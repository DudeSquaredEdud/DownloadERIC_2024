        "description":"This article represents an attempt to begin a dialogue among the research community to identify what is known about using technology in various content areas. Although it does not present new empirical data, it does offer the reader one researcher's perspective on technology in literacy and language arts. The author discusses the effects of hypertext and digital texts on literacy and suggests pertinent areas that need to be addressed by further research. These include: (1) Do traditional reading and writing strategies applicable to print-based materials transfer to digital text? (2) What are the best methods for fostering students' ability to critically evaluate digital information? (3) Do the reading processes inherent in navigating through the associative web of hypertext transfer to reading print narratives? and (4) What comprehension abilities are prerequisite to derive meaning from hypertext?",

        "description":"How has technology affected student achievement? There is a never-ending and misunderstood debate regarding technology integration that revolves around two main factors. First, the definition of student achievement has changed. Information technology literacy is now part of the skill set students will need to be successful, bringing with it a responsibility for educators to expose students to a wide variety of tools. Second, the technology must be skillfully harnessed and applied by professionals to ensure positive effects on student achievement. This article addresses the second part of the argument. Harnessing technology in the differentiation process provides an efficient method of using student data. The authors contend that it is the way educators apply data to planning and instruction that leads to student achievement. Educators must be supported in acquiring the skills (in data analysis, data application, and technology-based arenas) necessary to be successful with this process. Differentiated instruction is the approach to education adopted by the teacher; technology is the tool that allows them to be successful.",

The success of this vision produced an unparalleled explosion of information, which in turn resulted in a parallel problem--how to locate the right piece of information. A 2005 study by Hanson and Carlson, published by the Educational Development Center, identified the time required to locate resources as the number one factor affecting teachers' use of the Web. This brief column describes several strategies and tools that can be used for identifying useful information. The social bookmarking tool \"del.icio.us\" and the image site \"Flickr\" are examples of tools that allow users to assign their own descriptor to links and images. The patterns that emerge can be described as \"folk taxonomy\" or collective categories created by the lay populace. These two bookmarking tools are described in this article.",

        "author":["Kadel, Robert"],
        "description":"Personal digital assistants (PDAs, also known as handheld or palmtop computers) are, in this author's opinion, the next great step in educational technology. The educational community has spent countless hours and dollars on providing desktop or laptop computer access to PK-16 students. Most students now have some experience with the Internet, whether through the World Wide Web or through software packages that provide their own real-time content updates. Even with this technology available in most schools, students are tied to a classroom or lab setting. PDAs are mobile, which provides for learning beyond the boundaries of the classroom; they are easy to use for just about any student at any level of schooling; and they are relatively inexpensive. The author believes that it is time for practitioners to embrace, experiment with, and learn what PDAs have to offer students.",

        "description":"Technology leaders can often be heard talking about Return on Investment (ROI) and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) as they extrapolate complex formulas as documentation for their board of directors. This brief article argues that these metrics are merely indicators corporate CIOs use to rationalize the need for more money to grow their personal empires, and that public education has now bought into this same madness. The author proposes two new measures unique to public education: ROA and TCI. ROA, or Return on Achievement, would measure how the investment in technology moves the core mission of the district forward. TCI, or Total Costs to Instruction, would indicate the expenses incurred in operating the technology department.",

The Barren County School District in Glasgow, Kentucky, has partnered with the Northwest Evaluation Association to use their computer-based Measure of Academic Progress (MAP). The MAP testing platform is unique--it is differentiated to each test taker, creating what is known as a &quot;leveled test.&quot; The RIT scale is used to provide a consistent scoring level for all subject areas. Students start at an average grade level, and as questions are answered, the test continually adjusts the difficulty level up or down until it finds the student's true ability level. Questions are weighted by type and group. Immediate short summary results are available within 24 hours of testing, and a complete detailed summary is available within a week of the final district testing date. Teachers and technology curriculum specialists found that instruction was greatly improved by the immediate access to data. It is suggested that district administrators could use the data to access student achievement across the district compare program success between schools, determine learning gaps and achievements, then adjust the curriculum accordingly.",

Without collaboration between K-12 schools and university programs, preservice teachers are unable to observe examples of classroom teachers integrating meaningful and authentic technology projects into the content areas. This article describes a model of a collaborative system at the San Diego State University in California (SDSU) that is working well for both training preservice teachers and assisting inservice teachers while furthering the ultimate goal of improving student learning. One of the primary goals of this site-based credential program is to prepare a teaching force that has the skill and confidence to integrate technology into the classroom. This goal is best accomplished when teacher educators are able to provide preservice teachers opportunities to observe exemplary teachers, to reflect on and discuss their ideas, and to collaborate with others on meaningful projects as they implement their ideas about teaching and learning with technology in real classrooms. For both preservice and experienced teachers, school--university collaboration results in an increased level of competency and efficacy in using  technology as an instructional tool and instruction for K-6 students improves.",

        "description":"Many children today have never lived in a home without a computer. They are the \"Net Generation,\" constantly \"connected\" by iPod, cell phone, keyboard, digital video camera, or game controller to various technologies. Recent studies have found that Net Genners see technology as \"embedded in society,\" a primary means of connection with friends, and helpful in solving both personal and academic problems. These kids expect fast communication responses, tune out when things are not interesting, and may be more visually than verbally literate. The studies also show that today's students believe that \"teachers are vital,\" \"computers cannot replace humans,\" and motivation is critical in learning. They like group activities, believe that building social skills is a part of schooling, identify with their parents' values, and feel that it is \"cool to be smart.\" They prefer inductive discovery rather than being told what they should know--they want to learn by doing rather than simply listening or reading. This author contends that schools will be more productive if educators acknowledge the unique attributes and preferences of the Net Generation and adapt educational environments to suit students instead of trying to change their basic natures. This article focuses on these implications in regard to Net Generation library media centers, giving suggestions for both the electronic and physical resources that should be available to students.",

Little attention has been paid, however, to how teachers are subjected, once they have been hired, to group-think processes of indoctrination, usually called \"staff development.\" Staff development works not infrequently to increase their credulity, stultify their normal critical abilities, and undermine their capacity for reasoned judgment. Much staff development in education is dedicated to examining mission and vision statements. In this article, the author describes how he encourages students to ask questions because it is legitimate to subject dogmas, and slogans of the profession to the same kind of scrutiny that they do other concerns of life. In particular, he teaches them to consistently formulate two kinds of questions: (1) Critical questions; and (2) criteria questions. The moral of the lesson, that teachers should be more assertive in asking questions. They should tell their potential critics that they are coming at the vision and mission statements from a research and implementation perspective. If they will not or cannot answer critical and criteria questions, then all the visioning and missioning in the world will not amount to anything more than wishful thinking and wasted time.",

        "author":["McCarthy, Martha M."],
        "description":"Accompanying the explosive growth of the Internet have been concerns about protecting children from viewing pornographic and other harmful images through cyberspace. In the past few years, Congress has passed several acts to censor Internet sites available to children, but only the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) has received Supreme Court endorsement to date. In short, public libraries and schools must install filtering software on their computers as a condition of receiving the federal subsidies. CIPA does not specify which filters must be used and stipulates that the filters can be disabled in certain situations for adult patrons. The Supreme Court's endorsement of CIPA, although clearly a victory for groups trying to shield children from cyberspace pornography, does not resolve all the legal issues. Challenges involving the Internet seem destined to increase, and the Supreme Court recently agreed to review a case involving another federal law that imposes penalties on creators or transmitters of indecent Internet materials for commercial purposes if the materials are known to be accessible to minors. The legal questions go beyond concerns about freedom of speech and the protection of minors; there also are significant privacy concerns related to the increasing ease of cyberspace access to personal information about individuals. Undoubtedly, courts will continue to be confronted with complicated legal issues pertaining to sending and receiving transmissions via the Internet, and this is an area of law that school personnel should carefully watch.",

Properly used, tests can measure improvement over time, inform the public, and tell us what portions of our population may not be receiving a good education.

        "description":"The signing of the No Child Left Behind Act on January 8, 2002, moved the federal effort to influence K-12 schooling to a new and higher level--more aggressive, focused, and directive. The act requires that school districts and schools demonstrate adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward a particular goal: universal student achievement of standards established by each state. Each year, school districts and schools that do not achieve AYP will be labeled \"Did Not Make AYP,\" and after two such years they may suffer sanctions that include loss of federal funding, termination of staff, and dissolving the school district. There is much in NCLB to like and embrace. The focus on \"leaving no child behind\"--systematically identifying and then addressing the needs of low-achieving students--is still a worthy if distant goal. If the provisions of NCLB as they stand at this writing are not changed, the greatest consolation for the education community and all concerned may be that the results of NCLB will so lack credibility that they will be not be taken seriously. In that event, NCLB will go down as one of the greatest missed opportunities in the history of American education.",

        "description":"There is a growing momentum in academia for liberal arts departments to become involved with schools of education in the preparation of teachers and efforts to improve schools.  A major difficulty comes from the stereotypical view that each group has of the other. For example, liberal arts professors accuse education faculty of ignoring content and focusing on ideas like critical thinking and hands-on learning. So long as each group maintains a rigid perception of the other?s view and fails to see that process and facts are not separate domains but rather exist in mutual support, difficulties in collaboration will prevail. This drive has been accelerated by reports indicating substandard performance by students in all areas but particularly in mathematics and science. It is reinforced when we find that school systems lack full complements of certified teachers in these areas. There is general agreement that cooperation between the different academic communities would be helpful. However, if such efforts are to be productive, universities implementing such partnerships should be aware of the problems that will inevitably occur. Despite predictable problems, cooperation and collaboration between liberal arts departments and schools of education can result in  great benefit to schools.",

Horace is a small frog, who has a passion for gardening, and watching flowers bloom. As soon as he comes of age, Horace decides to pursue his great love of nurturing tender blooming things. He studies, diligently, and becomes a professional horticulturist in a public greenhouse. Horace struggles with inadequate funding for public green houses in his neighborhood, and often with administrators, who in turn are controlled by a greenhouse board, who have no experience in horticulture yet are allowed to make major decisions about how the greenhouses, and seedlings should be managed. In spite of it all, Horace soldiers onward, and regardless of what shape the seedlings are in when they come to him, he tries his best to make all the struggling seedlings thrive. In the end, however, the damaged condition of many seedlings, inane greenhouse rules, incessant hectoring of Bullfrog officials, and watching his work undone by plant owners combine to wear Horace down. About this time, the Frog King emerges from the muck on the bottom of his pond and decrees that henceforth, no flower shall wither. Although little additional money follows this decree, new mandates do. Eventually, one \"Miracle Plant\" emerges, finally comes into bloom, and offers Horace the determination, and encouragement he needs to return to the green house the next year, in spite of the struggles, as he tells himself \"Few worthwhile things are easy.\"",

That trend, responding to public pressure on decision-makers to make school systems more transparent and accountable, is often colored by criticisms of the effectiveness of public schooling (Beldon, Russonello, and Stewart 1998). Schools and school districts often publish the results of such largescale tests with little apparent regard for their limited use in improving student performance and system monitoring (Bartley and Lawson 1999). Such tests are often not situated within a coherent policy and accountability framework based on learning and overall assessment of student achievement. In addition, the results of the tests are often not correlated or analyzed by context, student and family characteristics, or other factors that determine school or student success (CISA 2001). The tests often provide no information that helps students and educators improve their practices. Moreover, invalid uses of large-scale testing have been exacerbated by the news media, narrowly focused interest groups, and elected officials (CASA 1995b).",

Several features distinguish the program from other school-university partnerships. First, the partnership idea, including all early planning, originated with the school district and not the university. Second, the academic content of the degree programs transcended the university's set curriculum to address teachers' needs. Third, the focus of the degree programs changed from pedagogy to educational leadership. Finally, there was a practical factor: the school district and the university are separated by 150 miles. This article describes the history and evolution of the partnership and provides a brief overview of its successes and shortcomings.",

Discoveries such as the theory of probability, the law of large numbers, the structure of the normal distribution, standard deviation, and Bayes's theorem transformed our understanding of risk. For the first time in human history, possibilities and dangers could be logically analyzed and managed. In modern times most serious endeavors--medical research, engineering, investment management, economics, space flight, and planning for war--use such tools.

One NCLB mandate is to provide every student with a \"highly qualified teacher.\" The mandate arises from growing evidence of the relationship between teacher qualifications and student achievement. Research draws a significant association between differences in student achievement and teacher effectiveness in the classroom (Wright, Horn, and Sanders 1997). Three reports--a 1999 study that used data from a fifty-state survey of policies, the 1993-94 Schools and Staffing Surveys (SASS), and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)--all expanded upon these findings. These studies found that teacher-quality variables accounted for 67 to 87 percent of total variance in student achievement (Darling Hammond 1999). Darling-Hammond determined that such teacher-quality characteristics as certification status and degree in a specific teaching field significantly and positively correlate with student outcomes. Furthermore, significant relationships with student achievement were evident even after controlling for student poverty and language background. This research highlights the critical importance of highly qualified teachers. In summary, the data indicated that overall, schools at risk had less-qualified new teachers.

One way of overcoming the gap is deeply embedding professional development in schools; such collaboration takes extra time, effort, and patience and demands different rules. This paper interprets focus-group data about the authors' work as college professors meeting once a week with teams of teachers and administrators in a junior high school. In local terminology, the authors are \"cluster consultants\" working with \"clusters.\" The research is autoethnographic: it analyzes cultural data that the authors themselves have created about their own experiences (Reed-Dahaney 1997) and action research in that their primary goal is to use data to reflect on and improve their work in their own institutions. Toward this end, the paper discusses the authors' changing roles and the effects of their participation, both on Ravine Junior High School (a pseudonym) and on their own pedagogies in the university.",

        "description":"In the early 1980s, the Michigan Department of Education (MDE) revised its policies on reading instruction. A new transactional definition of reading shifted the emphasis from discrete reading skills to comprehension and set out objectives consistent with that new definition. Policymakers also revised the state?s reading-evaluation instruments, the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP), to reflect the new emphasis on comprehension (Spillane 1998). In the early 1990s, responding to the national standards movement, the department developed the Michigan Curriculum Framework (MCF) as a guide for districts and teachers developing local curriculum. The MCF consisted of six sections: (1) an introduction; (2) content standards and draft  benchmarks for the core-content areas; (3) planning; (4) teaching; (5) learning; assessment; and (6) professional development. According to the MCF, the benchmarks indicate \"student expectations at various developmental levels including elementary, middle school, and high school\" Although the teachers had hoped to see greater improvement in the MEAP scores, they were pleased with the day-to-day progress of their students, especially those at risk. The teachers looked at their students and saw readers and writers where they had once seen students who showed little interest in literacy. The students had progressed from hating to read to loving to read. Working with curriculum-based standards had helped the teachers write a curriculum that has transformed a culture of nonreaders into a community of readers.",

        "description":"American public schools are in clear need of real school reform centered on leadership style and organizational structure. To help bring about such reform, lessons taught by the new sciences and through the lens of critical theory need to be considered. At the beginning of the Industrial Age, businesses organized their burgeoning systems using military counterparts for examples, and public schools soon followed suit. That model, called \"classical organizational thought\" or \"scientific management,\" remains the predominant feature of school systems today. With the lessons we are learning from the new sciences, open systems theories should become more central to all educational administration preparation programs. Likewise, the tenets of critical theory, bolstered by the new research, should no longer be just an interesting and fashionable topic in administrator preservice programs. If schools continue to teach what has always been taught, educators will always get what they have always gotten. A truly critical look at the need for current hierarchical structures must be taken. Are they the most effective and efficient models possible? What better ways can be created in this postmodern world?",

In April 1983 the federal report \"A Nation at Risk\" stunned the nation with its dire warning that \"a rising tide of mediocrity\" was swamping our schools. A spate of articles and editorials on the occasion of its twentieth anniversary last spring concluded that the schools today are not much better than they were then. Five years after \"A Nation at Risk\", in 1988, the first President Bush and the nation's governors, with much fanfare, set lofty education goals to be met by the year 2000, including the goals that every child would be ready for school and that the U.S. would be first in the world in math and science by the dawn of the new millennium. We didn't even come close to meeting any of the goals. Now we have \"No Child Left Behind,\" the sweeping and intrusive new federal law that more than doubles the amount of standardized testing. It promises, among other things, that a highly qualified teacher will be in every classroom by 2006 and that all children will be proficient in a dozen years. It, too, will inevitably fall well short of its noble objectives. How could a country with such knowledge, wealth, and power and such stellar accomplishments in every other field of human endeavor try so hard and still be so far behind in education that it ranks among Third World nations?",

The company was set up to design breakthrough public schools, research and replicate new designs for education, train educators to serve as leaders in their schools and communities, and  engage the public as participants and decisionmakers in the education of this country's youth. The company's philosophy is grounded in educating \"one student at a time\" and promotes/creates a personalized education program for each student. The world is changing and schools are not. The authors, in founding this company, wanted to change the entire conversation around education and use the schools they started to influence the schools, districts, and country surrounding them. Their company motto is \"Education Is Everyone's Business.\" Who is \"everyone\"? The president, the secretary of education, state politicians, teacher-training institutions, policymakers, college presidents and admissions directors, the media, businesses, and community members, as well as principals, teachers, students, and parents.

Skeptics like to say, \"Oh well, that 'X' and 'Y' did something really special is irrelevant; they're exceptions.\" But the author's experience suggests that today's exceptions can become tomorrow's norms. If that is to happen, a way for exceptions to be nourished and made systemic needs to be provided. A new kind of system is needed whose central task is to maintain the protected space necessary for nurturing what the author calls \"exceptionalism\": a lean, mean system, with a limited but critical accountability function that protects the public interest; a system that respects the fact that schools must be responsive, but to their own constituents--the members of their community, not the system itself. How to accomplish that goal is the challenge. The author concludes, based on personal experience, the challenge is very much doable.",

        "description":"As far as schools are concerned, there are three kinds of safety: physical, emotional, and intellectual. Excellence demands all three, while \"good enough\" schools are simply physically safe. How can parents and others determine whether a school is physically safe? It's always good to find out how many students were suspended at  a particular school, and why. Ask school officials, but if they're reluctant, search out student-advocacy groups. Talk to students. Ask them about the places in school where they feel unsafe, and check them out. Bathrooms are a good place to start, because if some kids are being bothered, there's a good chance there will be graffiti that singles out kids in a mean or threatening way. Parents should keep an eye out for stuff that smacks of sexual harassment, because schools now have a legal responsibility to protect students from sexual harassment by their peers. Excellent schools and excellent teachers try to instill a sense of purpose, so that the students understand why they're learning in the first place. That?s a very different mentality from learning a skill or learning a piece of the curriculum in order to pass a test or receive an award like an A, getting into college, or not making parents angry. The simple, common-sense test of school safety for parents, whether it?s physical, emotional, or intellectuals: \"Listen to the children.\" They will tell, perhaps not directly, but by their behavior, whether they feel safe at school. They may often want to stay in bed in the morning, or they'll have mysterious stomachaches, or they?ll have lots of unexplained absences.

But are schools safe even in more favored neighborhoods? Not in the deeper sense of safe. Not only are children verbally and physically abused in many public schools in minor ways--in ways that are not life threatening--but in almost all schools they are abused in subtle ways. This type of violence can be even more harmful because it is so difficult to identify--and harder yet to stop, and even sometimes overlooked or dismissed as mere kids' stuff. Naturally kids have good reason to feel unsafe in a world in which children?s games are as likely as not to be about hurting others and about being powerful enough to get away with it. None of that is new, but it does not allow us to put off dealing with it everywhere, and above all in the two places children spend most of their time: their homes and their schools (before and after school included). Adults are silent, as often as not, because they do not know what to do, and the self-assuaging rhetoric that kids need to solve these questions on their own is at least in part a cover-up for adult helplessness. Still, of course, there's just enough truth to it to shame kids into silence, and to shame their families as well.  It's a circle that must be broken.",

        "description":"Accepting that few lists are comprehensive, but acknowledging that they still have value, here then are seven important factors that contribute to a healthy school climate: (1) Models: Adults are teachers in more ways than one, and the way that has the greater impact is less what  they say than what  they do; (2) Consistency: The school staff must be vigilant in sending coherent and consistent messages to students and families; (3) Depth: It is important to build beyond, while not ignoring, first impressions; (4) Democracy: Sharing power in an environment that has traditionally been structured as a top-down hierarchy can be a frightening and difficult transition, but a democratic classroom and school need not be a radical change; (5) Community: Most people working in a school will tell you that no school can ever have too much help; (6) Engagement: Many skills are inherent in the practice of community service-learning; and (7) Leadership: Engaging school staff, families, community members, and students in creating and maintaining a positive school climate requires a strong school administration supported by a core of staff and families.",

        "author":["Gunzelmann, Betsy"],
        "description":"Safety in the schools involves much more than metal detectors and disaster plans. Although such catastrophe preparation is necessary, we often overlook less obvious beliefs and practices that put children's everyday safety at risk. According to the well-known pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton and the child psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan (2000), all children require physical protection, safety, and regulation in order to grow, learn, and flourish. Obvious safety issues are clear-cut and usually well addressed in our schools. However, there are less obvious, hidden dangers in our schools that impact the social, cognitive, and emotional well-being of our students. These hidden dangers are not always directly observable, and therefore they are difficult to identify. We are seeing more violence than ever before; more diagnoses of learning, behavioral, and emotional problems; and more students unable to attain basic skills in rudimentary subjects necessary to succeed in our technologically advanced society. The key to identifying these concealed problems is in understanding school climate. School climate is not a new concept. Originally, climate and environmental studies fell under the parameters of industrial and organizational psychology. However, over the past several decades, as more and more difficulties have required handling in the school setting, educational psychologists have become increasingly concerned with issues of climate.",

        "description":"If schools are unsafe, they are made so, in part, by those people, young and old, who appear to value neither living things nor material objects. Moreover, they are made so by young people, research reveals, who, although bullying their classmates and teachers, nonetheless often fail to meet the commonly held stereotype of the bully. It is interesting to note that among the children who eventually are brought to juvenile court, 50 percent will be adjudicated and never return. Apparently, the one episode that brought them before a judge was enough to, well, scare them straight. The other 50 percent represent a different story altogether. These are people characterized by learning disabilities, substance abuse, low IQ scores, and histories of suffering physical abuse. The culture may advertise its famous melting pot slogan, but everyone knows the true melting pot is the classroom and playground, where every variety of integration of turf and difference, not to mention every dynamic of the lower brain stem and cerebral cortex, has to be worked out. The fundamental principle of America's democracy is embodied in the school, where, irrespective of just who has decided to occupy the superior species, religious integration, sex integration, racial integration, and the inclusion of children with disabilities continue to be played out. And it will continue this way, whether people feel safe or not, until, ideally, in a world one can only imagine, all children will not only feel safe from the terrors of the outside as well as those of the inside; they will in fact be safe.",

Ordinary people came to recognize the advent of the Costumed Ax-wielder as a sign of their own shortcomings. If, when asked to adopt the Costume, you hemmed and hawed, you were visited by one of the Ax-wielders and made an offer you couldn't refuse: be convinced or be minced. And most people fell in line wearing the prescribed costume: surprisingly, not all too reluctantly. Rather, to make peace with Conscience, they talked themselves into believing that they accepted the Costume, not from fear of the Ax, but for Good Reason's sake.

        "description":"A painstaking investigative report by the Washington Post describes pre-massacre Columbine as filled with social vinegar. The high school was dominated by a \"cult of the athlete.\" In this distorted environment, a coterie of favored jocks, who wore white hats to set themselves apart, consistently bullied, hazed, and sexually harassed their classmates while receiving preferential treatment from school authorities. Other students hated the abuses of the \"steroid poster boys\" but could do little. A former student testified, \"Pretty much everyone was scared to take them on; if you said anything, they'd come after you, too.\" No matter how seductive they might seem, it is generally unwise to trust bad-apple explanations of school violence. Harris and Klebold's marginalization and subsequent maltreatment were major factors in the massacre. Their powerlessness in the face of this favored clique's illegitimate authority, psychological abuse, physical intimidation, and sexual harassment sparked a profound desire for revenge. As one student told a Post reporter,\"They just let the jocks get to them. I think they were taunted to their limits.\" The primary task of educators charged with containing school violence  is that they must discover and modify ithese causal networks. Years ago a pioneer social psychologist, Solomon Asch, incisively observed, \"Most social acts have to be understood in their setting, and lose meaning if isolated. No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function.\" Nevertheless, that is precisely the blunder the FBI fell into.",

But this issue is not going away. Following the Supreme Court's decision, several families voiced interest in mounting new challenges to the religious reference in the Pledge.

That is not to say that all forms of school choice are good public policy: choice can have positive or negative effects, depending upon the policy framework that guides it. In order to be most effective, school choice must, among other things, (1) Provide better education for poor children and more effective involvement for their parents (the bottom-line criterion for judging whether a school choice policy is acceptable;) (2) Provide for more accountability for validly measurable educational outcomes than now provided by public schooling based upon a local monopoly; (3) Be based upon clear standards for the educational outcomes that every pupil should achieve at every level in order to participate effectively in our society, political order, and economy; (4) Forbid discrimination in admission to schools, or in employment at those schools, on the basis of race (5) Make effective provision for outreach to parents, especially low-income and language-minority parents, to ensure that they are well informed about the choices available and how those can be matched with the strengths, needs, and interests of their children, and with their own hopes and beliefs about education",

Any individual competence can be recast as a display of weakness if we restrict the manner in which it is performed. Formalisms are the usually social restrictions by which we judge individual achievements. Some formalisms are necessary; others are pernicious. Pernicious formalisms are ones that have been, often unconsciously, introduced as schooling customs from a particular social class or cultural group and that cannot be reasonably expected to be the same for every child. Then there are the Formalisms of the \"subject matter.\" Whether they are necessary or pernicious is a controversial issue that must be decided on case by case. Whether they even matter is debatable.

During almost thirty-six years as a college administrator and instructor, he designed programs and services, taught classes, and conducted workshops with one purpose in mind: to help students gain maximum benefits from college and continue learning and achieving long after they finished school. The winter of 1978, brought a turning point when he attended a conference on college student retention sponsored by American College Testing (ACT), which brought together some of the best researchers and practitioners in the field. The conference coordinators were Lee Noel and Randi Levitz, who later founded Noel-Levitz, Inc., the largest consulting organization in college student recruitment and retention. Noel and Levitz? presentations explained why nearly half the students who enter college drop out or flunk out. They presented research findings and described some of the most effective programs and services designed to help more students persist to graduation. Another presenter at the conference was Robert Cope, the co-author of \"Revolving College Doors.\" He presented the best theory and research available about the causes of student persistence and attrition. Before the conference, the author had concluded that students left college because they lacked certain skills, knowledge, and abilities. All the work he had done was based on that false premise. Eventually, he was forced to an even more devastating conclusion: the deficit-based remediation programming previously used actually prevented students from becoming top achievers. From this discovery a new outlook emerged recognizing that seeds of potential greatness, a person?s talents, already exist in the person, therefore,  strengths quest, a quest to achieve excellence and become all one can be through individual natural talents is really a quest to discover, develop, and apply what one truly is. Now, althnkey tool for implementing strengths-based education. However, applying StrengthsQuest to K?12 education certainly will become more textured and sophisticated as experience with the program grows.",

It is intended to lead students to discover their natural talents and gain unique and valuable insights into how to develop such talents into strengths--strengths that equip them to succeed and to make important decisions that enable them to balance the demands of coursework, extracurricular activities, employment, and family. This article provides an overview of the StrengthsQuest program and the theory of strengths development upon which it is based. It explains the Clifton StrengthsFinder, which is the assessment at the foundation of StrengthsQuest, and provides documentation of its construct validity and reliability.

Results showed that SEA SLD classification criteria continue to be dominated by three features, severe discrepancy between intellectual ability and achievement, specified achievement areas, and exclusion factors. Significant variability between states also continues to exist in SLD prevalence, conceptual definitions, and classification criteria. SLD diagnostic decisions depend heavily on SEA classification criteria, producing potential changes in the eligibility of children for special education depending on their state of residence.

Since the passage of P.L. 94-142, numerous identification methods has been proposed, implemented, and studied. While each new method has been successful, at least partially, in addressing some of the limitations of earlier methods, each new identification model is saddled with its own set of shortcomings. This article argues that factors beyond specific LD identification technology significantly influence the decision-making process and ultimately decisions about who is and who is not LD. Results from focus group discussions with six stakeholder groups (LD parents, LD teachers, general education teachers, directors of special education, school principals, and school psychologists/diagnosticians) are reported, indicating that a broad array of factors beyond a student's performance on formal and informal assessments influence ultimate decisions made about a student's eligibility for learning disability services. Thus, the search for new identification technologies should also include efforts to better understand the values and biases of critical stakeholders and how to include these factors in the overall decision-making process.",

For example, cognitive assessment and aptitude-achievement discrepancy might be less important. A student's responsiveness-to-intervention (RTI) is emerging as an important construct for assessing underachievement. This article provides a framework for understanding how RTI fits as one LD determination component, describes research on RTI, and outlines the NRCLD's research efforts to examine current RTI implementation in schools and model site selection. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, it provides a conceptual background for RTI. In addressing that goal it will describe the theoretical framework of RTI, the research about RTI as a prevention model and as a component in LD determination decisions, as well as existing applications of RTI. The second purpose is to describe how NRCLD staff and the staffs from the six national regional resource centers are researching the following four questions: (1) How is RTI implemented locally;(2) How is RTI used in the process of LD identification; (3) How effective is RTI in the prevention of reading problems; and (4) Does RTI enhance LD identification? An outcome of those activities is to select exemplary RTI sites that might assist in national technical assistance and scaling-up activities. The research methodology uses a mixed design of descriptive information from detailed case studies and empirical data from school and student records. This article is viewed as an important opportunity to inform the field about RTI and engage readers in shaping its relevant policies, procedures, practices, and criteria.",

Today over 1,000 education journals publish more than 20,000 articles in the English language each year. No systematic tool is available at present to get the research findings from these tens of thousands of articles to the millions of education practitioners in the United States who might use them. The purpose of a structured abstract is to help practitioners sort out findings from education research. The structured abstract would take the place of the paragraph- style narrative summary that appears at the beginning of most articles. A structured abstract is a formal and compact summary of an article's main features and findings. Like a table or figure, it has a predictable structure that compresses information into a small space and can be read independently from the main body of the article. The structured abstract is longer and more detailed than the standard paragraph-style narrative summary. On the printed page, the structured abstract appears between the title and the main body of the article. It includes basic elements that apply to all articles (background, purpose, research design, and conclusions) and several additional elements that apply to some articles but not to others (e.g., setting, population, intervention, data collection and analysis, and findings). The structured abstract offers a robust vehicle to help practitioners systematically access, assess, and communicate education studies and research findings.",

Within this sample four groups of children were compared: children with reading disabilities (n=12), children with math/reading disabilities (n=19), poor readers (n=14), and skilled readers (n=25). Intelligence, reading and math tests, and verbal working memory (WM) measures were administered (presented under static and dynamic testing conditions). Two important findings emerged: (a) hierarchical regression analyses found that a dynamic assessment measure factor score contributed unique variance to predicting reading and mathematics, beyond what is attributed to verbal IQ and initial scores related to WM; and (b) poor readers and skilled readers were more likely to change and maintain their WM score gained under the dynamic testing conditions than children with reading disabilities or children with a combination of math/reading disabilities.

All students had significant delays in decoding, fluency, comprehension, and language processing. Two comparable, intensive tutorial treatments differed only in the degree of explicitness of the comprehension strategy instruction. Overall, there was meaningful progress in students' reading decoding, fluency, and comprehension. Gains in formal measures of word attack and reading fluency after five weeks of intervention translated into grade-equivalent gains of approximately half a school year. Analysis of the trends in the daily informal fluency probes translated into a weekly gain of 1.28 correct words per minute. The more explicit comprehension strategy instruction was more effective than the less explicit treatment. Findings are discussed in light of the question of how to maximize the effects of reading interventions for older children with RD.",

In order to achieve an adequate level of writing competence, these students must apply strategies that enable them to effectively plan, organize, write, and revise a written product. Explicit strategy instruction involving a structured style of learning has been found to increase students' writing competence (De La Paz & Graham, 1997a). The current study examined the effects of the Self-Regulated Strategy Development (SRSD) model on the writing performance of 15 high school sophomores with LD. Students were taught to apply the SRSD model as a strategy for planning and writing essays and to self-regulate their use of the strategy and the writing process. The effects of strategy instruction were examined using a repeated-measures design.",

        "description":"Second-language acquisition theorists caution educators that higher second-language competency skills can take anywhere from five to eight years to attain realistically for any individual acquiring competency in a second language. There are many other variables like age of arrival in the United States and standard of education from home country that can further impact the speed and success of second-language acquisition for ESL students. The question remains: is three years an adequate length of time for a middle school or high school student to acquire English language mastery concurrently with grade level content knowledge and skills? Researchers say &quot;no,&quot; but state legislators in the state of Texas say &quot;yes&quot; by mandating a three-year English language acquisition period for immigrant students. What is the reality of everyday classroom experiences for ESL students under this new state mandate of three years? How equipped are regular classroom teachers, who are not ESL certified, to teach these students to pass state standardized content tests while still learning English language skills? Seeking answers to these questions was the authors' impetus for conducting this investigation in one middle school in Texas. As principal investigator and researcher, the author also sought to examine and witness for herself the everyday reality that immigrant students experience acquiring English language skills and maintaining grade level content knowledge during their initial three years in the United States.",

These initiatives are OHRP's Words of Engagement Intergroup Dialogue Program--the core component of its Student Intercultural Learning Center (SILC)--and OHRP's Multicultural Curriculum Change Program--a major offering of its Diversity Training and Consultation Services (DTCS). This article discusses the INTERACT project and it's findings. It concludes by saying that through the continued development of the INTERACT project, it has an equally tremendous potential to impact classroom teaching and learning, intergroup dialogue facilitation and participation, corresponding student engagement in the curriculum, and subsequent student academic success across disciplines/subjects areas and educational levels/contexts on a grander scale.

This article explores relationships among race, poverty, and special education identification to arrive at a more precise estimate of the contribution of poverty to racial disparities. District-level data for all 295 school corporations in a midwestern state were analyzed for this study. Records included information on disability category, general and special education enrollment by race, socioeconomic level, local resources, and academic and social outcomes for 1 school year. Simple correlations among the variables demonstrate that correlations between race and poverty of even moderate strength do not guarantee that the 2 variables will function in the same way with respect to outcome variables, such as identification for special education services. Results of regression analyses indicate that poverty makes a weak and inconsistent contribution to the prediction of disproportionality across a number of disability categories. On the other hand, rates of suspension and expulsion consistently predict district rates of special education disproportionality. Inconsistent relationships between special education disproportionality and achievement may indicate a developmental trend in the systemic contribution to racial disparity. Ideal-type analyses examining race?poverty relationships indicate that where poverty makes any contribution above and beyond race in predicting disability identification, its primary effect is to magnify existing racial disparity.",

Both self-monitoring of attention and self-monitoring of performance had positive effects on students' on-task and spelling study behaviors. While improvement in on-task behavior was comparable across the two interventions, self-monitoring of attention produced substantially higher gains in spelling study behavior among 4 of the 6 students. Although this is the first study in which differential effects of these 2 interventions have been investigated among students with ADHD, previous studies with students with learning disabilities (LD) have found that self-monitoring of performance tended to result in higher rates of spelling study than did self-monitoring of attention. Possible reasons for this difference among students with ADHD and those with LD are noted, as are directions for future research and recommendations for teachers regarding the implementation of self-monitoring interventions.",

        "description":"There are few who would disagree with the importance of stories and personal narratives in art therapy. Most art therapists seek to elicit them from their clients. They see it as their responsibility to honor each individual story, help integrate it where it is disconnected, and guide clients to illustrate these narratives in a manner that allows for healing. Stories, whether personal or communal, offer a glance into belief structures, values, and lessons. The history of art therapy in the United States is no different in this respect. The stories of the disenfranchised were usually not known or recorded, and were often maintained only in the oral tradition by art therapists of color. This article focuses on bridging two texts: \"A History of Art Therapy in the United States,\" written by Maxine Borowsky Junge (with Paige Awawa) in 1994, and \"The Black Beat in Art Therapy Experiences,\" a dissertation written by Lucille Venture in 1977. The first book is a well-known historical text, while the second is known to few. The author offers an integration of the two works to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the development of art therapy.",

A basic overview of migraine symptoms and treatment is presented along with a discussion of concepts relating to \"migraine art\" in order to provide a context for this project. Surveys dealing with headache history, pain experience, and artmaking practices were mailed to 371 participants in a national migraine art competition; both quantitative and qualitative data were analyzed. Participants reported that artmaking was more likely to trigger headaches than to alleviate them and that both the quantity and quality of studio work declined during headache episodes. In addition, participants identified numerous art materials and practices that they felt precipitated migraines and noted avoidance strategies they used to manage their headaches. The implications of these counterintuitive findings for art therapy practice are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)",

Those who drew exhibited more positive mood after drawing; those who copied shapes did not. Mood improved equally for those who drew negative and nonnegative images, suggesting that for some, catharsis led to improved mood and that for others, redirection led to improved mood. In Experiment 2, to test whether artmaking improved mood simply because people were distracted by making a drawing, we gave participants a word puzzle to complete, a task that does not allow expression of feeling through symbolic content. Completion of a word puzzle did not improve mood. These results suggest that artmaking increases the pleasure dimension of mood and does so via either catharsis or redirection.",

        "description":"Recent developments in neuroscience provide important information for therapists working with maltreated children. Severe maltreatment and lack of significant attachment figures in the crucial early years lead to adverse brain development (De Bellis, 2001). It appears evident that traumatic memories are stored in the right hemisphere, making verbal declarative memory of the trauma more difficult (Schiffer, Teicher, & Papanicolaou, 1995). This research lays the groundwork for understanding why nonverbal, expressive therapies can be more effective than verbal therapies in work with severely maltreated children exhibiting attachment difficulties. This article explores current research in neuroscience and provides a rationale for expressive therapy as a treatment intervention for this population.",

The participant was able to express enjoyment with her artistic expressions and challenge herself to learn something new. Following completion of art therapy, the participant indicated a feeling of accomplishment and an increased sense of control and self-confidence.

Participants were preservice teachers (predominantly White, European-American) within the teacher education program of a prominent Midwestern university which offers a reformed teacher education program redesigned in terms of research findings on best practices. This teacher education program includes a focus on traditional diversity topics such as race, gender, culture, and language issues. Overall, this research project indicates that expanding the definition and scope of multicultural education curriculum holds the potential to prepare new teachers to practice diverse family inclusion in several ways: (1) by broadening preservice teacher awareness of diversity to include family structure diversity since the composition of the American family has changed drastically and continues to evolve; (2) by assisting preservice teachers in discovering and examining their own prejudices concerning children from diverse family backgrounds and providing them with ways to address those biases; and (3) by exposing preservice teachers to ways to reflect upon their own thoughts and practices as well as ways to work collaboratively with others to raise awareness and solve problems.",

In addition, New Jersey remains one of the most segregated states in the country, educating the majority of its African-American families in the inner city and first-ring communities that surround the cities. Given this diversity in New Jersey classrooms, the authors conceptualized a multiphase research project with the ultimate goal of helping teachers understand family values, beliefs, and practices in order to create a learning environment at school that acknowledges and builds upon these. Simultaneously, the project aims to facilitate parents' understanding of the school's values, beliefs, and practices so they can create a congruent learning environment at home. Towards this end, the authors designed a survey to assess New Jersey teachers' current knowledge and practices. Participants were practicing teachers, specialists, and administrators in public and private central New Jersey schools serving children from pre-school to 5th grade. The final sample consisted of 40 respondents. A majority of the respondents were females (92%) and PK-3 classroom teachers (82%). This study reveals that the New Jersey teachers who responded have a rhetorical understanding of the important aspects of culture, but lack the ability to interpret that knowledge into practices. The same is true for their understanding of parent involvement practices. They identify communication and parent/teacher conferences as important, but people are left wondering about the specific strategies they use and if they use them for the purpose of cultural interchange. Future research will be designed to further probe these questions. (Contains 1 table and 2 notes.)",

Schools become &quot;sorting mechanisms in which select groups of students are favored on the basis of race, class, and gender.&quot; Students within the dominant culture gain cultural capital, while students outside the dominant culture are often left without the means to gain entry into the culture of power. Such is the situation for culturally diverse students in the United States. Studies have shown that, in many classrooms in the United States, culturally diverse children's knowledge and the ways of learning they bring from home often conflict with the teaching practices and curricula of school. Because of these clashing ways of teaching and learning between home and school, families of these children often feel alienated from the schools. Teachers must become aware of such inequities but once such an awareness develops, how do teachers begin to break down barriers between home and school?

Family-centered practices have been widely accepted in the provision of early intervention services since the 1960s. Research indicates that families are essential to the success of early intervention services. However, the family is strongly influenced by culture as it pervades all aspects of the family structure and it influences how a family defines itself. Therefore, understanding cultural influences in relation to the family system increases the likelihood that interventions will be appropriate. This article explores the literature related to natural environments, family-centered practices, and the influence of cultural diversity as it relates to service provision in early intervention in an attempt to link the research to practices that promote appropriate and effective early intervention services.",

This quote provided the title for the city's strategy for supporting young children through six years of age. Toronto First Duty's innovation lies in its approach of integrating early childhood services in a school-as-hub model through local collaboration among professional groups and agencies. The primary services are Kindergarten, childcare, and parenting supports with child health, preschool readiness, family mental health, special needs services, recreation, family literacy, and other programs included at most sites. The project is also designed to inform higher-level policies at the municipal and provincial levels. It is currently operating in five pilot sites in the Toronto District School Board; the sites include the local school and a large group of community partner agencies. An infrastructure system to support the project came together through the City of Toronto's Municipal government, the school board, and the Atkinson Charitable Foundation, which supports social causes such as early learning and care.

Findings of the study revealed that taking courses that had cultural diversity concepts embedded within the curricula positively influenced many of the pre-service and in-service teachers' attitudes towards issues of diversity. Because of their limited cultural knowledge, teaching experience and exposure to issues of diversity, some participants still felt ill equipped for teaching culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students. The authors also found that the majority of preservice and inservice teachers continue to blame the home environment and the parents' lack of value toward education for CLD students' low academic performance. The authors' recommendations for program revision in teacher education call for the inclusion of field experiences that include community outreach programs with CLD  populations, in addition to courses taken at the university. They suggest that these revisions  are implemented before pre-service teachers engage in their student teaching assignment, therefore, they will be better equipped to adequately communicate with parents and teach and meet the needs of CLD students.",

        "description":"Creating partnership between special educators and parents who are Mexican American often poses unique challenges for all involved. Historically, the fact that these parents may not share mainstream values, traditions, and customs has often been perceived by special education teachers as part of the problem and not as valuable new sources of information. This view has also been associated to other families who come from low socio-economic backgrounds, limited English proficiency, and/or racial and ethnic minorities, often leading to an eradication of the parent-special education teacher partnership. The authors believe that in order for effective partnerships to take place with these parents, special education teachers must go beyond creating comfortable and welcoming environments. Although creating these environments are necessary and a good starting point, the call for true partnerships requires that special education teachers come to know the cultural aspect surrounding how these parents perceive schooling. In addition, expanded parental involvement as suggested by the law requires that special educators learn: how parents from diverse background affect student learning; how to include all parents from diverse backgrounds; and how to minimize barriers between schools and these communities. This article explores good practices in creating parent partnerships between special education teachers and Mexican American families. (Contains 1 note.)",

Those who teach students learning English as their second language know that any language support is crucial for students' language acquisition. Therefore, English Language (EL) students need a variety of language experiences. They need opportunities to hear, write, speak, and read English. Technology, especially computers, can play an integral part in providing EL students with valuable language experiences as they learn a new language. Computers can be used to help provide additional language learning opportunities for EL students that take place beyond normal classroom instruction. Combining these opportunities with activities that can be done at home with family members provides EL students with a rich language learning experience. This article focuses on how computer-assisted instruction can be a supplemental teaching tool for teaching English Language learners, and on how these activities can be extended at home to produce a greater school-home relationship. Provided in this article are recommendations that educators can use with their EL students and families. (Contains 2 tables.)",

The experience of some mothers has led them to believe that their role is limited and that their ability to voice their opinions and concerns is hampered by the traditional school structure. Through their involvement in MAPPS (Math and Parent Partnerships in the Southwest), parents have had experiences that took them through a series of processes that provide the authors with a different vision for parental participation in mathematics education. The vision consists of four components: (1) Parents as Parents (i.e., parents originally joined MAPPS because they want to help their children with their mathematics education); (2) Parents as Learners (parents become learners for themselves; some even pursue further education); (3) Parents as Teachers (parents become facilitators of mathematics workshops for other parents in the community); and (4) Parents as Leaders (e.g., parents become advocates for the education of not only their children but for all the children in the district). This article elaborates on these components based on the parents' own reflections. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "author":["Lam, Sarah Kit-Yee"],
        "description":"To help children succeed in schools, professionals must work with the family system since \"the family is the child's first teacher\" and the benefits of involving families in educating children are evident in research findings. School professionals include teachers, school social workers, school psychologists, school counselors, and school nurses. Among different types of families that professionals encounter in schools, families of exceptional children have unique experiences that impose an additional dimension of difference. Working with families of exceptional children is pertinent to help them succeed. Encouragement and support from the family contribute to reducing the gaps in college access and completion among students with disabilities. In collaboration, families are \"equal and full partners with educators and school systems\" and this relationship \"will benefit the student and the entire school system.\" To be effective in collaboration, professionals must know how to engage families of diverse backgrounds. Unfortunately, effective models to train future school professionals in working with families of exceptional children are lacking. National accrediting agencies provide \"minimal guidelines for disability training for school counselors.\" State requirements for education programs to train future teachers and school professionals in the area of family involvement barely emerged in the past few years. Involving parents and contributing to a multidisciplinary team are two crucial areas of professionals' roles in assisting children with disabilities. In view of practical limitations of programs to provide specialized training to prepare professionals to work with families of exceptional children, and the reality that professionals must collaborate with one another to address children's specific conditions, the use of an interdisciplinary course to address specific topics and competencies related to serving special needs becomes a viable option. This article presents a study on the use of an interdisciplinary course to prepare school professionals to work with families that have exceptional children. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Many educators are committed to multicultural education and are constantly seeking an inclusive curriculum voicing the diversity of the many cultural groups in the United States. The influential work of James Banks (1981, 1997, 2001) has encouraged a generation of educators to design a multicultural curriculum. Yet while this task remains an important goal for all educators so students may develop an understanding of their own history as well as a respect for the history of others, exclusion of the historical experience of the other is still apparent in many social science textbooks adopted by local and state boards of education. This article explores the topic of the unconstitutional deportation of Mexican Americans (American born citizens) during the 1930s and advocates for its inclusion in elementary and secondary social studies curricula, especially through the use of family history and oral history. Actual quotes from oral history interviews conducted by the author and others are included. This deportation is estimated to have involved 1-2 million people across the United States, with the majority of individuals involved being American born. Actual quotes from oral history interviews conducted by the author and others are included here.

The growing body of research focused on this issue documents ways teachers can make a real difference in the educational lives of children. Ladson-Billings' (1992; 1994; 1995) and others demonstrate that teachers can work with students to challenge socio-economic inequities, succeed academically, and retain pride in their cultural backgrounds. Based on a review of literature about preparing culturally competent teachers, this article argues that social foundations courses, especially courses in the history and sociology of education, are critical for teacher candidates to understand the power of racial, ethnic, and socio-economic inequities and the relationship of these factors to the pedagogical practices of schools and teachers in order for teachers to engage in culturally relevant practice.

Occasionally it is clear within the first couple of class sessions that these groups are reluctant to interact with one another in any format. In these instances, those few cliques that could possibly develop do so early on and class discussions may be almost nonexistent at the outset of the courses. In later discussions teachers witness angry encampments of student groups lashing out at one another. In this article, the authors attempt at bringing diverse and segregated class groups together in some sense of understanding and respect for one another through a restructured, reconceptualized, multicultural curriculum. After all, these very groups of non-cooperative students will very soon be serving as teachers in schools across the United States and will need to develop the skills necessary to foster multicultural tolerance among their own students.

Through case-based pedagogy, preservice teachers can learn the essence of educational dilemmas, seek the most appropriate solution in a given and informed context, assess the results of problem solving, and reflect on meaning.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of Utah public and private school English as Second Language (ESL) programs in meeting the needs of Limited English Proficient (LEP) students. The hypothesis was that public schools were more effective in meeting the educational needs of LEP students than private schools. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to understand the effectiveness of schools at meeting the educational needs of LEP students. The sample consisted of administrators from 100 schools, 42 public schools and 58 private schools, along the Wasatch Front. Two surveys were created, one for private schools and one for public schools. Out of all the schools, only three schools thought that private schools were better equipped to meet the needs of LEP students. These findings show that the perception is that public schools are equally equipped or are better equipped to help LEP students. Most administrators also thought that their ESL coordinators were well qualified to help LEP students. Five administrators disagreed. The study recommends the following: (1) Further research must be done in this area; (2) Public school district leaders might conduct a survey of their own to ask their school administrators specific questions about funding, personnel, and qualified coordinators; and (3) Private schools should become more aware of the needs of LEP students in their areas.

A rights-based approach to education requires respect for the human rights of all individuals involved in the learning process; it offers education as an entitlement, rather than as a privilege, and does not exempt any actor of the learning process from his/her responsibility for the full protection and fulfilment of any other fundamental right. Such an approach to education takes place when learners are respected for their autonomy and dignity; moreover, they must be provided all things necessary for them to take part actively in the learning process and to develop their awareness of reality. They learn about their past, understand their present, and acknowledge their power to fight for their future.",

Caracas, the capitol city, is home to a population of 6 million people nested into a space that is actually smaller in size than the area of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A., a city/suburb of only 2.8 million people. In this article, the authors contrast the school cultures between U.S.A. and Venezuela. Schools in the U.S.A. have been structured around an individualistic model that encourages individualism, fosters competition, and supports capitalism. On the other hand, schools in Venezuela have been structured around collectivist model that focuses on interdependent relations, cooperation, and group well being, stressing the importance of family, organizations, religious, and social relationships. Differences can be identified in many areas, with the following dimensions particularly of interest to educators: (1) learning environments; (2) decision-making styles; and (3) interactional styles--students, family members, and teachers. It is important to remember that in a collectivist culture or society there will be individuals whose preferred style is individualistic and in an individualistic culture there will be individuals whose preferred style is collectivist.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to strengthen teachers' knowledge of multicultural literature for use with high school students in a highly diverse, high needs urban school district through a university-schools partnership. A core English group of 15-20 members of a university-schools partnership met in monthly department-based and periodic districtwide workshops and summer three-day institutes. This work supported instructional assistance, response to student writing, and development of teaching resources--all to strengthen preparation of African American and Latino youth in an urban low performing California high school district. Several teachers called for the summer institute to read, study, and plan units for multicultural literary works. Institute participants were 17 teachers (14 female) with teaching experience of 1 to over 25 years. Two staff development coordinators, both White (a colleague and the author), facilitated activities, read and discussed with book groups, and documented events. Data included institute observation field notes of activities and audiotapes of discussions later transcribed. As in other studies, this study found teachers used a stance of responding personally to culturally unfamiliar work, noting what in texts felt familiar and universal. However, unlike in most related work, this study also found many instances of teachers adopting a stance of ethical respect for characters. In fact, this study found a &quot;range&quot; of stances seldom occurring in isolation. In work on a single novel, for example, teachers together adopted one stance then used others. In some cases, a teacher adopted a stance different from a group and shifted stances through group discussion. Various versions of the permeable and recursive nature of the response stances are illustrated. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"The Carver Community Center in Evansville, Indiana, uses an academic enrichment program to support neighborhood students. The curriculum involves children in learning about African-American literary traditions and folk art. The Center's work is based on the premise that African-American children need to encounter the reality of history as in integral part of the curriculum; not as a superficial add-on. During the after-school program described in this article, students constructed replicas of indigenous art from inexpensive and commonly found materials. The ecology of learning during this 3-month activity was rich in music, storytelling, and creativity. Elementary students participated in informal pre- and post-activity discussions that indicated an increased level of awareness about African-American history. In this article, the authors describe the setting in which this project occurred, an overview of supporting literature, the method and materials used to engage K-6 students in the process of discovery, and an illustration of the effects of this project on participant learning. The work at the Carver Community Center demonstrates that non-traditional community organizations also ascribe to high academic standards and use curricula in ways that enhance self esteem and promote academic achievement.

They start with each other's reflections on teaching two autobiographies, showing their respective paths and their struggles. These reflections are followed by a &quot;conversation&quot; in which they talk about their own subjectivity-in-making influenced by their teaching.

As a result, countless bilingual and limited-English-proficient students are lagging behind their peers. Minority students are labeled and treated differently from their classmates. Although equally capable, they are receiving a second-class education. The reason is the hidden curriculum in the current American educational system. Hidden curriculum is defined as instructional norms and values not openly acknowledged by teachers or school officials. The hidden curriculum is an underlying agenda that affects students of low socioeconomic status, particularly language-minority students. It is based on the attitude that non-English-speaking students are not capable of the same academic achievement as native speakers. In this article, the author discusses the negative effects of hidden curriculum to English language learners' (ELLs) academic achievement. The author also explains why parents of minority students are often unaware of their children's academic problems. The author also suggests that in order for these children to succeed, schools must give minority students the right tools from the start.",

This has contributed to a growing racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity among professors.

        "author":["Ramanathan, Hema"],
        "description":"Emerging literature on Asian Americans shows that perceptions about the community are often at odds with reality. Asian Americans desire to be \"normal,\" to fit in. Whether it is to be accepted as \"honorary Whites\" so as not to remain \"forever foreigners,\" or to get by in a racist society by staying quiet and behaving so that nobody would bother them, Asian Americans indicate a desire to assimilate and to nullify their Asian roots. Their integration seems to depend on how mainstream they are, which argues for assimilation not accommodation. Viewed as a \"model minority,\" self-esteem issues that are cited in support of  African-American and Hispanic profiles in the curriculum may not appear to be applicable  to Asian-American students. While it is true that Asian-American students by and large are academic achievers and the Asian-American community appears to be successful economically, second- and third-generation Asian-American students in schools have to contend with cultural, social, and emotional issues like any other minority group. The purpose of this descriptive study was: (1) to understand problems Asian Americans may face as minority teachers; (2) to examine any impact they may have on curricula and academic experiences at the building level; and (3) to identify support systems available to them to implement desired changes.",

        "title":"A Love Supreme--Riffing on the Standards: Placing Ideas at the Center of High Stakes Schooling",
        "author":["Kohl, Herbert"],
        "description":"The Fake Book is a square spiral bound Xeroxed book, about 7&quot; by 7&quot;, maybe 250 pages long. It's all music--the notes, usually in C or B minor, of hundreds of standard tunes, jazz, pop, and every once in a while, classical. The Fake Book and all of its variants provide an evolving canon of tunes that defines a set of common standards for jazz improvisation. For example, the main theme of John Coltrane's &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; was not in the old fake books but it is there now just as the works of Toni Morrison and June Jordan have entered the canon of American literature. To play well you have to know the standards--not because they make you a better performer but because they provide a common language that allows you to collaborate with other musicians and take off on the tradition and go where your imagination leads you. People who don't understand contemporary jazz hear it as confusing, unstructured, free form, if they listen at all. They prefer an old tune played in a familiar way with comfortable harmonies and tempos. Yet what is comfortable now was probably once uncomfortable and the expanding repertoire of standards provides points of orientation to help people navigate a complex evolving music. So how does a fake book or a taxonomy of educational standards get made? Who adds or rejects a tune or a standard? What is the decision-making process that leads to a common language for learning and improvisation? &quot;Outcome based objectives&quot; was a prior version of the current &quot;educational standards&quot; movement and a successor to Benjamin Bloom's &quot;Taxonomy of Educational Objectives&quot; (1984). The book was the foundation of a system called Mastery Learning, conceived by John Carroll in 1963 and developed by Bloom. It is based on the assumption that all students can master tasks and materials if given enough time. The educational fake books, the objectives and the outcomes, are currently in the process of revision: a humane way to transform schools has been morphed into a harsh and punitive standardization of learning. The current standards movement and the No Child Left Behind testing obsession make no concession to individual differences, even to the point of sometimes refusing to exempt severely handicapped students from the humiliation of assured failure. This gets to the heart of the obscenities underlying No Child Left Behind and many of the attempts to impose rigid standards on all schools and all teachers and all children. The imposition of demands without providing the time, resources, and the opportunity to learn in a more than adequate educational setting is simply setting students and schools up for failure. It does not take much intellectual sophistication to understand this, but it does take a large capacity for hypocrisy to support such demands. From the author's point of view, the best ways to respond are reasoned and determined political opposition coming from the educational research and teacher education community as well as teachers unions and administrators and parent groups--a conscious and thoughtful subversion of the system from within. It is a question of riffing on the fake book of standards within the classroom despite the demands of conforming to scripted curriculum and test obsession. It takes courageous teachers and administrators willing to take risks with their jobs to do this, but fortunately there are many such people who work in public schools. The notion of riffing on the standards implies developing an interesting or powerful idea or theme and then tying it to a learning standard. The crucial thing to understand is that the standards are only fake books and everything important comes with their use; with riffing in the classroom with a heightened attention to the needs, desires, and dreams of students. This is the Love Supreme, the best gift teachers can give to their students.",

        "author":["Reyes, Gerald T."],
        "description":"This article describes an afterschool program called \"Poetic High\" in which the author shares insights on the transformation of oneself as a teacher into more of a guide and a mentor. It outlines the process of transforming the attitudes of students from being passive learners into being poets of learning and life. The Poetic High created by this program has been an endless cycle of infecting others with enthusiasm for reaching toward new high points both in and outside of the classroom, which is really the true essence of the Poetic High. It is about the journeys within and the progress made outward. The Poetic High is about loving the process of life through language and communities that intersect with minds, hearts, and, of course, voices that rise up to warm everyone. Encouraging students to think poetically, and independently requires teachers to relinquish the idea that they are the only experts in the classroom. The author suggests that in helping students develop poetic identity, instruction is necessary, however, teachers must also provide the opportunity for students to construct their own meaning. Asking purposeful questions, while not accepting the easy-way-out-answer of \"I don't know,\" has the power to liberate students from the dependency of always relying on someone else to be the \"depositor\" of information into their brain. Giving student poets opportunities to find themselves through a culture of poetry helps them take more control over growing into the person they want to become. Building this culture takes educators one step further to helping youth become authorities, to feel active in their own education, and to \"take control of the language of their lives.\"",

        "description":"Latina/o students often experience coursework that is remedial and unchallenging--benign at best, a dumbing-down at worst. This potential limiting curriculum is not only failing to provide Latinas/os with the credentials necessary to advance economically, but their education denies them the opportunity to develop the critical voices and intellectual capacities necessary to do something about it. Thus, the standard educational experience for young Latinas/os tends to submerge them into silence, where they are taught to be quiet and avoid independent and critical thinking. In this article, the authors present an educational model based on a critically compassionate intellectualism that can foster the liberation of Latinas/os as well as other students of color from the oppression of silencing they currently experience in school. A teacher following critically compassionate intellectualism implements the educational trilogy of: (1) critical pedagogy; (2) authentic caring; and (3) social justice centered curriculum. The authors argue that these trilogy's elements must be implemented simultaneously in the classroom to present the most effective preparation for Latina/o students to participate in the development of a truly democratic society.

        "author":["Yancey, Patty"],
        "description":"In the fall of 2003 a number of factors came together to create a fertile environment for developing an alternative, pre-service teacher education model. The overarching goal of the model is to diversify a rural university's credential program(s) by developing and offering alternative paths toward teacher certification within the constraints of a traditional, fifth-year  program. The vision of the model was a collaborative effort conceived by two institutions:  Humboldt State University's (HSU) School of Education and the East Bay Conservation Corps (EBCC) Elementary Charter School. The partner institutions are located 275 miles away from each other on the northern California coast. HSU, founded in 1914 as a normal school, serves a vast, rural area and enrolls approximately 7,500 students in undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. Although HSU serves a geographically-diverse region that includes a high concentration of indigenous American Indian tribal communities, the HSU student population is primarily White. In contrast, the EBCC Charter School opened its doors in 2000 in metropolitan Oakland and serves an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse, urban K-5 population of 190 students. In the pilot year (2005-06) of the model's implementation, the HSU Elementary Education Program and EBCC launched a distance teaching internship cohort based at the Elementary Charter School in Oakland. Seven credential candidates are working full-time as interns for the K-5 school year while earning their multiple subject credential through HSU. HSU and EBCC believe that the integration of the interns into the fabric of the school, from the EBCC staff orientation before school starts to the final day of school in June, allows credential candidates more time to experience and begin to make connections between teachers' work, learning, and the organization and politics of schools and school systems. The demographics of EBCC, the educational program, and additional factors such as active parent engagement, comprehensive extended day programs (before and after school), parent/family education, and proactive community relations provide a multi-dimensional and challenging urban placement for pre-service teachers. Combined with the Charter School's educational program, which places academic, artistic, and civic literacy at the core of the curriculum, the school context serves as a unique training ground for the HSU credential candidate.",

It builds on an earlier empirical study, which investigated the partnership between Poetry for the People and one East Bay Area high school and the rich learning environment that this partnership provided. Within that environment students participated in a particular writing process that included generative themes such as racial profiling and self-affirmation. The focus of this article is Poetry for the People's presence in other school settings and the involvement of students through a contest inspired practice. Using participatory ethnographic methods, various types of data including audio-taped teacher and student interviews, video-taped student performances, participant observations, photographs of students in different settings, and student poetry artifacts were collected. Poetry for the People was instrumental in the proliferation of poetry in schools. Through the June Jordan Poetry Prize Contest with the continued support of the Poetry for the People program, students were provided a unique opportunity to read, interpret, discuss, write, and workshop poems that paid attention to the power of words in creating a more democratic society. The contest inspired not only students to submit entries, but also challenged teachers to innovate the teaching of poetry and, as argued throughout this article, to link school and community resources.

        "description":"By describing an innovative model for teacher education, these authors hope to contribute to an interrogation of teacher education, class, and culture within the current political and economic system. Inaugurated at Keene State College in New Hampshire in May 2002, World Educational Links (WEL) prepares future educators for anti-oppressive teaching, critical pedagogy, and social activism. It provides post-baccalaureate initial teacher certification (either elementary or secondary) and a master's degree through a 12-month integrative immersion model. In the WEL program, a knowledge base is gained within the context of a full-year immersion experience in a school, four days a week for the entire public school year. One day a week, the interns attend seminars on campus. Working with experienced mentor teachers, they are fully immersed in the life of the school. WEL is innovative in its delivery model, but more so in its transformative mission and its focus on teacher-as-activist. The goal is transformative learning through a reconstruction of social-political-historical knowledge, demonstrated through language and action on the part of the learner. The immersion model is seen as vital not only to the delivery of traditional teacher education curriculum, but to the potential for transformation that WEL offers its interns. Three areas of inquiry are woven throughout the content of the WEL Program: (1) Deconstructing the current educational system within its historical and political context; (2) Deep inquiry into issues of equity and social justice in a multicultural world; and (3) Constructing a new perspective on their essential task as educators. Initial results seem to validate the efficacy of a teacher education model that integrates theory with practice in an immersion experience, rather than providing theory in the college classroom apart from meaningful fieldwork. Mentors and WEL faculty alike considered the interns to be very well prepared as teachers, and graduates have been successful in finding employment. (Contains 2 notes.)",

        "description":"Hernandez (1989) argued that teacher educators who teach multicultural education courses too often focus on curricular or content aspects of multicultural education and rarely deal with the process of changing teachers' belief systems related to multicultural education. This article presents a host of practices that have supported teachers' ideological becoming as they prepare to teach in classrooms serving culturally and linguistically diverse student populations. By using a Bakhtinian lens, the authors invite teacher educators to understand their task not as a series of curricular implementations, but rather as a means for inducing the tensions necessary to nurture the development of teachers' beliefs and ideologies. Described are several instructional practices that were used in a teacher education course   to help teachers explore their own cultures, appreciate differences, and transform their previously held views and assumptions about multiculturalism. Each of the practices described were referred to by at least one member of the class as tension-inducing. This article is organized around three questions: (1) What instructional practices pushed beginning teachers to struggle and experience tension between their authoritative and internally persuasive discourses?; (2) How can tensions be created and managed in a multicultural teacher education course?; and (3) What are the challenges and opportunities? The authors encourage teacher educators to review these practices as flexible ideas (as any thoughtful teacher would) rather than a prescriptive list and concentrate their efforts on selecting a host of instructional practices to spur tensions.

        "description":"The recruitment of qualified teachers is an immense and demanding job, particularly for high-poverty urban schools. Urban schools often turn to the common practice of recruiting teachers who are under qualified, most of them with no teaching experience and limited training. Because of their lack of preparation, coupled with the difficult working conditions they face and the inadequate support within their schools, these beginning teachers are likely to leave the profession soon after they enter. The attrition data is challenging: 33% of beginning teachers leave within the first three years of teaching, and almost 50% leave within five years. The TEAMS (Teacher Education for the Advancement of a Multicultural Society) Teaching Fellowship Program is a collaborative model of positive recruitment that prepares diverse teachers, paraprofessionals, and counselors for service in urban, public school with the goal of increasing the academic success of all students. The TEAMS Program has implemented a unique model that provides a winning situation for all who are involved by using creative partnering to recruit, prepare, and support a confident, critical, and diverse teaching force prepared to tackle the challenges of inner-city teaching for the long haul.  The program model rests on the assumption that by providing financial support to acquire a teaching credential, focusing training activities on diversity, multiculturalism, and effective teaching strategies for urban schools, developing a network of like-minded educators, and  intentionally targeting communities of color for recruitment, a diverse group of capable teachers committed to a career in public school teaching will emerge.

        "author":["Kayes, Pauline E."],
        "description":"In the last ten years, many colleges, universities, boards, and agencies have jumped on the diverse faculty/staff hiring bandwagon not only by issuing resolutions, policies, and mandates but also by inventing programs, initiatives, and strategies all intended to increase the number of faculty and staff of color in predominantly White institutions. The statistics illustrate the results: 80-90% of faculty and staff in most colleges and universities are still White. Why, despite the best intentions, are most of these programs and policies failing  to increase faculty/staff diversity? Unfortunately what is often overlooked in the diverse hiring conundrum is the crucial role that both search committees and institutional culture play in the recruitment and retention of diverse faculty and staff at predominantly White colleges and universities. It has been assumed that those who serve on search committees prioritize diverse hiring when in reality many have never even discussed, let alone agreed upon, the institutional and departmental advantages of a diverse faculty and staff. This author contends that, if predominantly White colleges and universities are serious about their commitment to faculty/staff diversity, if they want to move from empty rhetoric to real action and progress that changes statistics and transforms institutional culture, they must make a concerted effort to educate everyone who serves on their search committees. Although search committees are only one part of the diverse hiring picture, diversification of faculty and staff at U.S. colleges and universities can not occur without their eyes being opened to the various biases, assumptions, and stereotypes that influence their perceptions, judgments, and decisions. More importantly, inclusive educational cultures that retain diverse students and employees can not be created without knowledge and skills in intercultural competence. Given the rapidly changing demographics affecting colleges and universities, it is imperative that predominantly White institutions recognize now the serious repercussions of a monocultural faculty/staff serving a multicultural student body and support their employees in moving from minimization of cultural differences to acceptance and adaptation so that predominantly White search committees selecting diverse candidates will no longer be an oxymoron.",

        "description":"White students and teachers who are exposed to information about how oppression works seem to recognize that there is a problem and want to do something to ameliorate the situation. They show up for meetings of diversity clubs, attend conferences and workshops, and will speak to others about their growing understanding of how privilege/ racism works. Yet, for all of this commitment, the system is not really changing. White students who feel that the diversity programs are exclusive or too time consuming are simply ignorant to the fact that racism affects them, albeit in different ways, just as it affects people of color. White privilege is described as a means of insulation that allows a White person to express awareness, but that also keeps the White person from really having to do anything with that awareness. This article asks the question &quot;What exactly is white privilege, and what is the cost of racism to Whites in America? It goes on to present a discussion about a white affinity group, modeled after Tim Wise's group called AWARE (Association for White Anti-Racist Education) for White students interested in becoming actively anti-racist. AWARE is both a student and staff White affinity group that is dedicated to developing positive anti-racist racial identities. The group does that by engaging in cross-cultural dialogues with other affinity groups, such as the Young Men of Color and the Young Woman of Color. Ultimately, putting together a group of White students to explore their racial identity development and anti-racism is an arduous task. This is by no means a simple task; it takes time, dedication, and patience, but this should not be surprising. After all, dismantling a system of racism/White privilege is not exactly an easy endeavor.",

        "description":"Early College High Schools (ECHS) are defined as &quot;small schools where students  can earn both a high school diploma and two years of college credit toward a bachelor's degree&quot; (Early Colleges, 2005). ECHSs are designed as places of learning to help young people progress toward the education and experience they need to succeed in life and in family-supporting careers. The Utah County Academy of Sciences (UCAS) is innovative in its approach in assisting Hispanic students. As Hispanic students enter an Early College High Schools (ECHS) program such as the Utah County Academy of Sciences (UCAS), it is clear that no single theory of academic achievement entirely explains why some students succeed in school and others fail, nor can just one type of program answer everyone's needs. As Hispanic students enter an ECHS program such as UCAS, it is clear that it is vital to understand school achievement as a combination of personal, cultural, familial, interactive, political, and societal issues, and this means understanding the socio political context in which education takes place. UCAS represents just one kind of attempt in a specific setting to begin to respond to the multifaceted needs of students of color. The purpose of presenting an overview of this experimental program in this article is to provide an example that will aid other educators and policymakers as they conceptualize and implement their own unique approaches to the challenge and promise of multicultural education.",

In this piece, Gray-Rosendale argues that three new constructions of basic writing student identity that have gained prominence in the journal from 1999-2005: the basic writer's identity constructed as in situ; the basic writer's identity constructed as a theory, academic discourse, and/or history reformer; and the basic writer's identity constructed as a set of practices in action. All are part of what she terms a \"contextual\" model. Identifying both beneficial and detrimental aspects of this contextual model, she calls upon basic writing teachers and scholars to work to combat some of the problematic elements within this latest metaphoric allegiance.

At the same time, there is a pressing need for highly qualified teachers of nontraditional adult students, especially in community college and adult literacy education programs. This need has recently been articulated in two official statements from the Two-Year College Association of NCTE. It is also being realized by the efforts of individual professors who have collectively offered at least nineteen such courses in recent years. A second argument for offering more BW graduate courses is the extensive BW scholarship revealed by such publications as \"The Bedford Guide for Teachers of Basic Writing,\" 2nd ed. (Adler-Kassner and Glau) and \"Teaching Developmental Writing: Background Readings,\" 3rd ed. (Bernstein). This essay argues that graduate programs should augment current commitments to preparing graduate students to teach, research, and administer programs for nontraditional adult students by regularly offering courses on basic writing theory, research, and pedagogy.

        "description":"Basic writing has played a large role in the history and institutional identity of the City University of New York (CUNY). From the Open Admissions era of Mina Shaughnessy to the present day, &quot;remedial courses&quot; at CUNY have been revised in response to different colleges' missions, curricular initiatives, university policies, and public opinion. Briefly reviewing a short history of remediation at CUNY and the university policies which affected it, this article then describes an intensive developmental writing course newly implemented at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. It explains the course's strategies, rationalizes its approach, and examines its successes as well as its continuing challenges. Theoretically approaching the basic writing course from the combined perspectives of Mary Louise Pratt and Lev Vygotsky (&quot;the contact zone of proximal development&quot;), this newly revised course takes seriously what Mike Rose says when he suggests &quot;that a remedial writing curriculum must fit into the overall context of a university education.&quot; In a pedagogical situation where a gatekeeping exam (over)determines students' educational progress, this course goes beyond skills and drills or test-taking preparation to challenge students' critical thinking and develop their college-level writing abilities. It gives students and instructors a curriculum that does not teach &quot;to&quot; the test but, instead, &quot;with&quot; it. (Contains 4 notes.)",

Street calls the &quot;autonomous model of literacy,&quot; a model that research tells us is as artificial and inappropriate as it is ubiquitous. This article describes a curricular response to the political, material, and ideological constraints placed on basic writing via this autonomous model and instead treats literacy as a social practice. After a brief description of the local conditions from which our program emerged, I articulate what I call a &quot;pedagogy of rhetorical dexterity,&quot; the new model upon which our curriculum is based. Informed by both the New Literacy Studies and activity theory, rhetorical dexterity teaches writers to effectively read, understand, manipulate, and negotiate the cultural and linguistic codes of a new community of practice based on a relatively accurate assessment of another, more familiar one. The final sections of the article describe the assignments included in a recent version of our curriculum, as well as selected student responses to these assignments and readings. Accepting that a curricular solution to the institutionalized oppression implicit in much literacy learning is necessarily partial and temporary, I argue that fostering students' awareness of the ways in which an autonomous model deconstructs itself when applied to real-life literacy contexts empowers them to work against this system.

        "description":"Language and literacy are situated in specific classroom contexts and are acquired as students engage with the subject matter and tasks of these courses. Therefore, all faculty--not just those who teach courses devoted to teaching English to speakers of other languages (ESOL)--are responsible for contributing to multilingual students' acquisition of language and literacy. Drawing on qualitative research studies, including first-hand accounts of students and faculty who discuss their expectations and experiences in undergraduate courses across the curriculum, this article explores how faculty can facilitate the learning of multilingual students. Analyzing a variety of pedagogical strategies that faculty across disciplines have enacted in their own teaching, we find confirmation for our theory that when writing is assigned for the purpose of fostering learning, and when instructors provide supportive feedback in response to what students have written, writing can serve as a powerful means for promoting language acquisition. Significantly, this across-the-curriculum research indicates that when faculty transform their pedagogy to meet the needs of ESOL students, all students benefit. This research also has critical implications for the philosophical and pedagogical perspectives that bear on ESOL teaching. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"Using a think-aloud procedure this study explored why certain vocabulary interventions are more facilitative for word learning than others. Second Language (L2) readers' &quot;quality&quot; and &quot;quantity&quot; (Hulstijn, 2001) of word processing strategies were recorded to determine the effect on (a) establishing and (b) strengthening lexical form-meaning connections (FMCs) as well as (c) text comprehension. L2 learners read a text enhanced with either multiple-choice glosses (MCGs) or single-translation glosses (STGs). In both conditions the target words (TWs) occurred three more times in the text after the first glossed occurrence. The data-analyses suggested that MCGs may lead to more robust and complete FMCs than STGs. Strengthening of FMCs seemed to be related to the integration of multiple meta-cognitive and semantic-elaborative resources, the repeated search and evaluation of individual word meanings as well as recursive reading strategies. Weaker FMCs were marked by the use of only meta-cognitive resources, linear text processing, and a lack of motivation to assign concrete word meaning. Readers in both conditions comprehended main ideas equally well. But MCG readers showed a tendency to comprehend more supporting ideas. (Contains 2 figures, 6 notes, and 6 tables.)",

One hundred and six undergraduates at a university in Korea participated in the study. Twelve were assigned to think aloud, and the rest (ninety-four) took part in the main study only. They read the material under one of three conditions: no gloss, Korean gloss (L1 glossing), and English gloss (L2 glossing). After reading, they were asked to take a multiple-choice reading comprehension test and to answer a questionnaire. The results of the quantitative analyses indicated that only the second language (L2) gloss condition significantly affected students' reading comprehension. However, the think-aloud protocols revealed that both types of glossing made their reading comprehension smoother and faster than was possible for those who read without glosses. In other words, even first language (L1) glosses enabled them to comprehend more easily while reading, although statistics did not indicate a significant difference between the no gloss and L1 gloss conditions. When surveyed, learners showed their preference for glosses in the margin: more than 62% of the learners favored L2 glosses for their reading material. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"This study examines the characteristics and quality of simplification in graded readers as compared to those of \"normal\" authentic English. Two passages from graded readers are compared with the original passages. The comparison uses a computer programme, RANGE (Nation and Heatley, 2003) to analyse the distribution of high and low frequency words in the passages. This is supported by a comparison of the texts in terms of Swaffar's (1985) characteristics of authentic message. The present study is in part a reanalysis and extension of Honeyfield's (1977) seminal study of simplification, but it reaches different conclusions. By not making the simplified versus original text comparison in absolute terms, but in terms of the respective readers, it finds that patterns of use of structure, discourse markers, redundancy, collocations, and high and low frequency vocabulary, are similar in both original and simplification. This suggests that the writing in well-written graded readers can be, for its audience, experienced as authentic and typical of \"normal\" English. (Contains 6 figures and 4 tables.)",

        "description":"A number of studies have shown that second language learners acquire vocabulary through reading, but only relatively small amounts. However, most of these studies used only short texts, measured only the acquisition of meaning, and did not credit partial learning of words. This case study of a learner of French explores whether an extensive reading program can enhance lexical knowledge. The study assessed a relatively large number of words (133), and examined whether one month of extensive reading enhanced knowledge of these target words' spelling, meaning, and grammatical characteristics. The measurement procedure was a one-on-one interview that allowed a very good indication of whether learning occurred. The study also explores how vocabulary acquisition varies according to how often words are encountered in the texts. The results showed that knowledge of 65% of the target words was enhanced in some way, for a pickup rate of about 1 of every 1.5 words tested. Spelling was strongly enhanced, even from a small number of exposures. Meaning and grammatical knowledge were also enhanced, but not to the same extent. Overall, the study indicates that more vocabulary acquisition is possible from extensive reading than previous studies have suggested. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Through the identification of reading strategies utilized by the subjects, the study is also aimed at discovering possible reasons for the use of L1 while comprehending L2 texts. Four students, whose L1 was Bahasa Melayu, were placed in a group and asked to think aloud while reading English texts. Analyses based on the think-aloud protocols were made to identify the reading strategies utilized by the students. Through these reading strategies, it was found that the L1 was used by all the students in the study and that more than 30% of the total instances of strategy use involved the L1. The study also revealed various reasons for the students' use of the L1 while reading L2 texts particularly in the context of group reading. One reason was that the L1 facilitated resolutions of word-related and idea-related difficulties. Furthermore, using the L1 might have helped the students reduce affective barriers and gain more confidence in tackling the L2 texts. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)",

        "description":"With 104 advanced second language (L2) readers, this investigation seeks to construct a multicomponent model of interest and L2 reading. Sources of interest (SI) refer to variables that induce feelings of interest in a text. Perceived interest (PI) refers to the feeling of interest itself (Schraw, Bruning, & Svoboda, 1995). A factor analysis revealed the following 5 SI in order of variance: (1) cohesion (31%), (2) prior knowledge (13%), (3) engagement (12%), (4) ease of recollection (10%), and (5) emotiveness (6%). PI accounted for 68% of the total sample variation. Of the 5 factors on the SI questionnaire, three were uniquely related to PI: cohesion, engagement, and ease of recollection. PI was related to sentence completion items and multiple choice items, but not recall. Five factors from the SI questionnaire were regressed on comprehension scores after first removing the variance explained by perceived interest. Ease of recollection positively related to all 3 comprehension tasks. Findings provide a construct of interest for L2 reading and serve as an attempt to develop an instrument to assess different sources of interest in L2 reading. A preliminary understanding of these dimensions of interest as predictors of L2 reading comprehension is presented. (Contains 6 tables, 12 notes, and 2 appendices.)",

However, no positive relationship between L1 reading motivation and L2 reading motivation was observed. Follow-up interviews, conducted with 1/3 of the participants, illuminated aspects of the motivation that the quantitative data did not reveal. Several enthusiastic readers of Japanese were not motivated to read in English due to the gaps between their abilities to read in Japanese and in English. In contrast, the intrinsic motivation of enthusiastic readers of English was limited to L2 reading and did not extend to their L1 reading habits. (Contains 4 tables and 5 appendices.)",

Over the past decade, a number of concerns have been raised about claims for the effectiveness of GOs. These concerns involve the inconsistent research results on student improvements, the limitation in generalizability from research studies, and the need for research studies with second language (L2) students and with more extended instructional exposure time. This paper argues that GOs, which directly represent the discourse structures of a text, provide stronger evidence for the effectiveness of the technique, and these versions of GOs should be adopted in comprehension instruction. The authors propose a number of generic forms of graphic representations that apply to regularly recurring text structures, and recommend further research on the impact of GOs with learners of English as a second or foreign language as well as research that involves more extended instructional time. The following are appended: (1) Studies in the Effect of Graphic Organizers That do not Reflect Text Structures; and (2) Studies in the Effect of Graphic Organizers That Reflect Text Structures.

Analysis of classroom discourse data indicated that none of the students independently identified these themes. This article shows the results of a comparative analysis of extracts from the original version of \"The Cay\" (Taylor, 1994) with the modified \"The Cay\" (Strange, 1997) in order to provide an explanation for ESL students' inability to identify the themes of racism and prejudice in The Cay. An example from classroom discourse data is used to illustrate students' difficulty in answering the teacher's theme-related questions.

Debate in the content area classroom serves a dual purpose: students are exposed to a process that facilitates critical thinking and analytical skills, and debate serves as a device for authenticating and deepening subject area knowledge. Debate for young adolescents is not only developmentally appropriate, but timely in another sense--this age group loves to argue! At a time when so many middle school students feel awkward and embarrassed about walking into a room, they can be amazingly open to entering into an argument. Debate gives these young people a meaningful \"voice\"--a way to interact with and to feel a part of the bigger (adult) world around them. Most significantly, it builds both the voice and the skills to enable the developing young person to begin to make sense out of his or her place in the world through the consideration of differing points of view. This paper gives an overview of the basic elements and concepts that are helpful in implementing an informal debate in the classroom. Not every concept or procedure outlined here is necessary for holding a successful classroom debate, and there are many concepts and procedures that have not been included. (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "description":"Every teacher is a messenger. The message that a teacher communicates and portrays is acquired formally and informally through systematic study, and environmental and socialization processes. While formal study happens consciously within a particular period of time, experiential learning that impinges on the development of the message happens all the time. It is a pervasive force with a long incubation period. No matter how the effects of environmental processes are suppressed and ignored, eventually they must crystallize and  impact one's practice of giving the message. Noting that the demographics in American education are such that 85% of teachers are White, while the public school population is increasingly made up of children of color, the message conveyed in this article involves ways to prepare preservice teachers to work effectively with culturally diverse children. The author describes the course, \"Critical Issues in Secondary Education, an educational foundations course for secondary education students in a southwestern urban U.S. university. The course was designed to help students examine perspectives of critical issues in contemporary education, to think critically about these issues, and to develop their own viewpoints. Relating her experience in helping to design and teach this course, the author discusses the reaction of some students when attention was focused on the educational implications of issues of race, racism, and White privilege. Amobi then suggests ways to engage novice teachers in conversations about race, and relates some of the lessons that she has learned from the volatility of conversations on race.",

        "description":"Due to changing demographics in the K-12 student population contrasted with the homogeneous population of prospective teachers, the uncertainty about teacher preparedness to meet the needs of diverse student populations remains a controversial educational issue. Teacher educators have continued to question whether preservice teachers presently in schools, colleges, and departments of education (SCDEs) have the requisite skills and the necessary sensitivity toward racial and cultural diversity to meet the challenges associated with effectively teaching culturally diverse students. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to address safe ways to prepare preservice teachers, specifically White teachers, but not limited to that ethnicity, who will teach in schools with an increasingly culturally diverse student population, particularly people of color. In an effort to meet the challenge of training educators to effectively teach culturally diverse students, the authors have created a culture specific pedagogical counseling (CSP) model. It is designed to address the construct of diversity-sensitive training as a possible factor for the P-12 prospective teachers' lack of efficacy toward teaching culturally and racially diverse students. Thus, the goal of the CSP model is to increase the comfort level of White preservice teachers (or teachers of any cultural, racial, and ethic background with limited exposure to culture differences) when interacting with people of color and people from diverse backgrounds. Before introducing the model, the authors provide the reader with background information (e.g., philosophy, theories, and history) that influenced the shaping of the model. This includes culture specific pedagogy and Black pedagogy theories, counselor and teacher education diversity training models, teacher preparation, historical and current demographic trends, and segregated schools and the \"Brown vs. the Board of Education\" decision.",

In reality, people are probably using this term to mean many things without actually embracing it as a perspective for educating students in urban school settings. In this article, the author examines the different definitions and conceptualizations offered by a number of educator-researchers on teaching and learning for social justice and identifies the common principles that are applicable, relevant, and translatable into classroom practice. He then offers a personal perspective on how the notion of teaching for social justice can develop, evolve, and become part of an ideological and political commitment for educational advocacy and activism.",

        "description":"Although small in scope, this study attempted to analyze the impacts of primary sources and field trip experiences on multicultural education through first-hand narrative interviews, one year after the experience. In particular, it assessed the recollections of students who participated in a one-half-day field trip to George Washington Carver National Monument, a site devoted to a multicultural message. In an attempt to learn as much as possible related to long-term memories of multicultural content associated with the use of primary sources and field trips, the researchers utilized a qualitative approach. Past literature has supported the notion that interview techniques can be more effective than experimental methods for gaining a detailed picture of recall. Two major themes were identified relating to the long-term recollections of the students on the field trip at the George Washington Carver National Monument: (1) Recollections were influenced by occasions which incorporated action and involvement, and (2) content information was retained by all students participating in the study. The results support the usefulness of primary sources in an interactive field trip experience to promote multicultural content and tolerance. Within this study, in particular, the notion of compassionate tendencies toward George Washington Carver prompts a tremendous need for further inquiry into the long-term impacts of other field trips that attempt to convey multicultural messages.",

Evans, Torrey, and Newton (1997) found that 82% of states require some level of multicultural or diversity training for teacher preparation programs. However, only 37% of these states have a specific requirement as part of gaining teacher certification (Miller et al., 2000). This study describes how a state-level requirement for meaningful multicultural education can be developed and implemented. Specifically, this study details how the pervasive problem of underachievement of ethnic minority groups was the catalyst for what happened in one state-wide university system. Given the current context and educational and achievement gaps of ethnic minorities, the outcomes of the educational reform presented in this article can be an effective example of how meaningful reform can happen in multicultural education for preservice teachers. This is especially important given the current environment of accountability through high stakes testing and the impact it has on the education of children. (Contains 6 tables.)",

        "description":"Increasingly, educational reform is linked to the concept of professional learning communities (PLCs). Definitions of PLCs vary, but generally the concept refers to a group of educators who \"continuously seek and share learning, and act on their learning\" (Hord 1997, 6). Stoll and her colleagues, concluding their review of the current state of PLCs and research, observe that there is a \"paucity of longitudinal research\" and that \"little is yet known about the potential for establishing enduringly effective PLCs.\" The concept, they conclude, is new, and much work is needed to develop and then test its potential. As researchers study PLCs to gain greater insight into their problems and possibilities, this article recalls an often-forgotten and consistently misrepresented moment in the history of American education, the Eight-Year Study, during which such communities formed and flourished. Five lessons of importance to school reform emerge from this inquiry into the Eight-Year Study and PLCs: (1) School reform consists of teacher education and capacity building; (2) Powerful teacher education is more than a matter of learning about and practicing promising teaching techniques, it involves engagement in exploring, with others, pressing personal and professional problems and issues--the sorts of issues that now form the focus of the teacher-researcher movement; (3) Sustained school reform will require both a foundation of trust among teachers and life-enhancing relationships with one another and with young people; (4) Powerful teacher education requires that schools, colleges, and universities join in a mutual quest for change and improvement; and (5) The story of the Eight-Year Study is one of uncertain but thoughtful educational experimentation, of testing ideas, of gathering data, and of remaining open to contrary evidence in the hope and the belief that interesting, if inevitably temporary, solutions would be found to situation-specific problems.",

        "description":"Interest in improving the quality of professional development in this age of educational reform has intensified as a growing body of research suggests that teaching practices matter in terms of student achievement. Some have argued for embedding professional development in the context of teachers' work in order to transform both teaching practices and the structures and cultures of schools in which teachers practice. These changes are necessary so that teachers can develop innovative teaching practices. Grossman, Wineburg, and Woolworth (2001) developed a set of markers to guide the formation of a workplace-based professional community. The markers, which identify issues that should be addressed when attempting to change teaching practice within the context of schools, may be helpful in developing other professional-development activities in the workplace. One such professional-development activity that may be useful in an environment of trust is what one refers to as \"open lessons.\" In this article, the authors describe the theoretical underpinnings of the workplace-based professional community that Grossman, Wineburg, and Woolworth developed. The authors also discuss how open lessons could help build a professional community.",

Students with significant cognitive disabilities may participate in an alternate assessment with alternate achievement standards, but these standards must be linked to grade-level content and promote access to the general curriculum. Because most research with this population has focused on nonacademic life skills, few guidelines exist for teaching and assessing skills that are linked to grade-level content. One challenge to developing research and practice in grade-linked academic content for students with significant cognitive disabilities is the absence of a clear conceptual framework.

Overall, students of all ability levels benefited from EAI with effect sizes (eta[squared]) ranging from 0.53 to 0.59.

        "description":"Charter schools are a growing and evolving component of the public education sector. These schools may be exempt from state or local regulations, but they are part of the public system and subject to federal laws and many regulations. Research has documented policy tensions and basic challenges associated with developing special education programs in charter schools. A key source of these issues is ambiguity in individual state charter laws regarding roles and responsibilities related to special education. This article presents findings from a review of 41 charter statutes. The review reveals variability and lack of specificity among states in the legislative structures they maintain for charter schools and how responsibility for special education is assigned. These findings highlight the importance of federal, state, and district policy leaders developing a nuanced understanding of statutes shaping the parameters of responsibility for special education in the charter sector.",

Conspiracy beliefs, we argue, should be looked at as a potential form of power recognition where AIs draw on their experiences of oppression to explain the presence of HIV/AIDS within their communities, at the same time that they draw on public health knowledge to explain how humans get HIV/AIDS. We advocate further research to better ascertain the effect that conspiracy beliefs have on HIV prevention and the treatment of individuals living with HIV/AIDS. (Contains 4 tables.)",

A number of statistics demonstrate that urban American Indian families deal with a variety of stressors such as poverty and isolation. However, very little is known about how these families perceive their lives. This report provides an exploratory study examining the status of 20 urban American Indian mother/child dyads. Mothers were asked about the role of American Indian culture in their lives, their views of life in general, and their attributions for their child's mild misbehavior. Two measures of child aggression were collected as well. The links between maternal perceptions and child aggression were complex, indicating the need for more studies of urban American Indian families. (Contains 1 figure, 5 tables, and 2 footnotes.)",

Though volumes of documentation regarding the value of the arts in education line the shelves of professional libraries and support for the arts as part of a comprehensive educational program is the subject of articles, speeches, and symposia, when push comes to shove, when resources are precious, and when test results are published in newspapers, arts are the first to go (Tambucci 2006). Ironically, the arts--disciplines that theorists, as well as teachers in the trenches, claim to improve higher-order thinking skills--are the very programs that typically are eliminated from the school district's budget when money is limited (Berube 1999). If the arts are responsible for helping to create strong thinkers, then why are school leaders hesitant to fund programs featuring the arts?",

The Index of Attitudes towards Homosexuals was used to assess levels of homophobia. Homophobia scores were significantly related to comfort in working with GLB people and GLB health issues, and those with higher levels of homophobia were less comfortable working in GLB health. Health educators who lack comfort in working with a community or a particular health issue may be less inclined to work on important health topics, which may be less supportive of responding to the health disparities that exist in these communities.

In order to tap into this interest and assist in their intellectual development, a sexual ethics continuum teaching strategy was developed during four semesters with six sections of two different college courses. A total of 52 behaviors of interest to students were identified and rated by students as ethically ideal, ethically allowed, or ethically forbidden. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods was used to rate the behaviors and clarify how learners thought about several behaviors. Reflections on the development of the strategy, the quality of thinking displayed by learners, and guidelines for conducting the strategy are offered. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"The toxic shock syndrome (TSS) crisis is a historical public health success story from which much can be learned and applied to contemporary public health issues. Following the first reports, multiple research teams initiated studies designed to ascertain the risk factors associated with TSS. Those studies evolved over several years--each building upon previous findings in an attempt to further understand both the nature and causes of toxic shock. After the first report of TSS in a May 1980 issue of the \"MMWR,\" multiple studies contributed to the body of knowledge that ultimately informed and facilitated interventions to reduce the incidence of TSS. Examination of the public health response to toxic shock syndrome highlights the effective use of epidemiological studies in successfully building a foundation for efficient responses to emerging problems and also highlights political and legal issues that remain for health professionals today.",

        "description":"One of the most recent waves of reform in public education began in 1989 when the governors and legislators identified eight goals for the \"Goals 2000: Educate America Act\" (U.S. Department of Education, 1994). This legislation promulgated the need for standards-based education and impacted health education in several ways. \"Goals 2000\" specifically addressed teacher education and professional development, so that teachers could \"acquire the knowledge and skills needed to prepare students for the next century\" (U.S. Department of Education, 1994, p. 2). In other words, standards for teachers in all subject areas including health education were needed to specifically determine the competencies for professional development to be demonstrated. The professional standards for health education teachers have been developed based on the \"necessary content, pedagogical, and professional knowledge and skills to teach both independently and collaboratively\" (National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education [NCATE], 2001, p. 3). The \"Program Standards for Health Education Teacher Preparation\" presented in this issue were revised to enhance and support the training of pre-service health educators that will be certified to teach health education in public schools. These revised \"standards\" and \"key elements\" originally were published in the \"2001 Guidelines for AAHE/NCATE Review of Initial-Level Programs for Health Education Teacher Preparation\" (American Association for Health Education [AAHE], 2001), and AAHE is still considered by NCATE to be the Specialized Professional Association (SPA) for health education. Because of this process, 30 health education programs currently are AAHE/NCATE approved at the national level (AAHE, 2005).",

        "description":"Indoor tanning continues to grow in popularity even though empirical investigations denounce the behavior. Various reports have illustrated the detrimental health effects of ultraviolet (UV) exposure including increased risk for skin cancer. According to some physicians, the risk may be especially high for adolescents whose skin cells are dividing and changing rapidly. Persistent use of tanning facilities has become especially apparent within adolescent female populations. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to assess pertinent, empirical studies to answer the question, \"What are the determinants of indoor tanning behavior among adolescent females?\" Assessment of the methodological quality of each study is also presented. Consistent results from all studies demonstrated that girls were 2-3 times more likely to tan indoors than boys. Age, skin type, attitudes, beliefs, demographics, and social factors were among the determinants identified throughout the literature. Suggestions for future research and intervention are also included. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"The goals of this project were to 1) assess obesity status and body satisfaction among African American college students, and 2) to compare differences in these variables between students at a predominantly white university (PWU) and a historically black college and university (HBCU). Four hundred and two undergraduate females completed a self-administered survey (199 HBCU and 203 PWU). The mean BMI for all respondents was 25.24 plus or minus 5.56. There was no significant difference between schools (HBCU = 25.62 plus or minus 6.0; PWU = 24.89 plus or minus 5.10) on BMI. Thirty-seven percent were satisfied/very satisfied with their weight, 36% were somewhat satisfied, and 27% were dissatisfied/very dissatisfied with their weight. There was no significant difference between schools. Fifty-one percent reported weight gain in college. Students at the HBCU who reported weight gain had higher BMI (27.22 plus or minus 0.56) than students at the PWU (25.53 plus or minus 0.52) who reported weight gain (p less than 0.01). Fifty-one percent of respondents said they thought about their weight everyday/almost everyday. There was no significant difference by school (p greater than 0.05). BMI varied by housing status; students living at home or alone off-campus had significantly higher BMI than those living on campus or off-campus with roommates (p = 0.0003). This study found few significant differences in weight status and body satisfaction between African American college females attending a HBCU and a PWU. Differences were due mainly to the demographic characteristics of the samples, particularly housing arrangement. Implications for college wellness programs are discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)",

In many technical professions, the complete focus of education and training is on technical topics either directly or indirectly related to a career or discipline. Students are generally required to master various mathematics skills, science skills and detailed technical skills directly related to the specific discipline they are planning to enter. This curriculum is critical to their success, and yet the fast-paced, global marketplace of today is demanding more. Technical professionals in various disciplines such as information technology, engineering, architecture, and research and development are increasingly required to broaden their skill sets to master the so-called soft skills. Soft skills, as defined by Wikipedia, are \"the cluster of personality traits, social graces, facility with language, personal habits, friendliness, and optimism that mark people to varying degrees. Soft skills complement hard skills, which are the technical requirements of a job.\" Furthermore, the authors present the three driving forces behind business leaders' increasing demand for a broader skill set from technical professionals: (1) necessity for improvements to the bottom line; (2) increasing competition; and (3) globalization.",

        "description":"In this observational case study, a 13-year old boy, Carlo, who was born completely blind, was invited to explore and identify, a set of raised-line pictures without receiving feedback about the accuracy of his identification. He was then asked to explain, verbally or by drawing, why he believed that the names he suggested accurately identified the depicted objects. The study found that Carlo identified 62% of the target pictures. Most of his verbalizations contained descriptions of salient parts of possible object referents that fit the configuration of the raised lines. The findings of this case study support the notion that the identification of raised-line pictures is based on principles of the perception of the shape of objects, independent of tactile beliefs. These principles seem to overlap, at least partially, in vision and haptics. The findings, however, need to be replicated with a larger sample. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)",

The purpose of the study was to find out if there are potential barriers to the implementation of the Nederlands Oogheelkundig Gezelschap (NOG) (2004) evidence-based guideline on referral. It was conducted during the annual conference of the NOG in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in March 2005, with thirteen ophthalmologists participating. They were interviewed regarding their views on the potential barriers to implementing the new guideline. All the participants were aware of the guideline, and were familiar with at least its global content. The general attitude toward the guideline was positive. However, not all recommendations were followed. Three potential barriers were found: an external barrier (time) with regard to the recommendation about the delivery of bad news, the lack of agreement with the recommendation on Charles Bonnet syndrome, and the lack of motivation to change the referral process by not perceiving a problem with it.

        "description":"The Ticket to Work (TTW) program is a federally funded program meant to assist persons who receive disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in obtaining employment, with the ultimate goal of terminating SSA benefits and thereby providing a cost savings for the government. With its focus on employment, the TTW program would seem to be an excellent opportunity for beneficiaries who are blind or have low vision, since lower levels of employment are a well-known problem for them compared to persons without disabilities and persons with most other types of disabilities. However, the manner in which the program has been implemented has caused professionals in the field of blindness rehabilitation to voice concerns about whether the program is effective with beneficiaries who are blind or have low vision. To evaluate the effectiveness of the TTW program with beneficiaries who are blind or have low vision, the author compares the use of tickets and preliminary outcomes for these beneficiaries and those with other disabilities. Results indicate that beneficiaries who are blind or have low vision have been more likely than have those with other disabilities to assign their tickets under the TTW program. This may be indicative of the greater difficulties that these persons face in navigating the labor market and obtaining employment. Even though persons in these groups are more likely to use their tickets, they are less likely to assign their tickets to employment networks, which indicates that the program has not been as effective in providing a choice of service providers for beneficiaries who are blind or have low vision. The finding that those with other disabilities were 1.35 to 1.5 times more likely to stop cash benefits because of earnings indicates that the program has also not been as effective for beneficiaries who are blind or have low vision in obtaining employment with a high level of earnings as compared to beneficiaries with other disabilities. Although not definitive, these results provide some support for the concerns expressed by professionals in the blindness field that the TTW program has not been as effective with beneficiaries who are blind or have low vision compared to beneficiaries with other disabilities.

The study presented here investigated the accessibility and usability of MySchoolDayOnline for students with visual impairments. Of the 12 high school students who participated in the field testing, 10 were blind (those with light perception or no light perception) and used a screen-reading program (JAWS for Windows) to access their computers, and two had low vision (those who met the definition of legal blindness) and accessed the computer screen using MySchoolDayOnline's screen-enlargement system. The students worked individually or in dyads at eight computers. The results of the study showed that students preferred MySchoolDayOnline and were more successful using it than Microsoft Outlook. Despite the difficulty experienced with Outlook, one dyad was able to complete all tasks using Outlook, which indicates that the program is accessible but not usable. It was interesting to note that the students with low vision who accessed Outlook visually had as many problems and performed equivalently to the students who were blind and used JAWS to access Outlook, although the small number of students precludes generalizing the findings to a larger population.

        "description":"Wondering whether they are really making a difference to young people's mathematics learning is a question that most teachers have probably wrestled with at some stage of their careers. However, evidence from a multitude of research studies shows that students' mathematics learning and their dispositions towards mathematics are indeed influenced--for better or for worse--by the teaching that they experience at school (see Mewborn, 2003, for a review of this research). In other words, teachers \"do\" matter. It is difficult for researchers to specify exactly how different types of teaching and teacher qualities affect student achievement because this would require untangling the complicated relationships that exist between teacher characteristics, teaching practices, and student learning. Nevertheless, the general trends in these relationships are clear. In this article, the author illustrates some of these trends by drawing on her experiences in working with pre-service and practicing mathematics teachers and their students. In doing so, she proposes three reasons why teachers matter. She then gives some examples of \"how\" teachers can matter to their students in a more practical sense.

        "description":"Two hundred and thirty-one students in six Grade 9 classes in two government secondary schools located near Chiang Mai, Thailand, attempted to solve the same 18 quadratic equations before and after participating in 11 lessons on quadratic equations. Data from the students' written responses to the equations, together with data in the form of transcripts of 36 interviews with 18 interviewees (a high performer, a medium performer, and a low performer from each of the six classes), were analysed. Using a rubric for assessing students' understanding, the analysis revealed that at the post-teaching stage students improved their performance on quadratic equations and had a better understanding of associated concepts than they had at the pre-teaching stage. However, many were still confused about the concepts of a variable and of a &quot;solution&quot; to a quadratic equation. After the lessons, most students had acquired neither an instrumental nor a relational understanding of the mathematics associated with solving elementary quadratic equations.

        "description":"As part of the Victorian Early Numeracy Research Project, over 1400 Victorian children in the first (Preparatory) year of school were assessed in mathematics by their classroom teachers. Using a task-based, one-to-one interview, administered during the first and last month of the school year, a picture emerged of the mathematical knowledge and understanding that young children bring to school, and the changes in this knowledge and understanding during the first year of school. A major feature of this research was that high quality, robust information on young children's mathematical understanding was collected for so many children. An important finding was that much of what has traditionally formed the mathematics curriculum for the first year of school was already understood clearly by many children on arrival at school. In this article, data on children's understanding are shared, and some implications for classroom practice are discussed. (Contains 12 tables.)",

These activities were designed to help reveal the teachers' models of students' algebraic thinking and to promote the development of that model. Results of the analysis showed that the teacher developed a clearer understanding of the role of a variable in algebraic instruction.

This case study looks at the impact this move to Internet delivery had on student enrollment and discusses the lessons learned in this process. This study shows that placing technology education and career and technical education master's degrees online has resulted in a dramatic increase in course and program enrollment in the institution where this study took place. However, the current opportunity for traditional non-profit higher education institutions to reap the benefits of these programs is not guaranteed to continue, especially with the increasing market share won by for-profit institutions, which \"account for about 8 percent of the 20 million students enrolled at the 6,000 American colleges that are eligible for federal aid ... [and] more than one-third of online enrollments\" (Blumenstyk, 2005, A11). Additional research is needed on the impact of this trend, but in the meantime those considering online offerings should not hesitate to begin a planning process. The results may be both increased enrollments and program evolution. (Contains 3 figures.)",

Its purpose was to identify the entrepreneurial competency gaps that may exist between the desired behavior of training instructors and the behavior that presently exists among the instructors who participate in institution-based enterprise activities. This study first identified the entrepreneurial competencies that the Jamaican training academy managers considered either very important or critically important in order for training instructors to operate successfully in institution-based commercial enterprises. The focus then shifted to examining the Jamaican training academy managers' perceptions of the training instructors' levels of performance in these competencies. These two procedures provided the information needed to identify the instructors' most serious entrepreneurial performance gaps. Based on a synthesis of the data and the literature reviewed relative to this study, the following conclusions were reached: The Jamaican training academy managers believed that 39 of the 66 entrepreneurial competencies listed in the survey instrument were critically important or very important in order for instructors to function successfully in institution-based enterprises. The training academy managers also viewed the instructors' performances as commendable in over one-half of the entrepreneurial competencies. From this study, it appears that the failure of some academy-based enterprises to produce goods and services on time may be due at least in part to instructors' deficiencies in planning and organizational competencies. The findings indicate that some instructors were perceived to have low performance in these competencies, despite the fact that these competencies are very important for the success of the institution-based enterprise.

The study addressed the following basic research question: What do teachers in Georgia perceive to be the main advantages and drawbacks to teaching technology education in a modular environment compared to a conventional environment? This study found that Georgia technology teachers who were familiar with teaching in modular laboratories tended to have a positive perception of modular technology education laboratories. Overall, in comparison to conventional technology laboratories, the teachers felt that modular laboratories are better, both for themselves and for their students. The fact that the technology teachers found that the modular laboratory format provided specific advantages to themselves may be a factor in their favorable attitude toward modular laboratories. Among the perceived advantages for teachers of a modular laboratory format were that the modular laboratory allowed them the freedom to use as much or as little of the lab as they wished. Another advantage cited by the respondents was that it was easy to implement the Georgia curriculum though the use of a modular laboratory. Teachers also agreed that modular laboratories were more consistent with their values and needs. However, teachers did not perceive modular labs as easier to try out on a limited basis as compared to conventional laboratories, nor did they find modular laboratories easier to understand and use. Since modular laboratories are being widely used, further study should be conducted regarding their advantages and disadvantages. (Contains 8 tables.)",

Technology education students should be aware of experimental technologies. They should understand the ramifications of items such as hybrid vehicles, photovoltaic solar panels, biometrics, nanotechnology, biological engineering, and hydrogen vehicles. Nonetheless, the focus of the middle level technology classroom should not be on any specific experimental technology. Instead the focus should be on preparing students to think in a logical manner, comprehend the needs of society, solve problems (even those which may not exist at the current time), consider what technological skills society must develop in order to solve those problems, and understand how to use technology ethically. By fully engaging students in the use of experimental technologies at the middle level, technology education teachers make students active stakeholders in experimental technologies.",

In keeping with this progression of years, the products and services of the organization are advancing as well: the \"Journal of Industrial Teacher Education (JITE)\" will turn 43, the Industrial Teacher Education Directory (ITE Directory) will turn 49, and the News and Views Newsletter will turn 26. Such a record speaks to the durability and quality of the organization. Nonetheless, NAITTE, like many other membership organizations today, is facing many challenges that threaten its long-term health and survival. This article reports the findings of the 2004 membership survey that was conducted in an effort to understand these challenges and to better meet the needs of the membership. In an attempt to provide some perspective on the new findings, the article incorporates a comparison with the 1993 survey conducted by Patrick Miller (1993). As the two surveys were compared, the message that emerged from the data was disturbing. It is troubling to think that the challenges that have confronted NAITTE for the greater part of the past two decades are the same challenges that face it today. Granted, some of these challenges are perennial and out of NAITTE's control, but there are many that fall well within its purview. (Contains 17 tables.)",

        "description":"In this response to Charles Gagel's National Association of Industrial and Technical Teacher Educators (NAITTE) Membership Survey Report, the author states that the NAITTE of tomorrow cannot be the NAITTE of the past, as the organization is now feeling the effects of failing to change along with the field of teacher education. Of course, the direction in which NAITTE should change in order to accommodate the new playing field is not entirely clear, especially if changes are to serve the future and not just represent the present. The demand for elementary and secondary school teachers of technology, as they have traditionally known them in the past, has diminished and has resulted in the reduction of technology teacher education programs and, consequently, the NAITTE membership base. The author believes that joining together with teacher educators would be beneficial to NAITTE, broadening the population of prospective teachers who enroll in the organization's technological teacher education programs and thereby helping to stabilize the number of teacher educators. He also highlights the importance of partnering with teachers who use technological processes to teach basic life skills to special populations of students, entering into discussions with their colleagues in agriculture, and engaging in workforce education. In planning for the future of NAITTE, he says it is wise to go beyond the present mission statement to some guiding principles and to clarify what it is they stand for.",

        "description":"This study seeks to determine the state of online course development and faculty attitudes toward online instruction within technical teacher education programs in the United States. This study shows that a majority of research participants reported that less than 25% of coursework in their departments was offered fully online or Web-enhanced. This indicates a relatively low usage of online coursework in technical teacher education programs. One may conclude, therefore, that technical teacher education programs rely more upon traditional classroom-based instruction rather than online coursework. If so, opportunity may then exist to find ways to more fully integrate online instruction into these programs. When asked whether specific technologies are used as part of online courses offered by their departments, a majority of study participants (73%) indicated that course management systems were used to deliver online coursework. An almost equal percentage of faculty (86%) indicated that Web sites or Web pages were used to deliver online coursework. In addition to the presence of course management systems, the faculty members' willingness to develop and maintain personal and/or professional Web sites may be indicative of the availability of Web-development technologies as well as (at least) a moderate level of technical expertise in this area. Those planning for the use of technology in higher education institutions should use the results of this study to provide appropriate support and shape faculty's attitudes toward online course development and instruction. This, in turn, may lead to more rapid and effective infusion of technology into teaching. (Contains 9 tables.)",

Nisbet and Grimbeek (2004) previously reported an interpretable and statistically acceptable 6-factor exploratory factor solution. The present paper improved on this outcome by utilising Rasch analysis to identify items with orderly sequences of scores across response categories, and to subject these to fresh exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The resulting 3-factor scale proved acceptable in terms of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis as well as in terms of Rasch item analysis. The paper briefly discusses the implications of these outcomes in relation to the refined instrument's capacity to gather information about how teachers view the Queensland numeracy reporting system.

The items were administered in the classroom and collected from 1993 to 2003 in the Australian state of Tasmania. Data were collected from a total of 5514 individual students across Grades 3 to 11 over the decade and of these students 896 provided at least one repeated measure. As students completed a core of common items, Rasch analysis could be performed and all students were subsequently placed on the same logit scale for comparison.

Reporting the results of analyses for a range of audiences necessitates careful, well-designed report formats. Some useful new report formats based on Rasch modelling--the Modified Variable Map, the Ordinal Map, the Threshold Map, and the Annotated Ordinal Map--are illustrated using data from the IMYMS project. The Rasch analysis and the derived reporting formats avoid the pitfalls that exist when working with ordinal data and provide insights into the respondents' views about their experiences in schools unavailable by other approaches.

        "description":"The basic theory of Rasch measurement applies to situations where a person has a certain level of a trait being investigated, and this level of ability is what determines (to within a measurement error) how well the person does on each item in a test. This paper responds to frequent suggestions from colleagues that the use of Rasch measurement would be profitable in analysing a set of data on students' understanding of decimal notation. We demonstrate misfit to the Rasch model by showing that item difficulty estimates show important variation by year level, that there is significant deviation from expected score curves, and that success on certain splitter items does not imply a student is more likely to score well on other items. The explanation given is that conceptual learning may not always be able to be measured on a scale, which is an essential feature of the Rasch approach. Instead, students move between categories of interpretations, which do not necessarily provide more correct answers even when they are based on an improved understanding of fundamental principles. In this way, the paper serves to highlight the assumptions built into the Rasch model and to discuss its applicability to describing the progress of learning with various characteristics.

        "description":"This research examined students' responses to mathematics problem-solving tasks and applied a general multidimensional IRT model at the response category level. In doing so, cognitive processes were identified and modelled through item response modelling to extract more information than would be provided using conventional practices in scoring items. More specifically, the study consisted of two parts. The first part involved the development of a mathematics problem-solving framework that was theoretically grounded, drawing upon research in mathematics education and cognitive psychology. The framework was then used as the basis for item development. The second part of the research involved the analysis of the item response data. It was demonstrated that multidimensional IRT models were powerful tools for extracting information from a limited number of item responses. A problem-solving profile for each student could be constructed from the results of IRT scaling. (Contains 4 tables, 1 figure, and 4 footnotes.)",

For much of the time, truth is not a pressing problem for educational researchers who just get on with the job.

Teacher-related indicators revealed academic qualification deficiency, low continuing professional involvements, substantial physics teaching experience, and good licensure status. Academic environment indices revealed that the number of physics classes per teacher is manageable, but the individual classes are large. Results also showed limited instructional materials and technologies, the unpopularity of professional mentoring, and favorable library and internet access. Based on these findings, challenges to developing a larger pool of competent physics teachers and equipping schools with relevant instructional devices were identified.

Group assignments can, however, create dilemmas and tensions for both staff and students. Students often seek academic intervention in the form of support and dispute arbitration; and the types of interventions employed to deal with issues arising during and after group work, and the effectiveness of the interventions, are critical aspects of group assignments. This paper reports the findings from a recent qualitative study based on interviews with ten university academics about their use and management of undergraduate group work. These findings revealed that positive experiences and outcomes can be undermined when staff expectations of group work are at odds with student reality, particularly when academics try to distance themselves from student group problems or intervene retrospectively. The paper concludes that academics must be able and willing to work alongside groups in helping them achieve outcomes that are positive, fair and equitable.",

This article identifies the ways teachers and the &quot;tutors&quot; (as the volunteers were called) understood the value of the project. &quot;Being a teacher&quot; and &quot;being a volunteer&quot; were structured by different forms of social engagement, which in turn influenced the ways individuals were able to work with each other in collaborative processes. We argue that the discursive practices encoded in home-school-community partnership rhetoric represent ruling-class ways of organising and networking that may be incompatible with those of people from low socio-economic backgrounds. When such volunteers work in schools their attendance may be sporadic and short-term whereas teachers would like &quot;reliable&quot; ongoing commitment. This mismatch wrought of teachers' and volunteers' differing everyday realities needs to be understood before useful models for partnerships in disadvantaged communities may be realised.

        "author":["Gale, Trevor"],
        "description":"Academic engagement with higher education research policy in Australia, and with education policy more generally, is in crisis. This time around, it is not just that our theoretical tools are blunt and irrelevant (Ball 1990), so are our politics. It seems our attention has been so consumed by &quot;what is policy&quot; (Ball 1994a) and with challenging its claims to authority, that we have missed or ignored imperatives to engage with its production. Even though some have attempted contributions, for the most part we have been &quot;coerced into an era of cooperation&quot;. Getting ourselves out of this mess will take more than just better theories and new politics. It will require a degree of cooperation, to advance a theory and practice of policy engagement and to re-establish a field of education that resists the tendency to fragment and/or the temptation to defend itself &quot;against&quot; policy. In this paper I attempt an assessment of where we are theoretically and politically with regard to education policy and where we need to look to find new forms of policy engagement. By way of illustration, I draw on examples from AARE (the Australian Association for Research in Education) and the Australian RQF (Research Quality Framework) although the analysis is by no means restricted to these.",

        "description":"Education has become a domain of considerable ideological division. Today the mantra is freedom and choice, yet at the same time, a push to \"back to basics\" is observed. This author attempts to trace the contours of this division by taking two steps back from the contemporary fray. One step is to situate present day discussions in a larger historical context. In this context, today's points of debate and disagreement are not so new. The other step is to interrogate the protagonists' underlying understanding of the nature of knowledge, in other words their epistemological assumptions. She describes three paradigmatic approaches to education: \"didactic,\" \"authentic,\" and \"transformative.\" Transformative education may prove to be hugely significant in social terms and in the impact of social changes on education. In this article, the author reflects on the nature of the discipline of education. She concludes by arguing that education should conceive itself as a science, and suggests the constituent elements of a science of education. The time is ripe to open out the intellectual scope and ambition of education as a field of intellectual endeavour and social invention.",

        "description":"This paper takes up the question of the way in which &quot;the problem with educational research&quot; is represented. It takes as its point of departure two recent views on &quot;the problem&quot;--one expressed by an educational journalist and one presented by the Australian Council of Deans of Education. It locates these within a larger frame of international debate about educational research and its problems and considers how these arise out of particular dispositions towards educational research and, by extension towards, education itself. The paper suggests that the different positions on the problem with educational research, and hence on the solution to the problem, fail to engage in the question of education itself as a problem of the present. It argues that this problem is produced through twin fantasies about education: a redemptive fantasy about the possibility and the imperative for education to solve problems of social disadvantage; and a disciplinary fantasy that faculties of education can do this by themselves. Through an examination of the &quot;de-sciencing&quot; of education in the past decade or so, and its recent &quot;re-sciencing&quot;, the authors conclude that, with all the problems that might be identified that pertain to educational research and to faculties of education, the most significant might well be a failure of research imagination. Overcoming this problem demands engagement with provocative ideas coming from outside traditional educational expertise. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"In keeping with repeated calls to investigate high early career turnover within the teaching profession, the present study investigated the hypothesis that a significant positive association between burnout and turnover intention would be observed in teachers at the beginning of their careers. A sample of 112 Australian teachers working in their first or second academic year was surveyed in 2004. Respondents were administered the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI: Maslach, Jackson &amp; Leiter 1996) and asked about serious intentions to leave their job and/or profession. Meaningful and significant associations between serious intentions to leave and all three MBI subscales were found. The findings suggest a realistic and straightforward explanation for the alarmingly high early career attrition rates that are now commonly reported for the teaching profession in a number of countries.

As such, it focuses on a discursive field emerging within domains of internationalisation, globalisation, and resistance. It examines processes and protocols in a number of Australian universities' postgraduate divisions' practices in the conduct of postgraduate supervision, in the context of increasing pressures towards internationalisation within frameworks of globalising influences. It takes issue with Western custom and tradition as privileged within the field of supervision of postgraduate research studies and suggests a model of postgraduate research supervision as intentional and systematic intervention, based on literature deriving from research in postgraduate supervision which acknowledges the problematic natures of cultural relationships as to teaching and learning and knowledge production, and student resistances within these fields. In doing so, it examines issues of discursive practices and the problematic natures of power relationships in supervisor-supervisee protocols and possibilities suggested by alternative models of postgraduate supervision of international students.

The aim of the paper is to present the results from a systematic review of the research evidence on counselling children and young people and discuss these results in relation to the educational context and the added value to be gained in addressing the mental health needs of children and young people. A systematic review methodology is used to assess the outcome research literature. The review is structured around a range of counselling issues and four groups of counselling approaches: cognitive-behavioural, person-centred, psychodynamic and creative therapies. Results indicate that all four approaches to counselling are effective for children and young people across the full range of counselling issues. However, more high quality published research evidence was located for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural counselling than other approaches, identifying significant gaps in the evidence bases for these approaches. Other gaps in the evidence include research into counselling for school related issues and self-harm. (Contains 3 figures.)",

Parental concerns about composite classes are commonly reported as negative and this study confirmed this concern. Issues identified as causing concern for parents were a belief that some grades and some children are more suited than others to being part of a composite class, position in the class (younger or older grade), cohesion both within the class (class identity) and with grade peers in monograde classes (grade identity), perceived choice(between composite and monograde classes) and selection bias. Selection of particular teachers and students for the composite classes had both positive and negative effects--a positive effect on the composite class but a negative effect on the monograde classes because of the removal of the good role models and the &quot;best&quot; teachers. Many parents reported more favourable attitudes after a positive experience with a composite class but not all such parents were prepared to indicate their support for composite classes.

        "description":"Communication in society today is characterised by rapidly changing and emergent forms of meaning-making in a context of increased cultural and linguistic diversity. The need to teach these new literacy practices referred to as multiliteracies, is now embedded within systemic policies in Australia. This research paper is a response to these imperatives, releasing key findings of a critical ethnographic study concerning interactions between pedagogy and access to multiliteracies among culturally and linguistically diverse learners. A salient finding was that situated practice was enacted as an isolated stage rather than occurring concurrently with overt instruction. This had significant connections to some learners' inability to access new, multimodal, and digitally-mediated designs of meaning. More importantly, culturally and linguistically non-students who were not of the dominant culture were least served by the separation of overt instruction and situated practice. The article concludes with the recommendation that multimodal meaning-making requires an instructional model that involves both practice and instruction. (Contains 9 figures and 1 endnote.)",

The participants comprised 25 teachers, each of whom was administered a range of instruments. The results indicated that 40% of teachers were subjected to daily or peak noise exposures beyond the maximum permissible levels according to the Australian Occupational Health and Safety (OH&amp;S) standard. Further, the unique contribution of daily noise dose received by the staff to the prediction of their vocational strain, interpersonal strain, and defensive functioning was evident through multiple regression analyses. It was concluded that vocational strain amongst preschool teachers may be related, in part, to a combination of elevated daily doses of noise, and years of teaching experience.

        "description":"This paper is set against a history of school funding policies in Australia that begins with the first public policy recognition of the disadvantages experienced by government and non-government schools in the 1973 Schools in Australia (Karmel) Report. The paper traces a history of school funding policy linking it with the current backlash against public education and retaliatory backlash constructions of public schools as the new disadvantaged in an increasingly competitive and deregulated school funding policy environment. These backlashes, argued to be against the indiscriminate funding of independent schools policy by several protagonists of public education, are framed in terms equivalent to what Lingard and Douglas (1999) have called &quot;recuperative&quot; politics. From the kind of recuperative statist politics considered in this paper, construing the backlash effects of public and private schools as damaging and unproductive as those emerging from the gender wars in education policy, I propose a move to an Australian school funding arrangement in which all schools, both public and private, are integrated into one deregulated and equally funded sector, as typify diverse school provisions in several OECD polities (Caldwell 2004, FitzGerald 2004). While briefly tracing a school funding policy chronology, this paper also concentrates on the current policy moment in relation to school funding, that signals the end of distinctive public and private education sectors, and in the context of which it argues that private schools should be funded equally to state schools, a trend in evidence since 1996. The focus on the current policy moment entails an abbreviated analysis of the Fitzgerald Report (&quot;Governments Working Together: A Better Future for All Australians&quot; 2004), which makes a number of recommendations to the Victorian and other governments in relation to the public funding of all Australian schools. The paper addresses the impact of this trend especially on the funding of Australian Catholic schools. (Contains 4 endnotes.)",

Teachers who try to live up to it will not only burn out, they will distort their students' educational development. The vitality of the classroom comes from an energy that is created between teachers and students; it is an energy in which both teachers and students share, but for which neither is individually responsible. The successful teacher must be able to receive if they are to be able to give. This argument is advanced using interviews with Australian teachers and students, all of whom were asked to describe the teachers who changed their lives.",

        "author":["Agbenyega, Joseph S."],
        "description":"This paper reports on a study that compared the practice of corporal punishment in ten basic schools in the Greater Accra District in Ghana. Five of the ten schools were designated as inclusive project schools (IPS) and the other five as non-inclusive project schools (NIS). The primary purpose was to find out if the inclusive project schools were more effective in eradicating corporal punishment from their schools than were the non-project schools. One hundred teachers responded to a six-item questionnaire. A further 22 participants comprising ten teachers from the survey group, ten pupils and two directors of education were interviewed. Observation of the classroom practices, where these teachers work, substantiated the questionnaire and interview findings. The overall results indicated that corporal punishment still persists in both school sites at relatively the same scale. Three themes were found to underpin the administration of corporal punishment to students in these schools. (1) Punishment as an effective learning imperative (2) Punishment as a moral imperative (3) Punishment as religious imperative. The implications of these findings pertaining to inclusive education are discussed. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

In particular the study aimed to document the literacy and numeracy practices valued in the home community, community school and urban high school and highlight any continuities and discontinuities between the various contexts. Data were collected using observations, document analyses and interviews. Students in the study participated in a number of different activities \"outside of school\" in their home communities including hunting, art, ceremony, cooking, sport and play. There was evidence of literate and numerate practices embedded throughout these activities. The data also showed there were distinct differences in the kinds of knowledge valued in each context investigated. Cultural knowledge was valued in the home community whereas curriculum knowledge was valued in the school community. The students also built other bodies of knowledge through their participation in community activities. These were reflected in the school curriculum and included scientific knowledge, art knowledge, sport and recreational knowledge and work and domestic knowledge. This paper discusses the community literate and numerate practices, and highlights the continuities and discontinuities with the literate and numerate practices that are valued and privileged in the school curriculum.

        "description":"Video feedforward can create images of positive futures, as has been shown by researchers using self-modeling methods to teach new skills with carefully planned and edited videos that show the future capability of the individual. As a supplement to tutoring provided by community members, we extended these practices to young children struggling to read. Ten students with special needs participated in a multiple baseline intervention. Each received tutoring only, followed by tutoring plus video feedforward, another phase of tutoring only, and follow-up. Overall, reading fluency improved significantly for all students; in 9 out of 10 cases, rate of improvement was significantly greatest during feedforward. Other measures (e.g., word identification) confirmed student progress from most at-risk to mid-stream status. We conclude that video images of success with challenging materials may enhance the acquisition of reading skills.",

No group differences were found for latency, but the reading-match group differed from the other two groups on accuracy. All three groups identified the first letter of words faster than they did for nonwords. In Experiment 2, students named words with typical and atypical letter-sound relationships; the researchers measure latency and accuracy. Both the low-vision and the reading-match groups were slower than the age-match group; only the reading-match group made more errors on typical stimuli than on atypical stimuli.

Findings indicated that both positive and negative aspects of these children's relationships and bonds were associated with social, behavioral, and emotional adjustment.

The first innovation, the range-bound changing criterion, is a very simple variation of the classic changing criterion design. The classic version uses a single criterion for each stepwise intervention phase, whereas the range-bound version uses a range criterion--that is, an upper and lower limit for each intervention phase. The second innovation, the distributed criterion, combines elements of the changing criterion, multiple-baseline, and ABAB designs. It is well suited to contexts where students must multitask--that is, allocate, prioritize, and adjust time and effort to complete multiple tasks in response to changing environmental demands.

The odds of referral for boys were nearly twice those for girls. Compared to White children, the odds of referral were greater for Native American children and lower for Black and Asian/Pacific Island children. Odds of referral for non-Hispanic/non-Haitian children were greater than those for Hispanic or Haitian children.

The focus of the article is the intentions, purposes, and future directions for disability classification in education. The authors argue that these advances offer researchers and policymakers the opportunity to examine the relational nature of disability classification in any recalibration of statutory standards or educational policy reforms. Such developments are necessary to move beyond discrete categorical classification systems traditionally used in education that (a) do not recognize the complexity of human differences, (b) unnecessarily stigmatize children, and (c) do not always benefit the individuals who are classified.",

        "description":"This article is the second in a 2-part synthesis of an international comparative seminar on the classification of children with disabilities. In this article, the authors discuss classification frameworks used in identifying children for the purpose of providing special education and related services. The authors summarize 7 papers that addressed aspects of disability classification in educational systems in the United States and the United Kingdom. They discuss current policies for determining which children receive special education services, the origins and evolution of these policies, and current dilemmas and challenges associated with classification schemes and the provision of special education. The authors also describe emerging data and possible models and practices that might be used in educational systems. They conclude with the recognition that both formal and informal educational classification systems will continue to be required within a system that must address the competing priorities of individual needs and the broader social and community goals of education. However, as was argued in the previous article, by understanding the mix of intentions that underpin these policies, as well as periodically reviewing the norms that underlie them, it may be possible to move classification to descriptors that can be used to efficiently and effectively define educational needs and distribute resources.

The self-regulated strategy development model was used to teach these strategies; the impact of this instruction was evaluated via a multiple-baseline design. Instruction had a positive impact on students' writing, as their stories were longer, more complete, and, with the exception of one student, qualitatively better. Instructional effects also transferred to the recall of narrative reading material for four of the six students. These findings were generally maintained over time.",

During the first intervention condition (new passage each session), the first author (a) explained the meanings of new vocabulary words from the session's passage, used each vocabulary word in a sentence, and asked the learner to use each word in a sentence; (b) corrected oral reading errors during the learner's initial oral reading of the passage; (c) asked the learner to read the passage as fast as she or he could for three consecutive trials; and (d) asked five literal comprehension questions about the passage. The same procedures were used during the second intervention condition (same passage to criterion), except the same passage was used across sessions until the learner reached a predetermined number of words read correctly per minute. During the \"new passage each session\" condition, the oral reading rate of all five learners showed marked improvements over their performance during baseline. During the \"same passage to criterion\" condition, four of five learners reached the predetermined fluency criterion of 100 correct words per minute. The mean number of comprehension questions answered correctly per session was notably higher during both intervention conditions than during baseline.",

Participants were the nationally stratified linking sample (N = 498) of the WISC-IV and WIAT-II. Observed scores from the WISC-IV were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Although the factor index scores provided a statistically significant increment over the Full Scale IQ, the size of the improvement was too small to be of clinical utility. Observed WISC-IV subtest scores were also subjected to structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses. Subtest scores from the WISC-IV were fit to a general factor (&quot;g&quot;) and four ability constructs corresponding to factor indexes from the WISC-IV (Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed). For both reading and mathematics, only &quot;g&quot; (0.55 and 0.77, respectively) and Verbal Comprehension (0.37 and 0.17, respectively) were significant influences. Thus, when using observed scores to predict reading and mathematics achievement, it may only be necessary to consider the Full Scale IQ. In contrast, both &quot;g&quot; and Verbal Comprehension may be required for explanatory research.",

Experimental classes received units of differentiated, peer-mediated, hands-on instruction, while control classes received traditional science instruction. Results indicate that collaborative hands-on activities statistically facilitate learning of middle school science content on posttests and on state high-stakes tests for all students and that students enjoyed using the activities.

These trends were based on data published in annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by the Office of Special Education Programs, U.S. Department of Education. Rapid growth in teacher demand for students with disabilities aged 3-5 years was found, whereas the growth in teacher demand for students aged 6-21 years was more gradual and paralleled the rate of growth in teacher demand in general education. Although teacher demand was mostly satisfied by growth in the supply of fully certified teachers, the shortage of fully certified teachers for students with disabilities aged 6-21 years has been chronic since 1987/1988 and has increased annually, from 7.4% in 1993/1994 to 13.4% in 2002/2003 (a shortage of approximately 54,000 special education teachers, including estimated vacant positions).",

Many in the mathematics reform community have maintained that this principle can be achieved through one well-designed curriculum. However, the extant research on equity--which focuses on either ethnic diversity or academic achievement--suggests that this principle is illusive. The current study compares the effectiveness of two curricula in teaching a range of math concepts to 53 (28 male; 25 female) middle school students at risk for special education services in math. The yearlong, quasi-experimental study involved achievement and attitudinal measures. Results indicated that students in the intervention group who used materials designed according to instructional principles described in the special education literature achieved higher academic outcomes (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.001) and had more positive attitudes toward math (p less than 0.001) than did students in the comparison group.",

Twelve studies that employed quasi-experimental or experimental designs are reviewed. These studies included elementary students, adolescents, and college students. Of the 12 studies, 5 reported that the OG instruction was more effective than were comparison or control interventions for all measured outcomes, 4 reported that the OG instruction was more effective for at least 1 (but not all) outcomes in comparison to other intervention(s), 2 reported that the alternate instruction was more effective than the OG instruction, and 1 reported no significant differences once covariates were included. The largest effects were reported for word attack and non-word reading outcomes, with mean effect size of 0.82, and comprehension outcomes, with a mean effect size of 0.76.

Given the small number of studies, the lack of methodological rigor of the existing studies, and the inconclusive findings of the effectiveness of OG programs, additional research is needed before the scientific basis can be established.",

        "description":"Although single-case researchers are not accustomed to analyzing data statistically, standards for research and accountability from government and other funding agents are creating pressure for more objective, reliable data. In addition, \"evidence-based interventions\" movements in special education, clinical psychology, and school psychology imply reliable data summaries. Within special education, two heavily debated single-case research (SCR) statistical indices are \"percentage of non-overlapping data\" (PND) and the regression effect size, R[squared]. This article proposes a new index--PAND, the \"percentage of all non-overlapping data\"--to remedy deficiencies of both PND and R[squared]. PAND is closely related to the established effect size, Pearson's \"Phi\", the \"fourfold point correlation coefficient.\" The PAND/\"Phi\" procedure is demonstrated and applied to 75 published multiple baseline designs to answer questions about typical effect sizes, relationships with PND and R[squared], statistical power, and time efficiency. Confidence intervals and p values for \"Phi\" also are demonstrated. The findings are that PAND/\"Phi\" and PND correlate equally well to R[squared]. However, only PAND/\"Phi\" could show adequate power for most of the multiple baseline designs sampled. The findings suggest that PAND/\"Phi\" may meet the requirement for a useful effect size for multiple baseline and other longer designs in SCR.",

        "description":"The study examined the role of maternal personal resources (mother's attachment style, coping strategies, and affect) in moderating the effects of learning disabilities (LD) on children's socioemotional and behavioral adjustment (self-rated sense of coherence, loneliness, and hope; and mother-rated child behavior checklist measures), as well as on their secure attachment among school-age children with LD. The sample consisted of 110 mother-child dyads: 59 mothers and their children with LD (29 boys, 30 girls) and 51 mothers and their typically developing children (21 boys, 30 girls) from the same schools. Preliminary analyses indicated significant group differences on all children's measures and in several of the maternal personal resources. Mothers' low use of avoidant coping strategies and less avoidance in close relationships with significant others were found to moderate the effect of children's disabilities on children's level of loneliness, feelings of hope, and secure attachment. Results are discussed in terms of understanding these maternal personal resources' influences on socioemotional well-being among school-age children with LD.",

Analyses were conducted on the test scores of 625 middle and high school students (n = 388 with LD) on two equivalent 30-item multiple-choice tests. Whereas mean scores for students both with and without LD were higher in the accommodated condition, students without disabilities benefited significantly more from the accommodation (\"ES\" = 0.44) than students with LD (\"ES\" = 0.20). In addition, effect sizes from the present study were combined meta-analytically with those of previous studies. Results of the meta-analysis revealed that for elementary students, oral accommodations on a mathematics test yielded greater gains for students with LD than for students without disabilities; for secondary students, the converse was true. Findings of the study are discussed in relation to the question of the validity of an oral accommodation on mathematics tests for students both with and without disabilities.",

        "description":"Nicotine replacement products are commonly used to promote smoking cessation, but alternative and complementary methods may increase cessation rates. The current experiment compared the short-term effects of a transdermal nicotine patch to voucher-based reinforcement of smoking abstinence on cigarette smoking. Fourteen heavy smokers (7 men and 7 women) completed the four 5-day phases of the study: baseline, patch treatment, voucher treatment, and return to baseline. The order of the two treatment phases was counterbalanced across participants. In the patch treatment condition, participants wore a 14-mg transdermal nicotine patch every day. In the voucher treatment condition, participants received vouchers contingent on abstinence from smoking, defined as producing carbon monoxide (CO) readings of approximately 4 parts per million. Participants e-mailed two video clips per day showing them breathing into a CO monitor and the resulting CO reading to clinic staff. In the voucher treatment, 24% of samples were negative, and 5% of samples were negative in the patch treatment. Results suggest that contingent vouchers were more effective than transdermal nicotine patches in promoting abstinence.",

        "description":"Factors that influence choice between qualitatively different reinforcers (e.g., a food item or a break from work) are important to consider when arranging treatments for problem behavior. Previous findings indicate that children who engage in problem behavior maintained by escape from demands may choose a food item over the functional reinforcer during treatment (DeLeon, Neidert, Anders, & Rodriguez-Catter, 2001; Lalli et al., 1999). However, a number of variables may influence choice between concurrently available forms of reinforcement. An analogue for treatment situations in which positive reinforcement for compliance is in direct competition with negative reinforcement for problem behavior was used in the current study to evaluate several variables that may influence choice. Participants were 5 children who had been diagnosed with developmental disabilities and who engaged in problem behavior maintained by escape from demands. In the first phase, the effects of task preference and schedule of reinforcement on choice between a 30-s break and a high-preference food item were evaluated. The food item was preferred over the break, regardless of the preference level of the task or the reinforcement schedule, for all but 1 participant. In the second phase, the quality of the break was manipulated by combining escape with toys, attention, or both. Only 1 participant showed preference for the enriched break. In the third phase, choice of a medium- or low-preference food item versus the enriched break was evaluated. Three of 4 participants showed preference for the break over the less preferred food item. Results extend previous research by identifying some of the conditions under which individuals who engage in escape-maintained behavior will prefer a food reinforcer over the functional one.",

In a combined multiple baseline (across responses and participants) and multiple probe design (with trained and untrained stimuli), it was shown that reinforced multiple-exemplar training facilitated the development of arbitrary comparative relations, and that these skills generalized not just across stimuli but also across trial types. The sequence of training identified potential prerequisites in the development of comparative relations (e.g., nonarbitrary comparative relations). Taken as a whole, the present data, along with previous work by others in this area, suggest that relating arbitrary events comparatively is an operant.

Using a three-component multiple schedule, the results of Experiment 2 showed that the vocal stereotypy of both participants remained below preintervention levels following the removal of auditory stimulation and that 1 participant's vocal stereotypy increased following the removal of contingent reprimands. These patterns suggest that auditory stimulation functioned as an abolishing operation for vocal stereotypy and reprimands functioned as an establishing operation for vocal stereotypy.

To make the intervention more sustainable in the natural environment (where interruptions are unavoidable), a two-component multiple-schedule arrangement was used to progressively increase the period of time in which ongoing activities would be interrupted. During generalization sessions, the intervention was applied across a variety of contexts and therapists.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to demonstrate derived manding skills in 2 adults with severe developmental disabilities and language deficits by contriving transitive conditioned establishing operations. Specifically, we evaluated whether a history of reinforced conditional discrimination learning would ultimately result in a derived mand repertoire, in which participants manded for items that were needed to complete chained tasks. After mastering the first three phases of the picture exchange communication system (PECS), participants were taught to mand for the needed items by exchanging pictures of the items for the items themselves. They were then taught to conditionally relate the dictated names of the items to the corresponding pictures of the items and to relate the dictated names to the corresponding printed words. We then tested, in the absence of reinforcement, whether participants would mand for the items needed to complete the chained tasks using text rather than pictures. Both participants showed the emergence of derived mands and some derived stimulus relations as a result of this instruction. Some of the derived relations were shown to be intact at 1-month follow-up, and scores on derived mand probes were higher at follow-up than before training. In addition, the 2 participants vocally requested the needed items on maintenance test probes, a skill that was never trained and was not previously in their repertoires. These results suggest that a history of reinforced relational responding may facilitate the expansion of a number of verbal skills and emphasize the possibility of a synthesis of Skinner's (1957) analysis of verbal behavior and derived stimulus relations into language-training efforts for persons with significant disabilities.",

During the training condition, video models, prompting, and reinforcement were used. The results showed that all 4 children learned to emit appropriate helping responses in the presence of discriminative stimuli from the helping categories used during training. Generalization of helping responses was observed in the presence of untrained discriminative stimuli during additional probe conditions. Additional pre- and post-intervention generalization trials showed that the frequency of helping responses also increased in the presence of novel stimuli, in a novel setting, and with a novel instructor.",

Multiple baseline designs with 2 participants and a reversal design with 1 participant were then used to demonstrate the extent to which differential reinforcement of single-word mands (e.g., \"cars\") or framed mands (e.g., \"I want the cars, please\") would result in the emergence of other single-word and framed mands for different items (e.g., mands for music, puppets, or puzzles).

The reinforcing efficacy of the most highly preferred items identified by each method was evaluated concurrently in a reinforcer assessment. The reinforcer assessment showed that all stimuli identified as highly preferred via the direct preference assessment and teacher rankings functioned as reinforcers. The highest ranked stimuli in the direct assessment were more reinforcing than the teachers' top-ranked stimuli for 5 of 9 participants, whereas the teachers' top-ranked stimulus was more reinforcing than the highest ranked stimulus of the direct assessment for only 1 child. A strong positive correlation between rankings generated through the two assessments was identified for only 1 of the 9 participants.

        "description":"The widespread use of student evaluations to rate faculty has raised the question of whether high student evaluations can be gained simply through the process of faculty giving higher grades to students, or whether learning of students is a critical factor in such evaluations. Four different models were tested which represented different relationships between students= expected student grades and student evaluations of the quality of instructors, with and without student motivation, ability, and amount learned as potentially important variables. Evaluations from 119 students of four different instructors were used for the data set. Statistical tests of the alternative models indicated that a more complex model incorporating student motivation and  ability levels as factors affecting student evaluations of instructors provided the best fit to the data. The fit was superior to that of a model using only expected grades and student evaluations of instructors, indicating that students= evaluations of faculty did not appear to be based solely on the grades students expected to receive. The complex model also fit the data better than a simpler model using only perceived amount learned, expected grades, and instructor ratings. For this data set, instructor ratings were not simply a function of expected grades, or simply a function of perceived amount learned, but a function of motivation, ability, amount learned, and grades.",

        "description":"Education accompanied by social mobility is the cornerstone of the American dream. Yet, each year scores of children, especially those from the underprivileged class, fail to meet even the most modest academic expectations and subsequently never reach their academic potential. This research rejects earlier explanations of academic failure and suggests that Modality theory, the idea that students differ in their ability to learn new and difficult material depending on the manner in which it is presented, may offer a viable strategy for facilitating academic success. Some research suggests that one specific form of modality- tactual/ kinesthetic presentations, demonstrates promise for improving academic achievement especially when employed with underachievers. This research explores the use of tactual/ kinesthetic teaching strategies with a group of underachieving 6th grade Bermudian children. It reveals that underachievers do, in fact, learn differently than other students and that the tactual/ kinesthetic resources may promote a more positive attitude among the students leading to greater engagement with their education and subsequently improved cognitive achievement. This study asserts that the issue of academic failure lies less with the socio-cultural make-up of the student than with the educational delivery system, student attitude and intensity of student engagement in their own learning.",

This paper illustrates the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze educational achievement gaps in Arkansas. It introduces the Geographic Academic Policy Series (GAPS) and presents one example of GAPS as a case study using GIS in the education policy analysis. The Geographic Academic Policy Series, developed in the National Office for Research on Measurement and Evaluation Systems, provides a visual &quot;snapshot&quot; of achievement relative to important policy issues. The GAPS series displays maps in conjunction with state-wide summaries of educational statistics, but does not require complicated understanding of statistics or methodology by the user. Currently, the GAPS series examines the relationships between school district academic performance and other district level variables including percent of students participating in Free and Reduced Lunch Programs (a proxy measure for poverty), school district size, and per pupil spending. In addition, district performance on the ACT exam, which is completed by students intending to attend college, is presented and examined in relation to district size. The GAPS series also includes state maps identifying the academic performance status of all districts and schools in Arkansas relative to NCLB. Policy makers have been particularly interested in the GAPS series, noting that it provides them with an effective method for examining academic achievement statewide.",

Her babysitter left last week, just as her mom started a new job with longer hours. She is missing her former caregiver and mom a lot. Based on the stories from her teacher and her father, the author gives her assessment of Mackenzie's situation. Although the childcare setting seems fine, it will take her some time to get used to it. She may also be bewildered because family childcare is not school, and not the same as being at home either. Mackenzie needs the patience and understanding of all the adults in her life. Keeping the lines of communication open among all of the adults is crucial. With the parents' permission, not only should the parents and teacher be in communication, but also the teacher and new caregiver. An ongoing dialogue between all of those who care for Mackenzie will make it easier to help her feel at home. The transition to an afterschool care program would be easier if each parent spent a few afternoons there with Mackenzie. They might encourage her to bring a favorite toy or some special snacks that she really likes. Of course, this could be difficult with the mother's new job, but the special effort will be worth it.",

At seven to nine months, babies placed on the floor will push up both arms and legs and rock back and forth as if doing preliminary exercises in preparation for their first efforts at learning to creep or crawl across a floor. By 10 to 13 months, that baby will push up to standing, holding on firmly to the couch, even if wobbly.

        "author":["Herzig, Rebecca"],
        "description":"The author had a conversation one late afternoon with an untenured colleague from another department regarding chili pepper ratings. Her colleague explained that the popular RateMyProfessor.com Web site allows students to rate faculty members not only according to standards of \"clarity,\" \"helpfulness,\" and something called \"easiness,\" but also in terms of \"hotness,\" denoted with a cheerful cartoon of a red chili pepper. Many of her colleague's students reported checking the online evaluations before selecting courses, and those predeterminations affected not only enrollment numbers in her classes, but also eventual student satisfaction. If personnel committees take student feedback seriously in deciding individual review and promotion cases, then the absurd little chili peppers actually might influence her long-term professional prospects--including her case for tenure. In this article, the author describes the Bringing Theory to Practice project, an effort to advance engaged student learning and determine how it might improve the quality of students' education, development, health, and commitment to civic engagement. The project is exceptional in its recognition that the rupture between students' curricular and co-curricular lives is mirrored--if not encouraged--by the analogous ruptures experienced by today's faculty members. It begins with the recognition that there is a mutually constitutive relationship between students and professors--the fracturing of the \"whole student\" mimics the fracturing of the whole professor, and vice versa. The project assumes that for students to flourish, faculty also must flourish. Students and faculty must join together in building institutions dedicated to an expansive vision of collective advancement. What role those cartoon chili peppers will play in that vision remains to be seen.",

        "description":"In this article, the author shares her perspectives on the Bringing Theory to Practice project and liberal education. The Bringing Theory to Practice project has developed strategies and support for the necessary research and for initiatives individual campuses have proposed to affect the multiple and troubling increases in forms of student disengagement. Association of American Colleges and Universities' (AAC&U) partnership with the project has emphasized liberal education's commitment to understanding and strengthening the context in which students learn--including the complex relationships among the multiple aspects of a student's development and the structures and mission of liberal arts and sciences institutions. The partnership has come to reflect the promise of AAC&U's ongoing campaign, Liberal Education and America's Promise (LEAP), which seeks to advance liberal education for the twenty-first century. The Bringing Theory to Practice project is not only about justifying contributive aspects of a possible strategy for addressing the increasing number of disengaged students, it is equally about the core purposes of colleges. The project asks educators to reexamine what has become on many of their campuses the primary agenda--for that agenda appears to have less and less to do with students. In similar ways, LEAP is not simply about presenting liberal education to wider audiences, or finding preferable language to describe it. LEAP is about the effectiveness of liberal education, the need to understand its most useful nature and meaning, and then to encourage its practice and priority in colleges and universities of all sorts.",

In fact, many mathematics departments decided not to compete with other departments for use of the computer laboratory, and shifted to an emphasis on programmable calculators which were cheaper for every student to obtain and easier to carry to wherever they were needed by the class or at home.",

        "description":"For the last three years the author of this paper has been teaching mathematics to a group of students at Year 9 level who have rarely had success in mathematics, particularly in the area of algebra. Most of these students struggle with algebraic concepts and processes and generally have poor retention of any acquired knowledge. For the two years prior to this year the students in the class have struggled with the topic of solving linear equations, using incorrect operations to solve the equations, as well as not recognising the correct order to use the operations. The problems were most evident when students tried to solve equations where the pronumeral appeared on both sides of the equation. A new way of teaching this topic was necessary so that these students could be successful in solving all types of linear equations. According to Stacey, Kendal and Pierce (2002) students using computer algebra systems (CAS) have the opportunity to fulfil their mathematical potential with less computational skill. The technology can be used to support learning and teaching of many different styles, including both teaching emphasising routine procedures, and teaching emphasising understanding.",

        "description":"During the last two decades, obesity rates in the United States have escalated dramatically, and intense media coverage of obesity issues has fueled consumer interest in low-carbohydrate diets designed to promote rapid weight loss. The food industry has fostered the assumption that a drop in carbohydrate consumption will translate into a drop in weight. Studies of low-carbohydrate dieters, however, have indicated that weight loss is due primarily to calorie reduction rather than carbohydrate restriction. When lowfat foods were heavily promoted, dieters assumed consumption of reduced-fat or fat-free foods would result in weight loss, unaware that calorie consumption could increase even if fat intake was reduced. This pattern is likely to be repeated if escalating consumption of low-carbohydrate foods translates into increased calorie intake. Once polarized, low-fat and low-carbohydrate advocates, as well as health professionals, have moved toward agreement on a number of critical points designed to promote weight loss as well as to prevent chronic disease. These groups recommend a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dary products, lean meats, poultry, and fish. Despite this congruence, the weight loss industry aggressively continues to market new diets, products, and services. Ironically, as the diet business becomes more profitable, obesity rates continue to climb in the United States.",

Focus group discussions were based on four primary research questions: (1) What is sexual coercion? (2) How common is sexual coercion? (3) What causes it? (4) How can it be prevented? Content analysis was used to extract and report themes that emerged from the focus group interviews. Participants denounced physical coercion as rape and only addressed verbal forms of coercion in their discussions. Participants viewed verbal sexual coercion as a normative behavior often referred to it as \"running the game.\" They acknowledged the reciprocal nature of coercion as well as the fact that women use it and experience it as much as men. Poor communication skills were identified as a potential cause of sexual coercion. Because of this, college health and university housing personnel, along with health educators, need to focus their efforts on helping students improve sexual communications skills.",

Health education undergraduate students at ISU were found to have shortcomings in critical thinking dispositions during a study from 2000-2003. Dispositions (e.g. truthseeking, open-mindedness, inquisitiveness) were measured by the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory (CCTDI). Health education majors (n=96) were compared to students in other health science disciplines (n=187) and to health education minors (n=48). CCTDI scores did not differ between health education majors and other health sciences students but scores for majors were significantly higher than for health education minors. Specifically, health education majors scored significantly higher for inquisitiveness, cognitive maturity and total critical thinking disposition. The findings have significant implications for health education academic programs and the profession.

        "description":"The Dietary Guidelines for Americans [Dietary Guidelines] provides science-based advice to promote health and to reduce risk for major chronic diseases through diet and physical activity. Major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States are related to poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. Some specific diseases linked to poor diet and physical inactivity include cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and certain cancers. Furthermore, poor diet and physical inactivity, resulting in an energy imbalance (more calories consumed than expended), are the most important factors contributing to the increase in overweight and obesity in this country. Combined with physical activity, following a diet that does not provide excess calories according to the recommendations in this document should enhance the health of most individuals. The intent of the Dietary Guidelines is to summarize and synthesize knowledge regarding individual nutrients and food components into recommendations for a pattern of eating that can be adopted by the public. In this publication, Key Recommendations are grouped under nine inter-related focus areas. The recommendations are based on the preponderance of scientific evidence for lowering risk of chronic disease and promoting health. It is important to remember that these are integrated messages that should be implemented as a whole. Taken together, they encourage most Americans to eat fewer calories, be more active, and make wiser food choices.",

This was important for keeping track of food supplies, sending messages, trading between villages and even keeping track of how many animals were in their herd. Counting was done in various ways, but in all cases, the underlying principle was one-to-one correspondence. This correspondence between the objects being counted and their counting aid, enabled primitive man to make the first important steps towards an abstract counting system. Over time, and at varying places around the world different methods for counting arose. This document analyzes a survey of counting aids such as collections of pebbles, tally sticks and knotted strings, the use of the hand as a way of representing numbers, and counting with other parts of the body.",

However, when numbers less than one are concerned, base 10 provides friendly decimals for the most common fractions of half, quarter, three-quarters. Base 5 is not user friendly at all in this regard. Base 12 would provide nice dozenimals(?) for the same fractions, but not for the commonly used tenths or fifths. Of course, it may be that the reason these are the commonly used fractions is that they do match base 10 so well. However, the conclusion drawn here is that the wisdom of the mathematicians like Lagrange and Laplace, even when compelled to oppose political forces, is vindicated and we have, for practical purposes, a number system which stands up strongly to scrutiny.",

In his book, Euclid states five postulates of geometry which he uses as the foundation for all his proofs. It is from these postulates we get the term Euclidean geometry, for in these Euclid strove to define what constitutes \"flat-surface\" geometry. These postulates are: (1) [It is possible] to draw a straight line from any point to any other; (2) [It is possible] to produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line; (3) [It is possible] to describe a circle with any centre and distance [radius]; (4) That all right angles are equal to each other; and (5) That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than the two right angles.",

Those who indulge in mathematical problems involving weights should know the difference. Mass is often defined as the amount of matter in an object. This usually means the sum of the masses of all the atoms that constitute that particular object, but we would then have to define the mass of an atom. We shall not delve too deeply into this, but should note that the mass of an object remains the same no matter where it is in the universe. Weight, on the other hand, is the force exerted when a mass is acted on by the gravitational attraction of its environment. For objects near the earth's surface, the major gravitational pull is due to the earth, although the sun, moon and planets have a small effect (the moon affects the tides, for example).",

These are strategies that are easy to introduce to students and that allow students to grapple with the complexities of multivariate data. In particular, the author highlights the mean as a statistic that allows students to make comparisons across groups. The discussion also highlights an even more important issue: the need to help students to understand that the purpose and power of statistics is for answering questions using data and that answering questions also means convincing others of the validity of the answers found. The techniques described here, and the more sophisticated ones learned later in students' statistical education, allow us to find answers in data, and provide evidence for others of the trends that we observe. If students do not appreciate this purpose, then there is no motivation to carry out data exploration or to go through the data representation process with the intention of conveying a convincing message.",

The focus of this study is to provide information addressing this void for guiding the decision making of graduate faculty. More specifically, this study examines the utility of reference information for the selection of doctoral candidates from several perspectives. Most importantly, this study focuses on \"real\" as opposed to simulated selection practices by examining historical data used to make actual admission decisions.",

Three variables were used: (1) comfort level with technology, (2) frequency of technology use, and (3) efficacy. The project evaluation showed positive pre-test/post-test gains on all three variables with statistically significant differences for comfort and frequency of use. Follow-up studies compared TCs as first-year teachers and first-year alternative certification teachers (ACTs), who did not participate in the technology training. TCs average scores were more positive than ACTs with a significant difference for teaching efficacy and number of hours students use technology.",

        "description":"This study, assumes the significance of socioeconomic status (SES) or input factors in explaining achievement, and considers the impact of other &quot;process&quot; variables, that is, factors over which schools have some control. Using the Texas Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS) data, it examines these variables to determine the elements that can impact success or failure of public school campuses. The measure of performance is the standardized test given in 2001 to students in Texas public schools, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS). Study is focused on Texas schools that are predominantly populated by students who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. From this pool of poor school campuses, two groups of very &quot;high-performing&quot; and very &quot;poor-performing&quot; school campuses were selected. The central question of this study is to discover what factors contribute to the success of some and failure of other schools. It does not acknowledge that factors that affect student achievement at the primary school level may not necessarily increase performance at the secondary level. Thus this study compares primary and  secondary schools. This study addresses an important niche for educators in economically disadvantaged schools that are facing greater pressure to improve performance on standardized tests and to reduce the gap between poorer students and those from more affluent backgrounds. Further studies are crucial if reformers are going to influence the debate about the use of resources in an educational system with even greater pressures for accountability.",

Oral and written expressions about their pedagogy provide substantive insight to their thoughts and actions regarding teacher efficacy. The novices express a less than confident position regarding their teaching experiences, and portray themselves challenged by discipline issues that overshadow instruction. This position is confounded by supplemental evidence about their perspective, as measured on select teacher efficacy items, which indicate they are confident in reaching and teaching even the difficult student. On the scales, the novice teachers express confidence in their teaching efficacy, while oral and written expressions convey something else.

Because of this growing movement to expand and include statistics into all levels of education, there is also a considerable interest in how to teach statistics. For statistics concepts that tend to be very difficult or abstract, many researchers have recommended using computer simulation methods (CSMs), but there have been very few empirically and theoretically based studies related to student achievement using these methods. The purpose of this study was to determine whether using CSMs enhanced student understanding of abstract statistics concepts for students  enrolled in an introductory course. Based on a theoretical framework of how students learn statistics, the preliminary results of this study indicate some evidence that these methods may improve student understanding of abstract statistics concepts.",

The purpose of the Curriculum Articulation Project has been to work with educators in the state of Wisconsin to move toward a well-articulated educational system that provides students a seamless transition between secondary and post-secondary institutions. The working groups found that it is not the curriculum, but that student's expectations, the expectations of their teachers, and the expectations of their professors appear to be misaligned. While curricular alignment addresses performance and achievement in terms of content, it was found that study skills, family and friend support, advisement and personal responsibility also play a crucial role in the success of the student. Additionally, for any effort designed to improve student success, we must look at not only the curricula and students, we must also address the role of the administrators and teaching faculty involved in the process. A follow-up study based on criteria previously identified as misaligned was conducted and the results reported. Recommendations for more successful evaluation of curriculum articulation are offered by the authors.",

In which types of staff development activities have teachers participated during the past two years? How are staff development activities planned? Who comprises the planning committee for staff development? What types of planned evaluation of staff development activities are utilized? How much input do teachers feel they have in planning, and implementing staff development activities? The analysis of the data suggested that well organized meetings that are short and to the point with practical information that teachers can take to their classrooms are among the staff development practices that teachers prefer.

Group time is often a teacher's first \"formal\" introduction to the children, and a time when a teacher sets the stage for creating a sense of community. By demonstrating a teacher's loving acceptance for all children's backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints, he or she can create a group-time environment that says, \"All are welcome here.\" With a focus on helping children develop skills in collaboration, responsibility, and self-regulation, one's back-to-school group time can be the place where it all starts.

Many features seen by students as positive were the same features deemed undesirable by other students. In general, teachers were more amenable to the changes than were students. Nearly all participants expressed serious concern about the effect of the new code on current students and on adult braille readers. Issues were raised about the feasibility of instituting the new code as well, and about how closely braille needs to be wedded to print. With many constituents opposed to altering the braille code, this research explores questions associated with the controversy over instituting the proposed changes.",

It is important that students with visual impairment are given the option to use one or the other method with each new skill, since they may have a preference for one or the other method at all times or for different skills (Lieberman, 2005). It is imperative that the issues of personal space, fear of liability, and lack of one-to-one instruction are anticipated and overcome by instructors to ensure that students who are blind have the opportunity to clearly understand and learn the new skill. It is only when instructions are clear and high expectations of the performance of skills are clarified that students who are blind will improve their performance and increase their physical activity. This report describes the teaching techniques of physical guidance and tactile modeling, which are two important teaching techniques to improve the performance of motor skills by students who are blind.",

Specifically, participants noted the usefulness of DAISY technology with regard to educational and work-related materials, as it allows students and working-age adults to move more easily within a textbook or reference manual, and gives them the option of placing bookmarks throughout a document. Participants saw advantages, as well, in the fact that more than one book can be recorded onto a single CD, and in the digital media's superior navigation and sound quality when compared to analog cassettes.

        "description":"Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) requires that independent living programs annually report demographic information on consumers receiving services and the numbers receiving specific types of services. Although some states collect information on consumer outcomes (for example, improvement in daily living skills), RSA does not request such data. After being vacant for the last three years, the RSA independent living program manager position has been filled as of July 2006. It is expected that a major priority of the new manager will be the development of program goals and performance measures that can be used to demonstrate program effectiveness. In the current political climate, where disability-specific programs continue to be at risk, survival of programs serving blind and visually impaired consumers may depend on the initiative and rigor of administrators in demonstrating that their programs are effective. Thus, the present study focuses on improvement of measurement quality and consideration of additional methodological approaches to evaluation of national services to persons who are blind or visually impaired. A secondary purpose of this study is to demonstrate how CSA can contribute substantively to the examination of relationships among measured constructs, specifically program effectiveness: how improvements in blindness and low-vision rehabilitation skills can positively affect other activities of daily living (ADL) related to functioning and satisfaction, and implied by general rehabilitation theory.

        "description":"Students with multiple disabilities, such as severe to profound mental retardation combined with motor and visual impairment, are usually unable to engage in constructive activity or play a positive role in their daily context. Microswitches are technical tools that may help them improve their status by allowing them to control environmental events with small and simple responses suitable to their condition. Recently, a pilot study was conducted to assess such a program with a boy who had multiple disabilities, including total blindness and minimal motor behavior. The results were encouraging, in that the boy became quite active and chose stimuli he was expected to prefer and bypassed those he was not, thus exhibiting purposeful choice behavior. The present study reported in this paper served as a replication and extension of the pilot study, with two new students who had multiple disabilities. These students relied on a vocalization response to activate the microswitch as opposed to the eyebrow movements used in the pilot study. A computer system was used to handle sets of expected preferred and nonpreferred stimuli: it presented brief samples of the stimuli and eventually turned them on for longer periods of time if students selected them. The results of this study found encouraging evidence for the possibility of using specifically developed microswitch programs to enable individuals with minimal residual vision, limited motor behavior, and circumscribed intellectual ability to choose among environmental stimuli. Further research may help determine the generalizability of these results and assess ways of integrating different microswitch programs into the daily educational schedule of such individuals.",

This study began as a master's thesis in a university rehabilitation program; in 2004, the results were concisely presented at a conference in Asia (Sukontharungsee, 2005). The research activities were overseen by a committee of six professors, emeritus professors, and advisers. The critical role of defining and beginning to understand the prevalence and needs of people with disabilities, especially those who are deaf-blind, is vital to the establishment of services in Thailand. By reporting on the census and surveys conducted with individuals who are deaf-blind and their significant relatives, the authors hope that a nascent picture will emerge to assist in planning for appropriate programs and services in Thailand, which appears to be poised to expand and improve services for people with disabilities. Problems that were highlighted by the research include the lack of interpreters and other rehabilitation personnel, such as social workers, counselors, and others who are knowledgeable about deaf-blindness; more positive societal attitudes; and increased training and availability of teachers and educational programs.  Also notable was the lack of the perceived need for advanced technology.",

        "description":"In the tradition of peer review, the members of a profession form with society an unwritten contract whereby society grants the profession autonomy to govern itself and, in return, the members of the profession agree to meet correlative personal and collegial group duties to society. The members of the profession agree to restrain self-interest to some degree in order to serve the public purpose of the profession (knowledge creation and dissemination, in the case of the academic profession), to promote the ideals and core values of the profession, and to maintain high standards of minimum performance. This article discusses the \"social contract\" in the context of the academic profession, which embodies the concepts of professional autonomy, academic freedom and the central role of peer review with respect to academic freedom. \"Faculty professionalism\" defines the ethical duties required by the social contract for each professor as well as for the relevant groups of professional peers. The author describes six principles of faculty professionalism that capture the correlative duties of academic freedom, including a faculty member's contributions to peer review and shared governance, and warns that the failure of the academic profession to renew the social contract in each generation through intentional socialization on faculty professionalism will eventually lead to loss of professional autonomy.

        "description":"In this article, the author claims that the steady corporatization of American higher education has threatened to relegate faculty governance, never strong, to the historical archive. In public institutions, faculty disempowerment has been codified by law--legislatures, the governor or county executive or their staff, or state boards of higher education reserve all rights, except those that have been attained by academic unions. The relative powerlessness of most faculty senates and the independence of unions suggest that the time may be propitious to raise the possibility that, if unions choose to become involved in governance issues, there is a chance to reverse the long-term trend toward faculty disempowerment.",

        "description":"Mid-career faculty are the keystone of the academic enterprise. They fill essential instructional, program development, administrative, and citizenship roles at their institutions. They form a bridge between faculty generations by mentoring new colleagues and assuming leadership duties as their senior colleagues move toward retirement. Mid-career faculty are key players as their institutions adapt in a time of continuous change. They can be either allies or stubborn opponents as their institutions adjust to competitive pressures, revise programs to meet the needs of increasingly diverse students, and integrate new educational technologies. This article examines strategies that several progressive higher education institutions are using to support and gain maximum benefit from their mid-career faculty members. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"The present period is characterized by an unprecedented degree of global integration at the economic, political, and cultural levels. Economically, this has created a situation in which only creative problem solvers and innovators will be able to compete globally. On the other hand, liberal education remains more important than ever at these times. As such, individuals with strong quantitative and linguistic skills and the ability to analyze and solve problems are fundamental to economic competitiveness. In this article, the author examines how colleges and universities provide an education that is both rigorous and accessible, and that helps students understand the liberal arts tradition and the larger global context in which they will live and work. The author also argues for an alternative, question-based approach to liberal education. Situating liberal education in historical context, the author traces how liberal education has evolved and shows how the earliest organization of liberal education--the \"quaestio\" form, a question-centered approach used in medieval European universities--remains the best. He also provides some practical suggestions for restoring this approach.",

This confusion over what is liberal and what is professional, over what is a liberal arts college and what is not, provides an interesting backdrop to the question about the conflation of liberal and professional education. Progress has been made in bringing liberal arts and professional programs together, although the professions have reached farther across the aisle to bridge the old divisions.

The program, Project Aspire, attempts to increase the number of these children in the most rigorous math and science coursework available in their schools. To that end, Project Aspire assists 14 school corporations by helping faculty in those settings increase the level of rigor of their courses and by offering Advanced Placement (AP) courses through multiple platforms of distance education technologies. A primary component of the project is the attempt to assist the school counselors' work with their students, in hopes that the students' lives will be improved. To prepare the counselors, ongoing training has been provided. This paper reports an analysis of the ideas and experiences shared during the lengthy training sessions with 21 school counselors. From the analysis and a literature review, the authors offer in three tables concise information for effectively working with high-ability middle and high school students living in rural poverty.

In professional mathematics, &quot;creative&quot; mathematicians constitute a very small subset within the field. At this level, mathematical giftedness does not necessarily imply mathematical creativity but the converse is certainly true. In the domain of mathematics, are the words creativity and giftedness synonyms? In this article, the constructs of mathematical creativity and mathematical giftedness are developed via a synthesis and analysis of the general literature on creativity and giftedness. The notions of creativity and giftedness at the K-12 and professional levels are compared and contrasted to develop principles and models that theoretically &quot;maximize&quot; the compatibility of these constructs. The relevance of these models is discussed with practical considerations for the classroom. The paper also significantly extends ideas presented by Usiskin (2000).

Relative to their peers in general education, gifted and high-achieving students served in the school's International Baccalaureate (IB) program reported more positive perceptions of  school climate, had higher grade point averages and academic self-efficacy, and reported less externalizing psychopathology and affiliation with negative peers. IB and general education students reported comparable levels of global life satisfaction and internalizing symptoms of psychopathology. The psychosocial adjustment of intellectually gifted students within the IB program was similar to that of their high-achieving IB peers on all indicators except satisfaction with friends.

        "description":"In order to respond to the growing academic diversity in classrooms, teachers must recognize that their students have different needs and commit to differentiating instruction accordingly; however, the relationship between teachers' willingness and ability to differentiate instruction and principals' attitudes toward differentiation is unknown. In this qualitative study, the principals and faculty at three schools were interviewed and observed over the course of 3 years. The results suggested that principals played a key role in teachers' willingness and ability to differentiate instruction. Principals successful in  encouraging teachers to differentiate exhibited the critical support, desire for change, belief that change was possible, and long-term vision of implementation that teachers required in order to effectively differentiate in their classrooms.

At this time, graduates of the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program from two public schools in a large city in British Columbia, Canada, were asked to respond to 20 statements on a 4-point Likert-type scale, and to 7 open-ended questions. Graduates from the years 1996 and 2000 were selected. At the time of this survey, many of the graduates of 2000 were just finishing their undergraduate postsecondary programs, and the graduates of 1996 were settling into their chosen careers. Both groups were in a position to reflect on their experiences while they were in the program, and also to analyze the benefits of IB, if any, that they experienced during their postsecondary studies. Overall, graduates reported positive experiences in the program. They felt that the rich curriculum to which they were exposed, and the critical thinking and time management skills that they developed, were well worth the extra effort required to earn an IB diploma. Furthermore, they felt that the IB experience prepared them well for postsecondary studies. (Contains 20 tables.)",

One program model, the Governor's School, warrants particular attention because of its mission to provide an accelerated and enriched curriculum and a positive social environment in a seasonal residential program. To date, few well-designed studies directly assess the effect of attending a Governor's School on participants' social and emotional well-being. In order to provide a context for an in-depth examination of 8 studies conducted between 1965 and 1991 on participants in Governor's Schools in the Southeast, this review of literature begins with 2 landmark studies conducted on participants in summer residential programs between 1984 and 1993. Significant and tangential findings from all of these studies show that participation in summer residential programs has positive effects on students; the most significant effect is the formation of strong friendship bonds and support networks among program participants. However, the extent of supportive evidence is minimal due to  limitations of the research designs, and a considerable lack of current research. Gaps in the literature reviewed are discussed, and suggestions for future research are presented.",

First, an endowment may be emergenic. That is, a gift may consist of multiple traits (multidimensional) that are inherited in a multiplicative (configurational), rather than an additive (simple) fashion. Second, the endowment may not appear all at once but, rather, will more likely unfold via an epigenetic process. These 2 complications have consequences regarding such aspects of giftedness as the likelihood of early signs, the appearance of early versus late bloomers, the distribution of giftedness in the general population, and the stability and continuity of gifts over the course of childhood and adolescence. These complexities lead to a 4-fold typology of giftedness that has important practical implications. (Contains 1 table.)",

Aptitude refers to the degree of readiness to learn and to perform well in a particular situation or domain. The primary aptitudes for academic success are (a) prior achievement in a domain, (b) the ability to reason in the symbol systems used to communicate new knowledge in that domain, (c) interest in the domain, and (d) persistence in the type of learning environments offered for the attainment of expertise in the domain. Careful attention to the demands and affordances of different instructional environments enables educators to identify those individuals who are most ready to succeed in them. Although the principles discussed here are useful for all students, they are particularly important for the identification of academically promising minority students.

I argue that this research is relevant to more general discussions of talent. First, it provides a special opportunity to deconstruct talent in different domains. Because savants typically lack the general intellectual skills usually present in those with more domain-restricted achievement, this analysis helps to delineate both the core components of talent in those domains and how more general skills affect the expression and development of that talent. Second, savants often have disabilities that can modify the direction of development in unusual ways. Examining these conditions suggests new ways of thinking about how talent may be nurtured.

        "description":"This study examined the structure of social coping across 2 age groups of 716 Chinese gifted children and youths based on 7 social coping strategies assessed by the Chinese Social Coping Questionnaire. To evaluate whether these strategies could be applied adequately to younger as well as older students, 3 models hypothesizing different degrees of equivalence across the 2 age groups were tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Despite the similarities, there was suggestive evidence that the 7 social coping strategies might correlate differentially and to various degrees with each other for the two different age groups. Subsequent second-order confirmatory factor analyses separately conducted for the 2 age groups indicated that 2 overall strategies of social-interaction coping and minimizing-differences coping between self and peers encompassed the 7 specific social coping strategies. Implications of the findings, including subtle differences in the interpretation of discounting popularity by older and younger students, are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

Teachers (N = 334) from 31 secondary schools gave their opinion about gifted education and acceleration, and evaluated statements about accelerated students. Most teachers considered a special approach for gifted students advisable and acceleration a useful intervention. Teachers' opinions about accelerated students' social competence, school motivation and achievement, emotional problems, and isolation were qualified by the quantity and quality of prior experience with accelerated students and by their opinion on acceleration in gifted education. In a subsequent intervention study, we examined whether specific information on acceleration and giftedness changes teachers' attitudes toward accelerated students. Teachers who attended the information meeting and received written information expressed more positive opinions about accelerated students' social competence and school achievement and motivation and less negative opinions about emotional problems after intervention. Implications for gifted child education are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 6 endnotes.)",

Findings centering around 3 themes suggested that the children's experience was constrained by the presentation of mathematics as a discipline focused on calculation and bound by rules. Students' view of mathematics was further limited by a narrow conception of its usefulness. The study found, however, that the children received support for mathematics learning from their families and from the teacher of the gifted. Notably, instruction provided in the gifted program was reported as being more advanced, more challenging, and more engaging than what was offered in regular classrooms.

The paper does this in three ways. It paints a polemical picture of gifted education as a minor variation on public schooling and describes the contradictions and limitations this entails. It presents a short history of education in the United States to support the claim that compulsory schooling aims to shape the character of children in the interests of religion, government, corporations, and other groups. It argues that compulsory schooling is inconsistent with the liberal democratic value of the right to self-determination. The paper also offers a conception of education for self-development as one vision of what gifted education could be were it freed from the strictures of compulsory schooling.",

Time perspective was measured using the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI; Zimbardo & Boyd, 1999). Regression analyses yielded several significant results: An increase in age was associated with present hedonism, females had fewer negative thoughts about the future than males, and academic achievement was negatively associated with present fatalistic attitudes and positively associated with future positive attitudes. Findings support the examination of time perspective as a multidimensional construct including past, present, and future orientations in academically talented populations.

Based upon the results of data analyses using the National Household Education Survey (NHES: 93), social-interaction skills were reported as being more important for kindergarten readiness than were academic skills. In order to clarify typologies underlying parents' beliefs, we conducted a cluster analysis which revealed three definable groups: &quot;Typical,&quot; &quot;High standards,&quot; and &quot;Low academic emphasis&quot; groups. Other analyses suggested that views of kindergarten readiness varied across demographic characteristics such as age, education, income, and ethnic background. Most interesting was the finding that there is no strong consistency between parents' beliefs and their activities with their children at home. Implications for policy and suggestions for future research were also discussed. (Contains 4 tables.)",

However, many have questioned the validity of the tests and the value of each rater. While some research has found differences among raters, few had looked at samples of non-referred children. We wanted to study \"normal\" children, and we hypothesized finding no significant difference between the two raters. In our study, we administered the Clinical Assessment of Behavior to teachers and parents of students ranging from six to eighteen years old. When comparing these ratings, we found, as hypothesized, the parent and teacher ratings of children's behavior to possess statistically significant agreement. The only domain with significant disagreement was the externalizing domain. We found several potential causes for these findings consistent with previous research and suggested areas for further research, especially regarding the importance of the various raters for children who have not been clinically referred.

        "description":"In the spring of 2003, a survey was conducted to examine the differences in perceptions of academic rigor and engagement between faculty and undergraduate students at a small, liberal arts university in the Midwest. Although a sample bias in the student responses (students with higher GPAs had a higher tendency to respond) precluded a number of direct comparisons, a number of key inferences could be drawn. Faculty respondents correctly estimated the number of hours students spend studying outside of the classroom, and did not find this level of effort sufficient to obtain grades of A or B, while the student respondents achieving these grades with the level of effort predicted by faculty felt that their courses were reasonably challenging, and did not feel burdened with assigned out-of-class work. Although faculty respondents appear to recognize that a discrepancy between expected effort and grade assignments exists, they did not feel that they were apart of the problem. It would appear that in this instance, the greatest impediment to modifying grading practices to meet with stated expectations of effort will not be making faculty aware that a problem exists, but rather convincing faculty that they might be contributing to the problem.

        "description":"In the past, attempts to explain the disparity in academic achievement between advantaged and disadvantaged students have generally focused on the ability, aptitude and motivation of the youth themselves. Some theorists have even suggested that heritable differences in intelligence among students from different social origins may account for this disparity. These presumptions significantly limit the possibility that schooling can substantially reduce the existing academic inequalities that exist between students of different social origins. This paper rejects these simplistic solutions and investigates the effects of one learning style instructional resource--the Programmed Learning Sequence (PLS) on the social studies achievement and ability of a group of Bermudian seventh graders. It suggests that educational structures operating within the school may be at least partially responsible for the academic achievement of students. Further, it suggests that a school structure that employs tracking, the grouping of students by ability, may help to create a social construction of failure, especially for disadvantaged children. Finally, it suggests that one alternative to tracking, the programmed learning sequence [PLS], may provide an effective alternative. Accordingly, it is predicted that the fault lies less with the socio-cultural makeup of the student than with the educational structures and policies operating within the schools.

        "description":"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a degenerative disease of the retina that causes the severe impairment of visual functioning similar to low vision, leading, in many cases, to blindness. Because the construct of self-concept plays a key role in personality, this study was designed to measure self-concept in a group of young adults with RP. The participants were 45 Caucasian adults aged 19-35, who were studied in two groups: 22 people with RP and some residual vision who had no other impairments and had been diagnosed with RP at least three years before the study, and 23 with no known visual impairment. The participants were matched for age, level of education, marital status, and gender. The Tennessee Self-Concept Scale which consists of 100 self-descriptive items that are classified in five subscales that evaluate specific components of self-concept: personal, family, moral-ethical, social, and physical self was used. The data for both groups were compared with an appropriate t-test for differences of the means for independent groups depending on homoscedasticity. Mean scores and standard deviations were calculated for each self-concept subscale for the two groups. Results showed that participants with RP scored significantly lower on the family self-concept subscale, but no significant differences were found in the moral-ethical; physical; personal; or social self-concept subscales. The lower scores for family self-concept indicated that the participants with RP rated themselves poorly as members of their families, were unsatisfied with their family members, or showed signs of not feeling well loved by others in their immediate family circle. This finding points to the need for intervention programs to help people with RP and their families to improve their personal well-being and the quality of their communication and relationships. Because of the limitations this study had, additional studies are recommended to confirm the findings.",

        "description":"Most of the studies of the causes of visual impairment have been population-based studies. These population-based studies provide important information on the incidence and prevalence of &quot;theoretical&quot; eye problems in a community. However, not all those who are visually impaired, from a theoretical point of view, consider themselves as such and hence will not visit an ophthalmologist or accept the offer of low vision counseling. Others are unaware of the possibilities of rehabilitation or are not able to come to these clinics because of health problems, mental difficulties, or other reasons (Munoz et al., 1999). This discrepancy between population-based studies and daily practice makes it difficult to develop strategies to offer low vision services to those who need them. In addition, little is known about the changes in patterns of visual impairment over time. Therefore, there is still a place for hospital-based or patient-based studies of the incidence and etiology of visual impairment. The aim of this study was to determine changes, over time, in the incidence and etiology of visual impairment in persons aged 50 and older who visited an eye clinic for an incurable age-related eye disease and who accepted an offer of rehabilitation. The participants were all the patients of the Department of Ophthalmology of the Elkerliek Hospital, Helmond, the Netherlands.",

        "description":"In spite of the ongoing discussion and emphasis on student voice, talk curriculum, and small group discussion (Barnitz 1994; Johnson & Johnson 1994; Barnes & Todd 1995; Johnston & Nicholls 1995; Johnson & Johnson 2000), most classroom language/discourse strategies remain rooted in Socratic premises. That is to say, official classroom discourse still tends to focus on the individual presentation and recitation of knowledge, as opposed to its shared exploration and examination. By disconnecting thinking from talking, Socratic-based language activities or strategies treat reasoning and language as objective and exclusive. While Socratic-based language activities present certain advantages when used as independent strategies, the authors of this article propose that the overwhelming effect of their exclusive use in the classroom is to discourage students from taking a more active and independent part in classroom discourse. The implication of this lack of serious participation, to their futures as adult members of a democratic society, is that students learn to let others examine issues, and make decisions on these, for them. In this essay, the authors describe five of the most common of these Socratic-based discourse strategies, namely: (1) socratic method; (2) radial discussion; (3) presentation/lecture; (4) debate; and (5) unstructured conversation. They offer an alternative discourse model, the Deliberative Cycle, outline the five components of this Cycle, and show how these components can help teachers facilitate a more open ended and shared discourse.

        "author":["Thayer-Bacon, Barbara J."],
        "description":"Highlander Folk School is an adult education center located in eastern Tennessee that was formed in 1932 by Myles Horton and continues today. Myles Horton (1905-1990) hoped to create an independent adult learning center where people could come together and address their problems. He wanted to create a public space where people could learn from each other and use education as a means to challenge the unjust social systems affecting their lives. Highlander was built on principles of democracy; however, Horton resisted definitively defining democracy throughout his lifetime. In The Long Haul, he tells us people get angry with him for not carefully defining what he means by democracy, but he says, \"I've never been able to define democracy. ... it's a growing idea.\" Horton began Highlander Folk School by relying on Dewey's concept of a democratic society as \"a society which makes provisions or participation in its good of all its members on equal terms and which secures flexible readjustment of its institutions through interaction of the different forms of associated life.\" A democratic society is one with shared interests and fullness and freedom of interaction within the group as well as with other groups. In this article, the author revisits the legacy of Myles Horton in creating a school where \"people could learn from each other and use education as a means to challenge the unjust social system affecting their lives.\" She interrogates both the practices undertaken at the Highlander Folk School and the \"theoretical implications their practice has to teach one about a relational, pluralistic democratic theory.\" She ends with a number of recommendations for public schools that might make them more democratic social institutions.

They analyze photographs, and also draw on the history of graphic design to discuss the style of the publications in which they are placed. The pieces that they analyze are historical-drawn from the papers of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF). On the most basic level, their study looks at the appearance of individual publicity pieces (their style, layout, and the correspondence of text and image) and compares them to other materials available at the time, including publications from both the black and white worlds. It gleans several themes, including attitude toward social integration; the curriculum and needs of the black college; and idealization, loyalty, and patriotism. Finally, the study compares these messages to the desired goals of the UNCF--in particular, the need to appeal to black leadership, black alumni, and white donors. It situates the UNCF's overall approach within the history of post-War and Cold War politics. As well as adding to  their understanding of the role of publicity in higher education, this paper uncovers an African American perspective on the history of graphic design.

        "description":"It is often noted that the vast majority of students in pre-service teacher preparation programs may be poorly equipped to teach in urban schools because, in great part, they are disproportionately White, female and middle-class (Darling-Hammond, 1997 and 2001; Delpit, 1995; Sleeter, 2001). Typically, these students arrive at the university with life experiences aggregated from suburban or rural living. Their contact with urban living and people of color is limited at best and frequently non-existent. The majority of students in the teacher education program at Marquette University (Milwaukee, Wisconsin) fit this profile. In this article, the author explores the efficacy of using a Sociology of Knowledge perspective to frame a pre-service teacher education course designed to problematize students taken-for-granted assumptions about schooling and the role of the teacher as a transformative agent. Using data from student journaling, he identifies the ways in which a backstage experience provides students with a different vantage point to critically examine key issues in education, and thus can result is shifts in the taken-for-granted assumptions of pre-service teachers.",

She presents an insightful analysis that interrogates the work of the woman's movement and asks how women sought to shape the school curriculum during what is arguably the major curriculum shift to have taken place in the US: the transition from an emphasis on the liberal arts to a more functional, or useful, curriculum. She notes how the white, middle-class women reformers who led major national organizations during the Progressive era sought to bring the work of childrearing into schools in order to create a better society. She frames her analysis within the work of the PTA and ends by nothing that, with respect to curriculum history, one cannot just add women to the historical narrative without reshaping current interpretations.

He explores the impact of the Progressive Movement on the curriculum of these schools. He notes that when the progressive education fell into disrepute, the practices in the reservation day schools received similar criticism. As a result, by 1950, the federal government began to remove many of the progressive innovations from Native American schools. (Contains 74 notes.)",

        "description":"Over the past decade, numerous shifts in education policy have been proposed and implemented in the attempt to improve educational opportunities for the diverse American population. Some of these changes have been initiated by the federal government's No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2001) via its mix of standards, accountability, and punitive measures. Other changes have occurred at the state and local levels, by restructuring schools and administrative staff. These restructuring initiatives have included movements towards schools that are: small, themed, semi-privatized, and chartered. Both federal and local policy changes have led to intended and unintended consequences for educational stakeholders. In this article, the author seeks to understand how charter policy is actually lived by those who work closest with charter school students.",

        "author":["Urrieta, Luis, Jr."],
        "description":"In this article, the author attempts to enter the charter school dialogue by looking at the new charter school movement through an anti-essentialist social movement and new social movement lens. In the anti-Western new social movement conception there are no set patterns to how movements manifest themselves, or how they were intended to manifest themselves, and local context and activism defined as the agency to act through contentious daily practice is paramount (Holland &amp; Lave, 2001). This article then, theoretically places the intended macro-charter school vision as an essentialist, Western social reform movement in education, but one that has not followed a uniform, easily understood, projected, and coherent model. Its manifestation then, has been that of a new social movement without definite and set patterns of generalizability, focusing on local contexts of activism as daily practice, and exhibiting an abundance of contradictions and paradoxes. Principal amongst the contradictions is that reform is intended to level the playing field, to allow for access, and to ultimately equalize. Although superficially, charter schools have done that, deeper contextual analysis and case studies of charter schools, especially of predominantly White charter schools, reveal differing results. This article focuses on the case of Heritage Charter School (HCS), a predominantly White, rural community charter school. Using the &quot;community school&quot; and &quot;school of choice&quot; rhetoric, members of the Heritage community have managed to keep a predominantly White elementary school open for over one hundred years, even when the Local Education Agency (LEA) closed down their redbrick school building in an effort to consolidate. In effect through the postmodern lens, HCS is and is not a converter charter school. A converter charter school is usually allowed to continue using the old school building by the new charter school. In that sense HCS is not a converter charter school because the LEA refused to let the new school use the old buildings; community members, however, use the rhetoric of heritage to say it is still the same school. Local community activism through contentious daily practices created a new site for the school using the new charter school reform and the claim to &quot;community&quot; school identity.

Forth Academy is a charter school operated by a private company that uses market-based and consumer-driven methods to advance a particular vision and curriculum. Forth Academy's version of reform espouses rigorous academics through a return to the basics, a strong moral focus, high parent involvement, and accountability for all. In true market fashion, Forth Academy promises parents--the primary consumer--to deliver a product that results in students' high academic achievement. Operating a number of charter schools in several states, Forth's parent company is taking successful advantage of the charter school reform initiative to market a product and realize a profit through the development of charter schools.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to deconstruct the new racist discourse within an urban charter school. The authors focus upon how the new racist discourse relieves Whites, \"of any semblance of social responsibility and commitment\" (Giroux, 1999). As multiculturalism and political correctness are being taught and encouraged in the society to work against inequality, they are simultaneously being used by some Whites, particularly the middle and upper classes, to separate themselves from the \"bad\" Whites, whom are largely framed as the working-class and poor. As a result, a White liberal rhetoric has been developed that talks about \"diversity\" and \"democracy\" but does not address power and current racial inequities. The data presented in this study arise from fieldwork the authors conducted at Eagles Landing Charter School as members of separate evaluation teams and during different, but consecutive, years. The purpose of the evaluations was to examine best practices in charter schools within the State. Weaved within and beyond some of the proposed best practices was the \"new\" racist discourse as described above. As part of the evaluation, between the two authors, approximately 20 hours of classroom observations were conducted. Twenty students, five parents, and fifteen teachers were interviewed as well.

Unfortunately for Kozol, history has not been kind to reformers who have attempted to wrestle control of public schools from bureaucracies that impair school quality. George S. Counts and Ivan Illich are the most outstanding examples of those reformers who have tried and failed to initiate substantive school policy change. Though Counts and Illich come from very different generations and very different geographical regions, their quest to enhance public education shares very similar paths. As a result, their work warrants attention by those interested in the history of education as well those interested in contemporary school policy. Highlighting their careers and failures, the author of this article provides insight to those like Kozol who attempt to modify American public schools.",

In particular, critical pedagogy has functioned as a discourse on schooling and inequality that has developed in tandem with theories of race and pedagogical practice in ways that reflect the context of African-American education.

First, the article addresses critical teaching and learning evident in two generations of one nuanced Black family, the Foresight family, who appear to be surviving and thriving during and after the Freedom of Choice era of rural public schooling. The phrase &quot;nuanced Black family&quot; is intended to reflect the subtle degrees of difference in pedagogic meaning, feeling, tone, and action that may separate one Black family from another. Second, the article delves further to consider their critical teaching and learning at home within the framework of Oppressed Family Pedagogy. It explores a deceiving, and yet distinct political discursive innovation of the Post-Brown era and how one oppressed family is teaching and learning to overcome that deception by cultivating counter discursive efforts at home. The counter discursive narratives of this nuanced Black family exist in ways that could expand the purview of the possibilities of critical pedagogy as approached in the ethnographic work of &quot;Educational Foundations.&quot; (Contains 1 chart and 1 note.)",

Logistic regression revealed that males and students with lower occupational aspirations were more likely to avoid seeking assistance from counsellors for educational planning issues, while males, students with lower educational aspirations, and students with parents who attained higher levels of education were least likely to see counsellors for career planning. These results indicate that it is important to more fully explore student, counsellor, and contextual influences on help-seeking in the career domain, in order to design alternative intervention strategies for individuals who do not seek assistance from their school counsellors.",

        "description":"A study was undertaken to understand the chain of family, school, and employment factors that led a sample of young (18-30) psychoactive substance abusers into precarious employment situations, based on their personal narratives. Substance abuse was measured according to DAST-20 and SMAST scales. Three types of precarious employment trajectories emerged: concentrated precarization in a dynamic of inferiorization, integrated precarization (in either an identification or a parentification dynamic), and unexpected precarization in a dynamic of intensification. A discussion of the results points to the importance of developing an integrated multilevel intervention approach in vocational counselling for this clientele.",

        "description":"In this article, the authors state that the presidents and deans, with the cooperation of the professors, are responsible for the faculty and for the curriculum as a whole. The faculty work within organizations, and every organizational policy and practice, many outside the purview of faculty, has at least potential impact, either positive or negative, on the curriculum and the learning of students. If the curriculum is to have integrity, institutional priorities, policies, and resource allocations must all support the most important purposes of undergraduate education. Indeed, \"integrity in the curriculum requires integrity of the institution.\" This, in turn, means that educational programs should reflect the institutional mission and enjoy the full and informed support not just of the faculty but also of the board of trustees and the president, the primary stewards of the mission. Furthermore, approving a mission statement and then acting in ways that advance the mission, is the fundamental way that the president and the board could establish integrity. The authors also discuss that a mission statement is an institution's formal, public declaration of its purposes and its vision of excellence that contains enough specificity for determining whether alternative educational and institutional practices could advance the mission.",

Access alone is insufficient, however, so this New Academy also is committed to success for all students through proper preparation before college and comprehensive attention to learning in college. With higher expectations aligned across all the levels of learning, students will experience a high-quality college education. To achieve these ambitious commitments, concerted action by the various stakeholder groups will be needed, including across the high school-secondary education boundary. Nonetheless, achieving the \"Greater Expectations\" vision is a long-term endeavor that will require changed practices throughout the higher education enterprise, practices that become more intentional in aligning actions with desired outcomes. Here, the author discusses the implications of this New Academy to institutional leadership and its role in bringing a collective vision of a powerful, relevant education for all college students.  Piloting a ship safely though turbulent waters demands knowledge of the final destination as well as a plan for reaching it. In a parallel manner, clarity of the desired ends is essential to intentional educational practice. Without it, success becomes difficult to determine and choices relatively random.",

        "description":"This article discusses the notion that American Education is at a crossroads, and attempts to answer the question of how liberal learning graduates can be made more competitive in the modern work place. It introduces the idea that the gap between old and new working environments is highlighted by the vast difference in the computing power leveraged by today's employers. Students often sidestep the traditional liberal arts and sciences disciplines for a degree program with greater job security but the author contends that education can challenge this growing trend by mapping new options. The author believes that in order to help these students understand the value of liberal education and to prepare them for more effective \"work-ready\" studies, verifiable clarity in educational goals, plus greater dialogue with employers is needed. The article further suggests that as schools clarify their goals for students, they must forcefully show employers \"how\" liberal arts graduates and specialists with a strong liberal education can and will \"do the job\" in the workplace. How to manage this is the question. Faced with this \"clear and present danger,\" strategies are required that generate lasting results. This surely means curricular change and new relationships with stakeholders who can promote these changes far and wide. Two modest proposals for reform are offered. The author concludes by saying that If liberal education is to remain the nation's premier educational approach, a twist of the thinking cap --among administration, faculty, alumni, and \"risk-averse\" employers is a vital requirement.",

Invoking the unfinished agenda of the Enlightenment, Wilson has called for a rapprochement among the several branches of learning so that they can be viewed as interrelated and constituting a whole. He asks scholars to step back and see the forest instead of their small strand of trees. Such a summons may sound utopian in the light of the knowledge explosion of the twentieth century. Yet at the same time it is a plea for a kind of common sense in everyone's endeavors. In this article, the author shares his experiences as a committed generalist.

The author focuses on developing a personal means of remaining centered regardless of circumstances or situations as well as building an ethical foundation for one's work. He uses spiraling as a metaphor to describe his own personal and professional development. His initial consciousness of this metaphor can be traced to the years between the end of college and the beginning of graduate school, a time of transition for anyone considering a career in academe. To illustrate, the author compares spiraling to climbing a spiral staircase wherein one inevitably returns to the same point on a vertical line but at a higher level. He believes the same is true with one's own life experiences. Occasionally a person returns to a situation that appears familiar but, through one's own progression, he or she now possesses the resources, the memory, and the confidence to propel themselves upward. The author then concludes leaving a challenge--to be cognizant of the glass ceiling, but with the implicit knowledge and understanding that it does not represent an insufferable barrier in one's life.",

        "description":"Senior academic leaders are in consensus that, for purposes of tenure, a candidate's significant contributions to collaborative scholarship should be valued highly. The fundamental issue is how to give due weight and proper consideration for purposes of tenure to the intellectual work and scholarly worth of various kinds of contributions. As a group, academic leaders are not sure how to value such work as being the person who had the initial idea for the collaboration, designing and assuring the integrity of a collaborative research project, serving as the content expert, developing research instruments, writing the first draft, becoming a co-author, or providing statistical and analytical expertise. This article asks the following questions: (1) If those who are experienced in making tenure evaluations and decisions on candidates from a wide range of disciplines are not in accord, how can tenure expectations be discussed in an informed way among colleagues? and (2) How can sound academic leadership be provided? Every provost or president responsible for the final decision knows that some cases are neither a clear yes nor a clear no. At times, a president or chief academic officer must make a final decision that turns on the central issue of this article: how to evaluate in a fair-minded and informed way the quality and merit of scholarly contributions made to collaborative research projects. Faced with this problem, and wanting not to tenure unworthy candidates, some chief academic officers adopt a third approach: demand independent scholarship. For them, the candidate who produces solo-authored publications is the only truly worthy candidate. Fifty-six senior academic administrators responded to the author's invitation to participate in this conversation. To anchor potential responses, a hypothetical case was reviewed, and participant responses revealed that academic leaders are not in accord about where to draw the line between those contributions that are potentially of greater significance and those that are potentially of lesser significance. A list of several different ways individuals could potentially make a \"significant\" contribution to a collaborative scholarly project was provided, and respondents were welcome to endorse as many items from the list as they believed apply. The list could serve as a starting point for campus discussions from which analyses and clarifications could potentially emerge. (Contains 1 table and 6 notes.)",

Results found that, students did not have a working definition of a liberal education and did not spontaneously value the outcomes of such an education. Consequently, students tend to focus on specific course-oriented outcomes; and there is a gap between that focus and the larger consideration of more general skills and capacities that liberal education purports to foster. However, a consortium was held in the fall of 2005, among representatives from fourteen institutional members of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM) meeting at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The consortial project aims to formulate a more ways to engage students, faculty members themselves needed to be engaged beyond their departmental and divisional interests and think deliberately about undergraduate education across the curriculum and throughout the college career. In addition, collaboration within individual campuses may be the most important element in the new liberal arts interchange. Disciplinary courses, traditional departments, and academic divisions have historically defined and sometimes circumscribed academic culture in small colleges, and they will undoubtedly play significant and substantial roles in liberal arts education for the foreseeable future.

        "description":"There are various ways to succeed in recruiting and retaining underrepresented minority (URM) doctoral students; but key to them all is the creation of real student-faculty relationships, which demonstrate by example that diversity and excellence can and should coexist. This cannot be delegated or done indirectly, and no amount of outreach, campus visits, or diversity awareness activities--however well-intentioned--can achieve the effect of positive examples. In this article, the author discusses how the  recruitment and retaining of underrepresented minority (URM) doctoral students at Duke University's BME doctoral program became a success. Through a combination of graduate school, Duke endowment, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) training grant funds contributed to the success of the graduate program. This success could not have been accomplished by an administrator or a staff person alone. It had instead to be advocated at the departmental level by a faculty member with (1) successful and productive URM students in his or her own lab, (2) a vigorous research profile, (3) the respect of the other BME faculty, and (4) control over resources for supporting URM students. Here, the author suggested that majority faculty members need to step forward and enthusiastically mentor minority students, and minority students need to be openly receptive to the mentor-ship offered by majority faculty. The more people see working examples, the more likely it becomes that URM recruitment and retention will succeed.",

        "description":"In many countries there remain substantial sex differences in enrolments in elective science courses, despite concerted efforts in recent years to alleviate them. This paper explores the reasons for these differences by comparing models of male and female enrolment intentions in elective courses in biology, chemistry and physics. The models are based on responses from approximately 450 students from 5 Australian high schools. First, a theoretical model, the Science Enrolment Model, was derived from Eccles and colleagues' General Model of Academic Choice. Students' responses were then used to develop empirical models of enrolment intentions in the three elective courses. Analyses for the models were conducted using the LISREL &quot;mean structures&quot; extension. Sex differences in the dependent variables in the models were then attributed to the relevant sets of independent variables. Substantial sex differences were identified in measures of perceived career value, interest and performance expectations in all three models which explained between 70% and 82% of the sex differences in enrolment intentions.

        "description":"Educational psychology has a tradition of considering learning and motivation in terms of the individual and individual functioning. Short-term intervention studies have been common and quantitative measurement of the causes and effects of variables has been the aim of much research. When a sociocultural approach forms the basis of research into psychological constructs, a reappraisal of the research aims and the ways in which data are gathered and analysed is necessary. If the underlying assumption is that learning and motivation are socially and culturally situated, the design of research studies needs to encompass participation in authentic and purposeful activities. In order to develop a rich sociocultural understanding of these constructs, qualitative research designs become increasingly important. In this article, we consider two current research projects, one focusing upon conceptual change amongst students in a first year university class, and the other a classroom-based qualitative study exploring primary (elementary) students' interest in learning. In each project, data have been collected over time in relation to both social interaction and individual functioning in specific sociocultural contexts. Our frameworks for data collection and approaches to data analysis are discussed in this article, together with some of the issues which we have identified as problematic. In particular we are conscious of the difficulties associated with articulating and describing the nature of social and cultural contexts, especially those with which we are familiar, and of distinguishing their most salient features. We are also critically aware that because our research is situated within very familiar environments, we need to identify and explore our implicit assumptions about those environments and the ways in which our roles as teachers and researchers both coincide and occasionally conflict.",

By contrast, the establishment of school councils in the government school sector has had a much shorter history. In New South Wales, school council members are elected representatives of the broader school community. This study focused on government schools in rural areas of southern New South Wales and specifically examined the professional development and training needs of these school council members. The findings indicated that school council members expressed concern about their inexperience as council members. Further, they identified the following areas within which they should specifically seek professional development and training: (i) identifying and analysing the educational needs of the school and its community; (ii) enhancing and facilitating better communication between the school and its community; (iii) assisting the principal to understand local community politics; and (iv) promoting public education within the local community. These priority training needs have relevance for policy makers and professional development leaders at the systemic or departmental level. (Contains 1 table.)",

Students can benefit from the opportunities for enhanced access to staff provided by factors such as small classes and a compact campus. International students from non-English-speaking backgrounds are one group for whom these factors can be particularly helpful in their adjustment to a new society as well as in their continuing study program. This belief is tested in the study described in this paper. Factors identified by international students as influencing their learning at a small campus situated a considerable distance from the state capital indicate strengths to be built on and celebrated and areas that call for the development of strategies to improve the quality of that learning environment. Former international student graduates were surveyed concerning their perceptions of their regional Australian university experience and the professional preparation it provided. Other Australian higher education institutions, particularly those with regional campuses, can make use of the insights gained through the study: as well as having implications for the provision of a quality learning experience and environment for all students, not only international students, they also have a bearing on international marketing strategies.",

        "description":"This article draws on the transcripts of focus group interviews held with three groups of students, all in their final year of four-year Bachelor degrees. All had completed the professional experience requirements for their course. One group comprised education students, one group comprised nursing students, and the third was studying engineering. All were studying at the same university. Common across all three professional areas, the new entrants' experiences appear physically, psychologically, and emotionally, confronting. In addition, it seems that the power relations that structure workplace practices (including the performance assessment regimes in place in many workplaces) often structure the student-practitioner's behaviours in ways that can either conflict with the students' sense of themselves or go unacknowledged. The study indicates that students need to be provided with opportunities to explore these aspects of professional work. By making these dimensions of their practice explicit and open to interrogation students can be better assisted to develop and sustain reflective and ethically grounded professional practices.

        "author":["Gill, Zoe"],
        "description":"Over recent years there has been widespread concern for masculinity and the education of boys in Australia. In the policy arena, this has involved a federal parliamentary inquiry into the education of boys (&quot;Boys: Getting it Right: Report on the inquiry into the education of boys&quot;, October 2002) and a federal government response to this inquiry (June 2003). This was followed by a review of the current education policy directed at gender, the Gender Equity Framework, and the development of strategies to increase the number of men going into teacher training. The way in which &quot;Getting it Right&quot; and the federal government talk about boys and disadvantage is important. This paper argues that there is a particular understanding of disadvantage at work in this policy arena. It is an understanding of  disadvantage extracted from a wider gendered power order. The paper argues that &quot;Getting it Right's&quot; particular understanding of disadvantage as outside of power differentials is achieved by two policy approaches. First, the Report compares some indicators of both girls' and boys' situations, but in a selective way. I call this a &quot;selective comparative approach&quot;. Second, the Report emphasises the importance of focusing on the separate needs of boys and girls, just when the indicators of girls' position in society cannot be ignored. I call this a &quot;mere difference approach&quot;. These policy approaches assume particular understandings of boys, girls and gender which, I argue, underpins a fundamental misdiagnosis of the problem with deleterious results for boys and girls.

Looking beyond systemic factors influencing this trend--factors such as the increasing workload of principals--this study discovered why some schools are more affected by a shortage of applicants than others. We found that one of four categories of deterrents was generally involved with declining numbers of applications: location, the size of school, the presence of an incumbent, or difficulties arising from local educational politics. We found, furthermore, that smaller numbers of applicants for vacant positions do not necessarily indicate a decline in interest in school leadership: interest in the principalship remains relatively high but principal aspirants have become increasingly strategic in their applications. Whilst drawing attention, in this paper, to the research finding that numerical interpretations of principal supply have serious limitations, we are keen to acknowledge, briefly, the research data that refers to (a) social and generational changes (b) demographic information, (c) teacher resistance to the modern principalship and how these data explain declining numbers.

This study reports on a survey of 1206 students and 190 academic staff across four major Queensland universities in relation to student academic misconduct. The aim of the survey was to determine the prevalence of academic misconduct, and to investigate the extent to which perceptions of dishonesty are shared between students and staff, as preliminary steps toward developing effective strategies to deal with the academic dishonesty/misconduct problem. Results indicate a higher tolerance for academic misconduct by students in comparison to staff, particularly with respect to falsification of research results and plagiarism, as well as considerable underestimation by staff of the prevalence of virtually all forms of student academic misconduct. Overall, the study's findings confirm the significance of the issue of academic dishonesty within the Australian tertiary sector, indicating considerable divergence between students and staff in terms of perceptions of the seriousness and prevalence of student academic misconduct. We suggest that university administrators need to examine this issue closely in order to develop mechanisms for managing and curtailing the level of academic misconduct, since a failure to do so may lead to a further undermining of the academic integrity of the Australian tertiary sector.

This paper traces the discourses on teachers constructed in policy documents in order to establish what is meant by &quot;teachers of the highest quality&quot;. It employs Critical Discourse Analysis to investigate the discursive construction of teachers' professional identities in three policy documents released over the last decade. This analysis finds that, despite recognition being given to the importance of teachers in all three documents, teachers' professional autonomy is effectively curtailed as they are increasingly being &quot;taken out of the equation&quot; in education policy decision-making. The paper concludes with suggestions for ways in which teachers may challenge these constructions and work to reconstruct teachers as active voices in the policy-making process.

This result has usually been met with public apathy and political indifference. However, the results of this research conducted in Brisbane shows that the increasing social polarisation occurring in Australian society is being reflected in an increasing educational divide or polarisation. In terms of access to private education, and use of information technology the least advantaged students are faring worse than any other students. Teachers who are committed to achieving a just society through their teaching cannot ignore this situation.

In moving beyond the competing logics underpinning such remedies, this framework adopts a transformative theory and politics in problematising and seeking to restructure the inequitable gender differentiation of political-economic structures and social patterns of representation, interpretation and communication. This framework of gender justice is presented as useful in evaluating the ideologies and practices of particular schooling initiatives and thus is drawn on to critically assess three initiatives that currently seek to address issues of social/gender equity in education within Australia: The New Basics Project, The Productive Pedagogies Framework and the Success for Boys initiative. In particular, the paper critically explores these initiatives in terms of their capacities for enabling or constraining a transformative redistributive and cultural gender justice.

        "description":"The issue of school non-completion continues to be a matter of concern for policy makers and practitioners in Australia today. Despite the efforts of governments and school systems to improve participation and retention rates, often one in three students drop out of school before completing Year 12. Major factors influence non-completion and militate against young people remaining at school. Findings from recent research indicate that some non-completers choose to re-enter education through second chance programs outside the school environment. The argument for second chance education presented in this paper is developed within the context of the &quot;risk&quot; society and in relation to recent theories of youth transitions. The need for a &quot;second chance&quot; is justified in relation to recent theories of youth transitions, which suggest that re-entry into second chance education is a personal act of agency through which young people struggle to reclaim successful personal and educational identities amidst the constraints and hazards in their daily lives. Based on the findings that increasing numbers of non-completers are enrolling in TAFE second chance programs, these enabling programs are considered as a means of addressing the needs of this cohort. Educational policy in Australia related to second chance education is critically examined in light of international programs and recommendations for change are made. (Contains 5 tables.)",

The traditional pattern of the academic enterprise appears to have changed. To explore whether this is indeed the case, the Experience Sampling Method [ESM], a research technique devised by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and his colleagues (1993), was used in a pilot study to monitor the working lives of 22 university academics from two multi campus universities in Australia. Participants were asked to complete a specifically devised Experience Sampling Form [ESF] on receipt of an SMS message sent to their mobile phones six times a day for one week. Information was gathered about the activities being undertaken and the respondents' feelings about these activities. Work related tasks reported were sorted into the 17 different categories of academic work devised by Kreber (2000). The findings were examined by gender, university of employment, working hours, and by level of academic appointment. (Contains 6 figures, 6 endnotes and 5 tables.)",

        "author":["Watty, Kim"],
        "description":"A number of changes have occurred in the higher education sector under the auspices of quality and quality improvement. Much of this change has resulted in a compliance-driven environment (more measures, more meetings, more form-filling and less time for the core activities of teaching and research). It is an environment that seeks to assure all and sundry of the quality of academic programs. Anecdotally, many academics are not convinced that the current systems do, indeed, assure quality. The reasons for this may be many and varied. One suggestion is that differences in perceptions about the purpose of higher education inevitably lead to differences in the definition of quality itself and consequently, differences in systems designed to assure that quality. Understanding what academics think about the purpose of higher education may provide some clues about how they consider quality should be defined. In this research, the focus is on the views of academic accountants in Australia, defined as: academics whose main discipline area is accounting and who are involved in accounting education at an Australian university. The findings of this research show that the respondent group do, in fact, view the purpose of higher education currently promoted in their schools/departments differently from the purpose that they consider ought to be promoted. Such fundamental differences have the potential to influence the motivation and effectiveness of staff undertaking core activities in Australian universities. In addition, articulating the views of this important stakeholder group also has the potential to ensure that their views are considered in the discussions around purpose, quality and performance measures in higher education--all of which impact on the working lives of academic accountants in Australian universities.

        "author":["Hamston, Julie"],
        "description":"This article describes the application of Bakhtin's (1981, 1986a,b) theorisation of language as dialogue to the study of young students' struggle with discourses of ethnicity within the context of a Studies of Asia curriculum project (Hamston 2003). Bakhtin's rich conceptualisation of the productive and ethical nature of dialogue has operated at all levels in this study as a theoretical, pedagogical, methodological and analytic research construct. It is hoped that the description of the research provided here contributes to the field of discourse-based research in several key ways. First and foremost, the model of dialogic pedagogy central to the research was informed by Bakhtin's (1981, 1986a,b) belief in the moral responsibility of language and thus resonated with the need in complex and changing global and local conditions for education as &quot;good work&quot; (Carlson 1997a,b, 2002, Gardner et al. 1999, Luke &amp; Carpenter 2003, Willinsky, 1998). As researcher/teacher in this study, I situated at the centre of the research the kinds of questions that relate to what Weis and Fine (2003) define as issues of power, privilege, standpoint, knowledge and difference. Secondly, the dialogic nature of the data collected over time allowed for a nuanced and complex portrait of the key research participants' &quot;ideological becoming&quot; (Bakhtin 1981) and brought to the fore the different social &quot;voices&quot; that they chose to speak through. Finally, the location of discourses in the students' spoken and embodied language through a fine-grained linguistic analysis resonated with Bakhtin's (1986a) call for a profound understanding of language.

        "description":"As teacher-educators, we designed and implemented a small study that mapped teacher-education students' understandings of their own identities and how they made sense of ethnicity and class differences among their secondary students while on teaching rounds. While we didn't set out to &quot;teach&quot; our research participants, it was during the analysis of data from the research project, that we began to realise the potential of research to create opportunities for learning. In this paper we speculate on the &quot;conditions&quot; of knowledge production and suggest that the dialogic nature of interviews and focus group discussions can offer pedagogical spaces for learning. Research designs that incorporate opportunities for participants to re-tell narratives over periods of time, may position participants as experts in knowledge production and may reposition them and researchers in more equitable power relations. We present an example of one participant's narrative together with our interpretations to explore how research potentially offers &quot;evidence&quot; of learning. While this is tentative only, we suggest there is a need to create spaces for pedagogy in the design and execution of educational research. (Contains 2 endnotes.)",

Long term membership in these clubs, beginning from as young as five years of age, forms a significant part of children's and young people's development yet surf clubs have yet to receive recognition from researchers in either the education or physical education fields as significant learning sites. Within the context of growing recognition of learning as an ongoing, multidimensional and life-long process this represents an oversight in the literature that this paper sets out to redress. Employing the concepts of communities of practice and situated learning (Lave &amp; Wenger 1991, Wenger 1998) it examines four young people's experiences as members of a Victorian surf club as a community of practice. It also compares the experiences of these young people in the surf club with those arising from membership in their schools and sports clubs.",

Low achievement is moderately associated with socioeconomic background and Indigenous status and the relationships with gender, ethnicity, region, family type, state and region differ for reading and mathematics. Low achievement substantially reduces the chances of school completion and university entrance. It has much less impact on other forms of post-secondary education and training. There are stronger differences in labour market outcomes between low and higher achievers for young women than for young men. This study suggests the policies promoting the securing of full-time work soon after completing full-time education should reduce the detrimental effects of low achievement on labour market outcomes.

The use of \"Flatland\" with beginning algebra students resulted in the positive outcomes of cultivating critical thinking in the students as well as providing the teacher with the context necessary to introduce sophisticated mathematical ideas. The marriage of mathematics and literature led students to reflect on contemporary society and its problems as well as gain an insight into notions of limits, historical approximation techniques and various non-Euclidean geometries (fractal geometry and Minkowskian space-time geometry). This atypical but refreshing learning experience led students to request the reading of one of the sequels to Flatland. The release of Stewart's \"Flatterland\" in 2001 provided an ideal follow up to \"Flatland\". Banchoff's (2001) review of \"Flatterland\" for the Mathematical Association of America partially found in the back cover states: \"Flatterland\" challenges readers to go beyond \"Flatland\" and deal with phenomena, not just in dimensions higher than four, but in many exotic geometric realms that stretch our imagination and powers of visualization.\" (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)",

The medium chosen for the problems discussed in this paper is the newspaper. The purpose of this article is to tie together traditional views of the importance of problem solving with the current aims of numeracy and quantitative literacy. In doing this, the author considers another angle on the development of quantitative literacy. Watson (1997) suggested a hierarchy for the related field of statistical literacy, which is easily adapted in the wider milieu. The hierarchy suggests three tiers or steps in the development of the goal of quantitative literacy: (1) The terminology needs to be understood; (2) This terminology then needs to be understood within the social (or scientific) context in which it is used; and (3) There needs to be a critical awareness that prompts questioning of claims in context that are made without proper justification.

Kissane (2001) suggests that with the personal experience afforded by a graphing calculator the nature of learning \"if carefully structured by the teacher, can provide pupils with important insights about functions and their graphical representations\". Burrill et al. in their 2002 review note that the core research finding is that the type and extent of gains in student learning in the presence of handheld graphing technology \"are a function, not simply of the presence of the graphing technology, but of how the technology is used in the teaching of mathematics\". They concluded that \"specific issues regarding the effective use of handheld graphing technology in the classroom have not yet been adequately addressed\". This paper describes approaches used by senior secondary students using a Texas Instrument (TI) 83 graphing calculator during a small research study to determine a global view of a difficult function. Implications of these approaches for teaching in a graphing calculator environment are presented and discussed. (Contains 6 figures.)",

Another mathematician, Ron Graham, took care of his daily financial accounting. Erdos'approach to mathematics was as unique as his life. He invented a new kind of art: the art of raising problems. He said that mathematics is eternal because it has an infinity of problems; and in his view, the more elementary a problem is, the better. He loved areas of mathematics which did not require an excessive amount of technical knowledge but give scope for ingenuity and surprise.",

        "description":"If the goal is to promote mathematical thinking and help children become flexible problem solvers, then it is important to show students multiple representations of a problem. Because it is important to help students develop both counting-based and collections-based conceptions of number, teachers should be showing students both number line (counting-based) and array (collections-based) models of multiplication. Arrays allow students to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding of multiplication/division, and to fully appreciate the two-dimensionality of the multiplicative process. Because the grids presented in this paper are structured to show the ten-based structure of the number system, and enable various different partitioning possibilities to be shown using different colouring/shading, they provide a basis for students to image or visualise multiplicative processes. Arrays have enormous potential at the senior primary and secondary school levels to help strengthen students' multiplicative thinking. The multi-coloured/shaded grids described provide a practical means of doing this. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Students at all levels should be provided with opportunities to investigate and uncover patterns throughout their mathematical careers. Further, they should be allowed to explore situations in which pattern recognition plays a vital role in the construction of important mathematical knowledge. This article will discuss a lesson that introduces arithmetic sequences through a simple, yet rich exploration of a pattern. This lesson has been taught in a methods course for secondary mathematics teachers to provide them with a model of a constructivist lesson that they will be able to implement in their own classrooms when they begin teaching. It is, also, beneficial to this group as it affords them an opportunity to participate in a cooperative learning activity that lends itself to a wide variety of solution methods.

Web-based instructional tools allow students and teachers to actively and interactively participate in the learning process (Lynch, Moyer, Frye & Suh, 2002). The ways teachers use these tools can have a profound effect on the teaching and learning of mathematics. Telecollaboration has the potential to create authentic contexts and problem-solving environments for students, ultimately providing students with opportunities to apply their mathematics skills in a real-world context outside of the classroom. This article describes how one teacher used a telecollaboration project in his high school statistics course.

If translucent paper is used it renders easy tasks such as duplicating an angle or a segment to any position desired. Paper folding encourages students toward conjecture and invites the teacher to reflect upon the meaning of proof. Results are made plausible by simple observations associated with the folding of paper. A significant benefit of the paper folding technique is its accessibility to students and the affective benefits this confers. (Contains 1 table.)",

The four operations are taught and rehearsed in the early years and from this, it is assumed, \"children will induce the fundamental structure of arithmetic\" (Warren & Pierce, 2004, p. 294). Recent research has shown that the emphasis on computation can actually lead to many misconceptions in the students' minds, which in turn will make the learning of algebra more difficult. This article will focus on two categories of student misconceptions, the first concerns difficulties with the notion of equivalence and the second concerns difficulties with the application of the four operations. The last section of the article presents suggestions on easing the transition to algebra through problem-solving. (Contains 4 figures.)",

There is similarly a need, in developing numerate young people, to focus on the teaching and learning of mathematics and mathematics skills some of the time, and on application and tasks some of the time (not necessarily at discrete times). Clearly the balance needs to be flexible and dependent on the particular needs of any group of students at any particular time. Inappropriate balance--too much mathematics and not enough application or too much application and not enough mathematics-- will result in students who are not numerate. In this context, this author contends that all teachers of mathematics must also explicitly see themselves as teachers of numeracy. (Contains 3 figures.)",

There are several cryptographic techniques and many make extensive use of mathematics to secure information. The author discusses an activity built around one of the techniques that illustrates an application of matrices. Secondary school teachers may use this activity to consolidate their students' learning of certain concepts of matrices such as the algorithm for matrix multiplication and the concept of the multiplicative inverse of a matrix. It is hoped that this activity, not only offers teachers great opportunities to either introduce or consolidate certain mathematical concepts and algorithms, but also to convince their students that mathematics plays an important role in various walks of life and hence is a useful and meaningful field of study.

The range of tasks was found to be extensive, and stretched well beyond formal school hours. There were similarities and differences in the activities and work patterns of the experienced and novice teachers, and in what they found stressful. Administrative tasks were more likely to be the cause of stress for the experienced teachers; teaching-related activities for the novice teachers. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)",

It gains its character from the rules of evidence and reasoning used by communities of scientists and scholars to determine the relative value of truth-claims. One of the finest virtues of the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) Statement on Academic Freedom and Educational Responsibility is that it articulates this basic insight so clearly. AAC&U insists upon the responsibility of educational institutions to defend academic professionalism and to make its methods of thought available to students. In this article, the authors discuss their responses to the AAC&U Statement on Academic Freedom and Educational Responsibility. According to David A. Hollinger, it is perhaps the AAC&U statement that can help more of the public understand the structure of cognitive authority by which institutions of higher learning properly operate. Moreover, Bruce Robbins admires both the spirit and the letter of the AAC&U statement. He further opines that \"academic freedom\" means circling the wagons. That means, in the larger struggle over the university to which the recent attacks belong, they may need to be more enterprising, even to go on the offensive. This will entail recognizing, threatening as the recognition may be in terms of self-defense, that the line between the academy's inside and outside has never been as tight  and defensible as they sometimes pretend.",

        "description":"Political pressure on colleges and universities has been a matter of common debate and concern since 1934. That was the year the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the Association of American Colleges (the precursor of AAC&U) established a series of conferences in order to reaffirm and develop the 1925 Conference Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure. These conferences produced the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure that is still the reference point for many college and university policies today. It underwent another set of revisions in 1970, when interpretative statements were added; the statement has the endorsement of approximately two hundred learned societies and organizations. The AAUP conceived of the tenure system in the context of a fundamental research mission within universities: a greater emphasis on research went hand in hand with greater protections and freedom of inquiry for faculty members. The principles set forth in the statement produced practices in the university that include protection for the political viewpoints of faculty as citizens, for the appropriate use of controversial materials in teaching, and for the rights of faculty to due process. In this article, the author shares how his experience as a student, faculty member, and administrator has included constant exposure to political pressure. The vast majority of his experience has demonstrated the resilience and strength of the academic system.",

        "description":"In this article, the authors state that liberal education depends upon--presupposes--unfettered thought, inquiry, and expression. This is necessary not only for the production of knowledge but also for the preparation of citizens in a diverse democracy. A vital campus is one where ideas meet, mix, conflict, engage, and emerge changed by the interaction. Genuine dialogue is a difficult, even fragile, human endeavor. It entails both speaking and listening, articulating one's views and earnestly considering those of others. Campus communities need both to protect the rights of all members to think and speak freely and to foster the conditions that make dialogue possible. The word \"liberal\" in \"liberal education\" originally meant education for free men, an education to prepare men for the exercise of freedom within their polity. For this reason the practice of freedom on campus is deeply tied to the practice of freedom in the larger society and internationally, as well as individually and interpersonally. Thus, students have to learn both how to think critically about their own positionalities and how to engage various other perspectives on the issues they seek to understand and to judge. This need for multiple perspectives is the grounds of a global epistemology; it is also the most basic argument for diversity in liberal education. (Contains 2 notes.)",

In fact, it may very well be that, as Jerry Graff (2003) has suggested, our students are \"clueless\" about how to think about liberal learning; how it affects their personal, educational, and professional development; and how it plays a role in their day-to-day lives. To learn more about the students' perceptions of liberal education, the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) has conducted a survey. The findings reveal a \"serious disconnect between what students value and the vision of liberal education championed by the AAC&U community\" (Humphreys and Davenport 2005, 41). In this article, the author argues that the advising process offers teachers perhaps the best opportunity for helping their students become more intentional about their own educations, as well as for helping them to recognize the value of the liberal learning outcomes teachers seek to advance. In order to make the most of this opportunity, however, teachers must rethink advising and explore new approaches that engage students more broadly. In short, the author argues that advising must be reconceived as liberal learning.",

Although access to higher education has increased significantly over the past two decades, it has not translated into equitable educational outcomes. Not only do African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans have lower graduation rates than whites and Asian Americans, they also experience inequalities in just about every indicator of academic success--from earned grade point average to placement on the dean's list to graduation rates in competitive majors. This article focuses on the development and pilot-testing of Equity for All, an institutional change intervention designed to close the equity gap in higher education.

        "description":"Although they work toward the same goal, high school counselors and admission officers often overlook one another as essential resources in the transition to postsecondary education. When addressing the best ways to utilize high school visits, education professionals must remember that while student academic preparation, family support and financial aid improve student access to postsecondary education, the adult tutelage provided to students, regarding the requirements for postsecondary success and the process of securing admission, and financial aid, significantly add to the likelihood that students will attend a postsecondary institution (King, 1996; Adelman, 1999; McDonough, 1997 and 2004; Orfield and Paul, 1993; Plank and Jordan, 2001). No adults are greater experts than the high school counselor and college admission officer, especially when they work in conjunction. This article examines four primary areas where increased interaction between college admission officers and high school counselors could translate into student success: (1) alleviating the shortage of college counseling staff for students in high-need high schools; (2) increasing the amount of time-on-task dedicated to college counseling; (3) providing professional development to high school counselors responsible for college counseling; and (4) conveying financial aid information to high school counselors, students and families.

This study fills this void by researching whether state-operated lotteries increase the number of higher education students in the South. The research employs pooled time-series, cross-sectional regression analysis to test the data and suggests that state-operated lotteries are not significantly correlated with increased enrollments in institutions of higher education, as many practitioners and scholars originally anticipated.

        "description":"The National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC), originally established to serve as an advocate of ethical practices in the recruitment of students and awarding of scholarship dollars, now recognizes the ethical dilemmas admission counselors face in the current competitive marketplace. This article presents the details of a national study conducted in May 2004 to measure the moral judgment of admission counselors across the United States. The moral judgment score was then compared to other professions, and between admission counselors working in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors. Since age, gender and education-level were also shown to have an impact on moral judgment, these variables were compared as a whole and between the two sectors (Dawson, 2002; Goolsby and Hunt, 1992; Silver and Valentine, 2000; Trevino, 1992; Windsor and Cappel, 1999). The study reveals that individuals working as admission counselors in for-profit and not-for-profit, baccalaureate-degree granting, private colleges or universities possess a higher level of moral judgment than the general adult population. No relationship exists between admission counselors' moral judgment scores in the for-profit and not-for-profit educational sectors studied and age, gender or education level.",

        "description":"As a college degree is becoming a necessity for later earning a steady living, tuition rates are rising rapidly. Fortunately, the availability of merit-based scholarships is increasing, yet little research has been done on scholarship-awarding practices. Determining whether high school counselors accurately perceive awarding practices is an important step in determining how they can best advise students how to achieve these merit awards. This study compares the scholarship-awarding processes reported by 18 university scholarship personnel at selected four-year, public universities in seven Midwestern states with 122 high school counselors' perceptions of these processes. Participants completed a survey in which they rated statements and ranked factors regarding the scholarship-awarding process. Analysis of the data indicates that universities rely on academic factors statistically significantly more than on extracurricular involvement or other chance variables when awarding merit scholarships. The high school counselors have an accurate perception of the order in which these factors are considered; however, the elevated amount of importance attributed by counselors with the non-academic variables is misaligned with university practices.

        "description":"College counselors regard themselves as teachers and educators, but they are something else as well. They are links between the location of childhood and the larger, more risky terrain of first adulthood. College counselors prepare students for an actual, not merely figurative, journey, the prospect of which fill students and their parents with both excitement and fear. Every aspect of what college counselors do raises explicitly the moral issue that classroom teachers address usually only implicitly; self-knowledge and its consequences, critical judgment of the world around one, and discovery of one's own values within the ethical confusions that characterize culture are all included in the work of the college counselor. Clarification of these issues is made possible by careful description and delineation of the different roles that college counselors play in their complicated work. This article describes and discusses the four main roles of college counselors: document professors, advisors, counselors, and advocates. Each of these roles carries different skills. If college counselors give a clear account of themselves, particularly in their roles as counselors and advocates, if they can demonstrate the essential integrity of the college counselor's work, then they shall have fulfilled successfully that necessity for ethical clarity and appropriateness that must be at the core of all educators' work.

These philosophical issues have particularly significant educational implications for the nation's minority groups.

        "description":"In this article, the author states that no matter how experienced and exposed to life college freshmen may appear, no matter how sophisticated they may seem, they are vulnerable and unsure of themselves a lot of the time. The child in them grapples with the emerging adult; they are eager to enter adulthood but understandably fearful of what they will find there. Many have not developed the reliable judgment to get them through the social and personal situations they will find, despite their high academic achievements or verbal facility. They are left feeling alone, confused and unhappy in their unfamiliar environment. This is the author's call for a community in which a shared campus code of conduct emphasizes courtesy, care and the rights of others, and where young adults interact constructively with their elders who are respectful of and sensitive to the developmental stages of young adulthood. Feelings of confusion and disappointment that lead to transfer could be addressed to bring about thoughtful methods for change that lead to loyalty and commitment to a college community. Most young people begin college wanting to make such a connection. Furthermore, the author is intrigued by the statement of a young woman at DePaul University who in behalf of the studentry, states that they like the university to understand one thing; that is, they do not want the university to interfere in their lives but they want someone in the university to be connected with their lives. With this, in his subtle distinction may lie the beginnings of change on college campuses for the all-too-frequent responses of freshman like Jenny, Paul and Robert's cases which are presented in this paper.

The author contends that students with learning disabilities have both strengths and weaknesses. While they may learn in unique ways, these differences do not imply that their capacity to learn is inferior. Therefore, it is not necessary to dilute the curriculum to assist these students, but to work with them to identify what accommodations are necessary to help them be successful. Learning disabilities are not curable, but there are many instructional interventions and compensatory strategies that can be used to help those with disabilities to master the coursework.

The preface, by Mary Lee Hoganson, serves to bind the three speeches together under the cohesive question, \"Are college counselors social engineers?\" Here, she stresses that colleges and universities have served an unparalleled role as social engineers in the United States and that some of the primary draftspersons of the blueprints for positive change and social growth serve in admission offices. The three speeches in this article serve to offer separate views that address the same question which is spoken from within each author's heart as much as the intellect. Each of them shares the passion and vision of those who have elected to devote their careers to opening doors to all young people of potential in one's nation. Moreover, it challenges admission professionals to consider how they came to be social engineers, why they must continue to accept and act upon that responsibility and, finally, how the greater social good is well-served by their efforts and their angst over these issues. Furthermore, these professional dialogues have grown too full of discussions of marketing strategies, financial aid leveraging and way to maximize yield.

The authors assert that if vast changes are  made with regard to the experiences and the richness that underrepresented students bring to campuses, admission staff must make counter-cultural shifts in how they view their work. They must also generate methods of daily practice that ensure that a diversity of voices can always be heard, and on equal terms. Institutions must think about how to generate such possibilities on their campus for their admission staff, regardless of the previous history of success or cultural make-up of the student body.

        "description":"Professional program admission at U.S. universities has become increasingly competitive in the last 20 years, due to enrollment caps, core class requirements, transfer course acceptance, industry draw, and the appeal of starting salaries. As the competition steadily increases, students often find methods to exploit traditional policy, resulting in the exclusion of desirable candidates. Construction management program admission is consistent with this relatively new heightened interest, which now requires advisors and administrators to reconsider current policies to ensure that students being admitted into professional programs are not only academically adept, but also have the highest propensity to be successful after graduation. This paper considers admission policy improvements for emerging professional programs through a case study of a reputable construction program.",

The SLR includes a rating scale and open-ended response space that prompt evaluators to describe applicants on a set of qualities identified by faculty in previous research as important to academic success, including knowledge and skills, creativity, communication skills, motivation, self-organization, professionalism and maturity, and teamwork. Admission committees, in turn, receive a Web-based, interactive report of the applicant information. Researchers asked 421 graduate faculty and administrator respondents to use the SLR and then report their interest in and preferences for the form, content and function of an SLR. Overall, a majority of faculty and administrators preferred the SLR to the system currently being used at their institutions. The researchers list several practical implications that adopting institutions may wish to consider, and provide recommendations for subsequent activities to develop the project.

A study of more than 3,000 first-year students assessed a traditional pre-college predictor, the ACT, along with a new potential pre-college predictor, locus of control, to determine their effectiveness in predicting first-year student academic achievement as measured by end-of-first-year cumulative GPA. The results of the study indicated that first-year students who entered university with lower scores on the locus of control scale (internals) obtained significantly higher GPAs than those who scored higher (externals) on this same scale. Pre-college ACT scores also served as an effective predictor of student academic success as demonstrated by significantly higher cumulative GPAs at the end of the first year. In addition, this study found that first-year students retained to their sophomore year demonstrated a statistically higher GPA than those who were not retained. (Contains 1 table.)",

But the literacy narrative as a critical genre is problematic. Such narratives often are absorbed by and promote the \"literacy myth,\" a culturally conservative belief in the unqualified developmental power of literacy. Frederick Douglass's 1845 Narrative is often a major textual site of perpetuating such ideology. Minority and working class students especially are asked to understand the importance of reading and writing to their own intellectual and cultural development by absorbing the \"lesson\" of Douglass's fight to acquire literacy. But a close reading of his text reveals a more complicated, radical notion of literacy acquisition than is often credited to Douglass. This essay explores the rhetoric of literacy narratives and the critical model that Douglass offers. (Contains 3 notes.)",

        "description":"In this article, I review contact zone pedagogy from a perspective of discursive positioning and with attention to two assignments that ask basic writers to play with the conventions of academic language. The first requires them to translate a passage of academic prose into a slang of their choice; the second, to compose a parody of academic style. Their responses afford these basic writers new, unusually powerful subjectivities: as deflating formality and pretension, as mocking those in power, and as de-naturalizing everyday texts and discourses to render them newly problematic. And they serve as counterpoint to studies that present the contact zone as opening up the classroom to the appeals of all parties, sexist, racist, or homophobic as they may be. Ultimately, I challenge an unspoken assumption of much writing pedagogy--that teaching on current social issues will eventually bring students  around to their instructor's point of view--instead holding out the promise that in the contact zone, a teacher is just as likely to be moved and changed as a student.

Literacy narratives highlight for writing teachers the life lessons that have advanced people toward their literacy goals. These stories are often about the struggle for and triumph of confidence. Correspondingly, as a pedagogical tool, reading and writing literacy narratives may serve to build confidence in some of our least comfortable students. However, literacy narratives can present obstacles to school literacy as well. Some students are likely to have difficulty identifying with the narrators. Furthermore, when its  characteristic values and conventions conflict with a student's cultural orality, the genre can  have an alienating effect. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using literacy narratives in the writing classroom. My intention is to provide an overview of how well literacy narratives can help students overcome cultural obstacles to writing in college. (Contains 3 notes.)",

The Studio, first conceptualized by Grego and Thompson, is a one-credit writing workshop taken by students concurrently enrolled in a composition course. Developing this program necessitated incursion into an institutional landscape that we learned was not transparent, unclaimed, or uncontested. In remaking that landscape, we came to understand the crucial roles of space and place, power and colonization, in institutional change and in the teaching of writing.  Institutional spaces are never transparent, unclaimed, or uncontested; thus remaking an institutional landscape involves issues of power and colonization. Postcolonial theories helped us think about the shifting and asymmetrical relations of power embroiling us as we struggled to bring about change in our campus's approach to at-risk students. We argue that the contradictions and confusions students experience in the university embody the work in Studio, and that these contradictions must not be smoothed out in any narrative we write or theorizing we attempt.

        "description":"Studies of how children who are blind acquire and use language have focused less on cognitive compensations and more on delays in development. Vision is important in the establishment of early communicative patterns, and sighted children regularly use contextual visual information, such as a speaker's gestures and eye gaze, to make sense of speech that is directed at them (Mills, 1988). Some researchers have argued that, in the absence of vision, children may be expected to have more difficulty understanding concepts and the relationships between them and in acquiring generalizations about language and the way it works (Andersen, Dunlea, & Kekelis, 1993). In contrast, it has been argued that linguistic experience may be more important for children who are blind than for sighted children and that children who are blind may pay more attention to language (Chomsky, 1990; Perez-Pereira & Castro, 1997). This report examines the question of whether apparent compensatory changes in verbal fluency are concomitant with early blindness. The goal of the study was to discover whether there are differences between children who are blind and children who are sighted in verbal fluency, particularly whether there are differences in clustering and switching in fluency tasks. The data reported in this paper were collected concurrently with a larger data set reported in Wakefield, Homewood, and Taylor (2004).",

In their cases, providing a calm, affectionate, predictable, yet moderately demanding and encouraging, home and school life can, over time, help to ease the shyness.

Once children begin to understand the basic principle of compassion, which is kindness, and once they are introduced to the joy of differences, they can begin to teach themselves through experience and relationships.

This article offers suggestions and techniques for calming squirming babies of all types and ages who seem to be unable to find a comfortable position while being held. She begins by suggesting that care givers of very small babies be patient and remember that the baby may not be used to the feel of your particular arms, or the touch of your hands. As caregiver, and baby become more familiar with the particular way the care giver holds the baby, he or she will grow comfortable with the way your body moves while being carried from place to place. It is also possible that a baby has not had enough experience being held. Some babies are placed in cribs, car seats, high chairs, baby swings, or walkers far more than they are held. Another possibility is that a baby has some \"sensory Integration difficulties.\" Babies with such sensitivities react with discomfort to certain sounds, scents, and touches, and babies with \"sensory integration\" troubles can react by squirming and protesting if their clothing doesn't \"feel right.\" Still other babies will fuss if a touch is too light and gentle. Some feel the need for deeper firmer touches and techniques for communicating reassuring touches and interacting with fussy babies are discussed.",

As children gain skills in the social/emotional domain, they build language and problem-solving skills, as well as creative-thinking, memory, and abstract-thinking skills. These skills are important components of cognitive development in areas like reading, writing, and math. Skill development in the social/emotional domains is more difficult to see, and consequently are difficult to discuss with parents.

Even though we know of the importance of reading strategies, little research exists on whether or not ESL males and females have similar or different strategic reading habits. This study endeavored to fill this void by comparing the academic reading strategies of 248 (138=male; 110=female) advanced college ESL students. The results of a quantitative survey showed very few strategic differences, with both genders using strategies with medium or high frequency. These finding suggest that advanced ESL readers' strategies are primarily influenced by factors other than gender. (Contains 2 tables.)",

She has tried telling herself that when teaching developmental English, what matters is her knowledge of English composition. Good organization, solid development, and accurate mechanics do not change, regardless of the race, culture, or home language of her students. Leaders in developmental education have concurred that multiculturalism must become part of the curriculum of developmental education. For a growing number of developmental educators, that multicultural curriculum must meet the needs of Latino students. She stresses that those of them who teach developmental students must understand that they have to do more than teach content material if they want their students to be successful. Their good intentions and heartfelt desire for students to succeed are insufficient in the face of the number of their students who are not graduating from their institutions. If they are serious about retaining Latino developmental students, then they must train developmental educators in strategies that allow them to celebrate, endorse, respect, and internalize that which is specific to Latino populations.",

In this political climate initiatives to reform science teacher education and science education for students K-16 are expected to involve stakeholders from a variety of sectors in schools, universities, and the community. Facilitating the organization and work of such groups usually falls to the current leaders in science education in schools, state agencies, and universities. The diverse backgrounds of the various stakeholders are a double-edged sword. On one hand, they provide new ideas from which to develop creative programs. On the other hand, the varied perspectives that enrich the base of ideas also create enormous communication barriers that often impede progress. The suggestions offered emerged from a grounded theory study of an excercise in facilitated stakeholder discussion aimed at creating an ideal science teacher education program consistent with today's national goals.

Another goal of this study was to determine the teachers? ideas about inquiry teaching and the influence of their methods course and classroom experience on their use of inquiry teaching methods during their student teaching. Thirteen secondary preservice teachers (PT), (six male, seven female), who were enrolled in a yearlong science methods program at a large midwestern university, participated in this study. They underwent some classroom observations. In addition to the classroom observations, they were given an open-ended pre-observation questionnaire and an open-ended post-observation questionnaire. All student questionnaires and reflections were analyzed using content analysis. In the pre-observation questionnaire, all of the PTs recorded that the inquiry methodology was a good way to teach science content. Only four out of the 13 PTs (31%) observed their cooperating teacher using an inquiry-type lesson during their pre-student teaching observations. A total of 286 preservice teacher KWL reflections were analyzed and divided into three time periods: observation-1 reflections (n= 69) during the fall semester, observation-2 reflections (n=61) at the beginning of spring semester, and student teaching reflections (n=156) during the spring semester. Their concerns on instructional delivery, assessment, planning, as well as other concerns were divided into categories. Some preservice teachers in this study believed that questioning or predicting was the complete inquiry process. The preservice teachers in this study also encountered frustration and difficulties with teaching inquiry in the form of negative student attitudes, time restraints, and lack of student effort.

        "description":"Science educators have appropriated many meanings for the phrase \"scientific literacy\" (Champagne & Lovitts, 1989). This paper advances an argument that in order to maintain the usefulness of such a malleable phrase, its users must explicitly address the context of its use. Based on the vision of science education articulated in standards documents from the United States (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1990); (National Research Council, 1996)  and abroad (Council of Ministers of Education Canada Pan-Canadian Science Project, 1997; Millar & Osborne, 1998; Queensland School Curriculum Council, 2001), this paper advances a conception of scientific literacy which involves the negotiation of socioscientific issues. In other words, becoming scientifically literate requires, at least in part, the ability to make informed decisions regarding socioscientific issues. Central to socioscientific issues are moral and ethical implications; therefore, the promotion of scientific literacy requires curricular attention to the moral and ethical implications of socioscientific issues. This paper reviews how the Science-Technology-Society movement has addressed socioscientific decision-making and outlines an alternative approach that more explicitly focuses on the moral and ethical implications of socioscientific issues.",

        "description":"As early as 1923, Jean Piaget challenged teachers to reevaluate their goals for students and to promote critical thinking rather than conformity. Piaget described two important educational goals. The first \"principal goal of education is to create men who are capable of doing new things, not simply of repeating what other generations have done--men who are creative, inventive, and discoverers. The second goal of education is to form minds which can be critical, can verify, and not accept everything they are offered.\" As people move toward a global and information technology-based society, it is important that the students understand international and cultural diversity and become sensitive to different points of view. The key to this understanding and increased sensitivity is critical thinking: identifying and challenging assumptions and exploring and imagining alternatives (Brookfield, 1987). In essence, critical thinking means a student takes a holistic approach to solving a problem and assuring all dimensions of the problem have been examined. Based on these issues, the purpose of this study was to identify the perceptions of classroom teachers awarded the Christa McAuliffe Fellowship and the impact the Program had on their classroom teaching and on the need of teaching critical thinking skills.

Today both private and public funding agencies recommend that proposed projects  be based upon scientific research; that is, research that meets the criteria  delineated in the National Research Council's book, &quot;Scientific Research in Education&quot; (Shavelson &amp; Towne, 2002). Because evaluation that provides scientific-based research is the crux of the &quot;No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act&quot; (Paige, Hickok, &amp; Newman, 2000), it remains a top priority for science teachers and supervisors. This paper describes one state's efforts to evaluate its SSI, including issues that emerged during the evaluation as well as the lessons learned from the reform and its evaluation. Those lessons are particularly pertinent today as science teachers and district supervisors seek to meet the requirements of NCLB. (Contains 5 figures and 5 endnotes.)",

Schools are scrambling to find ways to reach students who are struggling. Once again professional development is being seen as a major tool to support improved practice and to assist teachers in meeting goals for student learning. Recently our perspectives about what works in professional development and where to best focus energy and resources have been shifting based on research and lessons from the field. This article explores three major shifts in beliefs about professional development that are suggested by the research on teacher learning, and shares examples of programs from the National Eisenhower Consortia that demonstrate the importance of these shifts. These three shifts must inform decision making about the structure, form and focus of teacher professional development. Policy makers and practitioners must recognize the importance of quality teaching to student learning and create permanent mechanisms and structures, embedded in the school culture, that support teachers to develop deep knowledge of teaching throughout their careers. This includes providing professional development with a strong content and pedagogical content focus tied to student learning goals and situated in teacher practice.",

In the field of science education, monitoring and reacting to the issue of efficacy seems to be one way in which teacher preparation programs are evaluating the structure of programs. The study reported in this paper provides a comparison of the self-efficacy of future science teachers in two countries (one developed and one rapidly developing). The purpose of the study is to compare preservice elementary teachers' efficacy beliefs at a large Turkish university and at a large American university located in the Midwest. The data for this study were collected by utilizing Enochs and Riggs' (1990) Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI-B). The STEBI-B is comprised of two subscales; personal science teaching efficacy beliefs (PSTE, 13 items) and science teaching outcome expectancy (STOE, 10 ITEMS). The participants consist of a Turkish sample of 100 preservice elementary teachers and an American sample of 79 preservice elementary teachers. The data were collected by convenient sampling. A descriptive analysis of student data indicates generally positive self-efficacy beliefs regarding science teaching in both countries. Results from this study indicate that there were differences in personal teaching efficacy beliefs of the USA and Turkish samples of preservice teachers. In general, USA preservice teachers have stronger personal science teaching efficacy beliefs than Turkish preservice elementary teachers. (Contains 4 tables.)",

It looks at students who are participating in a recruitment course in a secondary science, mathematics, and computer science teacher education program at a large university. By examining the experiences and knowledge of students in such a program, it is possible to understand the disposition of students who elect to participate in these courses, and the curricular and instructional aspects that impact students who are considering the teaching profession. The findings provide an additional data source from which to draw conclusions, and thus have direct implications for those affiliated with similar courses. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Project TIES (Technology Integration Enhancing Science), a four-year Technology Literacy K-8 project, combines technology as a tool for teaching and learning with earth and environmental science education. The project provides K-8 teachers in two school systems in the Central Piedmont area of North Carolina with professional development as well as equipment and materials. During this process, TIES teachers participate in professional development involving science content, the inquiry process, student-centered projects, and the use of technology as a tool for teaching and learning. TIES teachers have taken on leadership roles including presentations at state science teachers and educational technology conferences and provision of professional development within their school systems. The project is being sustained because the expertise and leadership resides within the schools.",

Although abundant research documents the specific needs of gifted students, too little is being done at the preservice teacher level to prepare our teachers to recognize and meet these needs (e.g., Feldhusen & Kolloff, 1986; VanTassel-Baska, 2003). This study examined the change in beliefs by one cohort of preservice teachers after participation in a gifted education course and practicum. Interviews with the participants following the intervention period were used to assess the participants' perceptions of the effect the course and practicum had on their understanding of gifted students' needs and their ability to meet those needs. Interview data were triangulated with classroom observations and lesson plans created by the participants for use during the practicum. Findings indicated the participants perceived an increase in their overall level of professional development, as well as an increase in their level of understanding of the characteristics and needs of gifted students.",

Each labeled &quot;gifted&quot; child was matched for age, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES) with two others in the same school class. The first matched child had an identical Raven's Matrices raw score, and the second was chosen at random for ability (N = 210). The study, begun in 1974 across the UK, used a battery of tests, including IQ, personality, behavior, and in-depth interviews of children, parents, and teachers. The group labeled gifted were found to have significantly more emotional problems than the nonlabeled group, which they mostly grew out of. This follow-up study demonstrates that for the subjects now in their 40s, a gifted childhood has not always delivered outstanding adult success. Better predictive factors for adult success were hard work, emotional support, and a positive, open personal outlook. By 2005, the labeled and nonlabeled gifted groups were not very different in life outcomes, though both groups were much more successful than the random-ability group.",

Significant differences have been noted in the young people's educational status and direction, life satisfaction, social relationships, and self-esteem as a function of the degree of academic acceleration their schools permitted them in childhood and adolescence. The considerable majority of young people who have been radically accelerated, or who accelerated by 2 years, report high degrees of life satisfaction, have taken research degrees at leading universities, have professional careers, and report facilitative social and love relationships. Young people of equal abilities who accelerated by only 1 year or who have not been permitted acceleration have tended to enter less academically rigorous college courses, report lower levels of life satisfaction, and in many cases, experience significant difficulties with socialization. Several did not graduate from college or high school. Without exception, these young people possess multiple talents; however, for some, the extent and direction of talent development has been dictated by their schools' academic priorities or their teachers' willingness or unwillingness to assist in the development of particular talent areas.",

However, the majority of children who score in the top few percentiles on ability and achievement tests in 1 grade do not retain their status for more than a year or 2. The tendency of those with high scores on one occasion to obtain somewhat lower scores on a later occasion is one example of regression to the mean. We first summarize some of the basic facts about regression to the mean. We then discuss major causes of regression: errors of measurement, individual differences in growth, changes in the content of the developmental score scale, and changes in the norming population across age or grade cohorts. We then show that year-to-year regression is substantial, even for highly reliable test scores. Different ways of combining achievement and ability test scores to reduce regression effects are illustrated. Implications for selection policies and research on giftedness are also discussed.

Drawn from the positive psychology movement, the goal of Operation Houndstooth is to develop in gifted students six co-cognitive factors: optimism, courage, romance with a topic/discipline, sensitivity to human concerns, physical/mental energy, and vision/sense of destiny. It is suggested that schools should adopt several approaches. Each level of the OHIT leads students closer to the constructive development of gifted behaviors and the internalization of the co-cognitive factors. (Contains 3 figures.)",

        "description":"This article focuses on two education-related factors that appear to contribute to the schooling aspirations and self-efficacy of Hispanic youth: (1) sense of belonging at school; and (2) composition of the student's peer group. In particular, middle school students whose home language was Spanish were given an opportunity to participate in the Advanced Placement (AP) Spanish Language program. By placing these students in a program that honors their native language as an advanced academic skill rather than an academic risk factor, the authors hypothesized that Spanish-speaking eighth-grade students would: (1) earn qualifying scores on the AP Spanish exam; and (2) increase their sense of belonging at school, self-efficacy, and academic aspirations. Findings support both hypotheses. The study was conducted at Waco Independent School District, in Waco, TX, which offers AP Spanish Language to Hispanic students in eighth grade. To examine the effectiveness of the AP Spanish project, the authors looked at student performance on the AP exams and studied the composition of the intervention group, students' sense of belonging at school, students' academic aspirations, and students' self-efficacy. The evaluation of student success on the AP exam included three years of data collected since the program's inception in the fall of 2002. In three years of program implementation, 117 students participated in the AP Spanish Language course and took the corresponding AP exam in the eighth grade. Of those 117 students, 92 (79%) of them earned qualifying scores of 3, 4, or 5 on the AP exam. All of those students earned four high school credits as a result of their exam scores. The AP group was compared with two other groups of students who were not enrolled in the AP class, one composed of Hispanic students who spoke Spanish (HS) as their first language, the other composed of Hispanic students who spoke English as the first language (HE). Randomly selecting eighth-grade classes from four participating middle schools completed a survey adapted from the National Center for Education Statistics Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 Student Questionnaire measuring the composition of their peer group, their sense of belonging at school, self-efficacy, and their academic aspirations. Supporting the first hypothesis, statistically significant differences were found between the AP group and the HS and HE groups who did not enroll in the AP class. Eighth-grade Spanish-speaking students in the program significantly outperformed high school students in the same district on the AP Spanish Language exam with more Spanish-speaking students earning qualifying scores than high school Spanish students in the school district. Supporting the second hypothesis, it was found that an AP program honoring the students' home-language builds students' sense of self-confidence, academic aspirations, and sense of belonging in school. The authors emphasize the importance of campus administrative support in creating a culture that values Spanish language skills as an advanced academic indicator rather than a risk factor.",

        "author":["Morris, Ronald V."],
        "description":"This article describes a group students in an elementary gifted class used discovery to learn about life in industrial New England. Taking multiple days to analyze this topic, students used artifacts (chairs), discussion, and primary sources to explore the politics of the 1830s. They examined the workings of Hitchcockville, CT, and a Massachusetts Shaker colony. Students used evidence to see the rise of industrialism and the reactions society had to it; the chairs reflect the geography, history, economics, and politics of the Age of Jackson. Students also examined a parallel Shaker community that lived and worshipped together--people who rejected the industrial age and attempted to insulate themselves from the problems of the age. This article also provides the benefits of learning about national and international events through the use of artifacts. (Contains 5 figures and 10 resources.)",

        "description":"Project Aspire was created to identify poor rural students with academic potential and to provide them with academic and counseling support in advanced placement courses and prerequisites. This article describes Project Aspire and its foundations; the relevant lessons learned from the literature on poverty, small schools, rural schools, and gifted education; and the lessons learned from the counselors who work with students in these environments. These lessons are about what we know of the difficulties high-ability students of poverty face and how school personnel might assist these students more effectively. The 10 lessons learned, which the article examines in detail, are: (1) The rural population is difficult to define and is not homogeneous; (2) Much remains unknown about poverty in rural areas and the gifted children it affects; (3) Small schools, small towns, or rural areas have both advantages and disadvantages for students, including the gifted; (4) Identifying and serving gifted rural students from poverty requires consideration of their differing circumstances and values; (5) Rural high-ability students may lack foundation for success in advanced courses; (6) School climate and policies may inhibit academic advancement; (7) Students from poverty who have no family members experienced with higher education require exceptional levels of support in order to successfully graduate from college; (8) Rural high ability students from low-income families frequently require support to help overcome problems of inadequate self-efficacy, low self-esteem, and self-concept; (9) Students need to develop good study skills in order to be successful in rigorous courses; and (10) Developing a personal relationship with students of poverty is of key importance. These 10 lessons from Project Aspire offer a beginning point from which studies can be designed that identify the specific strategies most effective in finding and developing these gifted students' academic efforts.",

This paper describes the goals, components, eligibility, and selection procedures of the EXCITE program. The number of students annually nominated for Project EXCITE, the number and percentage selected, and reasons for attrition, are presented in tabular form. The four components described herein, aimed at addressing the major factors contributing to the achievement gap are parent education and support, peer support, academic enrichment, and individualized talent development. The author concludes by stating that while Project EXCITE has increased minority students' access to accelerated and advanced programs, accomplishing high achievement commensurate with students' abilities within those programs is more difficult.

        "description":"This article describes Project Athena, a Javits program funded by the U.S. Department of Education and developed through the Center for Gifted Education at the College of William and Mary. Project Athena seeks to find ways to help impoverished children develop advanced skills in reading comprehension, literary analysis, and persuasive writing. Its goals are to: (1) implement, refine, and extend research-based language arts curricular units of study in grades 3 to 5; (2) develop and implement professional training models for teachers, administrators, and broader school communities; (3) develop and implement instrumentation sensitive to low socioeconomic learners for the purpose of identification and assessment of learning; and (4) conduct research on short term and longitudinal student learning gains, as well as the mechanisms that promote the institutionalization of innovation through scaling up. Project Athena has collected both longitudinal and cross-sectional data to document learning effects and plans to conduct case study research on the most and least effective schools. Now in its fourth year of operation, the project has two years of data suggesting that the emphases of the curricula are beneficial to students from Title I schools in three states that have been identified as gifted, those identified as promising due to strong reading ability, more typical learners, and some special education students. Two-year findings on both student learning and teacher learning are summarized thusly: (1) Experimental students did significantly better than control students in both critical thinking and comprehension; (2) Gender differences were minimal; (3) All ability groups and ethnic groups registered significant growth gains from using the curriculum; (4) Experimental teachers scored significantly higher on both the frequency of use and effective use of differentiated strategies across both years; and (5) Experimental teachers who had used the curriculum for two years and received commensurate training demonstrated significantly enhanced use of differentiated strategies over first-year experimental teachers. It is noted in conclusion that developing the literacy of impoverished children is possible through a systematic approach that involves high-powered curriculum wedded to the use of powerful teaching and learning models linked to multiple modes of student assessment to gauge the extent of accrued learning.

Movies have the potential to enrich and influence the lives of gifted students in constructive ways. A good movie, for example, can become a meaningful metaphor that explains the essence of a young person's dilemma. When an appropriate movie is combined with a discussion and supportive follow-up activities, gifted students may view their situation through a more positive lens, enabling them to appreciate multiple aspects of difficult situations they may encounter. This article presents guidelines to teachers on the implementation of guided viewing sessions in school settings, an example of guided viewing, and a selected bibliography of films for guided viewing with gifted elementary and high school students.  Each film entry gives a description, suggested audience, Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating, and key issues for discussion that might become the focus of a guided viewing lesson.",

AAMSUS, begun in 2004, is built on the notions of finding economically disadvantaged children early, providing varying interventions, raising achievement, and having the intent of producing long-range effects in high school and postsecondary schooling. The intent of AAMSUS is to use accelerative and enrichment strategies to increase achievement and to change attitudes and interest in science and math. This article describes its program rationale, intervention, and efforts. Two Ohio cities, Toledo and Dayton (100 children in Toledo and 88 in Dayton) were the sites of the program. While some deficits were found in that some students did not display strong academic achievement while others did, the AAMSUS programs at both sites were successful in building enthusiasm for learning and the desire to be in the summer program. Among anecdotal data were that teachers reported improved student behavior, prompt homework completion, and that children were more engaged, more independent in learning, asked more questions, and were more patient with other children. The program also served to reinforce positive behaviors and reduce problem behaviors in the schools.",

Cooperative learning also promotes academic achievement, increases retention, and vastly improves student self-esteem and communication. Gifted students, however, often feel exploited when cooperative learning is used as a predominate method of instruction and groups are configured heterogeneously. In this article, the author examines the debate over  heterogeneous versus homogeneous grouping. The author also explains the five essential elements of cooperative learning to help pinpoint true cooperative learning materials.

        "description":"Geography is rapidly becoming more interactive, especially with the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and their adoption in the public and private sectors. The days of two-dimensional maps are quickly being replaced by geographic images that are stored electronically in computers and handheld devices, which also house layers of information that are available with the click of a button. This change in the way information is stored, retrieved, and used is transforming business, industry, and government, allowing for a more efficient use of time and money, and in some cases, saving lives. In order to prepare gifted learners to lead in the future, which will likely require competence in technological skills, social studies educators and teachers of the gifted should utilize GPS and GIS in their teaching, allowing students to use real-world information to address authentic problems.

The methodology used for the cross-site evaluation is described in this introductory article. The next five articles provide case studies of each site and vary in format and analysis of the data governed by environmental factors found at each site, the nature of problems identified and addressed by each system, and level of statistical power determined by sample sizes. Case studies of L1, L2, and L3, the sites funded for multiple years, include contributions from both the cross-site and internal site evaluations. The case study of Academic Enhancement (AE) is enhanced by data gathered in the course of a multiyear prevention demonstration project which had preceded TRM funding and had laid the groundwork for change at this site. The final article draws conclusions across sites, and discusses both best practices and barriers to success found in these sites. A Staff Survey is appended. (Contains 4 figures and 3 tables.)",

        "description":"This site is an intertribal residential grant school annually enrolling over 250 students in grades 1-8 from tribes located in three states on the Northern Great Plains. From its inception in 1890, the boarding school's mission has been to provide services for young children in need of a safe and supportive living and learning environment. For over a decade, this site has used strategies centered on respecting children, structuring students' time, and providing the therapeutic benefits of a well-maintained campus. This site also has a long history of believing in each child's inherent value and potential. When Therapeutic Residential Model funding commenced at the midpoint of the 2002-2003 school year, L1 focused these new resources on strengthening and refining its program. The number of personnel positions increased from 98 to 135, with new positions principally going to dormitory staff and four Masters-level counselor positions. This increase in staff allowed L1 to proactively address the children's developmental needs. The site also adopted and implemented the Applied Humanism caregiving model. In accordance with Applied Humanism, an interview was utilized that allowed the site to identify and hire applicants possessing the attitudes and skills necessary to be good caregivers, existing staff were trained so that they understood the kind of caregiving that would be expected of them, supervision procedures and practices were implemented that supported and encouraged good caregivers and provided time-limited assistance to those who were not, and relevant agency policies and procedures were revised as needed to align with the Applied Humanism philosophy. In addition, the Morningside program was brought in to systematically address the students' academic lags in reading. The results of implementing the Therapeutic Residential Model were a reduction in behavioral incidents, a decrease in the amount of money spent on external mental health services, an increase in the retention rate, an increase in academic skills in selected areas, and higher scores on pre-post measures of adjustment, interpersonal relationships, and adaptability.

        "description":"L2, one of the original sites first funded under the Therapeutic Residential Model Initiative in 2001-2002, is operated as a peripheral dormitory This dormitory cares for 185 boys and girls in grades 1-12 who attend local public schools. L2 presented an outstanding proposal which identified gaps in services and presented a reasonable budget to address those gaps by adding additional mental health services and increasing the number of residential and recreation staff. With only minor modifications to this budget, the site efficiently and effectively implemented the strategies it had proposed and utilized evaluation feedback to fine-tune systems and maximize positive outcomes. The Therapeutic Residential Model funds enabled the site to move from a functional dormitory to a therapeutic residential situation where the needs of students are assessed and addressed. Outcome indicators in spring 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 showed impacts in a number of areas when compared with the baseline year of 2000-2001: (1) Retention of students steadily increased going from 40.7% in 2000-2001 to 68.4% in 2004-2005; (2) 75 students graduated from high school during the four Therapeutic Residential Model years, compared with 41 in the preceding four years; (3) Academic Proficiency and ACT scores improved significantly; (4) Thirty-day cigarette use dropped from 62% in spring 2001 to 38% in spring 2005 among 7th and 8th graders, from 58% to 33% among 9th and 10th graders, and from 72% to 29% among 11th and 12th graders; and (5) Alienation indices showed an increase in feelings of inclusion and a decrease in lack of meaning. This site is an outstanding example of what can be done with a well-designed and responsibly implemented Therapeutic Model Program, and the measurable impacts which can result from such strategic use of resources.

        "description":"L3 is an intertribal residential school enrolling approximately 200 students in grades 5-8 from tribes in the northern Midwest. As a result of successful grant-writing which espoused Circle of Courage and Asset-Building, the school built up an impressive configuration of programs funded by a variety of sources, including a cadre of mental health professionals, and began increasingly to rely on their assessments and services. First funded by the Therapeutic Residential Model program in the 2002-2003 school year, L3 used the funding that year primarily to increase professional-level services of a psychiatrist and psychologist, and to maintain or expand programs which would otherwise have been terminated as funding from short-term sources was running out. Evaluation of this project began in January 2003, when the site was assessed and determined to be strongly oriented toward provision of Level Three, or professional-level, psychiatric and medical mental health services. The initial evaluation report identified a low retention rate and raised concerns that the presence of more than 200 staff on campus had resulted in a diffusion of responsibility, lack of consistency, and duplication or redundancy of services; that elements of the environment appeared to be detrimental to social development and emotional stability; and that an unusually high proportion of students were receiving psychiatric diagnoses and medication. The site was asked to address these issues, and additional funding was provided to bolster lower levels of triage by adding paraprofessional case managers to advocate or students and coordinate provision of services for them. Retention remained low at this site throughout the course of funding, and there were a high number of assaults and psychiatric hospitalizations compared with other sites.

After having documented significant improvement on a number of outcomes during a previous High Risk Youth Prevention demonstration grant, the site submitted a Therapeutic Residential Model proposal, requesting funding to continue successful elements developed under the demonstration grant and to expand mental health services. The site received Therapeutic Residential Model funding for school year 2001-2002. Once funds were received, the site chose to shift Therapeutic Residential Model funds to an intensive academic enhancement effort. While not in compliance with the Therapeutic Residential Model initiative and therefore not funded in subsequent years, this site created the opportunity to enhance the research design by providing a naturally occurring placebo condition at a site with extensive cross-sectional data baselines that addressed issues related to current federal educational policies.

Located in the heart of a reservation and serving local students, the K-12 school enrolled over 1,000 students. The site received Therapeutic Residential Model funding for the 2001-2002 school year. Initial evaluation of this site found an array of daunting problems throughout the school structure and functioning. There were some successes, including implementation of the Morningside reading program in the elementary school and some response from the community to the comprehensive evaluation report which provided an overview of the situation to policy-makers and community members. However instability in the system and a mid-year change in leadership complicated the process of implementation. By the end of the first year, it was clear that the feasibility of the original proposal was questionable and that an overhaul of he school's system and culture was necessary before a Therapeutic Residential Model could be implemented or significant change could come about. Therapeutic Residential Model funding was terminated at the end of the school year. As there was no substantial implementation of a Therapeutic Residential Model program, data gathered were utilized as representing a naturally occurring control or minimal treatment site.

        "description":"For well over a century, there have been boarding schools for American Indian children. The unique configuration that makes up each boarding school's environment attempts to meet the needs of as many students as possible, and tries to maximize positive outcomes. Recognizing that there is room for improvement, the Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP) provided several years of funding to a group of schools in order to enhance their services to children. The selected boarding schools were provided Therapeutic Residential Model (TRM) funding to carry out their proposals. To determine each site's accomplishments as well as the efficacy of this approach, the OIEP concurrently implemented a cross-site evaluation. The evaluation was designed to: (1) provide a record and evaluation of the characteristics of each site's environment prior to funding; (2) document the course of planning and implementation of changes during TRM funding; (3) collect data on incoming students and outcome data agreed upon by all sites; (4) provide ongoing analysis of the data to the sites so that administrators could make program changes; and (5) use process and outcome data from these diverse sites to draw cross-site conclusions. In this article, the authors discuss the results of a cross-site evaluation which is patterned on chaos theory. Data were collected in the course of complex changes occurring in systems. Also, staff and student surveys provided the basis for data comparison among boarding schools. Furthermore, this article is divided into four sections including: (1) the identification of the factors that were common to sites that achieved high retention, and it describes the prevailing situation at those sites that were not successful at retaining students; (2) the examination of the process and outcome indicators that presumably impacted the retention rate at each TRM site; (3) the examination of each boarding school's ability to establish a data feedback loop to guide dynamic system change; and (4) is entitled Elephants in the Living Room, and deals with common issues across sites. The survey data indicated that students coming into the boarding school or peripheral dormitory sites had similar risk factors. (Contains 1 table and 24 figures.)",

Congress thought about the cost, and then thought otherwise. As a result, Congress created a 2% solution, and then wrote the law in a way that discouraged identification of students with SED. Schools must obviously also have seen the fiscal wisdom in fewer identifications of such expensive students because they have never identified as many as 2% of all students as SED. This 2% solution pops up repeatedly in special education. Moreover, Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings recently announced some flexibility in federal NCLB policy regarding the disaggregated special education population. Her new initiative would permit schools to evaluate yearly progress for--you guessed it--2% of their scores against alternative standards. The author argues that the debate about 2% solution could be resisted and focus on to more effective professional education and development in support of teaching students whom teachers accurately perceive as difficult to teach.",

The thought goes something like this: Children with disabilities are better off in general education classrooms because special education classrooms are somehow inferior or produce minimal results (the opposite of &quot;rigorous&quot;). Still, the apparent dream is that students with learning disabilities, despite being identified as not doing well (actually failing) in general education, must be placed in general education so they will do better. The world of general education as it interfaces with the world of special education is becoming so complex that most teachers are on overload.

The purpose of this NJCLD report is to examine the concepts, potential benefits, practical issues, and unanswered questions associated with responsiveness to intervention (RTI) and learning disabilities (LD). After brief overview of the approach, issues related to RTI implementation, including use as an eligibility mechanism, parent participation, structure and components, professional roles and competencies, and needed research, are addressed. The report is neither a position paper nor a \"how-to guide\" for implementing an RTI approach. (Contains a list of 9 resources and 4 notes.)",

Successful was defined as average or above-average grades in college coursework. The study compared the cognitive and metacognitive performance of students with and without LD (N = 40). Although achievement levels for both groups were comparable, students with LD scored significantly lower than students without LD in word reading, processing speed, semantic processing, and short-term memory. Differences were also found between groups in self-regulation and number of hours of studying. Results showed that students with LD compensated for their processing deficits by relying on verbal abilities, learning strategies, and help seeking.",

Although the instructional level is a generally well-defined and researched construct, much less data exist on the acquisition rate (AR) component of an appropriate level of challenge. The current study used curriculum-based assessment to assess the AR of five fourth-grade students diagnosed with a reading disability and taught each 20 words from the Esperanto International Language over two sessions (10 each session). Students were observed during instruction, and the number of demonstrated off-task behaviors was converted to a mean rate of off-task behaviors/minute. Comparison of pre- and post-AR data showed that each student demonstrated an increase in off-task behaviors while rehearsing the word that immediately exceeded his or her AR.

With the advent of compulsory education in this country, awareness of and concern for these children grew. This article reflects the personal and professional journey and perceptions of the author as a young student, professor emerita at the University of Oregon, and a consultant in special education law. Her vantage point from which to observe and participate in LD in the 1960s was that of close association with Kirk, her doctoral advisor, and Engelmann, the creator of direct instruction, the highly effective pedagogy. Then, in the early '70s law school called, where she hoped to find tools to persuade schools to adopt proven, available teaching methods and materials. Now, 30 years later, it appears that hope may be realized through the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; 2001) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1997, 2004) (IDEA), as both compel attention to the research base for the services.",

Three decades later it is helpful to examine the status of the education of students with LD from a policy perspective in the context of the historical antecedents. The article evaluates the changes, progress, and challenges that have transpired through the decades for LD students. It responds to questions such as: Are students identified with LD receiving the free appropriate public education (FAPE) to which they are entitled? Are there more students classified as having LD than warranted? and Are students with LD being appropriately educated? The article concludes that, beginning with the IDEA amendments in 1997 through the current amendments, coupled with NCLB, this nation is moving back to the traditional standard of sameness. If it fails to address this issue, it not only allows the achievement of some students to be devalued, it also allows the question of whether society should bother educating children who cannot succeed.",

Despite years of effort and an extraordinary increase in the number of individuals considered as having LD, educators continue to grapple with vagaries and inconsistencies in classification, definition, and identification. They continue to face critical challenges about \"what is LD?\" \"who is LD and who isn't LD?\" and \"how do we know?\" Problems are in part related to a lack of clear boundaries between LD and other conditions. They also relate to definitions that serve political, legislative, advocacy, or intervention needs as well as research or \"scientific\" purposes. To muddle the problem further, classification problems are compounded by limited and often inadequate or inappropriate operational methods of identification.",

Similar efforts are being made to link other cognitive disorders of development to a molecular pathway involved in brain development. The objective is to disclose a developmental brain pathway leading to a brain that has a particular structure and physiology, a set of perceptual, cognitive, and metacognitive associations, and a behavior explained by these cognitive structures and processes. Environments and learning are apt to play their respective roles, but their full impact can only be understood in terms of the brain they impinge upon. Advances in neuroimaging research, including functional imaging and the new tract tracing techniques, will link specific behavioral phenotypes to areas of abnormal activation and, hopefully, specific mutations. Finally, improved classification on the basis of identified gene mutations, brain activation patterns, and behavioral phenotypes will trigger the design and testing of specific therapies implemented at earlier and earlier stages of development, with the promise of much improved success for the expression of each child's full potential.",

It is clear that these issues are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, they are intimately connected. Progress has been made in examining these issues, but future challenges will be substantial. This author of this article provides his general definition and some elements of his specific subtypal definitions of LD. The definitions arise from the part of his research program during the last 40 years that has focused on delineating reliable and valid subtypes of LD. The author concludes that virtually every advance in this field has been inspired and/or carried out by scientist-practitioners.

The accidental phenomenon of learning disabilities (LD) has pursued the scientific truths in axioms for 42 years. Writing facts and perceptions regarding the history and future of LD enables theorists and practitioners to determine if any of its constructs and practices reaches consensus as universally accepted axioms of undeniable truths. In mid-1900, rapid growth in population, social needs, as well as political pressures compelled medicine, rehabilitation, psychology, and education to serve children in subcategories of sensory, physical, mental, and communicative disabilities. LD as it is known today was not included. Some legislators, educators, and parents believed certain children, even in the accepted categories of disability, should be excluded from schooling. At the time, no philosophical, ethical, or legal consensus guided comprehensive service planning for (or from) individuals with disabilities. In this article, the author reflects upon the three lessons that  were learned early in his education, and remain critical foundations for his current and future practices. These are: (1) each child must be studied and understood in depth; (2) methods exist to help any child learn; and (3) few children are resistant to correct interventions.",

        "description":"Over the past 20 years, teachers have been under continuous pressure to increase students' academic achievement gains. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), the latest effort in the 20+-year-old school reform movement, is a federal mandate that demands in part that school districts implement science-based instructional strategies to ensure that children meet the standards set forth in content curricula. Science-based interventions in the social domain are notably absent. This omission is unfortunate. Children's social status significantly impacts their participation in the reciprocal teaching-learning process. Many horror stories have detailed the adverse outcomes of ignoring the school's social milieu, from the tragedy at Columbine High School to the many students with learning disabilities who spend their school years depressed and lonely (cf., Margalit &amp; Al-Yagon, 1994). Although schools define their mission and are evaluated based on students' academic achievement, the reality is that the mental and social health of classrooms impacts everyone's learning. This article addresses the scope of the problem in learning disabilities; advances in social skills research; studies of effective interventions; and implications for the future.",

        "author":["Deshler, Donald D."],
        "description":"Historically, most of the professional literature in the field as well as federal funding initiatives in research and program development have been directed at younger students with learning disabilities (LD). The prevailing assumption (or hope) has been that if intervention took place at a young age, many of the manifestations of the learning disability would be minimized or avoided altogether in later years (Kirk & Elkins, 1975). However, the field has learned that adolescents with LD have enduring and unique characteristics that are manifested in differing ways as development and setting demands change (e.g., Brinckerhoff, Shaw, & McGuire, 1992; Lenz & Deshler, 2005; Mellard & Deshler, 1991). Even if children with LD receive quality interventions during their early years, in all likelihood, their disability will endure into adolescence and adulthood. The need for effective intervention strategies for these older individuals is as great as, if not greater than, the need for interventions for younger children because of all the emotional overlays that generally emerge as individuals mature and continue to encounter significant failure. Hence, it is critical that the LD field develops a research and intervention agenda that is designed to address multiple aspects of the condition of LD across multiple age ranges. As compelling as the case for early intervention can be, if that case is made at the expense of addressing the equally problematic and unique set of problems presented by older-aged individuals, the long-term effects of such a policy will be devastating for thousands of individuals with LD.",

        "description":"The author was asked to address the future of the field of learning disabilities (LD) from the perspective of a director of one of the five Institutes for Research on Learning Disabilities (IRLD) funded by the Office of Special Education Programs more than 25 years ago. The theme of each of the Institutes differed; the Minnesota IRLD focused on assessment and decision making. Research was conducted on how school personnel sorted students who were achieving poorly in school into those who were and those who were not LD, and worked to develop improved ways to use assessment information to plan and adapt instructional interventions. Considerable variability at that time (late 1970s and early '80s) was pointed to in the kinds and numbers of students receiving LD services in different settings, and to the tremendous variability in criteria used by state and local education agencies. On many days in many ways, educators asked this question: Who are students with learning disabilities and what is being done for them in special education? On many occasions since then, the author has argued that education spends far too much professional time making predictions about students' lives and far too little time making a difference in their lives.",

        "author":["Lyon, G. Reid"],
        "description":"Beginning in 1983 with the Connecticut Longitudinal Study (Shaywitz, Shaywitz, & Fletcher, 1992), with additions to the NICHD research program in 1987 (Lyon, 1996), educators were able to initiate new multidisciplinary prospective, longitudinal studies to define and classify LDs, to identify the multiple factors responsible for their presentation, and to develop multiple interventions and determine their effectiveness. Indeed, cohorts of children recruited for study in 1983 and 1987 are still being studied by collaborative multidisciplinary teams at 44 research sites as they enter their adolescence and adulthood. Extensive replicated findings from this NICHD research network have been reviewed elsewhere in detail (see Lyon, Fletcher & Barnes, 2003, and Lyon, Fletcher, Fuchs, & Chhabra, in press). While educators have learned a great deal, they must sustain and build on research investments to ensure that the educational and social needs of children and adults with LDs are addressed in an optimal manner. First, research must continue efforts to refine the definition of LDs. Data reveals that IQ-achievement discrepancies and exclusionary criteria are invalid markers for LDs, reinforcing a wait-to-fail model. It is known that early identification and prevention is not only critical but essential (Lyon et al., in press), and researchers must have the courage to jettison these concepts if necessary. Second, replicated research findings must inform educational policy. Third, replicated scientific research findings must inform professional development and instructional practices. Effecting meaningful change in the lives of children and teachers requires that  research not only have sound scientific findings, but also that it understands how to translate them so that they inform efforts in complex educational environments.",

This article describes the actions the author, an attorney within the field of learning disabilities who served as a legislative assistant to the U.S. senator who chaired the Senate subcommittee on education as the country began to deal with special education. It was at that point, that he realized that the nation needed to have federal laws and federal oversight of what was happening to these millions of students in state and local programs. The author describes several court cases that demonstrate the loopholes of the amendments to IDEIA and their impact on everyday life. He concludes, however, that parents have never given up in their right to secure appropriate services for their children, and they never will. Even with intentionally punitive and confusing amendments to the IDEIA, the nation can learn from history to work together, especially with national, state, and local organizations, to make this new statute even more successful for students with learning disabilities, their parents, and their teachers.",

In the 1980s, there were few who recognized that adults with disabilities were an important resource in the education of students with disabilities or that issues of race and culture had consequence for identifying and delivering services to these children. Reflection on education reform efforts, cannot help but make one wonder, \"Are we there yet?\" Through practice, research, litigation, small and gross mistakes, and from parents, advocates, and colleagues professionals in the field have learned that some directions proved less costly to children and to school districts while achieving more effective outcomes. In reviewing the work over the past several decades, three major foci have been identified: (1) access to free appropriate public education; (2) achievement of quality academic, behavioral and social outcomes; and (3) establishment of a unitary inclusive education system to prepare all students for a full and productive adult life. The central features of a unitary inclusive system include strong leadership, quality teachers, challenging curriculum, differentiated instruction, careful and regular assessments, engagement of parents and community, and a focus on the meeting of standards and the achievement of outcomes. Based on this evaluative review, the article concludes, \"no, we are not there yet.\"",

There are new names (authors) and old names, and some significant advances that hold promising new opportunities. Sadly, educators are still trying to define learning disabilities, and some have begun to argue for the more postmodern and critical definitions (more about this later). In part, the field has been restricted ever since the first legislation locked us into a reductionistic way of seeing, defining, and treating LD. The legalism surrounding LD also has kept educators asking themselves \"Is it legal?\" or \"Can we get away with it?\" rather than \"Is this the very best we can do?\" Hopefully, refinements to law will open up new possibilities.

It has been approximately half a century since learning disabilities were first recognized in the United States. Throughout that time ubiquitous &quot;paradigm wars&quot; have been a prominent feature of the discourse surrounding the field (Andrews et al., 2000; Brantlinger, 1997). In this article, the author briefly and admittedly incompletely, steps back to characterize where the field has been, before describing his vision for the future. His hope for the future is perhaps the increased need to serve culturally and linguistically diverse students will serve as an impetus to approach the work of providing educational opportunities for students with learning disabilities in a more integrative fashion in the coming decades.",

He believes that while there are technical problems that educators should be able to fix (definition of LD, best instructional practices for students so identified, powerful secondary programs that \"hold\" students and add value to their lives), these issues, while important, are not nearly as important as the shift of the aim of public schooling away from preparing democratic citizens and offering meaningful opportunities for all students. Such problems exceed the reach of special educators. Today, the most important action for special educators is to become stewards of the public schools. This article presents the author's plea to view schools as moral places where society prepares youth to take on the role of advancing democratic ideals, to refocus schooling on deeper more moral premises than consumerism, and to seriously consider working to repeal ineffective laws regarding education.",

The article reflects the personal perceptions of the author as a \"participant observer\" in a variety of activities related to technology applications in special education beginning in the early 1960s (Blackhurst, 1965, 1967). At that time, educators were focused on the potential that audio-visual aids, such as 16mm film projectors and tape recorders, had for instruction. Researchers and instructional designers also were engaged in developing programmed instruction materials that had their foundation in Pressey's 1926 invention of the first teaching machine (Blackhurst & Edyburn, 2000). As mainframe computers and their applications became more prevalent, technology gradually emerged as the terminology of choice. Appended is list of web site resources related to technology and LD.",

The author is just as convinced today as she was at the beginning of her career that children can be taught to be more adaptive. She does not believe that educators cannot afford to fail, because this is germane to the educational mission. Perhaps not a perfect analogy, but she thinks of medical science confronted with a particularly resistant viral strain, unresponsive to existing medications. Ignoring the virus is not an option. Instead, medical research efforts are intensified and persist until they succeed in containing the virus and improving health. Similarly, despite the challenges, commitment to effective social skill interventions ought to be increased not relaxed. The author concludes by saying that few things are more important than the successful education of all of children, particularly those with special needs.",

As an adult with learning disabilities, he describes how he has learned to manage his language and memory barriers through assistive technology and outside support, and he nourishes himself through therapy or simply surrounding himself with family and friends who understand his innovative use of language. Shortly after graduating from college, he developed a personal action plan that came to include standard tools, modifications and accommodations of task and expectations, and assistive technology. Today, individuals with disabilities have access to assistive technology through legislation, including the Assistive Technology Act of 1998. This law affirms that technology is a valuable tool for improving the lives of Americans with disabilities. It also affirms the federal role in funding and promoting access to assistive technology devices and services for individuals with disabilities. Neuropsychologists today are helping to provide answers to cognition. Over time, this information will slowly funnel its way into academic and employment settings. The landscape of the brain is one of the most important areas of training for individuals with learning disabilities, parents, service providers, and employers. Through such newfound research and understanding, the field of learning disabilities will evolve to new heights in providing services and teaching students and employees. As more specifics on the workings of the brain emerge, a shift in education will occur, which will help define and unify the voices of individuals with learning disabilities.",

It is a variable that is often overlooked or taken for granted as an interesting but meaningless statistic, however, the positive impact of good school attendance on academic achievement may be greater than historically thought (Johnston, 2000, Lamdin, 1996). Coutts (1998) suggests student attendance should be charted and monitored weekly, since high attendance rates are indicators of effective schools. The initial focus of this research study was to determine if there was a significant, positive relationship between student achievement in Ohio schools, as measured by the Ohio Proficiency Tests, and student attendance in grades 4,6,9, and 12. All data used for this study were taken directly from the ODE web site. The study is based on the most recent information available to the public (1999 data) for school building proficiency test and attendance averages. Table 1 displays results of the correlational study for each grade level taking the Ohio Proficiency Test. This overview study of school attendance and its relationship to student achievement provides an initial forum for discussion, debate, and further research. Continued studies may provide additional information that may lead to strategies for improving student attendance and academic achievement. (Contains 7 tables.)",

The Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Blindness and Low Vision at Mississippi State University recently conducted research on the estimated costs of providing national Medicare coverage for vision rehabilitation services. Medicare is a health insurance program for people aged 65 and older, some disabled people who are younger than age 65, and people with end-stage renal disease. When beneficiaries with disabilities reach age 65, they are included in the &quot;aged&quot; group. Medicare Part A covers the costs of inpatient hospital care, care in a skilled nursing facility, and some home health care. There is no monthly Part A premium for most beneficiaries. (A monthly premium is charged if the beneficiary or spouse does not have 40 or more quarters of Medicare covered employment.) Medicare Part B is an optional program that requires a separate monthly premium. It covers physicians' services, outpatient hospital services, certain home health services, and durable medical equipment (CMS, 2004). Services that are provided by vision rehabilitation professionals would be covered under Medicare Part B. Approximately 93% of the total Medicare population are covered by both Part A and Part B (CMS, n.d.). The purpose of this article is to report the estimated number of Medicare beneficiaries who are blind or have low vision who have Part B coverage and, among them, the number who are likely to benefit from vision rehabilitation services.

This study examined CSA experiences and associations with demographic factors, self-reported health and risky behaviors among senior high school students in four provinces in central and northern China. Method:: Students in four schools in Hubei, Henan, Hebei, and Beijing provinces participated in an anonymous, self-completed questionnaire survey. From a total enrolment of 3,261 students in the target classes in years 11 and 12, 2,300 (70.5%) returned valid questionnaires. Mean age was 17.2 years. The questionnaire was adapted from prior CSA research in Australia and utilized standard scales for depression, self-esteem, and youth risk behavior. Results:: Prevalence of any unwanted sexual experience before the age of 16 years was higher among females (16.7%) than males (10.5%). Sexual penetration was rarely reported (1%), while 7% reported at least one type of physical contact abuse (female 8.9%, male 5.0%). Risk of any CSA was not associated with the existence of siblings (one-child vs. two- or more child families), rural/urban residence during childhood, or parental education. Males and females with CSA were more depressed and suicidal, and drank alcohol more often, than unaffected adolescents. Contact CSA was strongly associated with sexual intercourse (ever) for both males and females. Females with CSA were more likely than others to engage in anorexic and bulimic behaviors, while males with CSA were often involved in violence. Conclusion:: Social norms for consensual sexual experiences differ between Eastern and Western societies. CSA experiences also differ, with substantially less penetrative and physical contact abuse in China. However, the psychological and behavioral profile of abused, young Chinese people, including the additional burden associated with contact abuse, is similar to that found in other cultures.",

Traditional intelligence and achievement tests assessed students? knowledge; tests based on Luria?s (1966) information processing model measured cognitive and metacognitive capacities; and learning potential was via dynamic assessments of student?tutor interactions while completing patterns.

There were in general no gender and age group differences on these self-perceptions, with the exception that younger students perceived their families as more hardy than did older students. The results of regression analysis indicated that family hardiness and emotional intelligence had separate and direct effects on self-perceived creativity, and their effects were additive, rather than multiplicative, as their interaction terms did not yield significant increment in variance accounted for in the criterion of prediction. Similar results were obtained when different components of emotional intelligence were considered, with some suggestive evidence that family hardiness could interact with specific components of emotional intelligence in the prediction.

Four hundred forty-seven correlation coefficients from 21 studies and 45,880 participants were retrieved. The mean correlation coefficient was small (r = .174; 95% CI = .165 ? .183), but heterogeneous; this correlation coefficient indicates that the relationship between creativity test scores and IQ scores is negligible.

        "description":"This study examines the relationship between both first language (L1) and second language (L2) reading attitudes, and learners' performance in L2 extensive reading. Four reading attitude variables were identified (Comfort, Anxiety, Value, Self-perception), both in L1 and L2, according to learners' responses to a questionnaire. Results of analyses using these four variables are summarised on two levels. First, the study supports the transfer of the affective domain of reading (attitudes) from L1 to L2. But L2 proficiency does not affect this transfer in the way in which the linguistic threshold hypothesis would predict if this hypothesis were applied to the affective domain. Since this hypothesis explains the transfer of the cognitive domain of reading (i.e., reading abilities and strategies), these findings suggest that cognitive and affective domains of reading relate differently in L1 and L2. Although the transfer of reading attitude is generally supported, there are different degrees of transferability among different attitude variables: what learners think (Value) is more likely to transfer from L1 to L2 than what they feel (Comfort, Anxiety, Self-perception). Second, from a more pedagogical point of view, the positive feeling towards reading, both in L1 and L2, facilitates learners' performance in extensive reading. Merely thinking that reading is beneficial to oneself does not represent a strong enough motivation. The study has thus demonstrated the importance of understanding learners' attitudes (particularly feelings) to reading both in L1 and L2 for encouraging L2 learners' involvement in extensive reading.",

        "description":"Extensive research on reading in a first language has shown the critical role fluency plays in successful reading. Fluency alone, however, does not guarantee successful reading. Cognitive and metacognitive reading strategies and schemata that readers utilize also play important roles in constructing meaning from text. Most research, however, indicates that good reading ability is virtually impossible in the absence of fast and accurate word recognition skills and reading fluency. Therefore, efficient ways of improving fluency must be developed. In answer to this need, extensive reading programs have been implemented as an effective approach in EFL settings. Another method, repeated reading, seems equally promising. The main objective of the current study is to focus on whether and how assisted repeated reading with an auditory reading model enhances EFL readers' fluency. Some comparisons of Japanese university students' performances in repeated reading and extensive reading programs are also made in an attempt to see gains in reading fluency and comprehension, and to explore some characteristics which are unique to assisted repeated reading. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of participants' reading behaviors suggest that assisted repeated reading is equally as effective as extensive reading in increasing EFL readers' silent reading rate, and favorably affects learners' perceptions of reading activities. Furthermore, the results indicate the specific role the repetition and listening components of assisted repeated reading play to facilitate reading comprehension. Assisted repeated reading can potentially develop weak ESL/EFL readers' fluency and help them become independent readers by providing a distinct form of scaffolding.",

A review of recent research from the past five and a half years from four leading scientific journals of reading is offered. Research questions that motivate the selection of statistical procedures are examined for each study. Results show that Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is utilized more than Regression Models (RM) primarily because researchers are asking questions about the variation between and within groups of variables and are not predicting performance on dependent variables via independent variables. The strong resemblances and differences between ANOVA and RMs are discussed in light of the review of research, and through a detailed critique of Brantmeier's (2003) study with different research questions and additional analysis of data, the relationship between statistical procedures is further exemplified.

Unlike the multiple choice or cloze tests, the recall protocol is a truly integrative authentic-task measure, firmly grounded on a constructivist model of reading comprehension. Given an understanding of the model, the literature base on memorial representation, and the formulation of a \"weak-rule\" scoring system, the present study demonstrates a computerized recall protocol scoring system that has high correlation with traditional manual scoring methods. The results further demonstrate that the computerized procedure provides efficiency in delivery and scoring, enhances consistency, is practical for large-scale assessment, and can lead to improved diagnostic and placement testing. Using this system as part of a multiple-measures approach, valid and reliable quantitative score information is readily available and directly linked to a qualitative database ripe for additional examination to advance L2 reading comprehension research and model development.",

        "description":"Although the use of \"text coverage\" to measure the intelligibility of reading materials is increasing in the field of vocabulary teaching and learning, to date there have been few studies which address the methodological variables that can affect reliable text coverage calculations. The objective of this paper is to investigate how differing vocabulary size, text length, and sample size might affect the stability of text coverage, and to define relevant parameters. In this study, 23 varying vocabulary sizes taken from the high frequency words of the British National Corpus and 26 different text lengths taken from the \"Time Almanac\" corpus were analyzed using 10 different sample sizes in 1,000 iterations to calculate text coverage, and the results were analyzed using the distribution of the mean score and standard deviation. The results of the study empirically demonstrate that text coverage is more stable when the vocabulary size is larger, the text length is longer, and more samples are used. It was also found that the stability of text coverage is greater from a larger number of shorter samples than from a fewer number of longer samples. As a practical guideline for educators, a table showing minimum parameters is included for reference in computing text coverage calculations.",

        "description":"Effective second language vocabulary acquisition is particularly important for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners who frequently acquire impoverished lexicons despite years of formal study. This paper comprehensively reviews and critiques second language (L2) reading vocabulary research and proposes that EFL teachers and administrators adopt a systematic framework in order to speed up lexical development. This framework incorporates two approaches: 1) promoting explicit lexical instruction and learning strategies; and 2) encouraging the use of implicit lexical instruction and learning strategies. The three most crucial explicit lexical instruction and learning strategies are acquiring decontextualized lexis, using dictionaries and inferring from context. Implicit lexical instruction and learning can take many forms including the use of integrated task sets and narrow reading; however, this framework emphasizes extensive reading, which is arguably the primary way that EFL learners can build their reading vocabulary to an advanced level. The principal notion underlying this framework is that the most effective and efficient lexical development will occur in multifaceted curriculums that achieve a pedagogically sound balance between explicit and implicit activities for L2 learners at all levels of their development.",

Media debate leading up to the adoption by the French parliament of a law banning the hijab at school fits into a global discourse, but also presents local strategies of incorporation and silencing. The targets of scrutiny are primarily first and second generation migrants, a large and increasingly visible portion of whom live in rundown public housing and attend 'problem' schools associated with violence and failure. It is important therefore to consider the position, and positioning, of Muslims in relation to media representation.

Elite higher education and tuition in the U.S. and Australia are compared.

We develop this argument around three key propositions. First, we explore Confucianism and the civil service examination system in ancient China to situate the expectation of 'wishing for dragon children' historically. Second, we show that processes of re-traditionalisation exercise considerable vitality in modern China. They were used by Chinese Communist authorities for political control, and they now interrupt the de-traditionalising 'Quality Education' reforms. Third, we show that the re-traditionalisation of diasporic Chinese-Australians is evident in their negotiations with Australian education around their desires for 'dragon children'. Parental 'wishing for dragon children' hinders or deflects China's education reforms and subtly affects education in Australia. How to understand, judge and act on the problems of re-traditionalisation and detraditionalisation remain significant concerns for educational research.",

Further, genealogies of governmentality attempt to create this space with a focus on how conduct is conducted. In this paper I suggest that genealogies of governmentality are one way to create critical analyses of the education of young children. Sociologies of childhood consider childhood to be a relational concept, functioning in relation to adulthood. I argue that genealogies are one way to illuminate these relationships, in particular pointing towards the ways in which the education of young children is deeply embedded in a range of complex and contradictory 'adult' discourses and knowledges, including those of motherhood, politics, worker, citizen and the economy. To illustrate this I provide an analysis of the provision of preschool education in Queensland's government schools.",

Drawing on research investigating the governance of the lives of young children in Australia, we examine the rights of children to be both seen and heard as competent research participants.

The research truths we use to construct classroom practices decide the meanings of our actions, thoughts and feelings and our interactions with children. Following Foucault (1980), I see these truths as intimately connected with power and its effects on us. The truths of \"brain research\" have inundated early childhood education at an extraordinary pace in recent years and the recent \"Learning Brain Down Under Expo\" in South Australia which attracted over 700 educators offers us a timely opportunity to critically reflect on it and its effects. My critical reflections use the politics of logic contrasting the \"tree-like\" logic of linear causality and rhizomatic logic (Delueze and Guattari 1987) to point to key questions that I hope other early childhood educators can use to critically reflect on the truths of \"brain research\" and its meanings and effects in early childhood education.",

However, learning in any discipline area consists of both product and process. While the product may be quite different in different domains, there are general principles of pedagogy that encourage creativity of process. \"Creative teaching\" could be said to consist of setting up a learning environment that encourages students to see the essence as well as the detail of the subject, to formulate and solve problems, to see the connectedness between diverse areas, to take in and react to new ideas, and to include the element of surprise in their work. Such a learning environment involves not only appropriate materials and assessment techniques, but also methods of learning that address the important affective dimensions of creativity.",

This paper draws on findings from an empirical study of a professional doctorate program in nursing. During this study, a curriculum model that focuses on the intersecting spheres of university, profession and workplace was used as a prompt in interviews. Although this curriculum model has become a reference point for any discussion about the framework for professional doctorates in Australia, it became clear during the study that the predominant themes in the nursing program were different to those in the model. The disparity between the accepted model and the findings from the nursing program are discussed and an alternative model is offered. In this alternative model, the university retains its central role, combined with the themes of professional practice and change. These themes provide a curriculum framework that reflects the knowledge, experiences and intentions of both the students and the staff. The broader implications of the alternative model are also discussed.",

        "author":["Smith, Erica"],
        "description":"This paper examines young workers' beginning engagement in learning through work, placing it in the context of Australian policy on entry-level training. Eleven young people were followed through their first year of full-time work and the significant adults involved in their working and learning lives were also interviewed. The study demonstrates that the presence of a contract of training (an apprenticeship or traineeship) is a strong predictor of a young worker's propensity to regard the workplace as a learning environment. However, unsatisfactory interactions with employment or training providers can create disillusionment with policy interventions that are meant to assist. Moreover, the habit of learning through work is not only a function of policy and training frameworks, but is also affected by individuals' abilities to learn how to learn. The paper concludes by arguing that, for those young people starting work who are not in a contract of training, additional assistance may be required in order for them to continue the habit of lifelong learning in the new environment of work.",

        "description":"A large and burgeoning literature has established that mastery goal orientations yield positive cognitive and behavioural educational outcomes. Less research has focused on the psychological antecedents of adopting mastery goals. The present study draws upon prominent psychological theories of achievement motivation, specifically the expectancy-value theory of Eccles, Wigfield and colleagues (Wigfield and Eccles 2002), to explore possible antecedents of students' mastery goals. Based on this theoretical framework, our study focused on children's perceptions of their competencies in English and maths and how these related to intrinsic value and mastery goals for English and maths. Questionnaires were used to gather data about Year 6 (N=60) participants' perceived competence, intrinsic value and mastery goal orientation, and correlational analyses established the direction and strength of the relationships between the perceptions. Participants were targeted for follow-up interviews (n=17) according to a matrix of low and high competence perceptions and mastery goals, with students selected from within each of six focal groups. Interview responses were reported according to emergent themes, from which we describe how the constructs under consideration relate to one another and highlight implications for educational practice.",

This study of a balanced sample of male and female leaders from a cross-section of Victorian schools in the late 1990s reveals that there are key variations related to sectorial identity, level and scale of school, institutional histories and even student gender. It supports the development of nuanced theories about leadership and gender that combat essentialist stereotypes which have dominated in past discourse. It also combats simplistic claims based on school level, sector and student gender.

Its exploration is in three parts: first, it seeks to account for the ambivalent status of practitioner research in the larger context of the modern university; second, it moves on from this account to argue both the value and the limitations of practitioner research as a contemporary mode of knowledge production in education; and finally, it suggests ways that practitioner research might be less delimited in terms of its capacities to produce knowledge that is useful to a wider range of stakeholders.",

        "description":"In contrast to the plethora of literature that suggests that the increasing gulf between teachers and young people is due to the shifting interests and expectations of young people, the focus of this paper is on the roles teachers play in this relationship. Provoking our interest is a concern that some of the assumptions that underpin \"mainstream\" pedagogic theory and practice might actually contribute, albeit unwittingly, to hardening rather than softening the communication divide. Drawing on an incident that took place between a group of 7-8 year old males in a primary school setting, we reveal the limits of a teaching paradigm that encourages teachers to adopt authoritative positions from which to separate and individualise student behaviour. In theoretical terms, we argue that the application of this paradigm asserts an exaggerated notion of agency to individuals in the construction of identity. In practical terms it promotes processes that individualise behaviour as a way of dealing with miscreance. Together these manifest themselves as a \"pedagogy of separation\". The process of building more productive pedagogic relationships, we conclude, needs to begin with teachers better recognising and engaging with the collective investments of young people.",

        "author":["Campbell, Craig"],
        "description":"Of all Australian secondary schools in the current period, the government comprehensive high school is in most difficulty. This article looks at the developing fate of this school in terms of middle class social practice in relation to changing schooling loyalties. The recent work of Michael Pusey, Stephen Ball, Janet McCalman, Richard Teese and Judith Brett on the middle class is reviewed to give the discussion an historical and contemporary sociological context. The main idea addressed is that the middle class is being 'forced' to leave public schools. Government policy on state aid since the 1960s is interpreted as encouraging the departure of the middle class from public schooling, though not evenly in all regions or different kinds of government school. The article analyses census data for New South Wales from 1976 to 2001, using the categories of family income, fathers' occupation and labour force status as quantifiable indicators of changing school loyalties in the middle class. The article concludes that state comprehensive high schools face a difficult future. Increasingly these schools are seen as schools of \"last resort\", or schools to which students are sent  where active choices are not possible, or are not made by apparently neglectful parents. This occurs in a period in which 'good citizenship' is defined less in terms of responsibility to the welfare of broad collectivities in society, but in the informed strategic pursuit of private interest.",

We draw attention to some of the tensions that exist between different agencies, including different agencies within government. Through this detailed case study it is possible to identify parallels between LLEN and other social partnership initiatives developing in other parts of the world. This process of situating a specific Australian partnership within the wider trend to social partnerships permits a more contextualised analysis. It shows the way social partnerships are developing as a consequence of education reform shaped by neo-liberal governance and various patterns of compliance and resistance to this political rationality.",

        "author":["Billett, Stephen"],
        "description":"This paper proposes co-opting high school students' paid part-time work experiences to develop their critical understanding of the world of work, beyond their schooling through post-school pathways. It argues that unlike work experience program or work placements organised through schools, students' paid part-time employment provides authentic workplace experiences that have the potential to inform students deeply and critically about the world of work. These experiences include the reciprocal obligations that arise from paid employment and, as such, provide a rich base for high school students to explore the world of work, relationships in the workplace, what constitutes more and less valued work and how work is organised and rewarded. The co-opting of students' work experiences for school-based activities may provide a useful base to explore the world of work both for those students who are employed part-time and those not employed in part-time work, but able to learn from their peers' experiences. To assist achieving these goals some pedagogic tools are required to effectively describe, analyse and illuminate these experiences in classroom settings. A way of describing and critically appraising this paid work is proposed through individual and collective consideration of the activities and interactions that constitute students' paid work experience. Given the difficulty of organising workplace placements and work experience programs, and the potentially richer outcomes, co-opting students' paid  work experiences presents a viable and worthwhile resource available in most classrooms for learning more about the world of work.",

        "description":"There is little reason why educational research in Australia should be progressive and highly developed given that its history and direction are subject to the economic and political determinants of an increasingly conservative and uncertain world. Whether or not educational research is an entirely derivative field or a semi-distinctive social science, is essentially qualitative or quantitative in character, desires knowledge that is vaguely accurate or accurately vague, seeks epistemological or ontological explanation, remains to be seen as history works itself out. It cannot be considered a neutral endeavour and demands that researchers identify a political perspective or worldview from which new knowledge is described and interpreted. In developing an approach to participatory action research, in particular from working with Indigenous communities, a number of challenges and knowledges have emerged that are described in this paper and which embrace community partnership, two-way enquiry learning and the educational public sphere. Participatory action research as outlined here may be the only framework appropriate for democratic community research although it is not as yet legitimated within the pantheon of available methodologies and philosophies.",

The article explores the possibility that this early image of a teacher--the aging warrior Phoenix--could be a source for later representations of the teaching function. In an effort to place this historical image into a larger context of cultural symbolism relating to pedagogy, the article asks, why is this \"first\" educator a man? By what narrative procedure was a man contrived to assume roles such as nurturing and childrearing that had always been (and continue to be) represented as feminine occupations? Using the work of Luce Irigaray, the article raises issues about the sex of the teacher in order to disrupt the seemingly obvious sex-neutrality of modern images of education, which define teaching and learning as humanistic, as social and cultural practices for which gender is irrelevant, and through which abstract disciplines such as literacy and numeracy are represented as transcending the physicality of the sexed body. It attempts to expose the constant deference modern educators unconsciously pay to patriarchal models of the pedagogical relationship, and to reveal the repression of sexual difference at the core of the mythology from which Western images of education have been generated.",

Specifically, I question the assumption that the global imagination constitutes one shared, common experience that is the same across nations. In contrast, I demonstrate that though American and Australian students are certainly among the elite in global terms, their shared economic position does not necessarily correspond to a common global imagination. Instead, they have markedly different notions of both national and global identities. American students' strong national identity often prevents them from exploring the possibilities of global affiliation. Australian students' relatively weak national identity allows for a robust global sense of place, but is sometimes constrained by a limited tolerance for racial and ethnic diversity. In conclusion, I argue that the global imagination has not one, but numerous manifestations, which have the potential to both enable and constrain the enhancement of justice and democracy in a global context.",

        "description":"This study provides empirical evidence to support the validity of using a  content-specific reading test for college placement decisions. A content-specific reading test presents passages exclusively from the subject area for which the placement decision is intended. Forty-nine students in a human anatomy class were administered a content-specific reading test, a content general reading test, and a test of prior domain knowledge on the first day of class. In a forward-solution multiple regression, the content-specific reading test was a significant predictor (p <.01) of course grades, but neither the content-general reading test nor the knowledge test added significantly to the prediction. Thus, neither domain knowledge nor generic reading ability provided an independent contribution to the prediction, after partialing out the effects of content-specific reading ability.",

The information garnered from the survey was used to inform the general public and specific groups as to the degree of support held for the public education of gifted children and youth. A 21-question instrument from a previous study was used to assess this study. A random sample was drawn to represent the entire state of Mississippi. Fifty-eight percent surveyed were female. The majority of those responding were White (68.8%). The total household incomes with the highest representation were those in the $25,000-34,999 range (20.2%). The most highly represented age range was 35 to 45 years of age (21.3%). The education level most highly represented was graduation from college (28.2%). More than half of those responding (56.2%) personally knew a gifted child. The data indicate that the majority of the public in Mississippi recognizes the importance of gifted education, as well as the need to assist schools financially in developing specialized programs to serve gifted children.",

She has further learned that one needs a strong technological support system in the school to ensure that access can be restored. The physical setting for online learning is important, as well. Students need to have a place where they can respond to their learning. The regular classroom would not be the most appropriate environment for this type of independent study program. Funding must also be considered when dealing with distance learning programs. Finally, the small print the kind that reads \"System Requirements\" will always be the first piece of information she reviews before considering any type of technology program for her students! The use of distance learning in an elementary setting has truly just begun. She realizes now how important it is for educators to have a full understanding of what is available for their students through the use of technology and, more importantly, how to access what is available. Professional development regarding technology in the field is only in the infant stages. Teachers, need to find the time and resources to become proficient in this vast field. Her professional development plan will always include goals on how to improve her knowledge in this area. To ensure that students are provided with everything they deserve in an educational setting, it is a teachers' responsibility to pursue and move forward with their own learning in this vast virtual realm that provides such rich possibilities for exploration.",

Traumatic exposure has been linked to higher rates of psychological and physical health problems. Writing about trauma or stress has been shown to improve health and reduce stress, but can negatively affect mood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether art therapy is as effective as writing therapy in improving psychological and health outcomes. Participants in the writing condition, but not the art therapy condition, showed a decrease in social dysfunction. However, participants who completed artwork reported more enjoyment, were more likely to continue with the study, and were more likely to recommend the study to family and friends. Future research could combine writing and art therapy to determine whether a mixed design would both improve health and maximize participant retention.",

In 1999, a group of artists and teachers developed a varied program of art activities for these children. These activities included two 1-week visits and the opening of five art workshops--Art History, Ceramics, Painting, Installation Art, and Fashion Design. Given the high level of illiteracy among the children, as well as their difficulty verbalizing feelings and ideas, the group understood that the visual arts would provide a direct and immediate link to the children. The goals were to counteract negative influences in their lives, to improve their overall psychological and emotional state, and to broaden their cultural interests and understanding. The results, based on personal observation, validate therapeutic art practices as effective in a difficult context.",

Through an immersion in the group experience, the group members became increasingly introspective about their feelings of loss and their histories of multiple trauma. They developed a strong group identification and participated appropriately in a national process of mourning. The creation of the mural enhanced their sense of self-efficacy and earned them considerable positive recognition. Reflection on the mural making process itself, as well as its interpersonal impact, increased the group members' mutual attachment and their tolerance for their own traumatic memories. The inclusion of the mural in a museum exhibition of children's art solidified a powerful lesson about the symbolic value of art for therapeutic healing.",

        "description":"The use of microswitches has been considered a crucial strategy to help individuals with extensive multiple disabilities overcome passivity and achieve control of environmental stimulation (Crawford & Schuster, 1993; Gutowski, 1996; Ko, McConachie, & Jolleff,  1998). In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to extend the evaluation of microswitches and to make their role more relevant. For example, studies have investigated new, convenient responses and the matching microswitches that are likely to facilitate learning and performance with low-functioning persons and the possibility of using multiple microswitches for multiple responses to extend motor activity and sensory input (Lancioni et al., 2002). Responses to the environment by people with  extensive multiple disabilities have almost exclusively involved simple motor acts, such as hand and head movements. However, vocal utterances may occasionally be present in a person's repertoire and could become crucial means of exerting control over  environmental events (Lancioni, Singh, O'Reilly, & Oliva, 2003; Romski, Sevcik, & Adamson, 1999). To enable persons with severe multiple disabilities to reach the goal of using vocal utterances to control their environment, one would need microswitches that could discriminate between various utterances. Such microswitches do not exist. However, two computer systems were recently set up to substitute for such  microswitches with one-syllable or wordlike utterances (Lancioni et al., in press). This study evaluated the system's setup for wordlike utterances (ones that could have a wider application in daily contexts) with two participants with multiple disabilities. The system combines a new control software program with a commercially available  speech-recognition program (Dragon Naturally Speaking, V6.0 Standard, manufactured by Scansoft, 2002).",

        "description":"When assessing the visual function of young children, it is important to use a variety of tests. It is essential to have a structured observation method when it is not possible to use ordinary acuity tests. A structured observation method can be created by using a checklist. An ideal checklist should be handy and reliable and include a minimum of observations. The checklist should give relevant information about visual function and help identify children with visual impairments. A checklist of this type was constructed by one of the authors (Lindstedt, 1994, 1997) for controlled observation of visual behavior. This checklist has been used for more than 20 years and has proved valuable, particularly for assessing young visually impaired children with or without additional impairments. The participants in the study reported here were sighted children and children with visual impairments that were due to ocular disease but who had no other impairments. The results of appraising vision by use of the checklist were compared with the results of the evaluations with other vision tests: (1) grating acuity and contrast-detection ability, for which tests can be used with children aged 2 and younger, and (2) optotype acuity tests for distance, which is the measure used by the World Health Organization for classifying visual impairment. The aim of the comparison was to determine whether the result obtained by the checklist placed a child in the correct \"level of vision\" that corresponded to that obtained with other tests and at what age it is possible to use the checklist. Some preliminary results from this study were reported previously (Ericson, Rydberg, & Lindstedt, 1998).",

The new route to the only logical location for this change sent the buses through a driveway where residential students crossed to travel between the school and the dormitories. Some staff members wanted to eliminate this location as a possibility because of the increased traffic congestion and potential danger to the students. But the orientation and mobility (O&M) staff, saw this change as an opportunity. Schools all over the country have student crossing guards. The thought was, \"Why can't we do the same?\"  A program  was designed that has worked for four years. This article describes the design and administration of this crossing guard program.",

        "description":"Braille literacy skills are essential for success in school and employment and for independence throughout life. Because of the fundamental importance of well-developed literacy skills, the braille code by which persons who are blind or have low vision attain full literacy should be one that is easy and efficient to learn, use, and produce. A process has been under way for some time to study possible changes in the English braille code, which is the focus of this article. The goal of this research project was to gather evaluation data from respondents across English speaking countries on the ways in which they use braille and on their opinions about various aspects of the proposed unified braille code. A written survey was used to collect these data. The participants were 446 English-speaking braille readers, proofreaders, educators, and transcribers from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Since participants in each country independently volunteered themselves or were selected by their braille authorities, the resulting sample was nonrandom. With the exception of respondents from the United Kingdom, 51%?90% of the respondents from all the other countries favored the basic principle of a unified code for all reading materials, except for music (which is already an  international code). Only 37% of respondents from the United Kingdom agreed with the concept of a unified code. Similarly, the majority of respondents from all the countries (58%?94%) favored a six-dot cell; stated that no major changes should be made in the current  contractions and in short-form words in the literary code (64%?82%); and stated that the braille text should reflect the print text (56%?89%)?with the exception of the United Kingdom (21%) and 42% of the nontechnical readers from the United States. There was  more variation (5%?78% agreement) and, in general, less support from the respondents, on changes related",

        "description":"Since 1920, the Hadley School for the Blind in Winnetka, Illinois, has provided distance learning (via correspondence courses) to individuals who are visually impaired (that is, are blind or have low vision) and their families to support the acquisition of specialized skills and to attain the knowledge needed for full participation in life (Wolffe, 2001). Although distance learning has been in existence since 1920, its application to the preparation of teachers is more recent. A variety of models of distance education are implemented throughout the country. The model used for this study was video teleconferencing. The video teleconferencing model gave the faculty, onsite students (at Hunter College), and students at the remote site (Genesee Community College) the ability to interact with each other simultaneously and to discuss course content and materials. At the end of both the fall and spring semesters, the onsite and remote-site students were asked to complete a form, entitled Student Evaluation of Distance Learning, which consisted of 10 questions using a  Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 to 4 (strongly agree to strongly disagree), with statements regarding the experience each student encountered during each course. In the fall semester, the technical difficulties that occurred were related to audio and visual connections between the two sites. At the end of the fall semester and before the start of the spring semester, the technology at the Hunter College site was upgraded with new cameras and audio equipment that provided echo cancellation on every microphone in the room. This audio upgrade contained components that matched the equipment at the Genesee site and provided for increased compatibility. In the spring semester, each class was analyzed individually. In general, it appeared that the technology improved between the fall 2000 and the spring 2001  semesters, but that the quality of the auditory output was still an issue for the remote-site students.",

        "description":"Educators in the United States are being asked to do more with less: school budgets are shrinking, principals are struggling to be instructional leaders in the face of huge management issues, and teachers are trying to meet the needs of increasingly diverse students at a time when a standardized, one-size-fits-all curriculum is mandated. The tenor of schools and classrooms is one of anxiety, stress, and confusion, and at its worst, hopelessness. Why is this happening? What is going on in the world that is affecting schools, teaching, and learning in such profound ways?",

        "description":"Turnaround leadership concerns the kind of leadership needed for turning around a persistently low-performing school to one that is performing acceptably as measured by student achievement according to state tests. I first treat this question in the narrow sense, i.e., as a strategy for targeting low-performing schools, and then place it in a larger context--namely, how such turnaround can be part of an overall approach to sustainable system change. The sequence I will consider moves from the school to the district to the system as a whole. My conclusion, which I state up front, is that what looks like apparent success in turning around schools is actually quite superficial and indeed illusory.",

        "description":"Many nations' governments are requiring schools to bring about significant, systematic, and sustained change to improve student outcomes in all settings, and have imposed mandates to ensure that schools are providing quality education and running efficiently and effectively. Consequently, national and state testing programs, standards-based agendas, and reporting methodologies have been imposed on schools with significant demands and, in many cases, demoralizing outcomes (Hargreaves 2003). As a result of these processes, test questions have become the curriculum; teacher judgment has become undervalued; and evidence that is ill-informed, outdated, and incorrect has been used to drive school change. School leaders recognize that creating and nurturing a learning organization requires a dramatic shift in decision making and has worked consistently to reorient people's approach to work. Teachers have been engaged in research, investigation, experimentation, and evaluation to explore the challenges facing schools in the 21st century.",

        "description":"The purpose of public schooling in this nation--a nation founded on principles of freedom, justice, and measures of happiness for all--is to educate the citizenry in understanding and abiding by these principles. Public education is rooted in a long tradition. At several important points in history (Kauchak, Eggen, and Carter 2001), through federal court decrees and Congressional acts, America has recommitted itself to public education due to its importance in individual success and national progress. The Goals 2000 Act of 1994 introduced the idea of curriculum standards as a key element of the reform movement. The Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 solidified the United States' commitment to the education of all children and championed the notion of whole school reform. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ushered in the current climate of high-stakes accountability. Along with accountability for student learning, school leaders are being called upon to redesign schools and districts to serve the learning needs of all children in their care. The creation of reform agendas that will lead to success by all children requires leaders who can learn from past lessons, heed the findings of current educational research, and rely on the wisdom of their own experiences. This article examines the issue of leadership in urban school districts, calls on leaders in urban districts to be leaders of learning, and makes recommendations for leading in an increasingly complex world.",

        "description":"On July 1, 2000, the author became the first black dean of Education in the almost 100 year existence of the formidable University of Pretoria, South Africa. This essay offers a set of meditations on being a black dean in a white university at the birth of a post-apartheid democracy. There are many sides to this narrative. It is a story of leading in a young democracy and about black leadership in a conservative white environment. It is about the emotions and politics of change. It is about engaging established patterns of certainty and control, and managing the inevitability of loss and change. It is about race, reconciliation, and restitution--all at the same time. The challenge for leadership is to enter this sensitive and volatile terrain with caution. Faculty members must demonstrate in public ways their commitment to all students black and white. They must spend time in public places with both black and white student groups. When addressing students, they must move between both languages  Afrikaans and English because black students regard English as the language of fairness even though their home language is likely to be a traditional African language. Faculty members must consciously create opportunities and rewards that recognize both black and white students. They must be visible at sports events associated with black students (soccer) and white students (rugby). Further, all students must be introduced to both white and black teachers and school leaders.",

Yet, there is growing appreciation (Elmore 2000, 2) that \"public schools and school systems as presently constituted are simply not led in ways that enable them to respond to the increasing demands they face under standards-based reforms.\" For Elmore (2000, 2) and others, the way out of this problem is \"through the large scale improvement of instruction, something public education has been unable to do to date, but which is possible with dramatic changes in the way public schools define and practice leadership.\" Though there has been large-scale improvement in instruction in England, there is still room for improvement. Through the introduction of national strategies and regional and district infrastructures, the focus on teaching reading, writing, and math to students aged 4 to 14 years has sharpened considerably. Targets for student outcomes in literacy and numeracy at school, district, and national levels were introduced simultaneously. All public schools are regularly inspected by external teams of inspectors, and their findings have been made public for over a decade. Standards have risen significantly.",

        "description":"During the past 50 years, teachers have used contracted braille as the preferred method of teaching reading to children and adults. Contracted braille, previously referred to as grade 2 braille, involves the use of the traditional alphabet, along with 189 different characters and contractions that represent a group of letters or whole words. Ponchillia and Durant noted that braille research has focused on the proficiency of braille readers, but few studies have been conducted on the instructional methods used by braille teachers. This pilot study interviewed four certified teachers of students with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) to examine the assessment and instructional strategies that they used with their students. Interviews, the primary method used to collect data for this study, were conducted by the first author over a four-week period and ranged in duration from 30 minutes to 75 minutes. Findings included: (1) four common factors affected the assessment process; (2) teaching uncontracted braille requires different strategies and materials than does teaching contracted braille; and (3) for students to be successful in learning uncontracted braille, teachers thought that their students must understand how the knowledge of braille would be of benefit to them.",

Approximately 60-80% of those with retinitis pigmentosa inherit it by an autosomal recessive transmission (Brilliant, 1999). There have been some reported cases with no known family history. The symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are decreased acuity, photophobia, night blindness, and a progressive constriction of the visual field. Visual acuity can vary from 20/20 to no light perception. Typically, acuity is severely affected only in the later stages, when macular changes and glare from posterior subcapsular cataracts may cause moderate to severe vision loss. A person with retinitis pigmentosa has difficulty making the transition between different levels of lighting because of decreased rod-cone function. The visual field loss usually begins in the midperiphery and works in and out, creating a ring scotoma. Owing to the slow, progressive nature of the field loss, many individuals are unaware of it initially.",

Efforts to enable some of these persons (that is, those who are in better overall physical condition) to make some use of their legs may involve the use of support walkers. The risk may be even greater if the disabilities include blindness, which may increase a person's level of difficulty or insecurity in taking steps and thus reduce his or her motivation to try to do so. Recently, a study was conducted in which a walker was used in conjunction with the automatic delivery of contingent stimuli with two participants. As a result of this intervention, both participants increased the frequency of their steps, and their moods improved. The aim of the study reported in this article was to extend the previous research with a new participant with multiple disabilities, including blindness. This blind participant also used a walker and received a brief period of favorite stimulation at each step that he performed. A positive outcome with this participant was thought to be important to support the generality of the previous findings and the overall suitability of the intervention strategy.",

After conducting detailed assessments of the definition in the guidance for applicants and the definitions used by others in their respective states, seven of the nine grantees developed their own local, project-specific definitions through the participation of community focus groups and Advisory Councils. The definitions for SED developed by rural grantees all included American Indian and Alaska Native concepts specific to each tribal community's culture; the urban grantee's definition was purposely focused for reaching out to non-professional members of the community. This opportunity for the  communities to redefine SED not only provided each community with a definition which would be more culturally specific, but also proved to be an extraordinary exercise in empowerment and self-determination.",

This analysis demonstrated that the TEDS had good internal consistency, demonstrated construct validity, and shared a commonality with the other two measures, but had limited predictive validity. The YSR had strong predictive validity but, like the CES-D, showed weakness in construct validity. Unexpectedly, the CES-D and YSR revealed enculturated youth were at risk of depressive symptoms. These findings do not generate unequivocal support for any one measure, but suggest that their strengths and potential shortcomings should be taken into account when assessing depressive symptoms among American Indian youth.",

Accountability testing is a primary feature of Texas education law and has an enormous impact on public school culture. Of particular interest is Houston, one of the largest cities in the US, where more than half of public school students are identified by the school district as English language learners. The article investigates how students enrolled in a developmental English course use their own writing to advocate for change. The students attend an urban, Hispanic-serving, open admissions university and often are described as Generation 1.5. In particular, the article focuses on the case study of one student and his response to being identified as an English language learner.",

This lore is often grounded in the belief in a linear paradigm of learning, and is to some degree fostered by traditional conceptions of basic writers and basic writing teachers. The paradigm clashes between lore and professionally sanctioned  knowledge emerge quite organically from the varying background experiences of faculty; but, rather than creating a richly diverse group of pedagogical approaches that enhance the quality of basic writing classes, these paradigm clashes are often obstacles to building strong basic writing programs.",

The result was her redesigned basic writing course, in which students do extensive private writing on personal and sometimes painful issues. This private writing forms the basis for all their essays, beginning with personal narratives and moving toward more academic genres. The author?s initial experiment with this approach suggests that it has the potential to improve students? attitudes toward and confidence in their writing and to help them develop a stronger prose style and more authentic voice.",

Second, in the guise of presenting opportunity, the computers accentuated the differences in the students' past technological opportunities. The computers empowered the two students by giving them access to the technology for their writing, yet the students were at a disadvantage when compared to their classmates who were more experienced in using computers.

Indeed, the words diary and female seem to be synonymous with one another. Females everyday are exposed to the first hand benefits of keeping a diary or journal, but what sort of influences do males have to gain approval that journaling is acceptable? In recent years, American culture has begun to shift its efforts toward recognizing the difficulties males face (H?bert, 2002). Unfortunately, many educators are beginning to notice that years of neglecting the emotional needs of males in the classroom are now having detrimental effects (Pollack, 1998). Millions are realizing the benefits of  journaling, but we may not be doing an adequate job of promoting those benefits to the market of males, especially gifted males who deal with emotional and psychological issues that surpass the average individual. A catharsis and self-inspection journal can be a powerful way of expressing emotions and solving problems gifted children experience. Utilization of a journal of this type can not only be effective in the classroom environment, but also can be a wonderful extension between school and home for a gifted child.",

Abraham Maslow taught us that, in order to reach our full potential, we must have our basic needs met. This includes the need for safety, belonging, identity, and esteem. For diverse gifted children to develop optimally, they must be challenged and appreciated. Clearly, parents want their children to be happy while in school.

In 1976, they initiated interdisciplinary field trips to the base, which allowed students to use the resources of their local community as a curriculum to learn more about science and social studies. This project was important for the community because it preserved and disseminated its history. The students met a need for the community that the community had not recognized or filled. When students filled this need, they used the expertise of community historical groups, listened to local citizens, and worked to organize material that had not been explored. In an area that lacks professional historians, students contributed their best efforts to the community, and the community had an opportunity to see young people at their most altruistic.",

        "description":"Regardless of prevalence, students who are gifted and learning disabled do exist in America's public schools, and they have unique needs that must be met through our education system (Bees, 1998). Special education teachers, regular education teachers, and teachers of the gifted should be aware of the unique characteristics of students who are both gifted and learning disabled and should be aware of strategies to assist them in reaching their full potential. This article gives an overview of students who are both gifted and disabled and discusses learning strategies that will help them achieve academically. As awareness of gifted students with learning disabilities increases, so also should awareness of the unique characteristics and needs these students possess. In giving gifted students with learning disabilities opportunities for enrichment and tools to compensate for their disability, teachers are giving them the chance to reach their full academic potential.",

This process is working for politicians, and it can work for educators of the gifted, too. We can build our advocacy efforts on the common language used by policymakers in general education to the advantage of gifted education. There always has been discussion about the negatives and positives of educationalese, the language coined by educators to describe and promote intentions and directions in education. Advocates of gifted education need to use the current educational jargon to draft their advocacy efforts.

        "description":"The purpose of the current study was to determine the number of gifted students with disabilities identified and served in gifted education programs in the state of Mississippi. Four categories of giftedness are set forth in the regulations for gifted programs are:  (1) Intellectually gifted children refers to children and youth who are found to have an exceptionally high degree of intelligence as documented through the identification process; (2) Academically gifted children are those who are found to have an exceptionally high degree of demonstrated academic ability as documented through the identification process; (3) Artistically gifted children exhibit an exceptionally high degree of creativity and an exceptionally high degree of ability in the visual arts as documented through the identification process; and (4) Creatively gifted children are those children and youth who are found to have an exceptionally high degree of creativity and exceptionally high degree of ability in the performing arts (music, drama, or dance) as documented through the identification process (Mississippi Department of Education, 1994). A draft of the survey instrument (see Appendix A) designed by the researchers was given to seven special education program directors for content validity. The suggestions offered were incorporated into the final version of the instrument. They also assisted in establishing the timeframe for dissemination. Surveys were sent to all 149 directors of public school district programs for the disabled in the state of Mississippi. These directors monitor the identification and services of disabled students in each district; in most districts in the state, they also monitor the identification and educational placement of gifted students. Surveys were mailed with response envelopes included; a 2-week return time was requested for completion of the instrument. For those not responding, another letter and the survey was forwarded with an additional 2 weeks for completion. For clarification, follow-up was conducted by phone, e-mail, and fax. Sixty percent of the school districts in Mississippi responded to the survey. Results of this study indicate that few gifted students with disabilities in Mississippi have been identified. To address this situation, more emphasis may be needed in training teachers of the gifted and regular classroom teachers in the characteristics of gifted students with  disabilities, a suggestion also found in the literature (Cline & Schwartz, 1999). Appended are: (1) Survey Instrument; (2) Developing the Gifts of Gifted/LD Students (Suggestions for Teachers; and Suggestions for Parents); (3) a list and brief descriptions of gifted/LD Web sites; and (4) a list of further readings.",

In addition to demonstrating prowess, some students tend to exhibit passion toward one or both of these activities. Students who excel in either could be considered technologically gifted. The purpose of this column is to describe the second type of student, the one who demonstrates expertise using technology hardware and software. These students may or may not be able to program computers, but they are certainly able to apply technology in effective and creative ways. Their interests and skills may not be limited to computers. They often focus on other technologies such as audio and video equipment. When a new piece of technology is introduced into the classroom, these are the students who, cannot wait to experiment with it. They have a high interest in technology and spend much of their free time developing their technology skills. Technologically gifted students can usually be identified by the technology products they produce, the way they assist others with technology, and the technology-related questions they ask. One possible method to identify them is through a rating scale.",

In what ways did sandstorms of misinformation or geological upheavals among theories about just who is or is not gifted bury good sense about nurturing the creative responses seen on a daily basis in children? How might the promotion of giftedness be different than it was 10 years ago or 50 years ago, especially given the fact that it is now known that infants are incredibly more responsive than we had assumed? Are teachers in schools working under the same principles now as then about how to teach children who are showing precocious understanding and gifted behavior, or are there new principles that have been overlooked? What constitutes gifted behavior? Are there new options for parents to assist in that discovery process? As a matter of fact, might parents be allowed, expected, even encouraged to be the educators primarily responsible for action plans and implementation? A number of current leaders in this field have already been  actively pursuing such retrospection, as well as looking into the future, generating rich ideas that give hope and direction, spirit and opportunity, to parents for nurturing emerging giftedness in children.

Mathematically gifted students are able to see relationships among topics, concepts, and ideas without the intervention of formal instruction specifically geared to that particular content (Heid, 1983). Due to their intuitive understanding of mathematical function and processes, they may skip over steps and be unable to explain how they arrived at the correct answer to a problem (Greenes, 1981). Unfortunately, many programs for gifted children are inadequate and poorly designed (Heid, 1983), leaving classroom teachers to struggle to meet the needs of gifted children effectively. What resources are available for these students? What assessment tools are appropriate? Do these children need acceleration or enrichment? How can we meet their needs when there are so many other demands on teachers' time?

Nugent (2000) stated that the perfectionist attitude is established in childhood and suggested that identification of perfectionistic traits and recognition of problem areas is a first step to finding an alternative to the all or nothing attitude of many gifted students. Awareness of maladaptive perfectionism and origins of influence would be helpful to students, parents, and teachers in addressing the problem and discovering alternate methods for coping in a positive way (Schuler, 2000). Difficulty with perfectionism may increase with age (Emmett & Minor, 1993). In summary, although definitions measurements differ in the literature, researchers agree that perfectionism can be damaging to the individual. Striving to be the best, setting unattainable goals, and being dissatisfied with performance can jeopardize mental stability. A safe, noncritical environment can be developed in small classes of gifted students where deviations from the normal attitudes on perfectionism are acceptable as individual growth. In this environment, students should realize that perfection is not always achievable, necessary, or desirable, and they should have peer support throughout the process.",

The message is that one can improve with time and effort. Learning does take time and effort, and there is no one teaching strategy that inspires this. Almost any strategy that \"works\" for an individual teacher is worth at least a try, but, the teacher must always communicate to the gifted students that mastery and growth will require effort. Unfortunately, many students have never been challenged. Great teachers will challenge them while simultaneously offering support and making it \"okay\" to try, fail and try again. One key to engaging and challenging students is asking provocative questions and providing guidance as students struggle with answers. Further, the best teachers engage students in disciplinary thinking, and finally, great teachers provide diverse learning experiences.",

        "author":["Besnoy, Kevin"],
        "description":"An appropriate education is one that identifies students' educational needs and then provides a curriculum that addresses those needs (Benbow & Stanley, 1996). All students, even those identified as gifted, deserve a personalized education. However, many educators outside gifted education believe that \"giftedness\" is a fancy label and that gifted students do not need a special curriculum. These educators feel that, because of their precocious intellectual ability, gifted students are capable of satisfying their own needs without specialized attention. This belief is simply untrue and is, in fact, harmful to the educational growth of the child. The current trend of cutting funding for gifted education from state budgets is a call to action for all educators of the gifted. By becoming advocates and public relations strategists for the program within their own school, teachers of the gifted will help to promote the merits of gifted programming and remove the perception of elitism held by many professionals who are not involved in gifted education (Karnes, Lewis, & Stephens, 1999; Kiger, 1998). Effective advocates must also be good public relations strategists. This article describes effective strategies for beginning and managing a public relations campaign, in the local schools, where it is often most effective. It offers specific, and creative examples of successful use of media sources both inside and outside the schools as well as suggestions for activities to effectively reach the target audience using print, non print, and other media. Also contains 3 tables that list various other sources of media, and ideas for promoting gifted programs using them.",

        "description":"Each year, about 70 4th- and 5th-grade students from an elementary school in an Indiana urban area participate in an extracurricular social studies enrichment program called the Clio Club. Clio is derived from the Greek muse of history, and the club offers a variety of activities to help students discover and interpret social studies beyond the traditional school hours. They meet after school and on weekends, both at their public school and off site on field trips, to learn additional content and skills that are not possible during the regular school day. The members of the club engage in learning that compliments their school studies by allowing them to go into greater depth and to engage topics they would never cover in a regular curriculum (Morris, 1997). The students who elect to join this group are interested in learning more about a particular topic, as well as furthering their educational experiences. For teachers, the Clio Club offers an opportunity to let students explore and take more ownership over their learning. While doing this, the Clio Club also offers a platform for talent development.",

        "description":"Research indicates that ongoing, high-quality staff development is essential to achieving significant standards-based reform. Currently, the majority of teachers do not regularly participate in staff development practices in the United States. Staff development decisions have traditionally been made by school administrators to meet the needs of students and to address school, district, and national goals in gifted education. In this model, teachers have been sideline observers with little or no participation in the planning of these professional development efforts. While this paradigm is cost- and time-efficient, this one-size-fits-all approach to staff development fails to address the learning needs of each teacher in a district. Many districts are beginning to recognize that all teachers can benefit from designing individual professional development plans (Richardson, 2002). District leaders encourage the professional growth of their teachers through these plans that link \"individual learning with school goals and school wide learning with district goals\" (p. 1). Furthermore, several districts that have required individual professional development plans for their teachers have received the U.S. Department of Education's Model Professional Development Awards for their outstanding staff development activities. All teachers, regardless of subject area or grade level, can grow professionally through this process and can positively affect student learning, including teachers who already demonstrate excellence in their teaching.",

The war on academic terrorism is related to the broad areas of curriculum and instruction and have their roots in the national and distinct initiatives aimed at eradicating the \"enemies\" thwarting academic success. Ironically, these very initiatives are inhibitors to the academic success of gifted students and form the \"enemies\" fanning the war on academic terrorism. \"Time\" is one  of the major academic terrorists. This article concludes the elusive and difficult nature of combating the global war on terrorism is quite evident. Fighting some of the features such as \"time\" that represent the war on academic terrorism seems less elusive and far easier to  win.",

He once said that, with learning as with any activity, ability must be supplemented by interest or desire. \"If we wish to learn a certain thing, we must arouse adequate interest... we must transmute this general wish into an interest that will carry us to and through the detailed activities necessary\" (Thorndike, 1935, p. 85). His straightforward conclusion was that, in planning any educational endeavor, it is important to account for the level of student interest. \"It is important know whether the student has it, how strongly he has it, and when and how he has it\" (p. 85). A project in a San Jose, California, middle school was imbued with Thorndike's principles, placing them at the forefront of key decisions affecting instructional design. These decisions involved how to create a structure that enables students to learn the skills necessary to carry out many subprocesses requiring prerequisite knowledge and, at the same time, includes an absolutely authentic experience with real-world consequences.",

Out of 44 schools that he visited, the final school left him with a powerful impression of what this process is for young people and those who make their living working with them. Most people agree that today?s college admission process is deeply flawed. Those who work in college and university settings shoulder a large portion of the blame. Emphasis is place on technology over people, marketing over fit, prestige over quality, rankings over reality, and the bottom line over the greater good. So many conflicting messages are sent to the marketplace about institutions and policies that people no longer know what to believe. Admission deans often face inordinate pressure from their presidents and trustees to grow application pools, improve quality, increase diversity, and reduce expenditures on financial aid. In short, upper level administration wants it all, so deans do what they must to retain their jobs. Parents and headmasters contribute to the chaos. Young people are victims when their parents call the shots on where they should apply and where they will enroll.",

The U.S. homeschool population (K-12) is estimated to be growing at a rate of 7-15 percent annually. The home-educated population is now expected to be the size of the public school population in Los Angeles and Chicago combined (Hill, 2000). The primary purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes and perceptions of college admission personnel toward the homeschooled graduate and, more specifically, to gain an understanding of the attitudes and perceptions of admission personnel, by examining their college admission policies for homeschool applicants and analyzing their attitudes and perceptions of admission personnel toward the homeschooled graduate population. The study was guided by the following research questions: (1) What are the college admission policies for homeschool applicants? (2) What are the attitudes and perceptions of admission personnel toward the homeschooled graduate population?",

Garland and Grace (1993) note that as a set of strategies, enrollment management provides a systematic approach to attracting, retaining and graduating students, and, therefore, is a critical component in the stable operation of a higher education institution. According to Baldridge, Kemerer and Green (1982), and Garland and Grace (1993), enrollment management involves a host of functions that cross divisional lines, including clarification of institutional purpose, program development, marketing and recruitment, financial aid, orientation, and retention. As a process, enrollment management helps institutions: develop a keener awareness of their purpose and character in relation to the student marketplace, improve ties to prospective client group, and attract students into and through the institution. Lennington (1996) notes that certain institutions have recognized this need and have established an enrollment management function. The College and University Personnel Association (CUPA) describes the chief enrollment manager as an administrative official responsible for the development of marketing plans for the recruitment and retention of students. The enrollment manager coordinates institutional efforts in admission, financial aid, records and registration, and advising.",

We constructed a modified high school percentile rank variable, to take into account both high school percentile rank and the quality of the student?s high school. Using  student data from the University of Illinois at Chicago, we showed a student?s modified high school percentile rank as a substantially better indicator for university success than other commonly used variables.

        "description":"From its inception, affirmative action policies were created to improve the employment and/or educational opportunities for members of minority groups and women. Even today, however, the debate continues over the future of affirmative action. Proponents offer empirical evidence illustrating that affirmative action has been favorable in aiding minorities and/or women to achieve parity in seeking education at the most elite institutions in this country. This empirical evidence has focused on descriptive statistics such as increasing enrollment for minorities (NCES, 2001). Research supports that affirmative action promotes academic and social development for all students; diverse classrooms do not weaken student quality or intellectual skills; racial and ethnic classrooms actually enrich educational experiences of white students; and  multi-racial/multi-ethnic classrooms enhance educational outcomes for all students (Algers et al., 2000).",

Through a process of interpretive interactionism (Denzin, 1994), these portraits are examined, and include comparisons and contrasts to bilingual education programs in the United States.

Prior to 1997 no federal bill had specifically addressed child literacy as an issue. But in the 2000 presidential campaign, George W. Bush regularly touted his record on literacy, and he and his wife Laura, a former librarian, speak of reading as \"the new civil right.\" Legislators debate literacy philosophy and methodology--such as phonics versus whole language--and newspaper headlines track how U.S. kids read in comparison with the rest of the world. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2002, which federalizes literacy policy in important ways, is  hotly debated in state legislatures, Congress, and federal courts. Much was written about literacy when it played on the academic stage as an educational issue. Now that political attention and governmental dollars are involved, it is time to assess literacy on the public policy stage. What can we learn by tracking the politics of literacy? Will greater political attention and government expenditure improve literacy? Can illiteracy be overcome in the twenty-first century?",

Still, as political affairs have claimed a steadily increasing share of attention on the Hill, another crucial issue has received attention, the eighth reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA).  Since the adoption of the HEA in 1965, the stakes of reauthorization discussions  have always been high. Because the HEA directs federal student aid, its influence on what have been dubbed the three A?s (access, affordability, and accountability) is considerable. From this influence arises a signal opportunity for political positioning. This time, moreover, we have seen a familiar axiom confirmed, in that legislators with little additional funding to allocate compensate by proposing more intrusive policies. Given their engagement with every sector of higher education, those who support liberal education for all students have a clear stake in the outcome of the reauthorization discussions. As influential as the reauthorization may prove, what educators can learn from the discussion may prove in the long run to be even more important. For the sake of convenience, call it a top ten of lessons for higher education and for liberal education in particular. Because a popular late night host begins with number ten and works his way down, This article will too, but network television can be improved upon by going beyond the issues to consider ways in which liberal education might respond.",

        "author":["Astin, Alexander W."],
        "description":"One of the most remarkable things about the human consciousness is that each of us has the capacity to observe our thoughts and feelings as they arise in our consciousness. Why shouldn?t cultivating this ability to observe one?s own mind in action,becoming more self aware or simply more \"conscious\" be one of the central purposes of education? Even a cursory look at our educational system makes it clear that the relative amount of attention that higher education devotes to the exterior and interior aspects of our lives has gotten way out of balance. Thus, while we are justifiably proud of our \"outer\" development in fields such as science, medicine, technology, and commerce, we have increasingly come to neglect our \"inner\" development the sphere of values and beliefs, emotional maturity, moral development, spirituality, and self understanding. This growing awareness of the importance of spirituality in higher education was recently underscored by the Templeton Foundation through its award of a $1.9 million grant to UCLA?s Higher Education Research Institute to support a large scale longitudinal study of spiritual development in college undergraduates. A pilot study of 3,700 students enrolled at forty-six colleges and universities was initiated in spring 2003, and a full-scale assessment of 90,000 students enrolling at 150 institutions will  be initiated in fall 2004. Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind about spirituality is that is touches directly on our sense of community. More than anything else, giving spirituality a central place in our institutions will serve to strengthen our sense of connectedness with each other, our students, and our institutions. This enrichment of our sense of community will not only go a long way toward overcoming  the sense of fragmentation and alienation that so many of us now feel, but will also help our students to lead more meaningful lives as engaged citizens, loving partners and parents, and caring neighbors.",

The author has retooled his introductory CHEM 151 course at the University of Montana so that students must increasingly connect the course content and themselves to the world outside of the lecture hall by: (1) incorporating public issues into my sample problems; (2) offering extra credit for calculations that extend the lecture material into local problems; (3) inviting the students to participate in policy hearings; and (4) encouraging students to volunteer for relevant community-service projects. These strategies are but one example of how to build civic capacity into a course.",

On the one hand, there are some people out there who still believe that we can have access to some fundamental and obvious reality, an empirical natural world that is theoretically open to our unmediated knowledge if only we persevere long enough. But, they believe, the essential clarity of such a reality is then muddied and confused by all the things that we humans do, socially and culturally.

        "description":"Today there are important types of analytical thinking, communication, quantitative reasoning, and information skills that cannot be used, or learned, without technology. Let?s look at just two:(1) information literacy; and (2) the ability to create Web sites as a medium of academic expression. Information literacy is the set of skills needed to find, retrieve, analyze, and use information in a library, on the Web, or anywhere else. Virtually all majors require some form of information literacy, which almost always requires knowing how to use a maze of information on the Internet, as well as print resources. Information literacy, like writing across the curriculum, is learned via a series of assignments and feedback on those assignments that should occur frequently and throughout the student?s course of study. In course after course, psychology students at Earlham get briefings from librarians and do research on the literature. They learn, for example, the difference between using \"racism\" and \"prejudice\" as search terms. Faculty members coordinate their efforts informally, talking about these skills and other facets of the curriculum in biweekly departmental meetings. Over the years, students learn skills that are manifested and assessed in a senior year capstone experience. For psychology majors at Earlham, the capstone experience is a multipart project. In one piece of it, students are each given an article written for the general public (e.g., from a newspaper). They have to search and interpret the academic literature on the topic and then write an analysis of the article, also geared to the general public. In another part of this capstone, seniors do an experimental project and must search and analyze the relevant research literature. These capstone projects are each graded by a pair of faculty who examine, among many other things, the students? use of the literature.",

Indeed, based on their review of several thousand studies of college student development, Pascarella and Terenzini (1991, 611) concluded that \"there can be little doubt about the need for faculty members? acceptance of their roles and responsibilities for student learning and for their active involvement in students' lives.\" But as times change, so do student characteristics and aspirations as well as the demands on institutions and faculty, all of which presumably influence the nature and frequency of student-faculty contact, inside and outside the classroom. A particularly worrisome national trend is hiring part-time instructors--many of whom teach at two or more universities in the same academic term--in lieu of full-time faculty members with continuing contracts (Benjamin 2001). As a result, it's conceivable that face-to-face exchanges between students and faculty outside the classroom will decline because part-time faculty spend less time on campus and often do not have a designated space to meet with students after class. Relatively little is known about the effects of these and other trends and policies on student learning.",

        "description":"This document focuses on the writing skills of college students. The days of students sifting through piles of file cards, producing detailed outlines, and handwriting drafts have slipped into the distant past. Students write quickly and casually with the assistance of technology, and common sense dictates that technology needs to be used to teach them to write better. The faculty director of the writing program at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of this document, decided to apply technology to the goal of making writing instruction more cost-effective and proposed to design a new, technology-based model for teaching writing. From 1997 to 2002 a team of experienced graduate student instructors from several different  departments worked with the author to create, test, and refine the course, leading up to a comprehensive evaluation during the 2001-2 academic year. Because acquiring writing skill takes time, common wisdom suggests that more extended exposure to writing instruction benefits students. Electronic delivery creates a unique opportunity to alter length of instruction without adding course units or additional time to the student's or instructor's load. Eliminating formal class meetings and focusing on shorter, more concentrated writing activities ensured that the class work felt lighter than a traditional course, making a half-credit per semester seem appropriate. Extending writing instruction over a full year had several clear benefits. The project was formally evaluated during the fifth year of the program, by surveying students along with their peers in traditional wring courses about their experiences, comparing the cost of electronic writing groups to the cost of conventional writing courses, and comparing the quality of the writing produced in each environment. The results of the study validated many of the choices. The evaluation revealed that students in the electronic writing groups learned as much and, in some cases, more about perparts in traditional comparison  groups.",

        "description":"Despite the belief that liberal learning is a necessary component of the professional nursing student?s education, the scientific focus has held prominence in nursing education (Valiga and Bruderle 1997). In the twenty first century, thoughtful linking of liberal learning to professional nursing education takes on renewed urgency. As early as the 1970s, nursing education literature asserted that when the liberal arts are taught in discrete curricular courses, the connections between these courses and the learning needs of the professional nurse remain unrecognized. In an effort to address this disconnect between liberal learning and professional nursing courses, some general and nursing educators have argued that efforts should be directed at methods to integrate liberal learning within nursing courses (Newell 1989; Valiga and Bruderle 1997). The purpose of the study described here was to examine the current nature of the integration of the humanities learning activities within nursing courses in baccalaureate nursing education. In addition, nursing faculty perceptions on the achievement of the goals related to these humanities learning activities were explored. Furthermore, faculty views regarding motivation for integrating with the humanities as well as the perceived obstacles were examined. Recommendations from this study include increasing interdisciplinary dialogue that promotes faculty awareness of this value through faculty development programs. Furthermore, administrative leadership is needed to support faculty in \"trying out\" innovative teaching/learning strategies. Expanding societal and health care complexities demands that professional nursing education be tailored to prepare responsible, democratic citizens as well as empowered, competent, compassionate professional nurses.",

Four copies of the article: two from faculty colleagues on my campus, one from a campus administrator and another from a colleague at a university where I formerly worked were received. As a writing teacher, the author receives many articles and announcements about cheating from colleagues, though never four of the same piece. The figures cited in the Times article are worthy of attention38 percent of surveyed college students admitted to cut and paste plagiarism from the Internet during the year surveyed, while a slightly higher number (40 percent) that probably overlaps with the first group acknowledged plagiarizing from written sources. These numbers demonstrate that cheating is a problem on college campuses and that the Internet is probably not making matters better, but plagiarism is certainly not a new phenomenon. Educators have attended and continue to attend to plagiarism in positive ways that help students better recognize, understand, and avoid it: we educate students on how to properly work with sources; teach them about standards of academic integrity; help them to understand academic culture; and explain the ramifications, both intellectual and ethical, of cheating. Some schools have developed pledges and honor codes to help cultivate an ethos of integrity on campus. As an extra measure, many instructors address the problem by designing projects which make plagiarizing difficult.",

        "description":"Spider Man and the Green Lantern are not the first images that most people conjure up when someone mentions \"important art.\" In the world of fine art, comic books  are often viewed as the bottom rung of the artistic ladder. In the early half of the 1900s, such an assessment would not have been unreasonable. With their rudimentary visuals and sub-par writing, the comics of the day were nothing more than gags and cheap laughs. It was not until the end of the 20th century that comics became an acclaimed artistic medium, with profound and relevant writing and technically strong and aesthetically pleasing visuals. This documents discusses how the author believes comic books to be a form of healing. Through comic book characters and worlds he has been able to work through problems in his life.",

        "description":"According to Sue and Sue (1999), the invisible veil is a worldview which affects all individuals as products of cultural conditioning and which operates outside the level of conscious awareness. Further, they state that the \"values, assumptions, beliefs, and practices of our society are structured in a manner as to serve only one narrow segment of the population\" (p. 31). Given this sense of haze or dysconsciousness (Ponterotto, Casas, Suzuki, & Alexander, 2001) and ethnocentrism, it becomes imperative for art therapy to revisit its cultural and social identities to become more inclusive. The incidents of racist attacks on individuals of visible racial ethnic groups and the changing demographics of the United States are forcing art therapy to address issues of diversity. These include culture, race or ethnicity, gender, religion, historical experiences within the dominant culture, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic status, education, political views, lifestyle, and geographic regions within the profession. Furthermore, while the fields of social work and counseling have greatly improved their recruitment of minority students and staff, minority numbers have not changed in art therapy (Boston, Doby-Copeland, & Short, 2001). The goal of this article is to examine how collective biases, beliefs, and values have been masked and how they continue to impact educational programs.",

Twenty four of the 44 surveyed programs responded. Twenty three (95.8 per cent) of the respondents required a course of at least three credits, usually taught by doctoral level faculty. Most programs indicated they taught several research methods, covered numerous course goals, and introduced multiple topics. Over half the programs indicated their goals were reviewing published research and formulating research questions; the integration of research and practice was selected the least. Qualitative research approaches (87.5 per cent) were the primary orientation of most programs with quantitative approaches a close second (75 per cent). Survey results revealed most educators perceived that students feared learning about research. Respondents commented that research training enhanced development of students as reflective practitioners, increased their marketable professional skills, and contributed to the development of new knowledge.",

The notion of a team observing the therapist conducting a session, the reflecting team reflecting on the session in the presence of the client (either behind a one-way mirror or in person), followed by the therapist and the client reflecting on the reflections, has proven to be highly effective treatment (Anderson, 1991; Friedman 1995). The art therapy literature contains little on incorporating this technique aside from a presentation in 2001 at the AATA Conference (Klijn, Scheller, & Riley). In conversation, some art therapists say they have used this mode of therapy in their work but have not published the results. The purpose of this article is to stimulate interest in the reflecting-team approach in the field of art therapy.",

Sensory integration difficulties may be part of the symptomatology of these disorders. These difficulties may result in difficulties with both classroom behaviors and academic performance. This single-case study investigated the effectiveness of art therapy with a 5-year old white male with sensory integration difficulties. Art therapy focused on preart activities using three media. Teacher ratings assessed classroom behavior for improvement. Each of the varied media sessions was compared to control sessions where a nonart experience was offered. Results indicated an increase in positive behaviors after art sessions as well as postponement of the first incidence of negative behaviors. Art therapy was found to be a useful intervention.",

This paper presents the main areas and functions activated in emotional states, the formation of memories, and the processing of motor, visual, and somatosensory information. The relationship between the processes of art expressions and brain functions is approached from the viewpoint of the different levels of the Expressive Therapies Continuum (Lusebrink, 1990, 1991) with examples from art therapy interventions. The basic level of interventions with art media is through sensory stimulation. Visual feature recognition and spatial placement are processed by the ventral and dorsal branches of the visual information processing system. Mood-state drawings echo the differences in the activation of different brain areas in emotional states. The cognitive and symbolic aspects of memories can be explored through the activation of their sensory components.",

Psychotherapy techniques range in their use of left-brain verbal discourse and right-brain nonverbal discourse. In a case study, the author describes experiences integrating both verbal and nonverbal therapy with a client with severe anxiety and depression. Nonverbal therapy involved annotated scribble drawings. Images in the drawings became the stimuli for verbal discourse with the client.

Children create art and draw because it is rooted in the need to relate to their world (Horovitz, Lewis, & Luca, 1967). However, children with autism have difficulty relating (Green & Luce, 1996). This case study explores the value of art therapy interventions in the young boy?s development, growth, and ability to relate. His growth is highlighted by discussing three of his drawings that reflect his progress towards developing object constancy.

After the 211 responses were scored on 5-point rating scales for assessing Emotional Content and Self-Image, a psychologist analyzed the findings. The aggressive students had significantly lower Emotional Content scores and significantly higher Self-Image scores. Aggression also was significantly related to responses that received 1 point in Emotional Content along with 5 points in Self-Image. Significant gender differences, but no age differences, also emerged. The findings suggest that the DAS assessment shows promise as a technique for identifying students at risk for aggressive behavior.

        "description":"This study explores how children's drawings, as rated on the Formal Elements Art Therapy Scale (FEATS), are related to their emotional and behavioral health. Participating students (ages 8-16, N=53), attending a therapeutic day school for students with emotional and behavioral disorders, drew a picture of a person picking an apple from a tree (PPAT). A discriminant function analysis indicated that ratings on five subscales--Integration, Realism, Problem-Solving, Developmental Level, and Details of Objects and Environment--predicted group membership into impaired vs. nonimpaired thinking (74% of cases correctly classified). This study broadens the use of the FEATS to a child clinical population. Further, results validate the use of children's art forms as a basis for clinical insight and suggest that children's drawings can be a helpful tool for diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation purposes.",

Results revealed that the figures drawn by battering husbands tended to be smaller and placed lower on the page relative to the female figure but, nevertheless, resembled the female figures.

The author uses a transpersonal model of the human psyche and an interdependent paradigm of the self and views personal psychological experiences and external societal structures as entwined in a cocreative, mutually dependent relationship. From this perspective, art therapy and social action become interconnected enterprises ultimately having the same goal: just and peaceful communities derived from individual and collective wholeness. The unique role of image in art therapy and social action is discussed, and homophobia is used as a working example of the reciprocal impact of societal and individual psychic processes. Art therapists should examine their complicity in unjust social arrangements and take a moral stance to work for justice by actively redressing imbalances, within and outside the consulting room. It is suggested that art therapists adopt an action research approach by relinquishing theoretical dogma and cultural assumptions to consider the specific needs and worldview of the individuals being served.",

The assumption that spoken English is an equally accessible language can pose barriers to participation in such groups. The use of art processes in interracial dialogue groups can shift the power dynamics within the group by giving \"voice\" to members who are less able to utilize either verbal processes or the dominant verbal language. The author defines and describes Large Group Dialogue (LGD) as a specific type of group encounter, discusses the dynamics of language and oppression, and advocates for the use of artmaking in interracial LGD. TREC: Talking Race, Engaging Creativelysm is described and discussed as one art-based LGD model for interracial dialogues.",

        "description":"As society grows more cooperative, the importance of finding emerging leaders has become incrasingly crucial. Not only should these potential leaders be identified, but their talents need the opportunity to develop. Leadership education continues to be a concern in gifted education but remains an abstract concept that is often ignored in school curricula (Karnes & Stephens, 1999). Many districts do not equate leadership education with traditional academic education, and teachers often do not receive proper training in leadership skill development. Consequently, students are given limited opportunities to develop their potential. One of the problems facing current leadership education is the lack of a clear definition of a leader. Some view an effective leader as one who is skilled in group dynamics, can inspire others, and relates well to a wide variety of people (Feldhusen & Pleiss, 1994). Others see a leader as one who is able to communicate well, lead groups in problem solving, structure goals and objectives for a group, and evaluate group progress in achieving its goals (Feldhusen & Pleiss, 1994). A third group defines a leader as someone who induces a group to pursue a goal (Karnes & Bean, 1996).",

        "description":"Matt Ridley, an Oxford-trained zoologist and science writer whose latest book is  \"Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, and What Makes Us Human\" (2003a), wrote such an impressively clear and fascinating piece on \"What Makes You Who You Are\" that  the author decided to use it to introduce the continuing pursuit of \"What do I do to best promote the gifted potential that I am seeing in my child?\" We each become who we are and what we can do as the result of a very complex array of DNA (visually portrayed in the Ridley article) interacting with a complex set of dynamically convoluting planned, chance, and coincidental environmental events. So, too, when we focus on the gifted or extraordinary abilities in our developing children, we need to look at how we might approach their unique development and what part we might best play in identifying, releasing, and supporting their individual array of potentials. The genetic map our children have had transmitted through us as parents is not an immutable, \"set in marble\" single plan of directions for getting to a preset destination. We won?t even be able to identify that ultimate destination until our child arrives at it. Thus, the question \"Is my child gifted?\" requires a prescient frame of mind about \"nature via nurture.\"  Do the possibilities of a child?s map include alternate routes to the same destination or perhaps to several different destinations? Given the genes these children inherit, what kind of environment will provide the most beneficial or nurturing medium for those genes to develop?",

        "description":"The 1972 publication of the Marland Report by the U.S. Commissioner of Education proposed a multifaceted definition of gifted and talented education, enhancing what traditionally had been a focus on academics. Leadership materialized as a component of giftedness, along with general intellectual ability, specific academic aptitude, creative or productive thinking, visual and performing arts, and psychomotor ability (Foster, 1981; Karnes, Riley, & McGinnis, 1996). States, including but not limited to Indiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Idaho, and Colorado, all define giftedness in their state education codes as including a high or unusual capacity for leadership (Stephens & Karnes, 2000). Definitions of giftedness and subsequently leadership at both the federal and state levels of government present an ongoing struggle between one based on governmental policy and one that can be conceptually and empirically defined (Foster). The inclusion of leadership in state education definitions of giftedness necessitates measures to identify those with leadership qualities; however, few exist. The measurements that are available  possess marginal psychometric properties or are not normed for this specific population (Oakland, Falkenberg, & Oakland, 1996).",

Based on self organization patterns of groups, a leader emerges while other group members move into roles that are best suited for their skills and personalities (Cattell & Stice, 1954;  Roach, Wyman, Brookes, Chavez, Heath, & Valdes, 1999; Zaror & Guastello, 2000). This study examined the question of whether leaders can be identified through observations in a problem-solving situation where students are assigned to groups where no leader is appointed or designated. In each of six groups, the facilitator and counselor, students, and research observers reached agreement regarding the leader.  The existing leadership assessment instruments are largely teacher or selfreport instruments. These instruments often fail to define a specific set of behaviors linked to leadership. Furthermore, none of the instruments specifically assess leadership in an authentic setting. These concerns with current leadership assessment instruments require a new light to be cast.",

Germane to the spill-over effect is the concept of reciprocity  among educational programs or the means by which one program can share content and pedagogy to enhance another program. The spill-over effect reinforces the affiliation, rather than the isolation, of gifted education. This advocacy strategy evokes controversy. Some people argue that the spill-over effect obliterates the distinctiveness of gifted education and diminishes its value. Others argue that every specialized educational program can contribute to the education of all students under certain conditions. While these arguments continue and are not resolved easily, the need and efforts to advocate on behalf of gifted students also continues and must be addressed. Advocacy efforts that are specific in purpose and precise in procedure are more apt to be influential in shaping opinion and action.",

        "description":"Once identified, students should be given a wide variety of opportunities to develop their leadership potential in the classroom. This article offers information on rating scales, programs, and other resources that can be used in implementing leadership education into the gifted classroom. One rating scale, The Leadership Skills Inventory (LSI), identifies nine areas of leadership that should be developed. They include fundamentals of leadership, written communication skills, speech communication skills, character-building skills, decision-making skills, group-dynamic skills, problem- solving skills, personal skills, and planning skills (Karnes & Chauvin, 2000b). The LSI is not designed to identify giftedness in leadership, but rather a student?s current level in the nine areas, and it gives teachers a map for areas in need of improvement. Students rate and score themselves, then they plot their scores on a leadership profile that provides a visual representation of areas of strength and areas in need of further instruction.",

However, basic communication between parents and teachers is often difficult. When children are exceptional, problems with communication are only magnified. The solution is to facilitate communication intentionally. To develop strong communication between teachers and parents, ask the members of each group what they would like the other to know and record the answers. The author conducted two meetings, to strengthen communication between teachers and parents of students in the highly capable programs. This document lists the Teachers' messages for parents and the parents' messages for teachers. By communicating openly, two issues emerged: (1) Parents wanted some fine-tuning of homework policies; and (2) teachers wanted to remind parents about balance in their children's lives.",

When Amit returned to his home in Lubbock, TX, and tried to replicate his newfound recreation, his night of bowling fun ended after 10 minutes in an asthma attack. His second attempt at Lubbock bowling also brought a return of the asthma terror. He said, \"My mother didn't let me go back again. This became sort of serious because I wanted to have some fun.\" After Amit identified the problem as the second hand smoke in the bowling alley, he started seeking a solution to this problem. To redress this situation, fourth and fifth grade students Abby, Amit, Ben, David, Lori, Rachel, and Wade started a campaign called STIR: Stop Tobacco in Restaurants. The goal was to end smoking in public places, including restaurants, bowling alleys, sports bars, and pool halls. For 2 years they motivated their peers and coordinated an information campaign to urge kids and adults to find out about the dangers of secondhand smoke, and they eventually succeeded in passing a city ordinance banning smoking in public places.

Not only are reading experts expanding their notion of literacy to include technology use (Leu, 2003), but it is included in literacy in other disciplines, as well (Burkhardt et al., 2003), and technology skills often cross disciplines. The skills that educators of gifted and talented students have been advocating for the past half-century are now on the fore front of the literacy movement. This article asserts that these skills must be embraced through technology. The Internet needs to be the primary focus as technology integration within classrooms is considered. Simply using technology in the classroom does not ensure that students are acquiring new literacies. Help must be given to young people in using the vast resources of the Internet to solve problems and achieve specific goals efficiently and effectively.",

States like Virginia, for example, offer Latin for gifted middle school students in selected school districts, run a countywide  summer program in a rural area of the state, and offer it as a regular option for elementary students at a college Saturday program. Moreover, each year the state sponsors a 3 week Latin Academy in which selected students have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the subject with classics professors from across the state. Latin has many hidden benefits that are not often explicated and, therefore, are not well understood. It is especially well matched to verbally precocious learners who have the capacity to handle abstraction and rigorous analytical activity. This article puts forth an argument for the optimal match of the subject  matter of Latin for verbally precocious students at the secondary level, beginning no later than the middle school years. It delineates the major benefits for students of learning the language and links those benefits to a view of differentiation in curricula and instruction of the gifted. Furthermore, the article provides a blueprint for schools on developing a Latin program of study over the secondary years.",

Questions examined the alignment between DISCOVER and Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences (MI) and assessed gender and ethnic differences. The sample consisted of 395 middle school students, predominantly Mexican Americans and Native Americans belonging to lower socioeconomic classes, from schools in Arizona. Results supported a good fit between DISCOVER and MI theory. That is, students identified as gifted in one intelligence were not necessarily identified in other intelligences. The 2 x 3 MANOVA (gender by ethnicity) showed no significant interaction or main effect for ethnicity. However, a main effect for gender was found with males outperforming females in math. No overall gender or ethnic differences in identification were revealed. In total, 12.4% of the participants were identified, suggesting that using DISCOVER might diminish the long-standing problem of minority underrepresentation in gifted programs.",

In particular, it has called into question many of the moral and ethical foundations we take for granted as norms of a functioning society. In the wake of these events, it is important for teachers to allow students, in particular the gifted, to voice their thoughts and critically examine issues pertinent to society and life. The study of literature through the prism of critical thinking can allow the student to experience its cohesiveness to life. Literature can be practical, inspirational, appealing, stimulating, and educational if approached with this purpose in mind. This paper describes how gifted high school seniors at a rural Midwestern public school discerned the nature of \"truths\" about society and life by critically examining a simple contemporary novel. Vignettes of student discussions that illustrate critical thinking and express \"controversial\" views are presented along with commentaries. It also offers discussion of the implications of using fiction as a didactic tool to examine existential problems in the high school classroom.",

By undertaking this 3-year program, students learn not just about science, but how to do science like a practitioner in the field. First, students identify a topic they wish to investigate by doing an extensive review of articles. Then, they find a mentor to help them do research on their topic. Finally, students publish their results.

        "description":"Can students with learning and attention difficulties in school actually be talented scientists in disguise? This article presents a model that was highly successful in identifying and developing scientific talent in these special students. The factors that contributed to the success of the model were the following: The emphasis was on helping students become creative producers. The model also featured a strong mentoring component that included role-modeling and problem solving within specific scientific domains and provided students with authentic, discovery-based, experiential, advanced level subject matter of the domain. Finally, the alternate means of assessing student achievement focused on a student's performance and the product he or she created, rather than on test scores. Students demonstrated their ability to be competitive, collaborative, and to apply problem-solving skills. These performances resulted in the students? shifting their identity from loser to winner.",

Mini-case studies were presented for the 10 Sociometric Stars and hypotheses were advanced to explain their failure to qualify for the Beyonders.

A series of teaching experiments was conducted with 1 gifted and 1 average 7th-grade student to investigate how the gifted student's mathematical concepts and operation constructions differed from those of the average student. The teaching experiment approach provides opportunities for gifted and average students to be challenged by immersion in various advanced mathematical topics. The data analysis provides evidence that the gifted student was more adept at applying mathematical ideas to unfamiliar problems. As a result of being able to see mathematical patterns and to think abstractly, the gifted student was able to use analytical, deductive, and inductive reasoning to solve problems in more flexible and creative ways than the average student.",

Interviews, questionnaires, transcriptions of videotaped consultation sessions, and observations of classroom instruction showed that participants coplanned lessons, utilized collaborative teaching, and developed a close rapport. Service was provided directly through a pull-out model that offered little in the way of training the teacher for differentiating the curriculum. Moving to a more indirect model of service would require better communication of role and goal expectations between the two participants. However, given the shortage of resources in many schools and the highly competitive demands for time during the school day, implementation is \"a long road\" that is likely to be traversed over an extended time period.",

        "author":["Sriraman, Bharath"],
        "description":"High school students normally encounter the study and use of formal proof in the context of Euclidean geometry. Professional mathematicians typically use an informal trial-and-error approach to a problem, guided by intuition, to arrive at the truth of an idea. Formal proof is pursued only after mathematicians are intuitively convinced about the truth of an idea. Is the use of intuition to arrive at the plausibility of a mathematical truth unique to the professional mathematician? How do mathematically gifted students form the truth of an idea? In this study, 4 mathematically gifted freshmen with no prior exposure to proof nor high school geometry were given the task of establishing the truth or falsity of a nonroutine geometry problem, sometimes referred to as \"circumscribing a triangle\" problem. This problem asks whether it is true that for every triangle there is a circle that passes through each of the vertices. This paper describes and interprets the processes used by the mathematically gifted students to establish truth and compares these processes to those used by professional mathematicians. All 4 students were able to think flexibly, as evidenced in their ability to reverse the direction of a mental process and arrive at the correct conclusion. This paper further validates the use of Krutetskiian constructs of flexibility and reversibility of mental processes in gifted education as characteristics of the mathematically gifted student.",

This qualitative interview study examined differences in the interpretation of successes and failures between gifted college students scoring high on either socially prescribed or self-oriented perfectionism. Findings indicated that socially prescribed perfectionists tended to minimize their successes. They made internal attributions for failure, and they overgeneralized and inflated its ramifications. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionists took pride in their successes and made internal attributions for them. With regard to their failures, they made attributions that were situation-specific, and they were able to keep them in perspective. However, they did report frustration and anger when confronting a failure in a situation where they had applied their greatest effort.

To map the teacher's behavior, a dance-adapted version of the Leadership Scale for Sport (LSS; Chelladurai & Saleh, 1980) was constructed as the Leadership Scale for Dance (LSD). The LSD was administered to both teachers and students of the dance department of the Amsterdam Theatre School. In addition, dance teachers were asked to rate daily class behaviors of the themselves as teachers, and dance students were asked to rate their current dance teacher. While the characteristics of the ideal teacher were very similar for both teachers and students, large differences appeared in the rating of daily class activities. Ratings of the teachers and dance classes are interpreted within the framework given by the LSD scales, that is, as indications of the behavior characteristics of the ideal dance teacher.",

Despite this history, there appears to be little consensus regarding the relationship between leadership education and education for talented and gifted youth. This review analyzes publications about leadership education among talented and gifted students since 1980. Four major emphases are identified within this literature, and empirical articles within each area of emphasis are summarized and critiqued. Analysis confirms that a consolidated theoretical framework for leadership giftedness has not yet materialized, although limited consensus may be emerging regarding the aspects of leadership that are more or less responsive to instruction. Findings suggest that more research may be needed to justify retaining leadership ability within the federal definition of giftedness. Three suggested directions for future research on youth leadership giftedness are extrapolated from this foundation.",

For this study, we examined the curricular focus of alternate assessments using performance indicators in math, language arts, and functional skills from 31 states. Experts in math education, language arts, and severe disabilities, along with a group of stakeholders (i.e., teachers and administrators), examined the performance indicators relative to their alignment to national standards and curricula. Experts and stakeholders identified states that had alternate assessment performance indicators that were clearly aligned to math or language arts and those that did not. A subgroup also considered the functionality of the indicators. Through a series of discussions, experts and stakeholders identified features of the performance indicators that exemplified alignment with general or functional curricula, including specificity of content, wording, required response, and gradeor age-level appropriateness. The results suggest that alternate assessments have a strong focus on academic skills but also reflect an additive curricular approach linking academic and functional skills.",

Then, policies supporting integration and efforts to implement integration are discussed, followed by an analysis of systemic problems for integration and challenges to effective integration. Prospects for future special education services are considered. The author concludes that successful integration and quality provision of special education will rely on policies and governmental leadership in eliminating systemics problems such as elitism, a nonaccepting school culture and teacher attitudes, inadequate teacher training and qualifications, and inefficient resource allocation and monitoring.",

In the present study, the cognitive and academic performance of 171 thirteen-year-old graduates of 2 ECSE curricula is examined. Although preschool cognitive measures continued to predict later performance significantly, there were numerous examples of \"errors of prediction,\" that is, children whose later academic performance was substantially better or worse than predicted on the basis of a regression equation. Six individual and family factors were individually at least moderately associated with outcome status and collectively strongly correlated with status as \"improver\" or \"decreaser\": positive temperament, European American ethnicity, male gender, middle income, initial referral for gross motor concerns, and nonreferral for social concerns.",

Single-case designs that focus on intervention response and intensity are reviewed as a potential evaluation framework for interdisciplinary teams to help answer special services resource questions. Increasing-intensity designs are based on sequential intervention trials ordered on a continuum that builds in intensity. Decreasing-intensity designs start with more comprehensive or multicomponent interventions and intervention facets that are systematically withdrawn so that interventions become more natural and ecologically sustainable. The advantages and challenges associated with these designs for use in special education eligibility decisions are discussed as models for child evaluation in schools.",

The sample comprised 98 children with learning disorders from general education classes in four public elementary schools and 107 typically developing children from the same classes. Significant intergroup differences emerged in socioemotional and academic adjustment as well as attachment-based factors. Moreover, attachment-based factors were significantly correlated with adjustment measures and significantly mediated the association between learning disorders and socioemotional adjustment.

Findings indicated that parents were able to apply the constant time delay procedure and that students successfully acquired the purchasing skill when taught by their parents.

Teachers (N = 240) identified which of 30 social skills were essential for classroom success. Results indicated that while middle and high school teachers are relatively similar in their expectations regarding cooperation and self-control skills, they have different opinions about the importance of assertion skills. However, none of the assertion items was rated by the majority of respondents as critical for success by any of the subgroups (program type, secondary level). Findings also indicated that secondary level and program type were associated with the importance placed on assertion skills. These variables, as well as credential status, were also associated with teachers' ratings about cooperation skills. Implications for prereferral interventions, inclusive programming, and transitioning from middle school to high school are discussed.",

The WAA is an assessment of the academic performance of students with significant disabilities and is an alternative to the traditional on-demand achievement test. Alternate assessments like the WAA are required by federal law and are expected to be aligned with state content standards. The primary purpose of this investigation was to determine the extent to which the WAA adequately measured the concepts and skill areas represented in Wisconsin's Model Academic Standards. The ratings of an expert panel (N = 10) that participated in the WAA  Alignment Institute provided data regarding the alignment of WAA items to the standards. The expert panel's responses indicated that the WAA generally meets the multifaceted criteria developed by Webb (1997) and advocated by Title I reviewers for acceptable alignment between assessments and curriculum expectations as articulated in academic content standards.",

These choices are shrouded in increasingly contentious debates as teacher shortages reach crisis proportions. Yet, research on special education teacher education is almost nonexistent. Findings from comparative research documenting the characteristics of effective teacher education programs can inform these choices, but these findings should be grounded in what we know from previous research in general teacher education. To assist educators, we have analyzed literature in general and special teacher education toward two ends. First, we present a framework, derived from work in general education, for analyzing teacher education programs. Second, we use this framework to analyze practice in teacher education in special education. Specifically, we conducted an exhaustive review of special education program descriptions and evaluations. We conclude by describing steps necessary to improve the special education teacher education research base.",

Latent class analysis of a comprehensive test of mathematics taken by fourth-grade students with various disabilities reveals that a model with 2 latent classes is adequate to characterize the latent structure of the data. A parallel relationship of response profiles across the 2 classes suggests differences in the levels of mathematical ability (quantitative), rather than differences in the type of mathematical ability (qualitative), between the 2 latent classes in terms of generic mathematical proficiency. Cross-validation on a separate data set with careful matching of content areas within the math test verified this conclusion. Although a significant relationship exists between the identified latent classes and various disabilities, the analysis also found common mathematical problem-solving behaviors across disability categories.

Additional participation options beyond the usual three (participation without accommodations, participation with accommodations, alternate assessment) were more evident in state policies, and states continued to increase the number of accommodations included in their policies. Some states allowed accommodations for all students regardless of whether they received special education services.

Second, an instructional program that teaches a common expository text structure, compare/contrast, is evaluated in a series of studies; content similar to science content typically taught at the primary level is used.

Participants' reading ability was assessed in the fall, before the first year of the intervention, and again in the spring of Years 1, 2, 3, and 4. At the end of the 2-year intervention, students who received the supplemental instruction performed  significantly better than their matched controls on measures of entry-level reading skills (i.e., letter?word identification and word attack), oral reading fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. The benefits of the instruction were still clear 2 years after instruction had ended, with students in the supplemental instruction condition still showing significantly greater growth on the measure of oral reading fluency. Hispanic students benefited from the supplemental reading instruction in English as  much as or more than non-Hispanic students.

First, ARC is defined, and the confluence of factors that has hastened its growth and popularity, particularly in specialized, high-need areas such as special education, is discussed. Second, available research in the area of ARC in special education is summarized, with particular attention to the efficacy of the various approaches and programs and to the process and outcome variables used to assess program impact. Third, programmatic features associated with successful ARC programs are described, and what remains unknown about ARC programs is discussed. We conclude with a series of recommendations for policymakers and teacher educators.",

Some schools buy enough handhelds for students to check out for the entire school year and use much like their textbooks--a one-to-one model. Other schools purchase sets of handhelds that students use in class as needed, more like microscopes used in the science lab--a lab model. But which of these models is right for your school? First, you?ll need to think about your budget constraints and your goals for using handhelds in your school.",

Students use technology individually and collaboratively to produce reflections of their own learning and representations of  their thinking. They enjoy becoming technology-literate. In addition, technology has enhanced the differentiation of the curriculum by facilitating open-ended activities and creative production such as writing, drawing, photojournaling, bookmaking, and webbing. Technology has supported students in moving from concrete experiences to abstract concepts. Just like adults, 3- to 7-year-olds use technology to research answers to their  own questions and produce representations of their findings. Students have gone beyond gaming and consuming. They have grown socially, emotionally, and cognitively as they  used technology to create, collaborate, and problem solve in order to express their ideas.",

Graduate and undergraduate preservice teachers (n = 326) from three universities completed the Preservice Inclusion Survey (PSIS) during the first and last class sessions of enrollment in a survey of exceptionalities course. The results of this study have implications for future teachers' acceptance and disposition in serving students with disabilities in general classrooms. Participants in a survey of exceptionalities course significantly decreased their level of anxiety and hostility toward serving students with disabilities in general education settings. More research is needed to define disposition toward serving students with disabilities.",

Yet efforts to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of CS have been scarce. We compared instructional effectiveness of CS to another commonly used discussion strategy, an application question (AQ) method, with graduate students enrolled in a preservice teacher training course, using a repeated measures experimental design. Our specific focus was facilitation of the application of knowledge. Dependent measures included group scores on discussion guides, group discussion time, individual midterm quiz scores, and student satisfaction ratings. There were no significant differences between two discussion methods in midterm quiz scores, which was the measure of delayed application, and in the student satisfaction ratings; however, the AQ groups obtained higher scores on the discussion guides, the measure of immediate application, and took less time to complete the discussion activity than did the CS groups.

The amount of time required for each preservice teacher to reach a pre-established training criterion (i.e., unassisted use of CWPT for three consecutive sessions with fidelity ratings of 85% and above) was calculated and specific implementation comments and concerns were recorded. Academic effects on pupils' spelling test performance were assessed using weekly pretests and posttests and social validity data were collected from all primary consumers. Key outcomes were that (a) preservice teachers were able implement CWPT with a high degree of accuracy with about 60 minutes of in class assistance, (b) use of CWPT resulted in high spelling grades on weekly posttests for all pupils, (c) preservice and cooperating teachers and their pupils reported favorable \"treatment acceptability\" for CWPT, and (d) some preservice teachers made procedural adaptations that appeared to be related to lower levels of pupil satisfaction.

These factors were combined to create an aggregate teacher quality measure. All five factors emerged as viable components of an aggregate teacher quality measure, although some modest factor loadings suggested a need for further research into the precise nature of these teacher quality dimensions and the best ways to measure them.",

Both regular and special education teacher preparation programs struggle with the requirement to collect valid and reliable evidence of teacher candidate performance and their effect on student learning. This study incorporated an ecobehavioral assessment tool (MS-CISSAR) in the evaluation of 13 special education teacher candidates during their internship experiences. Special education teacher candidates taught in deaf education classrooms and self-contained and resource rooms for students with disabilities. Results showed that the instructional arrangements, teaching behaviors and student responses were similar to studies using inservice teachers and students with disabilities as subjects. The incorporation of data gathered through the MS-CISSAR program could be used to meet university and NCATE requirements for evidence of teacher candidate performance.",

One area of concern relates to inadequate preparation of teachers for the reality of the classroom. We were interested in determining the role of practicum experiences in special education teacher preparation. Surveys were mailed to randomly selected Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). Faculty responded to questions regarding teacher candidate field experiences. Results indicated that in most cases, faculty and/or staff members in the special education unit are responsible for locating and assigning students to field placements. The most typical response to minimum qualifications for cooperating or mentoring teachers was an appropriate teaching license and at least 3 years of teaching experience. Most cooperating/ mentoring teachers are paid an honorarium averaging $147. University faculty members supervise about 12 students each for fieldwork prior to student teaching. However, during student teaching, most supervisors are assigned approximately 7 students. The results of this study present a snapshot of current practice in fieldwork in special education preparation. Additional research is needed particularly to examine the role fieldwork plays in future teacher success.",

The school first became involved with the University through a research project designed to support the school's efforts at restructuring and soon became a full-fledged Professional Development School (PDS). Students' scores on highstakes assessment measures were the primary data sources. These scores are presented in descriptive form--no statistical analyses were applied. Students' test scores increased over the years and were higher than the scores of students in comparable schools. Individual interviews were also conducted to obtain teachers' and administrators' perceptions of the effects of the partnership on student achievement. Interviews revealed that teachers and administrators perceived that students benefited in academic, social/affective, and general domains. Furthermore, they attributed gains in student achievement to their partnership with the University.",

The authors argue that special rural knowledge and skills may be required for early interventionists and special educators to be satisfied and productive in rural areas. Both recruitment and retention of rural special educators can be challenging, leading in many states to gaps in services for infants, toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities who live with their families in rural or remote areas. This article began with a review of the literature on personnel preparation for rural services. It summarizes data from 96 recent rural personnel preparation projects funded by U.S. Department of Education (USDE), Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) and shares the results of an e-mail survey of the directors of recent OSEP rural projects that have concluded. Based on this triad of sources, the authors discuss (a) rural knowledge and skills to be incorporated into personnel preparation programs, (b) effective recruitment strategies for rural professionals, (c) methods of delivering training to personnel in rural areas, and (d) outcomes of the OSEP rural projects. The authors offer recommendations to university personnel and policy makers to increase stability and reduce the longstanding shortages of qualified personnel for rural services.",

Thus, teacher educators must encourage teachers to use effective teaching practices. One technique for increasing use of effective practices is providing feedback to teachers on both newly acquired and ingrained teaching behaviors. To determine attributes of effective  performance feedback, a systematic search for empirical literature was completed. Analysis of the ten identified studies indicates attributes of feedback that have been studied fall into categories of (a) nature of feedback, (b) temporal dimensions of feedback, and (c) who gives feedback. Through this review, attributes of feedback were classified as either promising or effective practice in changing specific teaching behaviors. Only immediate feedback was identified as an effective attribute. Promising practices for feedback to teachers included feedback that was specific, positive, and/or corrective.

Eighty-two faculty members from institutions of higher education across the U.S. rated the importance of and the extent to which they taught five categories of content associated with family-centered services. Content associated with Knowledge of Families, IFSP/IEP Skills, and Respecting Diversity were taught significantly more than Communication Skills and Knowledge of Team Work.

Weighted z[r] effect sizes were also computed for five outcome categories: anxiety, disruptive behaviors, irrationality, self-concept, and grade point average. In terms of magnitude, the largest positive mean effect of REBT was on disruptive behaviors. Analyses also revealed the following noteworthy findings: (a) there was no statistical difference between studies identified low or high in internal validity; (b) REBT appeared equally effective for children and adolescents presenting with and without identified problems; (c) nonmental health professionals produced REBT effects of greater magnitude than their mental health counterparts; (d) the longer the duration of REBT sessions, the greater the impact, and (e) children benefited more from REBT than adolescents.

        "description":"This study investigated differences between students' perceptions of their best teachers in primary and higher education in Poland. Teacher behavior was conceptualized in terms of the teacher-student interpersonal relationship and described in terms of eight behavioral sectors ? leadership, helpful/friendly, understanding, student responsibility/freedom, uncertain, dissatisfied, admonishing and strict ? and two independent dimensions called Influence (teacher dominance vs. submission) and Proximity (teacher cooperation vs. opposition). Data were gathered from 199 higher education students, 173 students from a higher vocational institute and 26 students from one university, and 105 primary education students. Results indicate that while preferred teaching in Poland is perceived in a similar fashion as in other countries, differences can be found across the educational contexts of interest.",

Participants took part in an art psychotherapy or an art as therapy group intervention. Self-esteem was measured with a questionnaire designed by the authors and the Harter Adolescent Self-Perception Profile. There were no significant differences on the questionnaire postintervention, with both groups reporting increased feelings of mastery, connection, and self-approval. On Harter?s Profile, administered pre and post, both showed an increase in global selfworth. However, the art psychotherapy group showed a significant increase in domains of close friendship and behavioral conduct whereas the art as therapy group did so in the domain of social acceptance. This implies an approach can be selected to build greater trust and self-disclosure or to foster general group cohesion, based on client needs.",

After undergoing a brief anxiety-induction, 84 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to color a mandala, to color a plaid form, or to color on a blank piece of paper. Results demonstrated that anxiety levels declined approximately the same for the mandala-and plaid-coloring groups and that both of these groups experienced more reduction in anxiety than did the unstructured-coloring group.

They were also willing to be critical and to challenge others' assumptions, images, beliefs, and positions, which they usually prefaced with supportive and attenuating remarks. In addition, both men and women were equally likely to mock and exclude those who did not abide by the conventions of the group norms, although such comments were uncommon.

The data collected were part of a three-year study supported by the National Science Foundation of an entire teacher education program to investigate how preservice teachers (PSTs) become socialized to the role of teaching and how they develop as technology using teachers in a technology-rich teacher education program. The article presents survey data from all the students in the program, focus group and interview data with a cohort of early childhood PSTs, and intensive case studies with two early childhood PSTs with data from their freshman to their senior years.

However, the findings suggest that the digital gap starts to widen as children move into first grade. Even though children's access to most computer resources at school increased from kindergarten to first grade, children attending higher poverty schools had significantly fewer computers and software programs available.

Through a longitudinal case study of an urban arts-humanities technology inquiry group, this research reveals three phases of group development: (a) defining the group, (b) identifying content-focused technology inquiries, and (c) initiating content-focused technology inquiries. The main advantage of the first year of participation for teachers was their use of technology to solve content-related problems in their classrooms. Challenges included a shifting content focus for the inquiry group, time availability for participants' inquiries, and the availability of technological innovations that matched the participants' problems of practice.",

A complex variety of contextual and conceptual factors influencing the integration of technology into student teaching experiences are presented, including access to technology, on-site support, and beliefs about mentoring. Findings describe the practices of cooperating teachers in mentoring student teachers toward technology use. In order for student teachers to learn how to support student-centered lessons with technology, they need knowledgeable mentor teachers and adequate access to technology to practice and develop those lessons. Recommendations for other school district/university partnerships attempting to integrate technology in field experiences include the implementation of frequent professional development sessions for mentors that help them build knowledge about how to teach in reform-minded ways with technology and how to mentor student teachers to teach in ways consistent with reform standards. Mentors should be introduced to new practices integrating technology with curriculum-based, student-centered activities that expose them to new models for teaching and learning and learn to encourage novices to teach in similar ways through modeling, practicing, and analyzing teaching together.",

        "description":"As the number of computers accessible to students and teachers has increased, there has been a growing emphasis on integrating technology across the curriculum. Even though schools increasingly invest in new technologies, the actual use of computers in classrooms remains limited. This paper examines a model developed to guide the implementation of a Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to use Technology (PT[3]) project and its capacity to promote improvement of teachers' ability to integrate technologies into their instructional practice. The essential conditions, identified by ISTE, provided the foundation on which this model was developed. Emphasis was placed on access, professional development, support, incentives, and assessment, with the remaining conditions embedded within. The findings indicate that the model was effective in improving teachers' technical skills and their ability to integrate technology into instructional practice.",

A learning-habit inclinations questionnaire (LHIQ) was constructed and administered to 288 students. Factor analysis revealed four factors: \"time management,\" \"ease of access\" to learning materials, \"positive aspects of interaction,\" and \"negative aspects of interaction.\" Seven satellite-based synchronous tutorials were delivered to 92 students in a Research Methods course. The following semester, 73 other students taking the same course received the same seven tutorials with the same tutor but in a mixed mode of delivery: three similar satellite-based synchronous tutorials and four satellite-based asynchronous videocassettes containing the recorded tutorials of the previous semester. Attitudes toward different components of the learning environments were measured and the LHIQ was administered. Results revealed that preferences of tutorial mode were determined by students' learning-habit inclinations: Those who prefer the satellite-based synchronous tutorials have stronger views toward the positive aspects of interactions and score lower on the need for autonomy and access to learning materials than those who prefer the satellite-based asynchronous tutorials. Methodological (lessons on field research), theoretical (significance of learning styles in effective teaching and learning), and practical (flexibility in teaching practices) implications are discussed.",

        "description":"The U.S. Department of Education sponsored a summit that addressed the need for scientifically-based evidence on the use of technology in teaching and learning. One hundred leaders from the Preparing Tomorrow's Teachers to Use Technology (PT[3]) federal initiative were invited to participate in the meeting, held in Fall 2003. The recommendations from that meeting offer a framework for future discussion of this topic. These educational leaders agreed on the need for identification through research of the best practices in the use of technology in teacher education. Studies to determine the generalizable effects of technology in teacher preparation programs are essential because of the key role of the teacher in education and because of the existing evidence on the need for in-depth preparation of teachers to use technology effectively. The full range of research approaches and methodologies are essential to find out what works in the Information Society, where rapidly increasing adoption of technology is having complex system-wide effects. Both quantitative and qualitative measures will be essential in this research. The evidence used to identify effective practice should include a variety of outcome measures that encompass preservice teacher and faculty portfolios, classroom observations of teacher candidates during their preparation program and into their induction years, and the achievement of their K-12 students over the years. Teacher education must be a strong force to promote appropriate uses of technology to support educational renewal and to prepare a skilled work force for our Information Society. Identification of the best practices in information technology in teacher education through large-scale, well-designed research programs is essential and will require substantial state and federal resources.",

        "description":"In November 2004, economists Thomas Fuchs and Ludger Woessmann published a statistical analysis of the relationship between technology and student achievement using year 2000 data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The 2000 PISA was the first in a series of triennial assessments of 15-year-olds conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The assessment included problems in reading, math, and science, as well as questions about student background, school characteristics, and information on the use of computers and the Internet at home and at school. Fuchs and Woessmann analyzed data from 31 countries: 96,855 students tested in math and 174,227 students tested in reading. The contention of this paper is that, even if the regression model were more complex, the sampling issues resolved, and the reliability established for all items, no more than the following still remain: (1) the presence of technology is not, by itself, related to student achievement; and (2) the use of technology may help or hinder academic learning, depending on the nature of the use. The quality of data in a survey such as PISA 2000 simply does not permit much more elaboration.",

Various agencies have developed computer-based and web-based software applications to improve student performance on these tests. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of one such application, FCAT Explorer, on student FCAT scores. We used hierarchical analysis of variance and analysis of covariance to compare scores for schools that used FCAT Explorer, and schools that did not. We examined fourth, fifth, eighth, and tenth grade FCAT reading and mathematics scores for selected elementary schools and high schools. Student scores from elementary schools using FCAT Explorer were significantly higher than scores from elementary schools that did not use FCAT Explorer. At the high school level, we found no significant differences in scores between schools that used FCAT Explorer and schools that did not use the application.",

This interpretive case study of two middle school science-math teachers was driven by the general question: Given ubiquitous computing, how do teachers use computers in constructing curriculum and delivering instruction? Specifically, the researchers sought to examine the facilitators and barriers for teachers in using laptops in the classroom. Using qualitative methods, the researchers collected data during the first year of the Maine Learning Technology Initiative (MLTI). Differential effects of one-to-one computing on each teacher were found along two dimensions: the effect of technical technological issues, and the educational effect of technology policies. For both teachers, the effects were deeply altered by the teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning, which in turn affected their ultimate choices of how their time (and their students' time) was spent. This empirical study offers a preliminary analysis and can be used both as a reflective mirror for practitioners and as a guide for administrators and teacher educators.",

In light of this increase, it is apparent that there will be demand for teachers who are prepared to teach from a distance and a complementary need for local counselors. The U.S. Department of Education agreed that the creation of a model for incorporating virtual schooling in preservice teacher education programs accompanied by appropriate assessment of the effect for a range  of competencies would be a significant innovation. This article describes the planned model led by Iowa State University and the evaluation designed to establish its effectiveness, including dissemination through a national community of practice. For example, evaluation of the competence of counselors, who will be prepared to mentor K-12 students learning from a distant teacher, moves from a formative approach into scientifically-based research with experimental and control groups. In addition, instruments to measure institutional adoption include a modified version of the CBAM instrument developed by Christensen and longitudinal surveys of preservice student teachers and graduates.",

Inclusion has been more successful in primary than in secondary schools. Secondary schools remain a challenge due to their traditional focus on curriculum, examinations, subjects and the large numbers of students allocated to each teacher. A qualitative methodology was used to identify the attributes, attitudes, knowledge and skills of inclusive teachers and the optimal means of their acquisition. Inclusive secondary teachers are dedicated, accomplished teachers. They feel empathy for their students and are student-rather than subject-centered. They work and learn collaboratively. Inclusive teachers need special education expertise or to be able to access special education knowledge at the point of need. Just as students with disabilities depend on their teachers, so too are secondary teachers dependent on their schools and systems to provide support during the learning process.",

The Combined Elementary and Special Education program has as its main goal to provide specialized cross training for special and general educators who work in highly diverse inclusive public school settings. The training allows teachers to earn credentials in (a) elementary education, (b) special education, and (c) bilingual education. By combining and redesigning three existing programs at SFSU, the students now earn credentials in each of these three areas faster, while benefiting from the strengths of these multiple disciplines. The Autism Spectrum graduate program is designed to prepare highly qualified educators and related professionals to meet the unique needs of learners with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in diverse settings. This interdisciplinary program is offered at an advanced level for students pursuing any area of special education or a related field. The program enables candidates to earn a (a) Master of Arts (b) Clear Education Specialist Credential Autism and (c) Autism Spectrum Certificate. Through participation in this program, students demonstrate working knowledge of state-of-the-art training models, strategies and philosophies to guide them in implementing appropriate educational programs for learners with ASD in inclusive settings.

        "description":"Special schools, along with an increasing number of mainstream schools that implement inclusive education in Hong Kong, have been making efforts to develop their own school-based curriculum to echo and support the spirit of &quot;one curriculum for all&quot; since the Curriculum Development Council (CDC) of the Education Bureau (EDB) released the consultation document on education reform at the beginning of the new century (CDC, 2001; Fok, 2008; Lian, 2001a, 2001b). However, several concerns surfaced in the process of developing an appropriate and effective curriculum: (a) it was difficult to help students with special education needs (SEN) access the central (i.e., mainstream or compulsory education) curriculum due to the lack of guidance; (b) a common language, as well as a teaching and evaluation system, has not been used with agreed-upon performance standards to describe students' learning progress and attainment; and (c) the phenomena of having low expectations for children with learning difficulties (CWLD) is common due to high emphasis on skills training-oriented education, a lack of direction in teaching and the understanding of Hong Kong's nine generic skills to be developed through the eight key learning areas (KLAs). This paper is, therefore, in an attempt to (a) review the trends and related studies on &quot;access to central curriculum&quot; from international experiences; (b) discuss the concerns on assessment and curriculum development for improving access to central curriculum for students with SEN in Hong Kong with respect to &quot;one curriculum for all&quot;; and (c) describe a project (the SAME project) in Hong Kong and to highlight the accomplishment of the Phase 1 of the project. The implications to the field are also discussed.",

Without a comprehensive understanding of how L2 students interpret the writing task, ESL/EFL writing instructors may not know the sources of various writing problems in students' written texts and hence, may not be able to develop appropriate writing pedagogy. The present study attempts to address this research gap by studying the interpretive process of three high ability college seniors as composing a source-based academic assignment. The findings show that all the participants have different representations of the assigned task. Two of them were less able to make sense of the requirements of such a writing task as expected in the academic community and consequently failed to use the assigned readings as required although they did understand the basic format associated with this task type and had received prior instruction on reading-based writing. First language culture may have affected how they constructed the writing task for themselves as inferring and eliciting the information specified in the writing prompt. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"The phenomenon of style shift in translated texts is ascribed mainly to textual incompatibility in terms of rhetorical asymmetry and divergence at the formality level. Mandatory shifts result from a systematic dissimilarity between the source language and the target language in terms of the underlying system of syntax, semantics and rhetorical patterns. At the textual level, shifts become more frequent in terms of cohesive relations which are manifest in endophoric references, substitution, ellipsis, conjunctions and punctuation. On the other hand, optional shifts are carried out by the translator's personal preferences under the influence of idiolect and level of proficiency in the target language. It is argued that diglossic divergence leads to an increase in the level of formality in translating and subtitling casual dialogues and conversations from English into Arabic. To demonstrate this, samples are taken from a corpus of translated texts to show how various stylistic patterns operate across cultures. (Contains 6 notes.)",

The second objective was to explore whether or not one or a combination of socio-cultural factors are predictors of language proficiency. Finally, the study aims at investigating the effects of gender, age and major on language proficiency. To fulfill the objective, a 100-item language proficiency test (30 items for grammar, 40 items for vocabulary and 30 items for reading comprehension) and a questionnaire including socio-cultural factors were distributed among 510 male and female Iranians taking part in the MA Placement Test at Shiraz University. The data gathered were analyzed descriptively utilizing central tendency measures (mean and standard deviation). Moreover, the collected data were analyzed inferentially using correlation, regression analysis, ANOVA and independent t-test. As such, the following results were obtained: a) although the descriptive statistics showed that females outperformed males in language proficiency, the independent sample t-test revealed that the difference is not significant; b) a significant difference was found between the participants' language proficiency in terms of their majors and their social classes; c) a moderate significant relationship was observed between the participants' language proficiency and their age; d) among various cultural factors, mother's literacy and using films/CDs predict language proficiency to a great extent.

Accuracy and communicability were defined as constructs, and the test development proceeded according to the three stages. The test was conducted as an examination into the assessment tasks and rating scales, and the analyses were done using FACETS. The results showed that 1) the difficulty of the two tasks and the impressionistic scoring were considered equivalent, which provided reasonable fit to the Rasch model, 2) the equivalence of task difficulty may indicate that task development based on construct-based processing approach could be reliable and valid to estimate students' writing ability, and 3) the rating scales associated with the five rating categories and their specific written samples were shown to be mostly comprehensible and usable by raters, and demonstrated acceptable fit.

One-hundred and twenty BA students majoring in English Literature took part in a one-semester experiment. For the experimental group, the integrated approach was utilized whereas the method used for the control group was based on content-cultural model according to which the course instructor provided all the necessary information without focusing on the linguistic or stylistic considerations. The post-test consisted of three parts: linguistic, interpretive and cultural sections. The results of the study confirmed the plausibility of the use of the suggested eclectic approach to teaching literature. Several pedagogical implications were drawn. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"The current paper attempts to account for the formation of English middle sentences. Discussing a set of previous analyses on the construction under investigation we show, following the assumptions of Oosten(1986) and Iwata(1999), that English middle constructions should be divided into two types: generic middle constructions and non-generic middle ones. The distinction is shown to be closely related with the tense aspect of the verbs: the structural subject in the former is interpreted as generic with the present tense, while the latter can take past tense and progressive aspect with a non-generic subject. Other thematic roles than Agent can be realized as the structural subjects. In the generic interpretation, the intrinsic property of the plays the role of cause and is primary responsible for the event denoted by middle verb. In the non-generic interpretation, on the other hand, a specific event plays the part of cause and thus can take the past tense. Middle verbs are lexically derived from a set of activity or accomplishment verbs that carry [-state, +process] aspect features. After derivations, the verbs in the generic interpretation possess [+state, +process, +repetition] aspect feature, and those of the non-generic one, [-state, +process, -repetition]. Another contrast lies in the definiteness of the subjects: the generic interpretation involves an indefinite/generic subject and the non-generic one needs a definite/non-generic subject.

Using a very large random population-based sample of AI/ANs, we compared the impact of three weighting strategies on counts and rates of selected health indicators. We found that different weights examined in this study did not change the percentage estimates of health-related variables for AI/ANs, but did influence the population total estimates dramatically. In survey data, different racial classifications and tabulations of AI/ANs could yield discrepancies in weighted estimates for the AI/AN population. Policy makers need to be aware that the choice of racial classification schemes for this racial-political group can generally influence the data they use for decision making. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that our measure of perceived historical loss and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale were separate but related constructs. Regression analysis indicated that, even when controlling for family factors, perceived discrimination, and proximal negative life events, perceived historical loss had independent effects on adolescent's depressive symptoms. The construct of historical loss is discussed in terms of Indigenous ethnic cleansing and life course theory. (Contains 3 tables and 3 figures.)",

As a result, mentoring programs have experienced exponential growth with little empirical attention during the last decade. This 16-month qualitative investigation within a large city in the northeastern United States, sought to better understand the work of mentors in high-poverty urban schools. Analysis of the data collected led to the identification of three assertions that highlight the interplay that occurs in the urban teacher mentoring context between four critical concepts: novice teacher survival, novice teacher success, onus of responsibility, and a social justice stance. Implications are discussed related to the need for adequate resources, placement, and preparation of mentors in high-poverty schools. Additionally, the study also asserts the role that a passion for or a disposition toward social justice plays in the success and survival of both mentors and novice teachers in urban contexts.

In addition, the study found that professional experience and credentials are not necessarily good indicators of how well teachers will perform with students whose cultures are different from their own. Rather, context, personal history, identity, and the disposition to view teaching and learning as reciprocal and recursive processes are interconnected factors that significantly influence teacher development.

        "description":"The authors of the three papers in this issue discuss and analyze the practice underlying \"critical exploration,\" a research pedagogy applied in common within their separate art, science, and teacher education classrooms. Eleanor Duckworth developed critical exploration as a method of teaching by involving students so actively and reflectively with a subject that they have \"wonderful ideas\" that arise from their own questioning. Teachers who encourage critical exploration support their students in encountering complex materials, experiencing confusion, considering multiple possibilities, and constructing new understandings. Teachers refrain from providing answers, or even implying that there is an acceptable answer or technique, and instead facilitate the personal process of development that Jean Piaget, Barbel Inhelder, and others documented and analyzed. Applying Piaget's findings requires teachers to sustain what David Hawkins described as \"triangular relationships\" of trust and respect among teacher, learners, and subject matter. The three classroom studies that follow narrate these exploratory qualities in the contexts of middle school girls learning Chinese brush painting, undergraduates investigating mirrors, and teacher education students exploring seeds, pendulums, and the moon. In teaching art and science via critical exploration, curiosity and a sense of beauty reinforce one another, and open a window into the processes of--and connections between--art and science.

        "description":"A teacher educator and student of Duckworth's critical exploration approach to teaching shares three episodes taken from science methods courses she teaches for preservice teachers in graduate and undergraduate programs in elementary education. The episodes reveal the pedagogy of critical exploration to be particularly well suited to the preparation of teachers. Classroom episodes are reconstructed using data extracted from student journals and field notes made during and following teaching. Consistent with the pedagogy, the students explore a phenomenon the teacher presents to them: the development of a seed, the swinging of an object on a length of line, the path of the moon in the sky, etc. The teacher, in turn, explores what students respond to, notice, and question; curriculum grows from these mutually reciprocal explorations. The teacher's exploration of what students are seeing, feeling, and thinking, and the connections they are making, creates an environment that supports further development in what students notice, which enriches the teacher's understanding of the phenomenon. Students' exploratory experiences with the subject matters they will teach in the public setting provide a framework for assimilating the experiences and thinking of young children. Teaching, learning, and research go hand in hand. The liberatory and transformational aspects of critical exploration for learners and teacher alike emerge. (Contains 6 figures and 2 footnotes.)",

        "author":["Chiu, Son-Mey"],
        "description":"By following their wonderful ideas or critical exploration, three eighth graders learned how to do traditional Chinese painting, which is taught by copying old masters' work from the Ming Dynasty in the 17th century. The standard manual, which most learners have been using for these three hundred years, is the &quot;Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Chinese Painting&quot;, published in 1679. However, according to my literature review, I found out that ancient masters before the Ming Dynasty talked about a self-directed method of painting manifested in six different ways: (1) production from observation and experience, (2) production from the heart-mind, (3) production from mental-vision, (4) production with authenticity, (5) production with spontaneity, and (6) production with a multidisciplinary approach. As a student of Eleanor Duckworth, I wondered what might happen if beginning students are able to learn this age-old tradition of Chinese painting by just following their wonderful ideas like pre-Ming artists. In the class session described in this article, students explored Chinese brush strokes to paint the Chrysanthemum Painting, one of the traditional &quot;Four Gentlemen Paintings,&quot; after being introduced to water and ink in a previous session. They invented their original brush strokes and uncovered brush methods used by the eminent painter, Zhao Shaoang: strokes for the pollen grains, curls of  flower petals, and leaves of the chrysanthemum. When they viewed a chrysanthemum model from the &quot;Mustard Seed Garden of Chinese Painting&quot; after the session, they thought that their paintings surpassed it. After looking at an ancient chrysanthemum painting on her own, a student commented, &quot;The ancient master painted like me!&quot; (Contains 7 figures and 5 footnotes.)",

Surprised by light's behaviors, the students responded with curiosity, losing their dependence on answers as the format of school knowledge. Inadequacies in how participants supposed light works emerged in the context of reinventing historical discoveries, including Ptolemy's second century AD account of how curved mirrors reflect, Chinese burning mirrors reported in the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), and a ninth century AD Arabic translation of Euclid's surveying proposition. Using historical accounts only as a starting point and motivation, students' improvisational experiments explored personal interests and provided grounds for synthesizing new understandings of light and learning, and for forming relationships of community among each.

Through a phenomenological approach to in-depth interviewing, teachers were interviewed at the end of their first year of teaching. Commonalities in teachers' experiences include former teachers' influences on their teacher personae, negotiating their authoritative role in the classroom, understanding how and why to set boundaries with students, and demonstrating resilience and resolve in the face of multiple challenges. Implications for teacher education and induction programs are to address the disequilibrium of the self in early teaching experiences and to model habits of mind that promote &quot;productive disequilibrium.&quot; (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Induction support for new teachers is widespread, particularly in the form of mentoring, but research evidence of effectiveness is limited. The majority of existing research has focused on the impact of induction on teacher retention. Of greater interest is the potential impact on student achievement, and on which forms of support are the most effective. One frequently encountered option is between full-release or site-based mentors. This study examines these two mentoring options employed in one large urban district. While mentors received the same training, they differed in case load and release time. A comparison of student achievement gains for classes taught by fourth and fifth grade new teachers, some of whom were supported by full release mentors and some by site based mentors, showed greater gains for classes of teachers in the full-release group, even though the demographic characteristics of the students would have led to the opposite prediction.

It is so much that the school system has selected sustainability as one of its 21-century skills--one that all 68,751 students in the system must learn. This selection sets a new direction and purpose for skill acquisition as part of the VBCPS' new strategic plan, &quot;Compass to 2015.&quot; Acknowledging that sustainability is the new workplace skill, the author says the role of career and technical education (CTE) will be to develop new academic approaches to sustainability and continue to explore alternative curriculum paradigms and career pathway applications. In this article, the author asserts that sustainability skills will help everyone understand and support the transitions toward a green economy. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Primary factors inhibiting Hispanic parental involvement were the following: the failure of the school to send correspondence, school calendar, lunch menus or newsletters written in Spanish; the inability of the parents to speak and understand English in personal communication with the school, and the reluctance of the parents to question authority or to advocate for the rights of their children.",

In Western Australia (WA), a state noted for its vastness and number of schools located in rural and remote settings, a scheme developed by the Western Australian Department of Education and Training (DET) and the WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy aims to address this challenge by offering financial support to student teachers who wish to undertake their final practicum in a remote or rural education district in which they hope to work after graduation. The Student Teacher Rural Experience Program (STREP) assists with return travel costs and a weekly stipend for the duration of the practicum. The DET specifies the particular districts to which the STREP will apply and applicants need to satisfy a number of selection criteria. In 2005 a survey involving 2004 and 2005 STREP participants was undertaken to ascertain their opinions about how effective the program was in preparing them to teach in rural locations. This article discusses the quantitative data and participant comments on issues not adequately covered by STREP and how the program might be improved. (Contains 1 table.)",

This mixed methods study included a self-administered survey of Likert-type items measuring 20 factors for job satisfaction and individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Several issues related to dissatisfaction surfaced not presented in previous studies. Teachers often found themselves frustrated at work because of conflicting expectations concerning their professional and social roles within the community and perceived that peers or coalitions within the schools possessed undue influence and power. Of most concern to participants was the perception of being unappreciated. This perception was influenced by the collective bargaining process and promoted the perception of a &quot;lack of respect&quot; and an &quot;unhealthy competition&quot; between homegrown and transplanted faculty. Addressing these perceptions afford rural administrators an opportunity to positively influence teacher retention, teacher quality, student achievement, and school climate.",

Efforts to improve accountability and teacher evaluation have taken an especially unique route in Iowa, where local control and resistance to state mandated curricular standards have been popular topics from the statehouse to the convenience store. This research explores principals' impressions of Iowa's state-mandated standards for best-practice teaching (as opposed to state mandated curricular standards). Further, the research examined the extent to which the Iowa Teaching Standards (ITS) and accompanying Iowa Evaluator Approval Training Program (IEATP) have impacted the way teacher evaluations are conducted in the state's rural schools. Evidence indicates that most principals felt that ITS and the accompanying IEATP made them feel adequately or very well prepared to conduct teacher evaluations. In addition, 65% of respondents reported that IAETP had changed the way teachers are evaluated.",

        "description":"The increased pressure for gains in academic performance in mathematics and science are not going to dissipate, and rural schools must find a way to meet these challenges. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the Carl D. Perkins Federal Vocational and Technical Education Act legislations have also put pressure on career and technical education (CTE) to increase academic standards in CTE curriculum. Infusing mathematics into the curriculum will give students a chance to see the mathematics in a real-world context. The model of infusion proposed by the National Research Center for Career and Technical Education (NRCCTE) has given a viable option to aid in teaching mathematics in context. Further research is needed in order to guide everyone to the best model of mathematics infusion. The NRCCTE model should be tested across more CTE curriculums to determine if it can be implemented nationally. Also, more research is needed on the professional development that CTE and mathematics teachers receive in order to determine its effectiveness. Most of the research in mathematics infusion has taken place with in-service teachers. Mathematics infusion needs to start with the pre-service teachers. An analysis of teacher preparation programs can determine if future CTE instructors are receiving adequate mathematics and science courses to be able to proficiently infuse those academics into the curriculum.

The growth is even more evident in rural areas of the United States such as North Carolina where teachers are facing classrooms with a majority of second language learners. The authors conducted a study interviewing 24 teachers at a rural elementary school in eastern North Carolina. Teachers were interviewed regarding their perceptions of their preparedness to teach English language learners in the mainstream classrooms. Findings revealed that teacher training programs have not prepared these individuals for the student population they face today regardless of the year in which they received their teaching licenses. All teachers showed a strong desire to learn more at this time in their careers, but emphasized their lack of prior training. The study found that even though teachers lacked confidence, they were effectively educating this growing population. The authors discuss the responsibility of Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) to provide formal education in teaching students from diverse language backgrounds. (Contains 2 tables.)",

During the research, thematic strands emerged indicating that parents may value their children's writing for purposes that differ from the purposes deemed appropriate by the school. Upon interviewing 30 parents/guardians, the following codes materialized identifying elements that contribute to the parents' perspectives. These elements include the following: Parents do not see the connection between school and real world writing, parents lack understanding on writing purposes, parents' perceptions of writing are based on their own school experiences, and some parents are illiterate.

Community members were grateful for the opportunity to participate, and the district's strategic plan contained important goals that would not have been recognized without community input.

Through a University-community partnership, teachers and adolescents in a rural West Virginia county with one of the highest obesity rates in the state developed a school-based research intervention to increase physical activity opportunities. The intervention included walking routes, educational sessions, and pedometers. A survey about barriers to physical activity revealed that &quot;lack of willpower&quot; was a barrier of concern among program participants (mostly school employees) and had a statistically significant (p = 0.0033) pre to post mean score decrease during the year two offering. Focus groups with the adolescent researchers revealed that pedometers may facilitate maintenance of physical activity and a broader community impact. Focus group dialogue combined with teacher-researcher perspectives suggested that the adolescents changed their weight control paradigm from &quot;dieting&quot; to include the critical role of energy expenditure.

Despite the proximity of rural schools to both agricultural land and the natural world, what little connection to place that may have existed in rural schools' curricula has been disappearing as schools shift their focus toward basic academic skills (e.g., reading, math, and writing). The authors argue that ultimately the trend in reduction of school programs and the practice of undervaluing place-based-knowledge, especially place-based knowledge gained outside the classroom through interactions within place, diminishes the ability of schools to be the primary location for collective socialization and the transmission of local community values to youth. They assert as well that consequences for both the quality of education and opportunities offered for youth and the overall community well-being ensue.",

Despite many pluses, collegial isolation, low salaries, multiple grade or subject teaching assignments, and lack of familiarity with rural schools and communities are challenges to new teachers in rural schools. This study examined nine mid-continent institutions for five components identified as preparing and retaining teachers to teach in rural schools. From the 120 teacher preparation institutions in the mid-continent, 17 confirmed the existence of a rural program emphasis. Nine of the 17 had three or more rural programs. Three of the nine programs offered options for teachers to receive multiple certifications. As to access, seven of the nine programs offered online courses and four offered courses at more accessible community college campuses. Four of the nine recruited students from rural communities and two programs actively sought student teaching placements in rural schools. (Contains 3 footnotes and 1 table.)",

The University of Nebraska at Kearney has been able to address this need by: (1) creating access to the university's certification program, (2) providing professional supports, (3) tailoring assignments, projects, and field based practicum experiences and (4) building capacity for rural teachers who have completed certification to mentor others in their regions.",

The inventories were administered in a total of 340 Greek university undergraduate students of different disciplines (education, psychology, and polytechnics) and primary school teachers. Regarding the LSI, our sample was found to strongly prefer the accommodative and the divergent learning style. Results indicated that in the Greek sample the LSI had a satisfactory reliability but its construct validity was weakly supported. No significant differences were found in relation to discipline, a finding that calls the discriminant validity of the inventory into question. Regarding the ILS, our sample showed a preference for the visual and the sensing learning style; its reliability was barely acceptable but the construct and the discriminant validity were well-supported. In conclusion, this study revealed psychometric weaknesses in both inventories suggesting that they could be used as a tool to encourage self-development of an individual within a discipline group, but not as a tool for grouping them according to given learning styles.

        "description":"This study examined the relationship between teacher written feedback and change in the disciplinary writing of tertiary students in their final year of undergraduate study. The student texts and teacher written feedback examined arose naturally out of a third year disciplinary-based unit in which each student submitted a text three times over the course of a semester, each time receiving feedback and a mark prior to rewriting and resubmitting. In analyzing the relationship between the different types of feedback and the changes that occurred, the feedback was categorized according to the issue that was being addressed, the manner in which it was given, and its scope. The different types of feedback were directly related to the changes that occurred in the students' subsequent rewrites. The analysis shows that certain types of feedback are more strongly related to change than other types of feedback. In addition, the analysis shows that change is further influenced by the balance between the various individual points of feedback and the degree to which they reinforce each other. The findings show that the use of feedback that is strongly related to change can improve the writing of students in the disciplines. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

        "description":"Pattern language is the lexicon used to express the schema of a field of professional practice (Smethurst, 1997). This lexicon is frequently presumed to exist in communities of practice in educational settings, although the findings derived from the longitudinal study of schools (Elmore, 1996; Goodlad, 1984; Lortie, 1975; McLaughlin &amp; Talbert, 2001; Sizer, 1987) indicate that the presence of such a lexicon is much more likely to be the exception than the rule. This study sought to establish the differential effects on pattern language of embedding evidence-based practice in the design of an inclusive education teacher preparation course. Embedded design involves creating self-repeating patterns in the instructional design of a course by expressing essential design features at multiple levels in the teaching and learning experience. In this case study, classroom communities of practice were employed as a learning context for students to develop their pattern language and as vehicle for applying the embedded design principle. The study also sought to establish whether increases in the frequency and sophistication of pattern language use increased as the pre-service course progressed through four teaching cycles and students learned more about inclusive approaches. The results indicate that pattern language frequency and sophistication covaried with participation in the course, and increased over time. The findings are discussed within the context of building more rigorous teacher preparation programs and the role of embedded design in pre-service inclusive education.

This paper presents a pedagogic approach that combines theory and practice, in an accessible way, to help students appreciate the interrelation of styles and contexts, and develop skills for writing in a range of genres. The approach is characterised as &quot;adaptive application&quot;. It is illustrated by the modification of a traditional tutorial-group structure to provide a new setting in which students can immediately apply key terms of rhetorical theory as they negotiate differentiated experiences as writers, readers, speakers, and listeners. This change in classroom practice is achieved by adopting and adapting the roles, organizational genres, and communication conventions of the committee meeting. The resultant hybrid form of committee-tutorial assists students to engage collegially in the disciplinary study and practice of writing. It also encourages them to consider how they may transfer their understanding of rhetorical principles and techniques to writing endeavours in other scholarly and social settings.

In light of the research that exists identifying the value of collaboration within learning environments, the merits of such isolated practice must be questioned. Even though collaboration within educational settings has been identified as critical to the development of both instructors and students, highly collaborative approaches to team teaching have not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to examine our own experience as team teachers in a team taught, educational psychology course. Through a phenomenological analysis of our lived experiences as instructors engaged in collaboratively teaching an undergraduate course, we gained understanding of the benefits of team teaching within a broader context. A thematic structure emerged that captured our experience of the process of co-teaching. This shared thematic structure consisted of one ground theme, named &quot;we didn't have a manual for this/finding our way through&quot;, and five themes, each providing insight into how we made sense of team teaching. The five emergent themes were (a) &quot;You can't shoot from the hip&quot;; (b) &quot;Following and leading. . .all of us together&quot;; (c) &quot;If we walk away disagreeing, is it okay?&quot;; (d) &quot;The presence of another pushed us to go deeper&quot;; and (e) &quot;You build something bigger&quot;.

In our quantitative analysis, we investigated the effects of in-class and online exams on undergraduate students' performance on an in-class comprehensive final (n=141). Students were randomly assigned by course section to take one proctored exam in-class and two other unit exams online in a learner-centered format. At the end of the course, students in all sections took a proctored comprehensive final, consisting of a series of multiple choice questions closely aligned with questions from the unit exams. No significant differences were found between content items initially assessed utilizing the traditional, in-class format and the learner-centered online format. In our qualitative analysis, students in one of the six sections (n=22) were selected to participate in open-ended interviews. A phenomenological method was used to collect and analyze responses to the question: &quot;When thinking about your experiences with both the in-class exam and Blackboard exams in [course name], what stands out for you?&quot; Findings from our qualitative analysis resulted in separate yet balanced themes for participants' perceptions of in-class and online exams. For both categories of themes, the constructs of stress, control, and knowing stood out for participants.

Improvements in understanding due to discussions were measured at 12%, while improvements of writing skills increased 29% during the course of the semester. Because we carefully structured the methodology and intent of the assignments, we suggest the assessment data could be used for quantitatively measuring student learning.

What is likely correct about this hypothesis (but needs more research) is that modality of instruction may need to be adapted to certain types of content (e.g., geometry vs. literature) or to domain of objectives (e.g., cognitive vs. psychomotor). What is also correct (and has much empirical support) is that instruction needs to be adapted to the learners' prior knowledge and experience vis-a-vis the material to be learned. What is incorrect is that instruction should be adapted to learners' styles. We describe some of the major historical conceptualizations of adapting to individual differences, including summaries of the empirical evidence on these approaches. Finally, we offer an alternative approach--namely adapting to individuals' prior knowledge. (Contains 1 table, 1 figure, and 4 notes.)

Although students have tacit knowledge about their approach to learning, they are often unable to coherently communicate their ideas. Drawing on the theory of metacognition, the technique of strategic questions is outlined as a means to represent, organize, and communicate students' abstract ideas about themselves as learners. Strategic questions provide a metacognitive language that allows students and teachers to examine a learning experience. In particular, reasoning for decisions and action, doubts or concerns, explanation of engagement and effort, and values and expectations. A case study is outlined of the use of strategic questions within a pre-service teacher education degree as a method that supports a reflective practitioner approach to learning. (Contains 2 tables.)

        "description":"In response to widespread concern that many American students do not write well enough to meet the requirements of higher education and the workplace, the College Board's National Commission on Writing in America's Schools and Colleges has called for a writing revolution. A key component of this revolution is evaluation, with particular emphasis on the need to align writing standards, writing instruction, and writing assessment. Teachers of writing want to provide their students with the kind of quality feedback that coaches and personal trainers provide their clients, but large classes and heavy teaching loads often frustrate their intention. Peer assessment can alleviate this problem. In fact, research indicates that when students are given valid and reliable assessment instruments to guide the process, feedback from peers can be as effective as--or more effective than--feedback from professors. As a direct response to the Commission's call for curricular alignment, Jackson State University has launched the Reader's Assessment Project, a project that seeks to harness the power of Peer Assisted Learning by developing and applying a series of analytic Peer Assessment rubrics for specific rhetorical modes. While analytic rubrics are useful in identifying broad areas for improvement in student writing, such rubrics are sometimes difficult to use because they address general qualities of effective writing without reference to the way those qualities operate in specific rhetorical modes, such as comparison/contrast or process. Analytic scoring also tends to be time-consuming. The Reader's Assessment Project at Jackson State University seeks to overcome these drawbacks by developing mode-specific analytic instruments that are aligned with the reading process. In this article, members of the Reader's Assessment team review the relevant literature, outline the conceptual framework and methodology of the project, and explain how they have harnessed the power of Peer Assisted Learning with the Reader's Assessment rubrics through a strategy that they call CARE (creating a reassuring environment).

The paper has four principle objectives: first, to understand the importance of identifying the skills, values, and actions that form our basic assumptions of knowing in our personal pursuits and teaching practices; second, to appreciate the importance of reflection on experience as an epistemology for self-knowledge and for developing in our teaching practices; third, to understand the power of metaphors to enhance our ability to see previously unavailable and therefore unexamined assumptions; and fourth, to examine and challenge for validity, through dialogue, our assumptions to improve our teaching practices. In addition, in this article we offer a metaphorical mirror exercise designed to help facilitate application of personal pursuits through reflection and dialogue to one's teaching practice.

        "description":"Immersion service-learning courses provide increased opportunities for faculty and students to experience the transformational effects of service-learning. This paper focuses on the experiences of faculty and the responses of students who took part in several immersion service-learning courses taught between 2005 and 2007 during the Winter term at Elon University in North Carolina. Four major themes were identified as being significant in these immersion service-learning courses: 1) sharing living space impacts the student-faculty relationship, 2) immersion faculty leaders are placed in multiple roles with multiple opportunities for role modeling, 3) immersion faculty experience their own transformative learning, which often further complicates their roles as leaders, and 4) immersion faculty leaders often experience role conflict in maintaining leadership roles and assessing student work in immersion courses. We conclude that while the role conflicts must be negotiated faculty modeling service behavior may have stronger lessons for students and their future civic engagement than other on-campus service learning courses.

In particular, the authors use postcolonial and feminist theories to create borderland spaces where marginalized youth can develop strong identities, establish a community mindset, and cultivate leadership skills through supplementary arts education programs. Our goal with this work is not only to empower youth but also to bridge the gap between postcolonial theories of the borderland and traditional classroom practices. In addition, our efforts bring students' work and voices to the forefront, helping students take the first steps to becoming critical change agents within their communities and beyond.

        "description":"The role of reflection is central to teacher preparation. As individuals integrate new information within their existing schema, they refine their practice. Through reflection pre-service teachers examine, evaluate, and adjust. Yet, the practice of reflection is rarely explicitly taught. Often teacher educators found their students aligning their written reflections with what they think pre-service teachers want to hear rather than what they themselves think. Disconcerted by the censoring that occurs in writing, the authors chose the visual and performing arts as alternative media for student reflection. Using the arts involves the artist who creates the performance, the audience that personally responds to it, the shared experience between the artist and the audience, and the intersection of all three. The authors offer students the opportunity to reflect using a creative method that liberates them to honestly examine and share their personal belief systems, including their biases. They offer the arts as vehicles to deepen their teacher candidates' personal and professional identities.",

        "description":"As educators deliberate on how to provide a well-rounded education for all, the idea of working more collaboratively with a range of arts education providers has become increasingly attractive. Allowing outside organizations and individuals to gain access to institutions in a more evenhanded way and create long-term relationships that reinforce the idea of education as a community-centered effort is a little new for schools. Yet many are finding it is worth exploring, as the process of creating alliances and partnerships with other community organizations places schools in a different light and allows them to appear less intimidating and more approachable. Arts organizations and teaching artists play an important role in realizing well-rounded educational strategies, and they are at the forefront of providing arts instruction in many classrooms. Now more than ever schools, teaching artists, and cultural workers must find common ground that allows them to share their practices. Through partnerships that draw on all of the resources within a geographic or cultural area, different kinds of knowledge and experience are shared, and communities are enriched by the exchange. This article presents the case of the Multicultural Arts School, which provides valuable insight into how arts partnerships can contribute to building a democratic learning community in which students, teachers, cultural workers, and artists are able to redefine their roles and obtain an alternative sense of community by expanding boundaries and definitions.

In this article, the author first outlines some of the special mind-body connections that object-based learning in museums affords learners and how this learning is specific to the kind of object-based learning one finds in museums. Next, she discusses how integral museum-school partnerships are to making a space for arts education in general school curriculum. Lastly, she makes a case for increased funding for museum-school partnerships and object-based learning school initiatives, as she thinks they should begin to be rightly seen as part of the future for arts education in the 21st century. Here, the author hopes to reinvigorate the argument that, in the current technological learning revolution of the early 21st century, educators do not forget the great benefits of learning from physical objects.

That is to say that teachers, administrators, parents, students, and community members tend to agree that the opportunity to participate in the arts is beneficial to students and to the wider society. Whether discipline-based arts education (DBAE or &quot;art for art's sake&quot;), integrated arts (art that promotes core content knowledge--literacy, numeracy, critical thinking--alongside self-expression), or somewhere in between, the desire to have art (including music and theater) in public schools is well-known. Also well-known, however, are the local and national pressures and mandates that place arts at the bottom of the list of school priorities and possibilities. In their thoughtful articles about the centrality of arts in education, Gulla, Milman, and Norman raise a series of interrelated issues amidst snapshots of best practices. In this paper, the author talks about these three articles that provide hopeful visions of what can happen when arts are included in the classroom, even amidst the funding crises, the standardized testing schedules, and the challenge of administering any innovative program in overburdened and under-resourced public schools.",

Method: A framework was extracted from genre research theories consisting of four concepts: aim, form, content and context. The term \"situated genre\" was used to focus on social practices. The context was further elaborated by combining discourse community with the concept of epistemic cultures. Analysis: The main purpose was to outline, discuss and test the framework. Three blogs from researchers in the field of physics were selected and used to test how the framework operated. Results: The preliminary results showed that scholarly blogs could be approached as a situated genre that is part of scholarly communication practice and that this framework can be used to analyse the social and technical features of the blogs. However, the framework has some constraints that have to be addressed. The four concepts are interlaced and can benefit from the application of a number of different methods. Conclusions: The proposed framework is useful as a tool for the analysis of research blogs and for making visible their socio-technical character. Existing genres in a particular epistemic culture, or differences between different epistemic cultures, are issues that could be studied further with this framework.",

Particular focus is on the use of user-created resources, such as &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, where authorship is collective and/or hard to determine. Method: An ethnographic study was conducted in an upper secondary school class. Methods included observation, group interviews and information seeking diaries in the form of blogs. Analysis: The empirical material from the class room study was categorised and aggregated into five themes, which emerged as a result of the interplay between the empirical material and a perspective based in socio-cultural theory. Results: The pupils make credibility assessments based on methods developed for traditional media where, for instance, origin and authorship are important. They employ some user-created sources, notably &quot;Wikipedia&quot;, because these are easily available, but they are uncertain about when these sources should be considered credible. Conclusions: In an increasingly diverse media world, pupils' credibility assessments need to be informed by a socio-technical understanding of sources which takes both social and material aspects into account. The diversity of resources requires that pupils assess credibility for the particular situation in which they use information.",

The research sought to establish what evidence-base is needed for evidence-based practice. Method: The Delphi method was employed to solicit opinions on the kinds of research needed by libraries of all kinds in Sweden. Research topics were obtained from practising librarians and identified in the professional literature and discussion lists. Two rounds of questionnaire survey using the sixty-four themes extracted were followed by an interactive workshop. Panel members were nominated by the practitioners themselves. Analysis: Standard statistical methods were employed to derive means and standard deviations and the Spearman rank correlation statistic was used to compare the results from different library sectors. Results: Consensus among panel members was not achieved during the survey rounds, but the workshop resulted in the identification of the ten highest priority themes. The public, regional and school libraries are more concerned with relation of libraries to education and society at large, while academic and special libraries emphasize the changes in scholarly and business communication and the impact of new technologies. Conclusions: The consensus among different Swedish library sectors regarding the top research agenda can be reached only conditionally. Strong differences between them remain and have to be taken into account when implementing the agenda. The panel members regard the library future as uncertain and prioritize the topics that can help to foster readers and library users and strengthen strategic positions of libraries.

Method: This study focuses on comparisons between tags and search queries using Shatford's categorization schemes and the level of specificity based on the basic level theory. Analysis: Frequency distributions and chi-squared analyses were performed on the data. The results of statistical analyses demonstrated that there were significant differences in categories among tags and different stages of search query terms. The overall distributions of the levels of term specificity also had similar pattern in both tags and search query terms, but statistically significant differences were found between tags and search query terms. Results: The results of this study demonstrated that \"Flickr\" tags have their own unique features compared to users' queries for image searching. The findings suggest that image tags should not be generally applied to other image collections although they have been considered as useful data in developing a user-centered indexing system. Conclusions: When utilizing user-supplied tags for user-centered indexing systems, it is desirable to consider the functions and users' tasks applied in tags rather than depending on statistical features merely obtained from the tag analysis.

This created a highly distorted image of the implementation of repositories in Spain. This study aims to analyse the current state of Spanish open-access institutional repositories and to describe their characteristics. Method: The data were gathered through a Web survey. The questionnaire was based on that used by DRIVER I: coverage; technical infrastructure and technical issues; institutional policies; services created; and stimulators and inhibitors for establishing, filling and maintaining their digital institutional repositories. Analysis: Data were tabulated and analysed systematically according responses obtained from the questionnaire and grouped by coverage. Results: Responses were obtained from 38 of the 104 institutions contacted, which had 29 institutional repositories. This represents 78.3% of the Spanish repositories according to the &quot;BuscaRepositorios&quot; directory. Spanish repositories contained mainly full-text materials (journal articles and doctoral theses) together with metadata. The software most used was DSpace, followed by EPrints. The metadata standard most used was Dublin Core. Spanish repositories offered more usage statistics and fewer author-oriented services than the European average. The priorities for the future development of the repositories are the need for clear policies on access to scientific production based on public funding and the need for quality control indicators. Conclusions: This is the first detailed study of Spanish institutional repositories. The key stimulants for establishing, filling and maintaining were, in order of importance, the increase of visibility and citation, the interest of decision-makers, simplicity of use and search services. On the other hand the main inhibitors identified were the absence of policies, the lack of integration with other national and international systems and the lack of awareness efforts among academia.

Method: Based on functional and structural changes of thesauri, provides an overview of the current context in which lexical paradigm is abandoned in favour of the conceptual paradigm. Likewise are described briefly various initiatives for the representation of thesauri using RDF vocabularies and hence for application to the Semantic Web, with particular attention to SKOS. Analysis and Results: This brief comparison will allow us to know some highlights of these proposals to raise those transcendental aspects in a model representing thesauri. SKOS includes the main proposal of this model, which organizes the concepts into diagrams and libraries. The notions of descriptors and non-descriptors terms are replaced by the association to the concepts of preferred and alternative labels and may be defined hierarchical or associative relationships between concepts. SKOS also provides for the establishment of correspondence relations between concepts belonging to different conceptual schemes. Conclusions: In accordance with the extent to which this series of requirements is fulfilled, we propose and defend the SKOS option as the best alternative for the development of multiple applications focusing on the use of thesauri in Web-based information services and systems, highlighting the advantages of this model over others proposed and in consideration of the user perspective in management, search and information query operations.

Method: A content analysis of 394 job announcements in the visual resources field posted during the past five years was conducted. Analysis: Content analysis was employed, using two main categories of analysis: the information environments within which the jobs existed and the qualifying requirements for the jobs. Results: Overall, digitization, management, and cataloguing stand out as the most desired skills for visual resources professionals. Digital asset management and knowledge of digital technologies were specifically mentioned as were effective communication and project management skills. The knowledge areas include relevant standards and practices, cataloguing and classification theory, standards and practices in digitization, rights and permission, records management, photography, preservation, exhibition and relational and object databases. Conclusion: Visual resources management appears to be an emerging area of knowledge and expertise that needs to be systematically addressed. The profession is moving from slide curators and slide librarians to a field that encompasses a broad range of skills applicable in a wide range of environments. (Contains 9 figures.)",

        "description":"Introduction: The goal of this study is to expand our understanding of the relationships between selected tasks, cognitive abilities and search result interfaces. The underlying objective is to understand how to select search results presentation for tasks and user contexts Method: Twenty three participants conducted four search tasks of two types and used two interfaces (List and Overview) to refine and examine search results. Click through data were recorded. This controlled study employed a mixed model design with two within-subject factors (task and interface) and two between-subject factors (two cognitive abilities: memory span and verbal closure). Analysis: Quantitative analyses were carried out by means of the statistical package SPSS. Specifically, multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures and non-parametric tests were performed on the collected data. Results: The overview of search results appeared to have benefited searchers in several ways. It made them faster; it facilitated formulation of more effective queries and helped to assess search results. Searchers with higher cognitive abilities were faster in the Overview interface and in less demanding situations (on simple tasks), while at the same time they issued about the same number of queries as lower-ability searchers. In more demanding situations (on complex tasks and in the List interface), the higher ability searchers expended more search effort, although they were not significantly slower than the lower ability people in these situations. The higher search effort, however, did not result in a measurable improvement of task outcomes for high-ability searchers. Conclusions: These findings have implications for the design of search interfaces. They suggest benefits of providing result overviews. They also suggest the importance of considering cognitive abilities in the design of search results' presentation and interaction. (Contains 17 tables and 6 figures.)",

For several data sets, the majority of the variance among states, districts, and schools was related to demographic characteristics. Where these background variables outside of the control of schools significantly affected averaged scores, and test scores result in high stakes consequences, benefits and sanctions may be inappropriately applied. Furthermore, disaggregating the data by race, SES, limited English, or other groupings ignores the significant confounding and cumulative effects of belonging to more than one disadvantaged group. With these approaches to evaluation being fundamental to the No Child Left Behind mandates, the danger of misinterpretation and inappropriate application of sanctions is substantial.

A major concern was the extent to which stringent accountability was associated with superintendents' tendency to emphasize educational leadership rather than managerial functions. Recognizing that other circumstances also might contribute to superintendents' decisions about how to balance their work, the study included five contextual variables: enrollment, locale, SES, funding, and percentage minority. From a sample of 941 superintendents, 68% returned questionnaires. Findings: although superintendents' perceptions of the stringency of state accountability measures were related to their location in high- or low-stringency states, contextual factors and especially enrollment and the location of a district in a rural region had the most pronounced effects on their attention to managerial tasks. Allocation of time varied by state; however, across states very few superintendents' devoted the majority of their time to educational leadership. (Contains 7 tables and 7 footnotes.)",

        "description":"This meta-analysis extends a previous review of the achievement effects of comprehensive school reform (CSR) programs (Borman, Hewes, Overman, &amp; Brown, 2003). That meta-analysis observed significant effects of well endowed and well-researched programs, but it did not account for race/ethnicity. This article synthesizes 34 cohort or quasi-experimental outcomes of studies that incorporated the policy-critical characteristic of race/ethnicity. Findings: compared with matched traditional schools, the black-white achievement gap narrowed significantly more among students in CSR schools. In addition, the aggregate effects were large, substantially to completely eliminating the achievement gap between African American and non-Hispanic white students in elementary and middle schools. Title I policies before or after the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 seem to have had essentially no impact on the black-white achievement gap. Curricular and testing mandates along with the threat of sanctions without concomitant resource supports seem to have failed. This study suggests that educational achievement inequities need not be America's destiny. It seems that they could be eliminated through concerted political will and ample resource commitments to evidence-based educational programs. (Contains 2 tables and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a study investigating the use of digital texts in schools serving low and middle/upper socioeconomic communities. It draws on theoretical notions of rhizomes from the work of Deleuze and Guattari to explain the network of relations that are formed in classrooms, and that form the context for a set of patterns observed when students and teachers engage with digital texts in literacy lessons. These patterns of complexity, fragility, continuity, conservation and authenticity can explain some of the connections and conjunctions between and across the rhizomatic systems of different classrooms as well as providing a genealogical tracing of the past back to a report on the integration of new technologies in literacy classrooms published in 1997. It would seem that in the current contemporary climate, teachers who work with digital texts at any level swim against the tide of normative and conventional literacy routines of the classroom.

        "author":["Davidson, Christina"],
        "description":"Research has established young children's increasing use of computers and other new technologies in the home. Yet, teaching about digital texts and digital practices most often appears as an addition to early literacy instruction in classrooms where &quot;business-as-usual&quot; maintains an emphasis on print and print-based texts. This article examines two young children's literacy practices in the home during their searches for information about lizards using Google, Wikipedia and a reference book about reptiles. Conversation analysis of the young children's social interaction establishes how interaction resources produced socially recognisable actions, how social activity mutually accomplished knowledge about lizards, searches, images and print, and how children shifted seamlessly between various technologies and texts. It is concluded that the children's activities constitute the kinds of digital literacy practices that might inform, reform, or transform, the teaching of English in the early years of schooling.

        "author":["Macken-Horarik, Mary"],
        "description":"This paper takes up the sea-faring metaphor at the centre of this special edition and asks what kinds of navigational tools (metalanguages) are necessary to steer English through the digital seas of contemporary communication. Much of this territory is yet to be mapped and the disciplinary &quot;boat&quot; is buffeted by contrary winds such as pressures for improved outcomes on the basics and development of 21st-century digital skills. The role of grammar as a navigational aid is complicated by these competing pressures. Alongside developing metalanguages to explore digital literacy practices in Web2, in multimodal texts like picture books, websites and social networking sites, teachers are being asked simultaneously to prepare students for national testing regimes which assess children's abilities to identify the correct verb, to underline the pronouns and to punctuate sentences in language convention tests. What kinds of grammar will enable us to manage such seemingly incongruous purposes? How do we make use of tools to improve students' writing without succumbing to reductionist models of language? What kinds of &quot;stretch&quot; do available grammars need if they are to prove useful as tools in this environment? In this paper, I draw on a range of students' verbal, visual and multimodal texts to investigate the issues facing adaptations of grammatically informed metalanguages in English. I attempt to show how such metalanguages will need to accommodate and account for verbal texts produced by students for assessment and multimodal texts produced by young learners in less formal, even play, situations. Basing my account on Halliday's notion of &quot;grammatics&quot;, I argue that any navigational toolkit needs to make space for both convention and innovation, but that this process requires careful thinking, dialogue across different grammars and substantive research into semiosis in school English.

        "description":"This article explores the emergence of multimodality as intrinsic to the learning, teaching and assessment of English in the Twenty-First Century. With subject traditions tied to the study of language, literature and media, multimodal texts and new technologies are now accorded overdue recognition in English curriculum documents in several countries, though assessment tends to remain largely print-centric. Until assessment modes and practices align with the nature of multimodal text production, their value as sites for inquiry in classroom practice will not be assured. The article takes up the question: What is involved in assessing the multimodal texts that students create? In exploring this question, we first consider central concepts of multimodality and what is involved in &quot;working multimodally&quot; to create a multimodal text. Here, &quot;transmodal operation&quot; and &quot;staged multimodality&quot; are considered as central concepts to &quot;working multimodally&quot;.  Further, we suggest that these concepts challenge current understandings of the purposes of, and possibilities for, assessment of multimodal text production. (Contains 4 figures and 6 footnotes.)",

        "description":"In this paper we report on one aspect of a qualitative study about an online wiki community, which was developed to build collaborative knowledge about poetry among a group of pre-service English teachers. Our paper explores pre-service teachers' experiences of writing in a digital medium and their perceptions of themselves as writers. We focus specifically on the processes of poetry writing (both collaborative and independent) undertaken in this digital medium by two groups of teachers, who were working in contrasting settings in the UK and Canada during their pre-service year. We investigate the affordances (Laurillard, Stratford, Lucklin, Plowman, &amp; Taylor, 2000) that a multimodal, wiki environment offered these teachers for learning about poetry writing and question the impact that these affordances have had both on the teachers' collaborations and the poetry they wrote. In analysing the pre-service teachers' wiki writings we were interested to observe how they shaped themselves as writers and intervened in each other's work in progress within a digital third space. We also wanted to explore how the wiki had supported their professional learning about the teaching of poetry writing during their training year and the implications that this support could have for their own future classroom practice as teachers of writing.",

        "description":"In this paper I identify some current elaborations on the theme of participation and digital literacy in order to open further debate on the relationship between interaction, collaboration and learning in online environments. Motivated by an interest in using new technologies in the context of formal learning (Merchant, 2009), I draw on in-school and out-of-school work in Web 2.0 spaces. This work is inflected by the new literacies approach (Lankshear & Knobel, 2006a). Here I provide an overview of the ways in which learning through participation is characterised by those adopting this and other related perspectives. I include a critical examination of the idea of \"participatory\" culture as articulated in the field of media studies, focusing particularly on the influential work of Jenkins (2006a; 2006b). In order to draw these threads together around conceptualizations of learning, I summarise ways in which participation is described in the literature on socially-situated cognition. This is used to generate some tentative suggestions about how learning and literacy in Web 2.0 spaces might be envisioned and how ideas about participation might inform curriculum planning and design.

Since British colonial settlement in the early 1800s, Maori children have been predominantly educated in an English-speaking system dominated by colonial governance.

        "author":["Morgan, Tannis",
          "Carey, Stephen"],
        "description":"Two of the major challenges to international students' right of access to higher education are geographical/economic isolation and academic literacy in English (Carey, 1999; Hamel, 2007). The authors propose that adopting open course models in traditional universities, through blended or online delivery, can offer benefits to the institutions and to the open education movement itself, in particular with non-Anglophone students. This paper describes the model and an implementation with undergraduate students in Canada, Mexico, and Russia. The implementation of the model was examined in three studies, which relied on data collected from student interviews, instructor observations and reflections, instructor interviews, course documents, and discussion forum transcripts. The authors note that the main benefit of an open course model is the development of academic literacy for students of English as an Other Language (EOL). Other benefits include 1) international course transfers, 2) breadth of professorial exposure for the students, 3) flexibility in professors' employment and professional development, and 4) course credits for students. Some of the challenges include 1) varying levels of Internet access, 2) coordination of the participation of the instructors, and 3) different teaching and learning practices. The authors conclude that an open course model might be applied in various contexts, such as in disciplines where global perspectives are important, in applied/professional programs, and in distance or face-to-face courses. Also, the model is useful for students working together on research, case studies, or joint projects, and it could be applied within an institution to enhance inter-disciplinary content and approaches.

        "description":"This article examines Utah residents' views of incentives and disincentives for the use of OpenCourseWare (OCW), and how they fit into the theoretical framework of perceived innovation attributes established by Rogers (1983). Rogers identified five categories of perceived innovation attributes: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. A survey instrument was developed using attributes that emerged from a Delphi technique with input from experts in the OCW field. The survey instrument was sent to 753 random individuals between 18 and 64 years of age throughout Utah. Results indicated that the greatest incentives for OCW use were the following: (a) &quot;no cost for materials&quot;, (b) &quot;resources available at any time&quot;, (c) &quot;pursuing in depth a topic that interests me&quot;, (d) &quot;learning for personal knowledge or enjoyment&quot;, and (e) &quot;materials in an OCW are fairly easy to access and find&quot;. The greatest disincentives for OCW use were the following: a) &quot;no certificate or degree awarded&quot;, (b) &quot;does not cover my topic of interest in the depth I desire&quot;, (c) &quot;lack of professional support provided by subject tutors or experts&quot;, (d) &quot;lack of guidance provided by support specialists&quot;, and (e) &quot;feeling that the material is overwhelming&quot;. The authors recommend that institutions work to transition some OCW users into degree-granting paid programs as well as adopt a marketing campaign to increase awareness of OCW. Additionally, OCW websites should make their content available to recommendation engines such as ccLearn iscoverEd, OCW Finder, or OER Recommender and should link to one or more of these sites.

        "description":"To address the high cost of textbooks, Rice University's Connexions and the Community College Open Textbook Project (CCOTP) collaborated to develop a proof-of-concept free and open textbook. The proof-of-concept served to document a workflow process that would support adoption of open textbooks. Open textbooks provide faculty and students with a low cost alternative to traditional publishers' textbooks and can help to make higher education more affordable. Connexions provides a publishing platform for open textbook projects. The CCOTP acted as a liaison between community college faculty, open textbook authors, and Connexions. Challenges to the production and adoption of open textbooks include 1) faculty members' and students' expectations of high production quality and ancillaries for open textbooks, 2) methods for documenting and maintaining control over various versions, and 3) the process of converting existing open content to digital and accessible formats. Connexions holds promise as a means to overcome these challenges. Connexions identified lessons learned about open textbook production, such as the importance of a style guide, the advantage of assembly-line workflow, and the importance of naming conventions and standard math authoring tools. Connexions also identified lessons learned about open textbook use by students and faculty, e.g., the value of availability and customizability, the importance of interactivity, the difference in how faculty and students view modularity, and the importance of textbook reading navigational aids. The authors note that the CCOTP recommends using Connexions as the common repository for open textbook content in an effort to provide greater national and international access.",

        "description":"Openness is a fundamental value underlying significant changes in society and is a prerequisite to changes institutions of higher education need to make in order to remain relevant to the society in which they exist. There are a number of ways institutions can be more open, including programs of open sharing of educational materials. Individual faculty can also choose to be more open without waiting for institutional programs. Increasing degrees of openness in society coupled with innovations in business strategy like dynamic specialization are enabling radical experiments in higher education and exerting increasing competitive pressure on conventional higher education institutions. No single response to the changes in the supersystem of higher education can successfully address every institution's situation. However, every institution must begin addressing openness as a core organizational value if it desires to both remain relevant to its learners and to contribute to the positive advancement of the field of higher education.

        "description":"Recognition in education is the acknowledgment of learning achievements. Accreditation is certification of such recognition by an institution, an organization, a government, a community, etc. There are a number of assessment methods by which learning can be evaluated (exam, practicum, etc.) for the purpose of recognition and accreditation, and there are a number of different purposes for the accreditation itself (i.e., job, social recognition, membership in a group, etc). As our world moves from an industrial to a knowledge society, new skills are needed. Social web technologies offer opportunities for learning, which build these skills and allow new ways to assess them. This paper makes the case for a peer-based method of assessment and recognition as a feasible option for accreditation purposes. The peer-based method would leverage online communities and tools, for example digital portfolios, digital trails, and aggregations of individual opinions and ratings into a reliable assessment of quality. Recognition by peers can have a similar function as formal accreditation, and pathways to turn peer recognition into formal credits are outlined. The authors conclude by presenting an open education assessment and accreditation scenario, which draws upon the attributes of open source software communities: trust, relevance, scalability, and transparency.

        "author":["Fini, Antonio"],
        "description":"In 2008, a new term emerged in the already crowded e-learning landscape: MOOC, or massive open online course. Lifelong learners can now use various tools to build and manage their own learning networks, and MOOCs may provide opportunities to test such networks. This paper focuses on the technological aspects of one MOOC, the Connectivism and Connective Knowledge (CCK08) course, in order to investigate lifelong learners? attitudes towards learning network technologies. The research framework is represented by three perspectives: (a) lifelong learning in relation to open education, with a focus on the effective use of learning tools; (b) the more recent personal knowledge management (PKM) skills approach; and (c) the usability of web-based learning tools. Findings from a survey of CCK08 participants show that the course attracted adult, informal learners, who were not concerned about course completion. Time constraints, language barriers, and ICT skills affected the participants? choice of tools; for example, learners favoured the passive, time-saving mailing list over interactive, time-consuming discussions forums. Some recommendations for future MOOCs include highlighting the purpose of the tools (e.g., skill-building) and stating clearly that the learners can choose their preferred tools. Further research on sustainability and facilitator workload should be conducted to determine the cost and effectiveness of MOOCs. Investigation is also necessary to understand MOOC participant profiles as they relate to course outcomes and retention and whether terms such as \"course\" and \"attrition\" are appropriate in this context.

        "author":["Lane, Andy"],
        "description":"Openness has been a feature of higher education for many decades, particularly through the establishment of open universities, although there remain debates about what openness means in practice. Digital technologies, some based on open principles, and digital content, aided by open licences, have both contributed recently to an extension of what is deemed possible under the heading of openness. Nevertheless, while in principle there may be greater degrees of openness available in higher education it does not mean in practice that many people can still readily avail themselves of these new opportunities to learn, not just because they do not have access to digital technologies but personal circumstances mean they also lack the necessary skills and the confidence to use such technologies in general or for education in particular. In fact it can be argued that this new openness, characterised mainly through the open educational resources movement, may actually widen rather than bridge the digital and educational divides between groups, both within and across national boundaries, through the increasing sophistication in technologies and the competencies expected of learners. This paper reviews some of the evidence supporting these different areas of interest and attempts to provide a synthesis of them. It then argues that actions may be required by many inter-mediaries to help to reduce the diverse social and cultural digital divides within education, including through the mediated use of open educational resources between teachers and learners.

Participants in the investigation included a representative sample of the learners (N = 15), their supervisors (N = 5), and the COL staff, including all of the eLIO staff (N = 10). The methodology consisted of an examination of all relevant documents, interviews that formed a learning history, and a sample survey. The investigation concluded that the eLIO achieved its goal of developing a distance learning model, and it met or exceeded identified objectives, with a high degree of satisfaction expressed by all participants. This included teaching +2000 satisfied learners; partnering with eight international organizations; achieving a 62% female participation rate and a high completion rate (75%) in the courses provided; testing, piloting, and delivering two new elearning courses; conducting needs analyses; recruiting/training highly qualified tutors; monitoring; and using appropriate technologies. Shortcomings of the programmes include the lack of pre- and post-tests, little analysis of pricing structures, some unclear instructions (a need for plain English), unclear copyright licensing, only very limited use of available OER software, and the absence of a succession plan for the manager. Based on the high level of satisfaction among all participants, it was recommended that the section maintain its present work and address these shortcomings.

        "description":"The undergraduate science programme was launched at the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) in 1991-92 with an enrolment of 1,210 students. The programme was well received, and enrolments increased over the years. However, the success rates have not kept pace with enrolment. In this paper, the authors report the results of an evaluation of the undergraduate physics programme at IGNOU. The evaluation, the first of its type for this programme, adapted the major tenets of the CIPP model. The findings are based on the responses from a randomly chosen sample of 509 learners across India. The methods employed for the study include records, document, and database analysis, surveys, and case studies. Although the University has enhanced access to higher science education, the attrition rate is high (73%), and the success rate is low. The authors recommend that the University review and reorient its strategies for providing good quality, learner-centred higher education in science subjects. The programme should address the concerns of the learners about the effectiveness of the student support systems, the difficulty level, and the learner-friendliness of study materials with the goal of achieving long-term sustainability while maintaining parity with the conventional system. The need for improving the presentation of the courses and simplifying the mathematical details is emphasised. (Contains 1 figure and 5 tables.)",

        "description":"The authors report the results of a study that provides bases for comparison between the time necessary to participate in courses delivered asynchronously online and courses delivered in a traditional classroom setting. Weekly discussion threads from 21 sections of six courses offered as part of online, degree-granting, accredited, graduate programs were examined. The purpose of this research is to determine whether students are spending more or less time participating in an online course than in a traditional classroom. The discussion size (i.e., the number of words per discussion) was determined using the automatic word count function in MS Word. Once the word counts for each course section were determined, the average words per discussion were calculated. The authors used 180 words per minute to calculate the average reading time, based on the work of Ziefle (1998) and Carver (1985, 1990), in order to determine the average minutes per week a student spent reading the discussions. The study indicates that a typical, graduate-level, online, asynchronous discussion requires about one hour a week of reading time, and the time commitment for participatory activity is similar to that of traditional, face-to-face courses, given that it takes under two hours to compose initial messages and responses to the discussion prompt. Although these findings are informative, further research is recommended in the area of time spent on online course activities in terms of student hours earned to enable a direct focus on various student characteristics, such as English language competency and student level.

Using multiple qualitative and quantitative data sources, the goal was to explore the developmental differences of the three presences (social, teaching, and cognitive) in the community of inquiry framework and students' perceptions of a community of inquiry. The results indicated that in both the online and blended course a community of inquiry developed and students could sense each presence. However, the findings revealed developmental differences in social and cognitive presence between the two course formats with higher perceptions in the blended course.

The purpose of this paper is to review the adventure learning literature and to describe the status quo of the practice by identifying the current knowledge, misconceptions, and future opportunities in adventure learning. Specifically, the authors present an integrative analysis of the adventure learning literature, identify knowledge gaps, present future research directions, and discuss research methods and approaches that may improve the AL approach. The authors engaged in a systematic search strategy to identify adventure learning studies then applied a set of criteria to decide whether to include or exclude each study. Results from the systematic review were combined, analyzed, and critiqued inductively using the constant comparative method and weaved together using the qualitative metasynthesis approach. Results indicate the appeal and promise of the adventure learning approach. Nevertheless, the authors recommend further investigation of the approach. Along with studies that investigate learning outcomes, aspects of the AL approach that are engaging, and the nature of expert-learner collaboration, future adventure learning projects that focus on higher education and are (a) small and (b) diverse can yield significant knowledge into adventure learning. Research and design in this area will benefit by taking an activity theory and design-based research perspective. (Contains 2 tables, 3 figures, and 1 footnote.)",

        "title":"Positioning Critical Educational Studies within the Field of Education: Rethinking Lagemann's \"An Elusive Science\"",
        "author":["Gottesman, Isaac"],
        "description":"Ellen Condliffe Lagemann's (2000) \"An Elusive Science\" provides the most comprehensive history of education as a field of academic study. As such it is important for those in the education community to read and reflect upon the text in order to take stock of the field. Foundations scholars who read Lagemann's work may be struck by a stark irony, however. While Lagemann is an eminent historian of education and scholar of educational foundations whose work explicitly champions foundations as an important arena of educational inquiry, her vision of the future of the field leaves little room for historical, philosophical, and other conceptual scholarship. This article aims to identify the intellectual assumptions that led Lagemann into this contradiction. It also aims to illuminate how a sustained examination of one historical moment in particular--the turn to \"critical\" work in the field in the late 1970s and early 1980s--highlights the problematic nature of Lagemann's position and opens up possibilities for a counter-vision of the role of foundations in the field of education.

        "description":"In this article, the author posits a dual argument. First, he contends that the post-WWII discourse of national unity pushed intolerance to the forefront of the domestic agenda linking its elimination with social cohesion while simultaneously advancing assimilationist and meritocratic beliefs about &quot;the&quot; American experience. Here, he utilizes the writings of Project creators/leaders to illustrate the ways in which they understood the amelioration of intolerance as integral to the safety and image of America and as inseparable from the purpose of strengthening national unity. Second, he argues that the curricular work of the teachers involved in the Project allow people a historically rare opportunity to understand how educators mediated the content of intergroup education. The freedom Project teachers experienced to act as both intergroup-curriculum creators and implementers allows people to glimpse the ways in which they reproduced &quot;and&quot; challenged beliefs about assimilation, intolerance, and the curricular treatment(s) of diverse populations in American society.

        "description":"Many diversity courses that prepare pre-service teachers do not address the significance or the impact of language barriers on linguistically diverse learners. Often time, new and veteran teachers construct their bilingual and/or bidialectical students as others and are unaware of how to use their students' social, cultural, and political linguistic communities to facilitate the academic growth and development of these learners. The end result is that teachers silence their students' cultural perspectives and approach them as little broken bodies needing to be fixed. Each of the contributors to this article is a teacher educator who currently has or has had in the recent past the responsibility of teaching \"the diversity\" course within their respective teacher education programs. Based on their distinct yet similar experiences, they believe that it is critical to find ways to effectively address language--within these courses--not simply as a technical skill and not simply by stressing the need to learn standard English, but more importantly by seeing language as a fundamental expression of cultural identity which is shaped by the interplay between family/community values and beliefs and educational policy and practice. In their efforts to bring this perspective into their classrooms, they often use their own linguistic experiences as a way to critically examine how profoundly they shape the ways in which they come to understand language and engage it with their students. In this article, they each share a critical linguistic moment, which they frame as critical race counterstories, to make visible the ways in which their own diverse linguistic experiences have shaped their concerns, and efforts as teacher educators. \"Linguistic Moments #1: Facing the Power of Language,\" recounts the experience of a mother/teacher/educator who faces the power of language as her child's teachers attempt to silence and replace her daughter's native tongue with Standard English. \"Linguistic Moments #2: \"Tu hija tiene mucho poopoo!\",\" forefronts the efforts of a novice teacher to teach her Spanish-speaking students as they faced down the tyranny of California Proposition 187. Emphasizing both personal and political dynamics of language diversity, a teacher's experience is fore grounded in theoretical frames that support the inextricable links between language and identity. In \"Linguistic Moments #3: A Bilingual/Dialectical Dilemma in Teacher Education,\" the author relives her experience as a woman of color fighting against \"stereotypical oppression\" while attempting to advocate for a bilingual/bidialectical pre-service teacher in the ivory tower and the schoolhouse.",

        "author":["McAndrews, Larry"],
        "description":"In 1982 civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson criticized President Ronald Reagan's attacks on busing to coerce school desegregation for targeting &quot;not the bus, but us.&quot; Two decades later, the United States Supreme Court ended the thirty-two-year-old Charlotte, North Carolina, plan which had launched the era of court-ordered busing (Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools). The same year, President George W. Bush signed the &quot;No Child Left Behind Act,&quot; which authorized federal funding and state testing of the nation's public school students. In lieu of busing, this law was also targeting &quot;us,&quot; the largely minority underclass for whom Jackson purported to speak in 1982. Yet this time the Republican president was not implicitly assaulting minorities; he was seeking to aid them. Despite this significant change in policy, however, one outcome remained the same: public schools increasingly divided by race and class. This article provides a brief history of the school desegregation policies of Presidents Dwight Eisenhower through Bill Clinton, based on secondary and primary sources, then examines the initial school desegregation efforts of President George W. Bush, based largely on contemporary primary sources. It argues that the early returns on the Bush Presidency show that despite his genuinely good intentions, President Bush, like his predecessors, has been unable to overcome this difficult history of racial segregation in the nation's public schools. George W. Bush would become the first Republican president to fight a &quot;war on poverty,&quot; yet only the latest president of either party to struggle in the battle for school desegregation. In many ways, for a variety of reasons, this battle was over before it began.",

        "description":"For over a century, drawing from observation, at least at the introductory level, has been integral to many secondary and most post-secondary art school programs in Europe and North America. Its place in such programs is understood to develop an ability to see and interpret on a flat surface the real, three-dimensional world; this skill, in turn, provides support to related mental processes such as memory, visualization, and imagination. Where an artist looks when drawing from observation may not be arbitrary and can be observed, quantified, and analyzed. Our interest in examining the first few minutes of the drawing process takes its lead from the novice's question, \"Where should I begin?\" Attempting to understand these first few minutes led to a collaborative study between art educators and cognitive-perceptual psychologists: the former interested in implications for practical pedagogy, the latter in applying expertise in eye movement and scientific methodology in service of a specific real-world question. The stated purpose of the study notwithstanding, contrasting histories and practices in art and science provided contexts for discussion beyond the collection and interpretation of data. This article seeks to report upon and further that discussion. (Contains 4 figures.)",

Across two focus groups, four themes emerged: systems structures, roles and attitudes, evidence-based practices, and training and professional development needs. Each theme is explored in depth, followed by practical implications, limitations, and recommendations for practice. Although numerous barriers emerged, they should be viewed not as limitations to RtI in secondary schools but rather as serving to identify the systemic factors needed to support the complexity of an RtI initiative beyond the elementary school years.

School psychologists can play an important role in the prevention and treatment of selective mutism. As an advocate for students, school psychologists can work with teachers, parent caregivers, speech pathologists, and other support staff toward helping children who may develop or have selective mutism. The purpose of this article is to present school-based prevention and intervention approaches within a three-tiered approach that may reduce the incidence and severity of selective mutism. We present theories and research on the etiology and prevalence of the disorder, followed by a review of intervention methods and research at each tier. Based on the theoretical and research literature base, we conclude that early intervention may result in the prevention and amelioration of many occurrences of selective mutism. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Student engagement in school is an important construct that has been associated with student success. For the current study, researchers examined the psychometrics of the Student Engagement in Schools Questionnaire (SESQ) and the Teacher Engagement Report Form (TERF-N) of student engagement. The results revealed that both the SESQ and the TERF-N have good internal consistency. The exploratory factor analysis results for the SESQ demonstrated alignment with the theoretically driven development (five factors: Affective Engagement-Liking for Learning, Affective Engagement-Liking for School, Behavioral Engagement-Effort &amp; Persistence, Behavioral Engagement-Extracurricular, and Cognitive Engagement) whereas the results for the TERF-N were more complicated. The items did not load as conceptualized in a 3-factor model, but instead loaded on one, General Engagement factor. Finally, while it may be that teachers viewed a student's level of engagement as a global construct, the correlations between the measures indicated that they might be used to provide helpful, convergent information obtained from a variety of sources regarding a student's levels of engagement. Future directions and implications for school psychologists are discussed. (Contains 2 figures, 7 tables and 3 footnotes.)",

        "description":"This study examined the relations of age, preschool experience, and gender with children's school readiness levels at kindergarten entry. The sample included 5,512 children of predominantly Hispanic heritage and from families experiencing low socioeconomic circumstances. A series of between-subjects ANOVAs indicated that age (&quot;Eta&quot;[superscript 2] 0.019 to 0.043), preschool experience (&quot;Eta&quot;[superscript 2] 0.104 to 0.204), and gender (&quot;Eta&quot;[superscript 2] 0.015 to 0.022) were significantly related to children's school readiness as measured by the Kindergarten Student Entrance Profile (KSEP). Logistic regression examined the unique contribution of these variables to predict students' academic achievement at the end of Grade 2 with a subsample of 980 students. The strongest achievement predictor was school readiness--the odds of students rated in the top 25% on the KSEP having proficient or advanced scores on the English Language Arts portion of the California Standards Test at the end of Grade 2 were 4.51 greater than the odds of students rated in the bottom 75% on the KSEP having proficient or advanced scores. Similar results were found for students' achievement in mathematics. The key findings of this study showed that formal preschool experiences play an important role in preparing children of Hispanic descent and who live in households experiencing low income for kindergarten entry. However, children's readiness at entry into kindergarten was more strongly related to later academic achievement than age at kindergarten entry and preschool experience.

        "description":"The prevention of drug abuse is an especially salient topic for school psychologists and other educational professionals. Schools are the primary setting for providing education and information aimed at the prevention of drug abuse. Previous meta-analyses (Ennett, et al., 1994; West & O'Neal, 2004) indicate that one of the nation's most popular drug prevention programs, the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program (D.A.R.E.), was not effective in reducing illicit drug use among youths. In 2003, D.A.R.E. was modified in an attempt to make it more effective. The purpose of this review is to summarize and synthesize the contemporary empirical evidence, which includes six studies focusing on the old D.A.R.E. and one study focusing on the new D.A.R.E., regarding outcomes associated with the modified D.A.R.E. program. Recent studies offer mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of the new D.A.R.E curriculum, thus, further systematic investigation is warranted to better understand student outcomes associated with the new D.A.R.E curriculum. This information is particularly valuable for school psychologists, administrators, and other education professionals responsible for identifying empirically supported programs for use in schools.

The premise of this model is that a learning disability is manifested in L1 (primary language) and L2 (secondary language). The writers present cognitive assessments that are available in English, Spanish, and nonverbal modalities that utilize CHC as the underlying theory. By incorporating these assessments, the school psychologist is in a better position to analyze L1 and L2 assessment data and gain a clearer understanding of strengths and weaknesses and provide linguistically appropriate interventions.

        "description":"The goal of any behavioral program is to facilitate lasting change. A significant criticism of behavioral programs is that they work in the clinical setting but do not generalize once the clinical program is stopped. The authors suggest that behavioral programs often do not generalize because clinicians fail to plan for generalization to occur (Maag, 2004). A technology for planning and facilitating generalization has been in existence since the 1970's (Stokes and Baer, 1977, Stokes and Osnes, 1986 and Stokes and Osnes, 1989). The authors have created a form to prompt clinicians and researchers to systematically plan for generalization as part of their behavioral programming. A case study is given to demonstrate how the form can be used to increase the probability of behavioral changes transferring to other settings and maintaining over time. The Generalization Analysis Worksheet is designed to assure that clinicians and researchers program for generalization as part of any behavioral program they design. If the technology suggested by Stokes and Baer, 1977, Stokes and Osnes, 1986 and Stokes and Osnes, 1989 is routinely programmed into behavioral programs, behaviorists may finally be able to answer the criticism that behavioral programs do not generalize.

        "description":"The world faces pervasive poverty and inequality. Hundreds of billions of dollars in international aid have been given or loaned to developing countries though bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, at least, ostensibly, in order to do something about these problems. Has such aid helped? Debates around this question have been ongoing for decades, perhaps intensifying in recent years. This should not be a surprise. It is far from straightforward to even determine how to investigate the question. In the author's review of the literature on aid and development, five recent books stood out as repeatedly discussed and referenced. These are: (1) Thomas Dichter's &quot;Despite Good Intentions: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed&quot;; (2) William Easterly's &quot;The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done so Much Ill and So Little Good&quot;; (3) Dambisa Moyo's &quot;Dead Aid: Why Aid is Not Working and How There is a Better Way for Africa&quot;; (4) Roger Riddell's &quot;Does Foreign Aid Really Work?&quot;; and (5) David Ellerman's &quot;Helping People Help Themselves: From the World Bank to an Alternative Philosophy of Development Assistance.&quot; In this article, Klees briefly examines each of these works, trying to provide a sense of each author's argument in his or her own words. The first three books mostly offer neoliberal perspectives, while the last two come from more liberal and progressive perspectives. The author follows this examination with a discussion of their views and concludes with his own views on aid and development, including implications for education. (Contains 23 endnotes.)",

        "description":"The logic behind international aid to development has typically centered on economics. Notwithstanding the variation in focus--from macroeconomic monetary and trade policies, to economic wealth programs aimed at creating jobs, to supply- and demand-side reforms--the central discourse on international aid has been dominated by a political economist's viewpoint. Steven Klees' article, \"Aid, Development, and Education\" continues to use an economic perspective by challenging some of the neoliberal economic assumptions made within the development industry since the 1970s. He offers a refreshing progressive alternative to the dominant neoliberal agenda and its institutions. His initial question--has such aid helped?--has a clear answer in all of the literature he reviews: no, aid has not been as effective as it could have been. But his call for a \"new architecture\" of international development derives from \"old\" foundations, reinforcing the established pillars of the economic development continuum--neoliberal, liberal, and progressive. Will a progressive development architecture produce a different outcome than that of (neo)liberalism without rebuilding the philosophical foundations of international aid? Is a reimagination of international aid along radically new philosophical lines possible? If so, what would it look like? As the development industry is becoming increasingly institutionalized as a science, business, and fashion--after all, anyone can now become development \"experts\"--these authors would like to challenge the very foundation on which the contemporary development architecture rests. Turning to an 18th-century French teacher named Joseph Jacotot, who attempted (albeit unsuccessfully) to reconceptualize education as an \"intellectual emancipation\" by implicating teacher expertise in perpetuating inequality, the authors ponder the possibility of a radical reimagination of international aid along similar lines. Instead of reinforcing the edifice of Western development expertise (seeking better \"best practices,\" identifying more efficient development methods, or mobilizing additional resources for international aid), perhaps what is really needed is an \"ignorant donor\"--a donor who enters the development scene without the baggage of international aid politics and the concerns of economic progress; who assumes an equality of intelligence in all stakeholders; and who sees empowerment, participation, and education as the ends in the process of international (and national) aid.

        "author":["Ginsburg, Mark"],
        "description":"In the introduction to his article, \"Aid, Development, and Education,\" Klees (2010) poses the question, has the \"hundreds of billions of dollars in international aid... loaned to [or otherwise targeted to \"assist\"] developing countries through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms... helped?\" He then posits the question to be \"too complicated to be well specified\" for empirical study, in part because \"there are a myriad of interactive factors that affect poverty and economic growth besides aid\" and \"international aid serves many [other] purposes.\" After reviewing a set of recent books on aid (Dichter, 2003; Easterly, 2008; Moyo, 2009; Riddell, 2007) framed mainly by authors subscribing to a neoliberal capitalist perspective, Klees concludes by stating that \"the best anyone can say is that the situation could have been a lot worse than it is now without aid.\" Ironically, though, this conclusion may apply to: (1) the quality of life for all human beings; and/or (2) the compensatory legitimation of the world economic system and national political economies. This author basically agrees with Klees' analysis of the issues and his critical review of these assessments of aid. However, Ginsburg takes the critique further and promotes a more radical--and, in his view, more humane--agenda for change. To begin with, he problematizes \"development\" much more than Klees does. Although the question Klees posed is framed around the term \"aid,\" he appropriately includes the term \"development\" in the title of his article, given that most of the focus is on overseas or foreign development assistance. Klees does reference Frank's (1967) critical analysis of the global economic system, but refrains from naming the system, let alone calling for a transformation of global \"capitalist\" relations. Instead, his argument could be (mis)interpreted as claiming that \"poverty and inequality\" result from--and are being reproduced by--neoliberalism. Ginsburg shares Klees' critique of neoliberalism, but emphasizes that it is only one of several ideologies (and associated policies and actions) which, historically, have been marshaled (with some success) to mobilize support for and demobilize opposition to the world capitalist system. Thus, in this author's opinion, one needs to be very careful in using the term \"development,\" given that its meaning has been captured within a capitalist framework. One might want to try to rescue the term by referencing social democratic, socialist, eco-feminist, or sustainable, human rights-based development, but perhaps it is better to focus one's attention and energies on transforming the unjust \"capitalist\" world system.

        "description":"Recent works that assess whether development has been well-served, or served at all, by international aid, are overwhelmingly pessimistic in their assessment and in favor of the market as the antidote to international aid (Klees, 2010). The author finds that Steve Klees' essay focuses on the neoliberal and liberal frameworks that represent the mainstream view on aid, but offers very little elaboration of the progressive perspective that Klees endorses. In this article, the author extricates the progressive perspective (as defined by Klees) from its premature burial and elaborates on progressive analysis on the future of aid and development. This is done by first parsing the very category of &quot;progressive&quot; and contending that its typical usage within U.S. political discourse obfuscates rather than clarifies political analysis. Building on this point, this author argues that the ways in which the &quot;progressive&quot; perspective is circumscribed in Klees' essay and within general U.S. political debate rules out Left critiques of international aid and the alternatives proposed from within this framework. Finally, Kamat outlines some recent policy actions and people's struggles in different parts of the Third World that illustrate a Left perspective on aid and development quite distinct from the liberal progressive critiques that are on the table thus far.

        "author":["Mundy, Karen"],
        "description":"In his article, \"Aid, Development, and Education,\" Steve Klees tells two stories about foreign aid. The first is that foreign aid does not \"work\" to alleviate world poverty, no matter whether one takes a neo-Marxist or liberal approach to understanding it. Aid is more about self-interest and geopolitics than anything else--at best it is a form of compensatory legitimation practiced by the world's richest governments to put a band-aid on inequality. At the same time, Klees tells that aid is not \"all bad.\" It has a progressive and transformative component. If reformed, and revamped, it can serve the common good. More money, provided directly to the poor, getting rid of the World Bank, focusing on key priorities, changing the role of research in the aid regime, and increasing forms of democratic participation and collective agenda setting are all parts of Klees' remedy. In this response, the author raises two questions: (1) How can critical scholars have it both ways? That is to say, how can development assistance be both a key instrument of unequal social relations and part of a progressive solution?; and (2) What is missing from Klees' diagnosis of the aid regime and his prescriptions for aid reform?

He tries to detail both in this reply, but he focuses on how he and his respondents share what he calls a progressive perspective--even though none of his respondents choose that particular label to describe their point of view. The meaning of a progressive perspective necessarily reflects a struggle over theory and praxis. It is constantly being formed and re-formed. The debate in this issue is part of that struggle.

This means looking beyond the traditional clientele of university education in terms of routes into higher education, age, and centrality of studies. Attracting and catering to this more comprehensive group entails rethinking study programs and study environment for a more heterogeneous student body. So where are we now on these issues and where can we expect to be in the next decade? This is a question being raised within the framework of the Europe-wide Bologna Process for higher education reform. On the basis of data sets being used for analysis within this reform program, a comparison of the situation in selected European countries will be presented. It will be shown that some countries are better placed to deal with the growing number of adult learners than others. (Contains 2 notes, 3 tables and 6 figures.)",

To address these questions, I compare high school students' perceptions of the level of education they will require for the job they intend to hold at age 30, with the level required according to professional job analysts. About three out of four students intending to work in a job requiring a university degree know the level of education that is required to obtain the job. Moreover, students who know that a university degree is required are more likely to attend university. Finally, higher university attendance rates are observed when students learn earlier (rather than later), that a university degree is required for their intended job.

The data come from Statistics Canada's Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Canada. Using multinomial logistic regressions and fixed effects regressions, we found that: a third of new immigrants with postsecondary training pursue their education during their early years in Canada; those who are admitted to Canada because of their high levels of skills, namely the principal applicants in the skilled workers category, are more likely to pursue their education; and those who enrol do not see an immediate benefit in terms of their earnings. This is further evidence of the lack of foreign credential recognition in Canada, which delays entry into highly paid occupations and delays full participation in the Canadian economy.

Unfortunately, school counselors today may not have adequate knowledge or training to be able to provide such services and some may have attitudes and biases that prevent effective work with these students. Yet, school counselors have unique skills to apply in service delivery. This discussion examines academic, career/vocational, social, and affective needs of gifted students and areas for which they may require specialized assistance. The American School Counselor Association (ASCA) Ethical Standards for School Counselors (2004) can guide and support school counseling professionals as they obtain the education and training necessary to better meet the needs of gifted and talented learners, who are indeed part of \"all\" students whom they are admonished to serve.",

The relationship between the lay Catholic principal in the parish and the parish priest emerged as a challenging issue in many contexts. Indeed, it was highly problematic for some principals.

For the Holy See this signifies a loss of a sense of sin and reconciliation, rightly connecting moral consciousness and faith in salvation with sacramental celebration. Cultural studies underscore the importance of ritual practices as an essential element of religion's ability to deal with the experience of moral evil. However, decline in the frequency of confession may also be complicated by indifference among North American Catholics to current roles and power relations in the Church. In light of moral individualism in society and new ways of envisioning the Church fostered by Vatican II, the challenge of moral education in the Church is complex, but hopeful. Effective religious education, responsive to the situation of contemporary Catholics, will seek innovative approaches that are rooted in the tradition and developed in communities of living faith. The essay suggests that theories of transformative learning and communities of practice offer helpful models for responding to the crisis of sin and reconciliation in Roman Catholicism.",

Recall that the 220 or so Catholic colleges and universities are of very different kinds, very different sizes, with different student bodies, and are located in different parts of a country that sometimes have quite different cultures. One of the more interesting developments in recent years has been the appearance of Catholic Studies Programs (CSPs). A number of Catholic colleges and universities have highly publicized these programs, and tried with varying success to make them vehicles for the transmission of the mission and identity of their institution. Commentaries on these programs often reflect the ongoing debates about the larger question of the mission and identity of Catholic universities and colleges. The quality of the debate about CSPs on a specific campus often indicates the depth of understanding that faculty and administrators of that institution have of their overall mission and identity. This article begins with a look at CSPs, and concludes with some personal reflections on the larger questions related to the mission and identity of Catholic higher education in the United States today.",

        "author":["Tidd, Kevin M."],
        "description":"In Part I of this two-part series (published in the March 2009 issue), the author traced the evolution of the Brothers of the Christian Schools' (Christian Brothers in the United States) understanding of how they related to the lay people with whom they increasingly shared their apostolate of Catholic education. From a stance of wary distance in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Brothers increasingly accepted the reality of the presence of lay teachers in their schools by the middle of the 20th century. In the wake of the renewal occasioned by Vatican II, the Brothers began a process of self-examination and reflection on their apostolic identity and finality that dealt directly with the question of their corporate relationship with the laity that increasingly staffed and administered what were now called Lasallian schools. In the second part of this series, the Brothers' 41st General Chapter of 1986 is the starting point for a detailed analysis of how they developed the paradigm of shared mission that has radically reshaped the Brothers as a congregation and the landscape of relationships within the institutions they help to animate. This conceptual framework has profound roots in the theology of the apostolate of the laity described at Vatican II (Vatican Council II, 1966) and is embraced in the Brothers' own documents of renewal (Brothers of the Christian Schools, 1967/1994). It offers a powerful example of theological reflection and apostolic action for lay people and vowed religious who today share the mission of Catholic education. This article reviews the recent struggle of the Christian Brothers to develop the concepts of Lasallian schools and shared mission as a means to invite and incorporate the full and active collaboration of lay men and women in the ministry of Catholic education.

The study found that the program had a powerful impact on the participants personally, and 71% became newly involved or recommitted to social justice initiatives upon returning from the program. Two factors, however, significantly predicted the participants' level of transfer of learning into action: the availability of social support at their home institution and the applicability of their learning to their work. The article concludes with recommendations to help institutional leaders even more intentionally support participants to bring the lessons learned from mission formation programs back to their institutions.

The Catholic School Classroom Environment Questionnaire (CSCEQ) was used to assess 7 dimensions of the classroom psychosocial environment: student affiliation, interactions, cooperation, task orientation, order and organization, individualization, and teacher control. The sample consisted of 1,719 students from 80 classes in 20 Catholic coeducational and single-sex schools. Validation data attested to the sound structural properties of the CSCEQ. Because the data were nested (i.e., students within classes within schools), multilevel analyses were used to investigate the influence of student gender, grade, subject, and school type on students' perceptions of the classroom environment. Statistically significant associations between some of these grouping variables and some of the CSCEQ scales were evident, with student gender and grade the main explanatory variables. Variance in order and organization was not explained by any of the four hypothesized grouping variables. (Contains 5 tables.)",

The present study compares the effectiveness of two types of high-poverty Catholic schools for 322 African American middle school students. Results show that Nativity schools are more successful than traditional Catholic schools in effecting student gains in standardized test score performance. Results also suggest that features such as small school and class size, small student-teacher ratios, and an extended academic day contribute to these gains. The quality of the school and classroom environment, as perceived by students, that contributed to the amount of engaged learning time also may have contributed to their stronger academic performance. Implications for urban schooling for African American middle school children placed at risk are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"During the first half of the 20th century, Catholic educators in the United States used theological arguments both to resist and embrace the progressive educational reform effort of educational measurement. The significant expansion of Catholic schooling and the increased number of students attending them, along with increased state oversight, led to a gradual, yet uneven, acceptance of educational measurement by Catholic educators. This partial and more critical acceptance can be attributed to the diversity of Catholic schooling and the incongruity between the assumptions of educational measurement and Catholic educational beliefs. This historical case offers support for continued critique of reform movements and at the same time cautions against wholesale rejection of them. Each reform requires scrutiny with the goal of determining which will assist schools in helping students reach their fullest potential.",

Following these descriptions it is explained how Jesuits can influence the development of a curriculum for Hate Studies.

        "description":"The Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) was an ecumenical council of Catholic bishops from around the world. The bishops made changes both in the internal life of the Church (e.g., the sacraments and daily practices of Catholics) and in the approach that the Church took toward other religions and toward the secular world. These changes transformed the mission of the Church. It is the purpose of this paper to examine how the mission of Catholic primary and secondary schools was transformed by this council. This paper is divided into three parts. The first is an analysis of the mission of these schools before Vatican II (1810-1962). The second is an analysis of Catholic school mission in the post-Vatican II era (1965-1995). The third part is a tool to aid reflection on the Catholic mission of one's own school.",

Drawing on survey data and a qualitative study of the teacher candidate experience, we explore the following questions: In a teacher education program committed to promoting social justice, embracing an inquiry-into-practice stance, and affirming diversity by meeting the needs of diverse learners, how do teacher candidates assess pupil learning, in particular, how are their assessments influenced by these program themes? Further, how do they respond when dilemmas linked to pupil learning arise? Specifically, we focused on dilemmas two teacher candidates encountered that engendered a sense of &quot;disequilibrium,&quot; a feeling something was not quite right with their teaching. In turn, we consider how they responded--typically taking ownership of dilemmas and modifying their teaching, while occasionally distancing themselves from responsibility for pupil performance. To conclude, we discuss implications for teachers educators, and specifically for Catholic institutions of higher education that prepare teachers for both public and Catholic schools.

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (2005) directs Catholic educators toward social justice schooling by making schools accessible, affordable, and available. In recent decades, however, Catholic elementary and secondary schools serving significant numbers of traditionally marginalized students have struggled to remain viable, despite compelling evidence that they are academically successful when they do. More recently, a growing number of Catholic institutions of higher education (IHEs) have been partnering with Catholic archdioceses and schools to promote the viability and capacity of such schools. This article calls for scholarship on emerging partnerships between Catholic institutions of higher education and Catholic K-12 schools that aim at socially just schooling. Justice, ethical care, learning, and social entrepreneurship are explored as possible conceptual frameworks for this research.",

University-school partnerships provide an opportunity for Catholic institutions of higher education to extend beyond developing human resources to strengthen Catholic K-12 schools to effect comprehensive school reform. This article describes the origins and evolution of one such university-school partnership initiative, the University of Notre Dame's Magnificat School partnerships. This article presents an analysis of program evaluation data from the first 3 years of the Magnificat partnerships and a discussion of how the lessons learned in this program evaluation have informed revisions to the Magnificat model. Additionally, these lessons can inform the efforts of other colleges and universities that may seek to engage Catholic K-12 schools to effect comprehensive school reform. (Contains 2 figures.)",

        "description":"This paper shows that a lack of explicit and clearly stated intentions regarding the development of Catholic students' ecclesial agency through their schooling leads to potential problems as they experience and imagine themselves as lay persons in the Church. While the question of \"ecclesial agency\" applies throughout all Catholic schooling and the whole Church, in practice the usual flashpoint upon which its relevance emerges is in the discussion of issues that are controversial within Catholicism. This paper, therefore, examines the question of ecclesial agency through an analysis of the pedagogical treatment of three controversial intra-Church topics and documents on the Church's understanding of the laity. Its conclusion reveals several important considerations and questions that concern the foundational aims of Catholic schooling and what outcomes are assumed regarding the student's current and future participation as a lay person in the Church.

Since Catholic school students typically do not have the physical transition or social network changes in junior high, it was hypothesized that their self-concepts would not fluctuate. One hundred ninety-five ethnically diverse Catholic school students rated how they think and feel about their general, self-image, academic, and social self-concepts, as well as how important each item was to their self-concept. Students were initially in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade and subsequently in sixth, seventh, and eighth grade at the time of the longitudinal study. Overall, the results indicated that ratings of self-concept and the importance of the items remained stable between elementary and junior high school and for students of varying ethnicities. The results are compared to the findings from other studies. The lack of a physical transition and social network changes from elementary school to junior high may assist students from developing significantly lower self-concept in junior high, especially in academic and social self-concept.

Over the past half century, hopes that human rights could become truly effective standards of international behavior have risen and fallen like tides. It is true, of course, that the Church's engagement in the struggle for human rights has not been uniform and consistent in all countries. It is also true that Church leaders and members have helped create a major global force for the promotion of human rights. A key question for Jesuit universities is how they can help both the Church and the larger secular community improve and advance on the achievements they have made. The Jesuit universities can contribute to advancing the cause of human rights in the globalizing world, both within the Catholic community itself and in the larger, religiously diverse world.",

        "description":"In the mid-1990s, several hundred Catholic educators gathered at the University of St. Thomas, attempting to move the discussion of Catholic mission and identity away from a debate about juridical relationships and toward mission-inspired work for social and civil responsibility, with a commitment to research and teaching in Catholic studies. Concurrently with the origins and then the development of the issue of Catholic identity, Catholic colleges and universities in the United States were undergoing massive and sweeping changes in response to a whole range of a number of other stimuli. Responding to all of these challenges and opportunities, Catholic, and specifically Jesuit colleges and universities, have made dramatic strides in the past 40 years in academic and institutional quality, professionalism, and lay leadership that have led to new respect among their peer institutions. The most severe critics would claim that, in the process of making this very obvious progress, US colleges and universities have lost or are losing their identity as Jesuit and Catholic. Others see many opportunities for a vigorous, engaged Catholic identity and mission to transform not only the American Church but American higher education. In this paper, the author discusses the history of Catholic identity among Catholic institutions of higher education, and more specifically the development of Jesuit, Catholic identity within Jesuit colleges and universities. He presents recommendations for what Jesuit institutions can do as they face the decreasing presence of Jesuits on campus.",

Key philosophical and foundational FCS papers along with documents pertaining to the principles of CST, CIT, and the charisms of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent De Paul, and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet were examined and shared meanings were identified; institutional mission statements from respective sponsored institutions were likewise compared. The review process permitted a very pointed comparison between the disciplinary and institutional missions, substantiating the congruity between the two. The parity between professional and Catholic institutional missions outlined in this paper suggests that the longevity of FCS programs could be fostered by taking root in Catholic institutions.

These issues are discussed in the context of a graduate level course on human diversity that culminated in a 1-day cultural immersion and service learning trip to Tijuana, Mexico. Students learned firsthand about the legacies of colonialism, poverty, and injustice as well as the resilience and potential of rural Mexican communities to transform these experiences into new cultural and business practices, healing, and survival against many odds. Excerpts from student essays suggest the potential for MFT programs to create a space in Catholic higher education in which the intersection of CST and MFT could be openly examined and realized with opportunities to create new knowledge and energy to work for social change and justice beyond the borders. The pedagogical challenges, recommendations, and areas for future inquiry are discussed.",

With that aim in mind, we review the patterns that Web 2.0 has successfully applied, and have been proved to encourage people to interact and to share information. Then, we present an eLearning 2.0 provisioning strategy based on iPLEs. Finally, we explain how this strategy can help translating Web 2.0 patterns to learning, and positioning universities as eLearning 2.0 providers.",

        "description":"This paper reports on a teaching experience of the introduction of ICT to higher education students in a complementary professional approach and a Personal Learning Environment (PLE) development approach, as well as a naturalistic study based on this experience. The central focus of this methodology was the use of hands-on sessions to introduce students to some specific ICT tools, and exploring the building process of an awareness about their Personal Learning environments. In terms of learning, we confirmed that students very much appreciate new ways of developing their tasks and their course work. Even when the great majority of students associates learning with acquiring only information and some of them associate learning with memorizing. In terms of Technology, after this experience we can conclude that students, when arriving at university, have no experience--even knowledge--in the use of ICT tools. In addition, students from the first year of the degree don't think they use Web 2.0 (awareness), and even more, they don't believe that they can use ICT tools for learning, even if they actually do. They value, useful tools which help them to plan their tasks, save time, simplify complicated tasks and, definitively, have fun; but also they specially value the ICT tools they discovered, seeing opportunities for Independency, collaboration, self importance in the learning process. The vast majority of students have a basic perception of their PLE. Few of them don't relate tools with themselves but with their tasks, and only some of them go one step further by establishing more complex relationships between tools, contents, tasks and themselves enriching each other.

Additionally, the relationship between the educational uses of technology and the overall educational patterns of interaction between teachers and learners, and among learners themselves was analysed. Detailed teacher and learner self-reports about their teaching and learning activity; the asynchronous written messages teachers and learners sent as educational interaction in the online learning environment; and documents produced by students were all obtained. The results from the three learning activities indicated six overall educational uses of technology in an online learning environment. Moreover, the results also indicated differences in technology usage in some different patterns of educational interaction in each learning activity. In conclusion, we argue that the notion of technology educational affordance is useful as an effective bridge between the real use of technology and instructional aims. Therefore the distribution of educational uses of technology is not only related to some attributes of both technology and instruction but also to its interaction. (Contains 1 figure and 7 tables.)",

        "description":"Say the phrase &quot;Charlie bit my finger,&quot; and just about every human being with Internet access visualizes the viral video clip of baby Charlie precociously biting the finger of his brother. With almost 200 million views, this video represents just one of thousands of viral videos that form a core component of modern entertainment, news, and advertising. These snippets that people e-mail, post, and pass on to one another faster than the common cold have rapidly moved from the fringe of youth culture to the mainstream. What if teachers could capitalize on student interest in these quick and quirky video clips as a way to help students connect with curriculum? That is exactly what Tyler Binkley, a first-year teacher and member of the YouTube generation, has set out to do in his middle school math class. Binkley creates online math video vignettes that teach critical math skills, and his unique approach has been featured on television and in other news outlets. His students report going to Binkley's YouTube channel whenever they struggle with a current math task; and with thousands of views, Binkley's videos are a viral hit in Palmyra (Pennsylvania) Middle School. In this article, Oliver Dreon and Jon Landis, educational technology professors, and Richard Kerper, a children's and young adolescent literature professor, explain the emergence of Binkley's use of digital storytelling in his middle school classroom. The article outlines how instructional technology and content-specific courses in the teacher education program work in tandem to develop beginning teachers' understanding of digital storytelling as an educational tool. This coordination of efforts offers a framework for incorporating digital storytelling in the middle grades classroom and can also help practicing teachers understand the educational importance and cultural value of the digital storytelling medium.

        "description":"This paper presents findings from a qualitative study that investigated school participants' perceptions of the benefits, challenges and supportive factors related to their involvement in a long-term school/university professional experience partnership. Data were collected through interviews with coordinators and a written survey completed by mentor teachers from 4 schools. The findings indicate that participants perceived the program to have a number of benefits for both staff and school students and that participation was supported by effective communication, flexible funding arrangements, local autonomy to interpret and adapt the program and the continuity arising from the long-term nature of the partnership. The benefits and supportive factors appear to have compensated for challenges such as organisational demands, negotiating university expectations and stresses on workload, time, space and resources. The discussion focuses on features that appear to have contributed to the sustainability of the partnership over many years.",

However, little research has been undertaken to investigate the factors associated with absenteeism among pre-service teachers. This study investigates rates of absenteeism among different groups of pre-service teachers in a large School of Education in a Western Australian university and considers pre-service teachers' self-reported reasons for being absent from lectures and tutorials. The results show that levels of attendance and reasons for absence at lectures vary according to demographic factors such as age, paid employment, entry pathway, course, mode of study and year level of study. Level of attendance at tutorials is affected by the same factors, except that the year of study (first, second, third or fourth) does not appear to be an influence. The relationships between attendance and achievement are also interrogated. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)",

These pre-service primary teachers completed the single semester, compulsory subject Managing the Learning Environment, which involves the application of behaviour management theory and research into the primary school classroom. The aim of the study was to investigate the experiences of student teachers using blogs whilst on professional placement and more specifically, the effectiveness of blogs to facilitate reflection on behaviour management. Data were drawn from focus group interviews and blog postings. There were mixed responses to the use of blogs as a learning tool; those who found it useful saw its utility in developing behaviour management strategies, venting emotions and supporting each other, while others considered blogs a time imposition and questioned the usefulness of peer advice. While blog postings demonstrated some evidence of reflection and aligning theory and practice, they were overwhelmingly used for the sharing of behaviour management &quot;tips&quot;.",

Recent examples include the No Child Left Behind policy in the USA, the British National Numeracy Strategy and in Australia, Effective Third Wave Intervention Strategies. Direct instruction, stems directly from the model created in the 1960s under a Project Follow Through grant. It has been defined as a comprehensive system of education involving all aspects of instruction. Now in its third decade of influencing curriculum, instruction and research, direct instruction is also into its third decade of controversy because of its focus on explicit and highly directed instruction for learning. Characteristics of direct instruction are critiqued and discussed to identify implications for teaching and learning for Indigenous students.",

This study examines societal, institutional, and personal factors that influence PSTs' understandings about general and special education teachers. It examines factors that influence their decisions about what type of teachers they want to become. It also examines the factors that influence their perceptions of disability and typicality. It considers the relationship between socializing agents (such as past experiences, public perception, and the teacher education program itself) in relation to PSTs' desires to become general or special educators. It also relates their professional decisions to the norms and values espoused within this new programmatic framework. Framed within the professional socialization and teacher identity literature, this study delves into the nuances of a combined credential program. (Contains 1 table and 1 note.)",

        "description":"As middle and secondary classrooms become increasingly inclusive, some special educators may not be prepared to teach content, and some general educators may not be prepared to address diverse learning needs. This mismatch between the reality of today's schools and traditional teacher preparation has led to the development of new models for teacher education that integrate or merge special education and general education. Integrated and merged models are two approaches to combining special and general education pedagogy for teacher education. In merged programs, faculty in general and special education collaborate to develop one program in which all candidates receive licensure in both general and special education. Merged programs are developed through the extensive and deliberate collaboration of general and special education faculty to redesign the teacher education curriculum and field experiences. However, while several merged programs have been developed to prepare elementary candidates, programs for middle/secondary candidates are scarce. When faculty from Curriculum and Instruction and Special Education consider creating a merged secondary program, many questions and issues arise. These questions and issues were addressed in the development and implementation of the Secondary Dual Educator's Program (SDEP). The overall purpose of SDEP is to develop strategic teachers with the versatility to meet the learning needs of all secondary students. This article describes the process used by cross-department faculty to develop the program design and components and how program evaluation led to revisions that strengthened the program.

There are currently three established teacher preparation program models: (1) \"discrete\"; (2) \"integrated\"; and (3) \"merged.\" In the \"discrete\" model, which is the most widely implemented of the three, general and special education programs are separate. In the \"integrated\" model, separate programs are retained but faculty work together to develop some courses and/or field experiences in which special education candidates learn about the general education curriculum while general education candidates learn about inclusive education. In \"merged\" programs, \"faculty prepare general and special educators, using a single curriculum in which courses and field experiences are designed to address the needs of all students, including those who have disabilities.\" While most integrated or merged programs are at the elementary level, there are a few examples in secondary education. Many questions arise regarding the capabilities that might distinguish graduates of merged programs, the program design needed to develop these capabilities, and the impact graduates could have in schools and classrooms. In order to address these questions, research regarding the development, design and evaluation of merged programs is needed. The authors describe the development and initial implementation of the Secondary Dual Educator's Program (SDEP), a merged secondary education program. SDEP is a full-time graduate program culminating in licensure as a secondary educator in a content area (authorization to teach mid-level and/or high school), licensure in secondary special education, and a Master in Education (M.Ed.). This article uses data from multiple stakeholders to evaluate whether SDEP candidates and graduates are meeting program goals. This initial evaluation suggests that graduates of a merged secondary program developed competency in differentiated planning, assessment, and instruction in content area classrooms and embedded the provision of accommodations into their planning process.",

        "description":"To reduce teacher shortages, an intern credential has been introduced as a means of alternate certification in California. Individuals who meet the requirement of subject matter competency are eligible for an intern credential, allowing them to teach students in special education programs for two years while completing their coursework requirements for certification. Often, intern teachers begin their employment with limited experience, knowledge, and skills in special education. Special education intern teachers are particularly vulnerable to attrition because of their stressful workloads, scant experience, and limited content knowledge. Therefore, it is critical to support special education intern teachers by reducing stress and improving their job satisfaction and retention rates. This study focused on perils to special education intern teachers' perceived self-efficacy and the quality of support they received, accounting for the influence of demographics, levels of paperwork, content knowledge, support from parents and school districts, and teacher preparation programs. Specifically, the authors examine correlates (perils) of intern teachers' levels of perceived teaching efficacy with access to teaching resources, personal background, competency knowledge, and perceived support--from school districts, from teacher preparation programs, and from pupils' parents. Results of the analyses are discussed. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Preliminary work in the teaching field has found associations between teacher beliefs and attitudes and their effectiveness in their interactions with students. This study aims to better understand the dispositional traits and emotional states of pre-service teachers and the association between these attributes and the effectiveness of their interactions with students. The authors examine two dispositional traits that hold particular promise: (1) &quot;personality&quot;; and (2) &quot;adult attachment style.&quot; They also examine three emotional states: (1) &quot;depression&quot;; (2) &quot;anxiety&quot;; and (3) &quot;stress.&quot; Additionally, this study asks whether these qualities of pre-service teachers are similar to their same age peers, if they remain stable over time, and whether they predict preservice teachers' interactions with students in their student-teaching experience. The results of this study have important implications for teacher education and for understanding the characteristics of those individuals who are entering the teaching profession and who may show early promise as effective teachers.

While there is an established body of literature in teacher education that examines teachers' concerns, studies exploring the emergence of such concerns and beginning teachers' strategies to survive during their first year of teaching is limited. Specifically, more studies that focus on the professional development of secondary teachers are needed. In this study, the authors followed five secondary preservice teachers for two years during their teacher education program and their first year of teaching. Using interviews and their written narratives, the authors described: (1) major concerns of preservice teachers; and (2) strategies the teachers used to help them face their concerns. Identification of their concerns and especially the strategies they used as they better understood their students and their students' families and became more aware of their identities as teachers also shed light on reforms in current teacher education efforts.

        "author":["Cuenca, Alexander"],
        "description":"A key factor in learning to teach during student teaching is the cooperating teacher, who supports and mentors prospective teachers. In the apprenticeship that is student teaching, the cooperating teacher serves as a gatekeeper to the experiential learning of pre-service teachers. Although several studies indicate the significant influence cooperating teachers have on student teachers' beliefs about the teaching profession, professional norms, or what student teachers decide to teach, the focus of many of these studies equate mentorship with the direct transmission of teacher knowledge to student teachers. Often missing in the student teaching literature is the crucial role of the cooperating teacher in sanctioning the entrance of the student teacher into the community of teaching and providing access to the settings that contain the tools, artifacts, and message systems student teachers need to learn to teach from the activity of student teaching. Seeking to address this gap in the research literature, this study explores the following research question: how is access to the practice of teaching granted by cooperating teachers during the student teaching experience? In particular, the author examines how two student teachers saw their cooperating teachers conferring legitimacy on them during student teaching. Drawing on the work of Lave and Wenger (1991), who suggest that the social structure of any community of practice, such as teaching, defines the possibilities for learning, this study attempts to identify dimensions of legitimacy and access that can provide favorable conditions for learning during the student teaching experience. By providing a sociocultural perspective on the work of learning to teach during student teaching, this study builds on work that frames the role of the cooperating teacher as a socializing agent, and contributes another perspective on the social structures that constitute an effective student teaching experience.",

They need to ask them to gauge continually their confidence in their career choice when they are engaged in learning what is required in the daily work of teaching. The authors state that teacher educators need to be in the business of preparing teachers who show up everyday focused on the task at hand, on the children, and not on planning for how they will get their \"real job.\" This article seeks to illuminate aspects of career choice and conflict for teacher education students seeking initial licensure. Secondly, foundational knowledge on career decision-making is addressed. Finally, suggestions are made for ways in which a career-counseling model might be directly applied within a curriculum framework. (Contains 1 note.)",

An inductive naturalistic approach was used to explore the following question: &quot;What are the experiences in the lives of upper-elementary school children that foster an intrinsic motivation to seek information?&quot; The conceptual framework was composed of Taxonomy of Tasks (Bilal 2002) and A Theoretical Model of Urban Teen Development (Agosto and Hughes-Hassell 2006a, 2006b). Self-Determination Theory (Deci and Ryan 1985) provided the theoretical framework. Participants were survey-selected fifth graders from three diverse schools. Data was collected through interviews and drawings. Students described various family situations and school experiences, and exhibited different communication styles. They exhibited affinity for play, tendency toward creativity, and the disposition of noncompetitiveness. Informants indicated a variety of information-seeking styles and interests, engaged in information seeking to facilitate maturation into adolescence, and recounted diverse information-seeking episodes. All experienced a &quot;point of passion,&quot; and &quot;anchor&quot; relationships helped foster their intrinsic motivation for information seeking. Topic interest and relevance, group work, task choice, creating a final product, and fewer time constraints were all components of the students' intrinsically motivating information-seeking episodes. Recommendations for practitioners are included. (Contains 4 figures and 7 tables.)",

Data were collected through school district documents and interviews with the district superintendent, a governing board member, the director of finance, a school administrator, and a librarian. Using an organizational decision-making framework, the researcher constructed the following values-oriented themes contributing to the retention of librarians: employee involvement, transparency in communication, trust between district leadership and the governing board, a commitment to the district's core values, and the value placed on the school library program by the district's stakeholders. Findings indicated that practitioners can advocate on the basis of organizational factors that contribute to school librarian retention.

A mixed-method concurrent triangulation research design was implemented by using pre-existing data, the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI), and a survey designed by the researcher.The study findings indicated that the participants' leadership training facilitated the development of their self-perceived transformational leadership behaviors to a significantly higher level than the established national norms for the LPI in two areas--Modeling the Way and Enabling Others to Act. In addition, the assessment of leadership potential given during the program selection process had a positive correlation with the LPI subscale for Enabling Others to Act. Moreover, the social context of each participant's circumstances had an impact on their self-perceived transformational leadership potential when considering the participants' satisfaction with the support they received from their mentors, the amount of time they spent with their mentors, whether they selected or were assigned a mentor, their Graduate Record Exam scores, and the poverty level within their schools districts.

        "description":"Distance learning is seen as the obvious answer for remote learners, and the use of online media is expected to overcome any access difficulties imposed by geographical distance. However, this belief may be obscuring our understanding of the role that location and individual circumstances have in shaping student experience. This paper explores the variation in experiences of remote rural students who study with the Open University (UK). The researchers found that perceptions of remoteness depended on geography, but were also relative to individual circumstances. With respect to students' sense of connection with university staff and peers, most mentioned their contact with their personal tutor. Networks with peers were less common, a matter of concern if peer networks are integral to fostering improved retention and progression. In this particular context, distance education may be playing an important and distinctive role for remote students by providing opportunities for connections with like-minded people.

        "description":"Offered between 2006 and 2009 and graduating 21 Inuit candidates, the Nunavut Master of Education program was a collaborative effort made to address the erosion of Inuit leadership in the K-12 school system after the creation of Nunavut, Canada's newest territory, in 1999. Delivered to a large extent in short, intensive, face-to-face courses, the program also made extensive use of online supports. This paper outlines the design challenges--geographical, technological, pedagogical, and cultural--that faced the development and delivery of the online portion of the program. It highlights the intersection of the design decisions with the decolonizing principles that framed the program as a whole, the various and varying roles played by the online environment over the course of the program, and the program's contribution to student success.

        "description":"For several years, the government of the western Canadian province of Alberta has drafted policies and conducted research on the problem of populations under-represented in adult education. This Alberta-North and Athabasca University study, funded by the Alberta government's Innovation Fund, uses the advice and educational experiences of northern former and present students, and of other community members, to identify ways of better attracting, preparing, and retaining under-represented populations in northern Alberta communities through provision and training in the use of distance delivery methods. The research reported here commences with a review of the literature to investigate the following: 1) the contribution distance education makes globally to learning access in remote areas (and resulting economic growth for under-served populations); 2) how support is provided to retain isolated students; and 3) the help needed to assist remote students to complete distance programs. Community consultations with social service and education agencies in three communities were conducted in order to obtain their perspectives about what helps to attract and support students to educational programs and the barriers students typically encounter, which might be mitigated by distance methods. Finally, a survey was designed and distributed in 87 Alberta-North communities in northern Alberta and across Canada's Northwest Territories to add perspective to the consultation results.

The demographic situation points to online distance education as a solution to support lifelong learning and to build competence in the region. An overall aim of all university education is what Hans Georg Gadamer calls &quot;Bildung&quot;, what we in Norwegian call &quot;dannelse&quot; and what Richard Rorty has called &quot;edification&quot;. A first problem to be addressed here is that in online distance learning some teachers find that is harder to support the development of the student's voice. Being able to express oneself and to position oneself in a scientific community is vital for a well-educated graduate. Another problem in online education has been the extensive use of writing as a means in the student's learning process. Writing is vital to academic education, but in online courses there is in general a danger of overuse. At the University of Tromso we have tested the web conference tool Elluminate Live. This is a real-time application, integrated in the University's learning management system (LMS), Fronter. The application enables synchronous oral dialogue, simultaneous sharing of texts, and so forth. I present our main experience with the use of Elluminate Live and discuss the extent to which this application has turned out to be helpful in developing the quality of online courses.

A key strategy in relation to this economic crisis is to consider the merger of the four public universities in Iceland and to introduce a much higher engagement with online and open delivery methods of higher education. The Net-University Project was an EU Leonardo-funded initiative to compare approaches to open and distance education in Iceland, Sweden, and Scotland, with additional lessons from Atlantic Canada. In particular, it sought to focus on the transfer of innovation in continuing university education, with particular emphasis on the development and delivery of online higher education courses throughout rural Iceland (i.e., outside of Reykjavik). The partners concentrated on how knowledge and experience about distributed and distance learning models could be transferred between the partner countries and how such models can be integrated into the education system to better support higher education and lifelong learning. There was a particular interest in the practical use of open educational resources (OER) for course design and in the sharing of these course modules among university partners. Some good practice and lessons from OER use in course creation are listed. (Contains 1 footnote, 1 table, and 3 figures.)",

When reinforcement on the second key was discontinued, positively accelerated and linear response patterns resurged on the first key, in the presence of the stimuli previously correlated with the fixed- and variable-interval schedules, respectively. In Experiment 2, resurgence was assessed after temporal patterns were directly reinforced. Initially, responding was reinforced if it approximated an algorithm-defined temporal pattern during trials. Subsequently, reinforcement depended on pausing during trials and, when it was discontinued, resurgence of previously reinforced patterns occurred for each pigeon and for 2 of 3 pigeons during a replication. The results of both experiments demonstrate the resurgence of temporally organized responding and replicate and extend previous findings on resurgence of discrete responses and spatial response sequences.

        "description":"In comparing open and closed economies, researchers often arrange shorter sessions under the former condition than under the latter. Several studies indicate that session length per se can affect performance and there are some data that indicate that this variable can influence demand functions. To provide further data, the present study exposed domestic hens to series of increasing fixed-ratio schedules with the length of the open-economy sessions varied over 10, 40, 60, and 120 min. Session time affected the total-session response rates and pause lengths. The shortest session gave the greatest response rates and shortest pauses and the longest gave the lowest response rates and longest pauses. The total-session demand functions also changed with session length: The shortest session gave steeper initial slopes (i.e., the functions were more elastic at small ratios) and smaller rates of change of elasticity than the longest session. Response rates, pauses, and demand functions were, however, similar for equivalent periods of responding taken from within sessions of different overall lengths (e.g., total-session data for 10-min sessions and the data for the first 10 min of 120-min sessions). These findings suggest that differences in session length can confound the results of studies comparing open and closed economies when those economies are arranged in sessions that differ substantially in length, hence data for equivalent-length periods of responding, rather than total-session data, should be of primary interest under these conditions.

We compared performance in two conditions which varied in terms of whether accurate performance required that responding be controlled jointly by frequency and orientation, or selectively by frequency. Results showed that pigeons learned both category tasks, with average overall accuracies of 85.5% and 82% in the joint and selective control conditions, respectively. Although perfect performance was possible, responding for all pigeons fell short of optimality. Model comparison analyses showed that the General Linear Classifier (GLC; Ashby, 1992) provided a better account of responding in the joint control condition than unidimensional models, but a unidimensional model fitted better for the condition that required selective control by frequency. Our results show that pigeons' responding in a visual categorization task can be controlled jointly or selectively by stimulus dimensions, depending on reinforcement contingencies. However, analysis of residuals confirmed that systematic deviations of GLC predictions from the obtained data were present in both conditions, suggesting that an alternative account of responding in multidimensional category learning tasks may be necessary.

          "Fields, Lanny"],
        "description":"Three experiments used postclass formation within-class preference test performances to evaluate the effects of nodal distance on the relatedness of stimuli in equivalence classes. In Experiment 1, two 2-node four-member equivalence classes were established using the simultaneous protocol in which all of the baseline relations were trained together, after which all emergent relations probes were presented together. All training and testing was done using match-to-sample trials that contained two comparisons. After class formation, the effects of nodal distance were evaluated using within-class preference tests that contained samples and both comparisons from the same class. These tests yielded inconsistent performances for most participants. Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1, but a third null comparison was used on all trials during class formation. Thereafter, virtually all of the within-class probes, for all participants, evoked performances that were consistent with the predicted effects of nodal distance, that is, the selection of comparisons that were nodally closer to the samples. It appears, then, that the establishment of the equivalence classes with a third null comparison induced control by nodal structure of the classes. Experiment 3 demonstrated the generality of these findings with larger classes that contained more nodal separations, that is, three-node five-member classes. Emergent-relations tests conducted immediately after the within-class tests showed the classes to be intact. Thus, the differential relatedness of stimuli in a class or their interchangeability depended on the content of a test trial: within-class probes occasioned responding indicative of differential strength among the stimuli in the class, while cross-class tests occasioned responding indicative of interchangeability of stimuli in the same class.

        "description":"Contemporary behavior analytic research is making headway in analyzing analogy as the establishment of a relation of coordination among common types of trained or derived relations. Previous studies have been focused on within-domain analogy. The current study expands previous research by analyzing cross-domain analogy as relating relations among separate relational networks and by correlating participants' performance with a standard measure of analogical reasoning. In two experiments, adult participants first completed general intelligence and analogical reasoning tests. Subsequently, they were exposed to a computerized conditional discrimination training procedure designed to create two relational networks, each consisting of two 3-member equivalence classes. The critical test was a two-part analogical test in which participants had to relate combinatorial relations of coordination and distinction between the two relational networks. In Experiment 1, combinatorial relations for each network were individually tested prior to analogical testing, but in Experiment 2 they were not. Across both experiments, 65% of participants passed the analogical test on the first attempt. Moreover, results from the training procedure were strongly correlated with the standard measure of analogical reasoning. (Contains 2 tables and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"This paper reports use of sample stimulus control shaping procedures to teach arbitrary matching-to-sample to 2 capuchin monkeys (\"Cebus apella\"). The procedures started with identity matching-to-sample. During shaping, stimulus features of the sample were altered gradually, rendering samples and comparisons increasingly physically dissimilar. The objective was to transform identity matching into arbitrary matching (i.e., matching not based on common physical features of the sample and comparison stimuli). Experiment 1 used a two-comparison procedure. The shaping procedure was ultimately effective, but occasional high error rates at certain program steps inspired a follow-up study. Experiment 2 used the same basic approach, but with a three-comparison matching task. During shaping, the monkey performed accurately until the final steps of the program. Subsequent experimentation tested the hypothesis that the decrease in accuracy was due to restricted stimulus control by sample stimulus features that had not yet been changed in the shaping program. Results were consistent with this hypothesis, thus suggesting a new approach that may transform the sample stimulus control shaping procedure from a sometimes useful laboratory tool to a more general approach to teaching the first instance of arbitrary matching performances to participants who show protracted difficulties in learning such performances.

        "author":["Gorsuch, Greta J."],
        "description":"One challenge for many international teaching assistants (ITAs) is improving their spoken English fluency after arrival in the U.S.A. It may be argued that poor fluency, with its hallmarks of slow speech rate, false starts, and particularly pauses that violate phrasal boundaries, account for the failure of many ITAs to be certified by their institutions to teach undergraduate labs or classes. And, for a variety of reasons, simply being in graduate school in the U.S.A. may not result in ITAs rapidly improving their English, even after a semester or more of specialized ITA courses. This study explores the question of whether an input approach, in addition to a production-oriented ITA preparation approach, will improve ITAs' spoken fluency in post-treatment teaching simulations. In this study, 28 participants in an ITA preparation course engaged in twice-a-week repeated reading (RR) sessions, in which they repeatedly and silently read 500-word basic popular science texts along with an audio recorded model of the text. In this study, ITAs' gains in reading fluency and comprehension were tracked throughout an academic semester for a total of twenty 30-minute RR sessions. In addition, two ITAs' teaching simulation presentations were audio recorded, once at the beginning and once at the end of the fourteen-week course. Changes in speech rate, percentage of grammatically intact pause groups, and percentage of disfluent pause groups were tracked. ITAs' reading fluency and comprehension increased significantly, while the percentage of intact pause groups increased, and the percentage of \"split\" pause groups decreased. While causality between the RR treatments and improvements in ITAs' spoken fluency cannot be strictly stated, a theoretical model of how extensive input may promote speaking fluency is presented, along with specific suggestions on creating input-focused programs for ITAs.

        "description":"Feedback plays an intervention role in the writing process. It is through feedback that writers are guided to achieve negotiated writing goals. Feedback encourages a process of discovery and this plays a developmental role in the writing process. In this paper, we report on three case studies that sought to understand cognitive processes when writers attended to feedback. Three ESL postgraduate students were asked to think aloud while attending to lecturer written feedback. Concurrent verbal protocols were analysed qualitatively using computer assisted data analysis software called Nvivo8. The findings from this study indicate that attending to written feedback is a recursive process. While recursively attending to feedback, the writers planned globally, locally, reflected, and justified. The findings suggest that dialogical type of feedback encourage recursiveness and planning. These are essential for the potential development of a writer. (Contains 1 figure.)",

The study group included 691 students out of 10 schools in Eskisehir. Both Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis were conducted on the data (Burnout stem from school activities, burnout stem from family, feeling of insufficiency in school, lack of interest towards school). A four factor solution was emerged with 26 items. These four factors explain 59 % of the total variance. Factor loadings ranged from 0.42-0.81. Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient for the sub-dimensions ranged from the lowest 0.76 to the highest 0.92. Split-half correlation coefficient for the sub-dimensions ranged from 0.65 to 0.81. The model indices emerged from the Confirmatory Factor Analysis [GFI=0.94, AGFI=0.91, PGFI=0.89, RMSEA=0.07, CFI=0.91; ([chi][superscript 2]=787.6, df=293, p less than 0.01)] indicated that there was a good fit. To establish criterion validity of the scale, &quot;Academic Expectations Stress Inventory&quot; was used. The correlation coefficients between the two scales as well as among the sub-dimensions of the scales varied from the lowest 0.20 to the highest 0.38. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Delinquency has become an import social problem in Turkey, especially in schools. Along with this trend, empirical studies have started to pay attention to delinquent acts in schools. However, most of these studies have mainly focused on the nature and prevalence of the delinquent behaviors. There are limited numbers of studies that explore relationships between school related factors and delinquency among Turkish students. Thus, the main purpose of the present study is to examine how various delinquent behaviors (property delinquency , violent behavior, delinquency in in school and substance use) are related to some school related factors such as school bonds (attachment to teacher and commitment to school), discipline techniques used in schools (coercive and inductive discipline) and victimization in the school. For this, a total of 3742 students from 11 high schools in Izmir were chosen through stratified cluster sampling techniques. The mean age of the sample was 16.8 and percentage of male students was 52. Self-report instruments used in previous studies were mainly adapted to measure school-related variables and various delinquent involvements. Due to the censored nature of dependent variables (delinquent involvements), Tobit regression techniques were used in analysis. The analysis revealed that commitment to school had an effect in the reduction of all kinds of delinquent acts that are assessed in this study. Results also indicated that coercive discipline techniques and victimization in schools were positively related to delinquent involvements regardless of the nature of delinquency. Overall, findings have confirmed that schools should be considered as an important social context along with family, communities or neighborhood that also affect various processes related to delinquency.

In line with the original version, both the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed a five-factor structure, each representing distinct functions of identity formation. Convergent validity of the instrument was proved via bivariate correlations with theoretically comparable scales. Finally, internal consistency coefficients, test-retest values, and item-total correlations demonstrated the reliability of FIS for Turkish use. Overall, the findings suggest that the Turkish version of FIS is a useful instrument to assess the diverse functions of identity among Turkish college students. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

This study examines the relationship between, gender, gender roles, self-esteem and initiating romantic intimacy at emerging adulthood. A total of 256 individuals (148 female and 108 male) completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Bem Gender Roles Inventory (BGRI) and Markers of Starting Romantic Intimacy Scale. In this study, t-test was used to determine whether gender plays a significant role in initiating a romantic intimate relationship, and also variance analysis method was used to determine whether gender roles plays a significant role in initiating a romantic intimate relationship. Besides basic regression analysis was employed to uncover the interaction between initiating a romantic intimate relationship and gender, self-esteem, and gender roles. It was found out that there was gender difference on starting romantic intimacy. Regression analysis shows that self-esteem, gender, and also gender roles were the most important factors for starting romantic intimacy. The findings of the study suggest that there is a statistically significant relationship between starting romantic intimacy, gender, gender roles, and also self-esteem. The results of the research were found parallel with the literature, and also they are discussed with respect to emerging adulthood, gender, self-esteem and cultural factors.",

        "description":"The main purpose of the research was to determine the views of teachers about working conditions working at private teaching institutions for 5 years or less. The research was designed as a phenomenology model. The data were collected by focus group interview technique of qualitative research method. 10 teachers from private teaching institutions working for 5 years or less underwent focus group interview by homogeneous sampling, which is one of purposeful sampling techniques. The video recorded focus group, then interview was deciphered. In the analysis process, descriptive analysis techniques were used. Generally, the participants said that working at private teaching institutions was not their first choice, the working conditions there were very difficult and they affected the teachers negatively in general and despite such conditions, their wages were too low. While talking about the private teaching institutions, the participants used such metaphors as maze, ant home, lacework, carrying water with a bucket, castle, watch, horse race, slavery and workmanship.",

Pisa evaluation studies are helpful to understand the current outcomes of the educational systems and will definitely enhance the quality of future educational policies with the help of comparison between the accomplishments of the rival countries. In this descriptive study, the data regarding Pisa results and country statistics have been obtained from the online OECD publications. It is observed that higher rate of students in Turkey has lower level reading skills, and a small rate of its students can accomplish high level reading skills contrary to the situation in the top-five OECD countries. Great majority of Turkish students lacks of advance skills such as working with abstract ideas, critical thinking, making links with the inferred knowledge with daily experiences. On the other hand, Turkish educational system is below the standards of OE CD countries in terms of educational sources because of lower level finance in education and schools, higher number of students per class and teacher, less amount of teacher salaries, which all parallel to its low level economic wealth. Moreover, Turkish citizens have low level of socio-cultural status with respect to other OECD countries in that most of Turkish students do not attend high school level education, and a great majority of parents, both mothers and fathers, have lower level of education.

        "description":"There are two main aims of this research. The primary aim is to develop a reliable and valid anxiety scale to determine writing anxiety levels of prospective teachers. The secondary aim is to determine what variables explain anxiety levels of students to what extent, by determining whether writing anxiety levels of prospective teachers significantly varied in terms of various variables. The study consisted of 202 junior students from Departments of Classroom Teaching, Elementary School Mathematics Teaching and Turkish Language Teaching at a Turkish university in the spring term of 2008-2009 academic year. The data were collected using Writing Anxiety Scale which was developed by the authors to measure writing anxiety levels of students and personal forms to describe personal traits of the students. The data were analyzed by SPSS 13.00 and LISREL 8.70 package programs. As a result of the exploratory factor analysis, it was found out that there was a single dimension. Besides, 49% of the total variance in the 35-item-scale was measuring was explained by the scale items. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct obtained by exploratory factor analysis. There were not statistically significant correlations between writing anxiety levels of university students and gender and educational background of parents. As a result of stepwise regression analysis, used to determine the predictive variables of writing anxiety levels in terms of personal traits, it was seen that out-of-school writing practice, in-class writing activities by 1-8 grade teachers, amount of time spent watching television, and gender were significant predictive variables and those variables explained only 9.5% of writing anxiety.",

        "description":"Individuals' thoughts and attitudes towards biotechnology have been investigated in many countries. A Likert-type scale is the most commonly used scale to measure attitude. However, the weak side of a likert-type scale is that different responses may produce the same score. The Rough set method has been regarded to address this shortcoming. A likert type attitude scale was evaluated using the rough set method. Randomly selected 60 participants were given a biotechnology attitude scale and their responses to the scale items were examined using the method mentioned above. Participants belonging to a specific group were examined if they might also belong to another group in light of this method. Mathematical values of each sub-dimension and the extent to which a specific group accounts for the total variance in the overall dimension were calculated. Finally, the accuracy of approximation for the high, moderate, low and very low sets are calculated as [alpha][subscript R](Y)=1, [alpha][subscript R](O)=0,8, [alpha][subscript R](D)=0,778, [alpha][subscript R](CD)=1 It means that the moderate and low sets are rough sets. Through reduction of attributes, \"Public awareness of GMO, Ethics of genetic modifications, Ecological impact of genetic engineering and Use of genetic engineering in human medicine\" sub-dimensions were found to be the indispensable sub-dimensions.",

The original scale had been developed by the author and revised based on the results of an exploratory factor analysis. In the present study, the revised scale was given to 564 PreK-12 in-service educators (teachers, school counselors, administrators, etc.) working at schools in a big mid Western city in the US. The scale had 29 Likert-type items intended to measure eight dimensions of the variable (at least three items per dimension). Obtained fit indices indicated a good fit between the data and the hypothesized factor structure. All parameter estimates were acceptable. Since there were no established variables in the literature to serve as criterion variables in the measurement of educators' attitudes toward educational research, data were collected on three variables (years of experience as an educator, research methods courses taken, and use of sources to learn about research findings) predicted to be correlates of this construct. To examine which ones might serve as criterion variables, analyses were performed to correlate these variables with subscale scores from the Educators' Attitudes Toward Educational Research Scale. Regarding the results of these correlational analyses, there was a high level of agreement between the present study and the previous exploratory factor analytic study which also looked at the same correlations, measuring the related variables in the same way as the present study did.

The first presentation included graphic organizers which were presented before reading whereas in the second presentation students were asked to fill the graphic organizer after reading. Five students with mild intellectual disabilities attending a special education classroom in an elementary school located in Ankara were participated in the study. An alternating treatment design was employed to assess differentiated effectiveness of the presentations of graphic organizers. The results of the study showed that four students reported that filling graphic organizers after reading was more effective on improving their ability to recall the similarities and differences of comparison concepts depicted in the compare/contrast texts. However, one student displayed more improvements on recalling the similarities in compare/contrast texts when provided with graphic organizers before reading. Yet, there were no differences between the presentations in improving the student's ability to recall the differences. Both presentations were equally effective for the student.

        "description":"Individuals with disabilities need to learn to control their own behaviors to rank among in the community. Self-management strategies are developed for this purpose. These strategies include antecedent cue regulation, self-instruction, self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self reinforcement. In the literature, there are researches about the effectiveness of self management strategies on teaching various behaviors to individuals with disabilities. In this study 40 single-subject research articles conducted with individuals with disabilities and published in peer-reviewed journals in between 1999-2008 have been examined. Articles primarily have been descriptively analyzed and then examined by use of meta-analysis as the computation of effect-size. Examining the findings of the descriptive analysis, it is found out that the most commonly used strategy is self-monitoring and strategies are mostly used for people aged between 7 and 17, which is referred to as school age. The PND score obtained in the studies that were examined was found as 87.23% on average for the behaviors that were wished to be increased, compared with PZD score an average of 43.96% for the behaviors that were desired to be decreased. According to the PND and PZD scores, it is possible to say that self-management strategies are effective for those behaviors that are desired to be increased, but they are doubtful/unstable in managing behaviors that are desired to be decreased. Findings have been interpreted and discussed by considering the literature and suggestions have been submitted for the implications and future researches. (Contains 4 tables.)",

It can also be used for evaluating existing curricula in terms of coherence. For this purpose, two models that are closely inter-connected called History Education System (Tarih Egitim Sistemi or TES) and History Research System (Tarih Arastirma Sistemi or TAS) are developed using systems approach. TES represents the process of history education. TAS represents the historian's craft. Viability of the framework thus created is demonstrated by applying it to the development of a draft history education programs for all levels; undergraduate, master's and doctoral. Core fields for all these programs, courses which differentiate in terms of depth and coverage depending on the level for each one of the core fields; project based learning/teaching and activity log based assessment that can be applied in many of the courses are described in detail. This work is first for the discipline of history. Moreover, TES and TAS are generic models that can easily be adapted to developing curricula in other social science fields. This work differs from other studies involving the systems approach in Turkey in that it models not only learning/teaching process but also the field of teaching/learning itself, that is history.

The data of the research were obtained by interview method applied to 58 teachers teaching in multigrade classes in 2008-2009 academic year. The data obtained in the research were analyzed and evaluated in accordance with qualitative research methods. In the analysis of the data, Nvivo 7 software has been used. As a result of the research, it has been seen that the teachers of multigrade classes found Social Studies curriculum qualitatively positive. However, it was found out that some kind of defects and difficulties have been encountered concerning skill/acquisitions, content, teaching-learning process, measurement and evaluation aspects, in terms of the implementation of the Social Studies curriculum in multigrade teaching having more different conditions, which was indeed prepared to be used in independent classrooms. In addition, taking into account the views of multigrade classroom teachers, practical suggestions have been made about the changes that can be made in the curriculum.",

This study evaluated texts written by Uzbek origin immigrant students and Turkish students living in Hatay in terms of the use of cohesion devices (ellipsis, conjunctions, lexical cohesion, reference, substitution). Within the participants of the research, 98 immigrants (Uzbek) and 103 Turkish 5th grade students living in Hatay were asked to write a story. These stories were analyzed by means of &quot;Cohesion Level Evaluation Scale&quot; and &quot;Cohesion Problems Inventory&quot;. Students' frequencies of using cohesion devices and the problems encountered in the use of cohesion devices were determined in categorical content analyze. The reliability of codifications was examined with the method of inter-rater reliability. According to the results of the research, no significant difference was found between immigrant and Turkish students in terms of the use frequencies of cohesion devices other than ellipsis. The average use of cohesion devices within each student (paper) are as follows: Ellipsis (15,4), conjunctions (15,4), lexical cohesion (11,2), reference (8,3), substitution (0,2). The study presents examples of reference, ellipsis and conjunctions from the submitted texts to illustrate typical problems experienced by the Turkish and Uzbek groups in using cohesion devices.

The sample of the study consists of 70 students studying at the Department of Turkish teaching in the academic year of 2009 2010. One of the classes was randomly specified as control group (N=34) to which traditional teaching method was applied while the other as test group to which the Jigsaw technique (N=36) was applied. The study was predicated on &quot;Non-equal control group pattern&quot;. Learning styles of the groups were determined by the Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI). Data about their academic success were collected through Success Test for Written Expression (STWE) applied as pre-test and post-test and views of students about Jigsaw I technique were collected through a form questioning students' views (SVF). Then, the results obtained from them were analyzed. It was observed as a result of statistical analyses that there was not a significant variation in favor of the test group in terms of academic success and stability between the test group and the control group in teaching the written expression subject. It was also determined according to the results obtained from the study that the students stated positive views for the Jigsaw I technique.",

Unequaled control group model which is half experimental is used in this research. 1/A section (experimental group) of standard class and 1/B section (control group) of evening class from Turkish Language Teaching Department of Gazi Education Faculty of Gazi University constitute the sample of the research. 60 students participate in the research in total. The data obtained from the result of creative writing activities processed in 10 weeks are evaluated with regard to &quot;The Scale of Story Writing Skill&quot;. It has been revealed that according to scale of story writing skill there is statistically a significant difference between the points [t(29) = -5,172; p less than or equal to 0.05 ] the students got from the post-test in the experimental and the control group. In other words, creative writing activities are more effective than traditional writing education in improving story writing skill. Besides, creative writing activities have a significant effect on content dimension [ t(29) = -3,668; p less than or equal to 0.05 ]; planning dimension [ t(29) =-3, 151; p less than or equal to 0.05 ]; characterization dimension [ t(29) = -5,666; p less than or equal to 0.05]; setting dimension [t(29) =-4,479; p less than or equal to 0.05 ] , and time dimension [ t(29) =-4,471; p less than or equal to 0.05 ] of story structure. According to these results, creative writing activities should be mentioned in Turkish courses and confidence in classroom should be taught in the relevant department of teacher training agencies and preservice teachers should be trained as qualified ones in terms of both practical and theoretical aspects of creative writing.",

In this sense, the city center of Burdur became the population of the study. By inclining towards the sample, composed of randomly selected primary and high school students, it was aimed to determine the factors playing role on the motivation for reading in the eyes of students. To do this, a questionnaire was developed by the researcher. Obtained data were analyzed by the SPSS statistical software. According to the findings, such factors as teachers, family members, friends, books, environment and activities had a diagnostic effect on students in terms of awakening their willingness to read. Another finding is that such factors were mostly effective on primary schools students while less effective on high school students. In terms of gender, factors except for activities and books became more effective on girls than boys. Hence, to lead students to read, books should be given to students as presents by their teacher and parents, they should be good models for them, children should be relied on and given autonomy if they are provided with books catching their interests and to be supported in the process of choosing the right friends.",

Obtained data were analyzed both qualitatively (i. e. inductive analysis) and quantitatively (i. e. Chi-square test). According to the results: (1) 4 main conceptual categories based on the prospective teachers' observations concerning the important acquisitions of fieldworks were identified. (2) 6 main conceptual categories based on the prospective teachers' facilitative suggestions for the application of fieldworks were identified. (3) Significant differences were not discovered between the principal categories of observations and suggestions with regard to the prospective teachers' gender. The study concludes that observation is a powerful research tool in determining, analyzing, and interpreting about prospective teachers' individual perceptions concerning fieldworks as a teaching method. The rationales behind this method are to improve the prospective teachers' communication skills through a broad range of contacts, their own life experiences, and more importantly encouraging their independent thinking.",

The research was carried out in three elementary schools in the city of Kocaeli, which exhibited three different levels of success in the SBS (National Level Determination Exam). The academic achievement test, which was one of the data collection tools of the study, was developed by the researchers and its reliability was found to be 0.85. A Likert-type scale, whose reliability was found to be 0.96, was employed in order to measure students' attitudes towards science. In addition, 14 alternative assessment activities were used in the study, which were developed by the researchers and composed of structural communication grid, diagnostic tree and predict-observe-explain activities. According to the findings of the research, a significant difference was found between the experimental and the control groups with respect to science attitudes and achievement in the favor of the experimental groups.

The type of the experiment they use and the type of their schools are significantly correlated. However, their experiences in teaching, the type of school they graduated, the type of experiment they use are significantly uncorrelated. The teachers from Anatolian high schools mostly choose open ended experiments while the others form vocational and state high schools choose closed end experiments.

In addition to this, the expectations from teachers differed and the need for more qualified teachers also increased. One of the factors affecting the quality of teachers is their motivation. In this research, it was aimed to reveal both demographic and professional profiles of secondary school physics teachers together with factors motivating themselves. General survey model was used in the research. Motivation factors priority order questionnaire was used as a data collecting tool. There were also questions in the questionnaire which determined the demographic and professional profiles of teachers. Motivation factors priority order questionnaire constituted of 6 different motivation factors. The research was performed on 103 physics teachers who were working at public and private high schools in Konya city center and in some districts. The statistical analysis of the research was carried out with SPSS 15 software by using percentage, frequency, Kruskal Wallis H test, and Mann Whitney U test. 80.6 % of physics teachers in the sample were male and the rest was female. The results of the analysis indicated that the most motivating factor for physics teachers was factors related with advantages and the least motivating factor was related with the profession. The interesting and challenging thing here is that the factors &quot;related with profession&quot; were at the sixth and so the final stage. Since factors such as making different lectures, following new source materials, information exchange with colleagues, presence of education technology and growing good students were at the final stage for motivation of teachers, this presents serious challenges in terms of future of teaching profession and growing of rising generation.",

The modelling approach which also includes traditional problem solving is consistent with different values of mathematics. With the recognition of mathematics that has different values with the traditional values, mathematics teacher training programs need to be addressed again. It has been intended to contribute the implementation of the program by examining the profiles of prospective mathematics teachers in the current state and the views for modelling. The profiles and modelling levels of 136 prospective mathematics teachers who study in mathematics teacher training programme at Abant Izzet Baysal University in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 academic years have been analyzed. When the participants' levels of having positivist values and levels of having constructivist values were compared, a significant difference was determined in favor of constructivist values. When the values were analyzed in terms of gender variable, the female participants' levels of having constructivist and positivist values showed a significant difference in favor of constructivist values. Modelling levels were examined in different dimensions, and it was determined significant differences between sub-dimensions. In terms of gender variable, when sub-dimensions of each modelling levels were analyzed, there was no significant difference between female and male prospective mathematics teachers. Also, there was a positive correlation between values and modelling levels among prospective mathematics teachers.",

        "description":"The paper examines the professional training of Principals of secondary schools in Nigeria. The study observes that teaching experience appears to be the major yardstick that is being used currently to promote teachers to the rank of school Principals in the country. After drawing experiences from some other countries on how Principals are trained and appointed, the paper concludes that teaching experience should not be the only yardstick for appointing Principals of secondary schools in Nigeria. As school administrators, the principals need to be formally trained before they assume administrative positions. The paper therefore suggests that the National policy on Education should be amended such that potential principals would attend mandatory leadership courses at the National Institute for Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA) before they assume managerial positions. It further proposed that NIEPA should expand its programmes to provide the opportunities and avenues for such training.",

        "description":"The Bright Futures Scholarship (BFS), Florida's lottery-funded, merit-based scholarship program, has been a source of both praise and criticism since its 1997 inception. Proponents of the scholarship assert the program has achieved the desired goals of making college more affordable for state residents and encouraging the brightest students to attend in-state colleges. Conversely, the BFS program has drawn heavy criticism for providing minority and low-income students with disproportionately fewer scholarships than Whites and high-income students who could have afforded college without the state's financial support. This policy analysis explores four alternatives for Florida policymakers to consider when reexamining the current structure of the BFS program: (1) maintain the status quo; (2) implement flat-rate award amounts; (3) introduce a &quot;blended&quot; program that provides both merit and need based aid; and (4) transform the BFS into a predominately need-based aid program. All four policy alternatives are evaluated based on the policy goals of cost efficiency, distribution equity, and political feasibility. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)",

Second, to examine the influence of teacher input characteristics and teacher perceptions of school culture on out-of-school suspensions. Data was obtained for the 2006-2007 school year from 23 urban public elementary schools in Florida. Using the school as the unit of analysis, data was collected examining student absences and suspensions during the 2006-2007 school year reported by the Florida Department of Education's School Indicators Report. Surveys were administered to examine collaborative leadership, teacher collaboration, unity of purpose, professional development, collegial support, and learning partnership, identified by Gruenert and Valentine (1998) as the six components of the collaborative culture of a school. Surveys also documented teacher input characteristics such as years teaching, percent out of field, and highest degree obtained. Correlation using multiple regression was used to analyze the data. As the Unity of Purpose factor increased, the model predicted that student absences would decrease by 22.56%. In addition, the model predicted that when either the average years of experience for teachers within a school increased or when the Collaborative Leadership factor increased, student suspensions would decrease by 0.413%. and 4.81% respectively.

        "description":"A comparative study was conducted to compare two approaches to engineering design curriculum across different schools (inter-school) and across two curricula &quot;Project Lead the Way and Engineering Projects in Community Service&quot; (inter-curricula). The researchers collected curricula material including handouts, lesson plans, guides, presentation files, design descriptions, problem statements, and support guides. The researchers conducted observations in the classrooms to collect qualitative indicators of engineering/technology reasoning, collect data on the nature of students' questions, how students define problems, and operate within the constraints of a design problem. Observational protocol studies were conducted on students participating in &quot;Project Lead the Way&quot; curriculum programs and with students participating in &quot;Engineering Projects in Community Service&quot; (EPICS). Students were asked to work through an ill-defined problem, in this case the problem of creating a new playground for an elementary school. The data from these protocols were analyzed using a coding process; a list of universal technical mental processes (Halfin, 1973) and a computer program OPTEMP, (Hill, 1997) to accurately record frequency and time of each mental process employed by the students. The data from the protocol results were used to identify common cognitive strategies employed by the students to determine where these students placed greatest emphasis throughout the observational protocol. General findings indicated that participants in the &quot;EPICS-High&quot; program were more solution-driven problem solvers, where the &quot;Project Lead the Way&quot; participants were generally problem-driven as defined by Kruger &amp; Cross (2006). Additionally, the participants in both groups had completed advanced courses in mathematics, very little mathematics was employed (less than 3%) to describe constraints of the problem or predict results of proposed solutions. Over half of the students became fixated at some point on the provided picture. (Smith; Ward; &amp; Schumacher, 1993). This study provides important insight about how students solve ill-defined problems, providing vital information for technology education as it seeks to implement engineering design.

There are a variety of approaches that can be taken, but research also indicates that adhering to a predetermined course of action or model is a significant component towards meeting pedagogical objectives. The development of a Web-based model for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) education has the potential to improve learning through: student generated documentation, ease of access to technical and problem solving strategies, student collaboration, online assessments, and timely feedback. The preliminary study of student development of personal GIS websites suggests that establishing a structure that addresses the various student levels of familiarity regarding website development is required.

Two research questions and a hypothesis were formulated to guide the study. A 35-item questionnaire was developed based on the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) standards on Technical College workshops, and was validated by three experts. Data was collected from 101 administrators, 140 teachers, and 24 workshop personnel randomly sampled and stratified along trades in 19 Government Technical Colleges in North Central Nigeria. Mean was employed to answer the research questions while one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to test the hypothesis using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis. Results revealed that administrators, teachers, and workshop personnel shared similar views on inadequacy of facilities in Technical College workshops. It was therefore recommended that: The private sector should be encouraged to initiate and participate in the provision of facilities using such methods as build operate-and-transfer (BOT), build own-operate and transfer (BOOT) and rehabilitate-operate and transfer (ROT); special intervention funds should be set aside by Government for procurement of workshop facilities to technical colleges, such channels may include Education Tax Fund (ETF) as practiced in Nigeria; Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Parent Teacher Association (PTA), and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) should be asked for support in supplying relevant facilities to the workshops as obtained in some nations; and that a specific percentage of income tax generated annually by the Government should be utilized for provision of workshop facilities in technical colleges.

It is the means to building mutual understanding, encouraging the construction of personal meaning and ensuring engagement. Inquiry requires dialogue. If we value processes of inquiry, then it is at our peril that we ignore the complex issues and aspects of designing and facilitating in online environments for inquiry processes. How do we design online learning experiences that encourage dialogue and a process of inquiry? A phenomenological inquiry using student postings, student interviews and survey data from an online undergraduate course is undertaken to explore the dynamic interrelation between design, facilitation, tools and learning. As part of the analysis, a heuristic device was developed--the \"Map of aspects of dialogical inquiry.\" In this article, this device and the dynamic interrelation between design, facilitation, tools and learning are discussed, and implications for practitioners teaching in online environments are explored.

This examination draws on interview data gleaned from nine university lecturers. These data provide important information about inclusive education practices in higher education institutions generally and, in particular, education faculties. The results of the data analysis indicate that even though all the lecturers self identify as inclusive educators and adopt various inclusive teaching and assessment practices, barriers exist that impede inclusive practice in tertiary settings.

Designed around practical action research and collaborative peer consulting, the SoTL Fellows Program creates a multidisciplinary community of peers who meet approximately monthly (seminar schedule included). Subgroups within the seminar address sequenced questions about research processes and then collaboratively consult with one another as they apply the research processes to their specific projects. The Fellowship year culminates in a presentation of project findings to the University community. The Program is well supported by the Administration. Fellows receive up to $1500 for research and travel. Analysis of 3 cohorts of Fellows showed that 66% of the projects had clear results showing enhanced student learning. The surveyed Fellows affected over 4500 students in 100 courses. Most of the projects emphasized a new teaching approach, new curriculum materials, integrated applications, and active learning. Fifteen projects were presented at conferences and 7 were published in peer reviewed journals to date. Participation in the SoTL Fellows Program is viewed positively in promotion and tenure decisions, with Fellows reporting a variety of intrinsic rewards as well. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)",

Research indicates service projects are beneficial for college students and adults. There is little data investigating developmental differences in how younger versus older participants perceive the service learning process. In this project, older adults joined high school and university students on a ten-day service mission to Panama to provide humanitarian aid. Using both qualitative and quantitative data, participants were assessed on their motivations for volunteering, their belief in a just world, and their emotional experiences from working in a service learning setting. On the Volunteer Functions Inventory, there was no significant difference between the students' and the adults' motivation to volunteer, but as evidenced on the Global Belief Scale, students were more likely to endorse the belief that life is fair and predictable and that people get what they deserve than were the older non-students. The Aids Caregiver Scale indicated younger and older participants reported similar levels of satisfaction in their work on this project. The qualitative analysis involved a paper synthesizing the experience from a strict service learning perspective. Suggestions and recommendations for similar projects are included.",

The purpose was to aid students in the preparation of cash flow statements, a topic that from the student perspective is usually considered fairly difficult. Following the pilot of the module, student responses were collected via questionnaire in order to evaluate their perceptions regarding the WEBLEARN module. Diffusion of innovations theory was utilized as a framework for assessing student responses and to guide further development of modules in other topics within the accounting unit. The results proved to be significant in relation to all four independent variables: relative advantage, compatibility, ease of use, and result demonstrability. The combination of quantitative and qualitative findings indicates that the majority of students formed favourable perceptions regarding the relative advantage, compatibility, and ease of using the module, which further translated into positive intentions regarding prospective use of the module as a learning resource.

Much of the discussion has concentrated on developing best practices in providing support via Language and Academic Support (LAS) programs. However, the main challenge in recent years has focused on integrating disciplinary and language learning. What has been largely missing from the discussion are the views of lecturers and students regarding the strategies they use to develop academic writing in the discipline. This paper addresses this issue. The analysis reveals that academic writing within the disciplines is largely an individual endeavor for both lecturers and their students. Lecturers focus on explaining what skills students are required to demonstrate in their assignments, but students are more concerned with understanding &quot;how&quot; they can develop these skills. The implications are discussed concerning the development of a whole institutional approach for integrating language and disciplinary teaching. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Specifically, we were interested in whether deliberate efforts to integrate social studies and assessment methods courses would facilitate our students' learning compared to when such courses are taught in isolation (traditional instruction). Fifty-nine undergraduate elementary education preservice teachers served as participants. Approximately half received integrated instruction, the other half traditional instruction. In both instructional formats, preservice teachers were required to design and implement interdisciplinary units (i.e., lessons, assessments) during their clinical experience. Examination of interdisciplinary units revealed that preservice teachers receiving integrated instruction outperformed their nonintegrated coursework peers in developing, assessing, and reflecting on interdisciplinary content.",

As a result of the training, students showed an increase in the successful use of research-related skills and a great improvement in their ability to present their findings in English. Students appeared to have a better grasp of their subject matter, to be more at ease, less reliant on their notes, and better able to address their audiences directly. Students' oral presentations not only illustrated a greater ability of students to use appropriate formats and structures in English but also a willingness and ability to adopt new methods of learning. This would seem to suggest that the preference for &quot;rote learning&quot; so commonly attributed to Hong Kong students is indeed the result of expectations and experiences in previous learning situations rather than the intrinsic and inherent characteristics of the learners themselves.

We argue that teaching in interdisciplinary studies rests on movements between different understandings, and that it gives ample opportunities for beneficial learning processes. This does not only apply to interdisciplinary studies. The metaphor of taking a journey can be used to illustrate the learning process and the dimension of personal change associated with moving between different understandings and discourses of knowledge. Some of the questions we will raise are: In what ways can differing disciplinary backgrounds be of help or create a hindrance? What are the specific didactic challenges one faces?

To fill this gap, this paper attempts to provide a framework for promoting noticing through CFTs using three sequenced and interrelated CFTs: (I) \"pre-noticing stage\" that aims at instructing the students on how the feedback task functions and what its purposes are, (II) \"while-noticing stage\" that is based on two interrelated feedback tasks, namely \"contrastive-critical framing\" and \"transformed practice,\" and (III) \"post-noticing stage\" that is aimed at helping students reflect on what they have learned during the entire feedback process. To begin with, the article provides definitions of noticing. It then discusses how noticing and feedback are closely related to facilitate second or foreign language writing learning. In what follows, it discusses how noticing and CFTs complement one another in order to facilitate critical and focused noticing to help students enhance their writing accuracy and fluency. Lastly, the article examines some challenges in promoting noticing through CFTs in an EFL writing classroom. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Testing accommodations are one way to increase access to assessments while maintaining the validity of test scores. This paper provides findings from an exploratory logistic regression analysis of predictors of four accommodations used with students who are deaf or hard of hearing: extended time, test directions interpreted, test items interpreted, and test items read aloud. Predicting factors included state policy, educational setting, teacher perspectives, and student characteristics. The paper discusses implications for assessment policies and practices with students who are deaf or hard of hearing, particularly during an era of accountability reform.

A total of 806 students across four Midwest high schools and middle schools completed the paper version of the survey while at school. Of those students, 130 also completed the same survey online. The goal of utilizing two formats was to examine the validity of the relationship between the responses on the paper version versus the online version. The results indicated that the online SVS was a psychometrically valid instrument. In addition, an important factor emerged, Group Control, that indicated that as the adult administration and teachers allowed one group of students to maintain the behavior of other groups of students, the likelihood of violent behavior, such as bullying and witnessing students being threatened with weapons, increased. In addition, as the Group Control variable increased, so too did the students feelings that they were less safe at school, and that they were more likely to think of ways to make schools safer. The present study indicated that school environment and climate play a critical role in the development of violent behavior. (Contains 10 tables.)",

Pedagogy has a long tradition of providing educational guidance in which there is little differentiation between child and adult education. The two groups of learners are assumed to learn under the same philosophy. Conversely, andragogy, advanced by Malcolm Knowles in the 1970s, is a well-known approach to address the distinct needs of adult learners. Knowles' concept of andragogy has been widely adopted by educators from various disciplines around the world. Andragogy is based upon six assumptions: (a) self-directedness, (b) need to know, (c) use of experience in learning, (d) readiness to learn, (e) orientation to learning, and (f) internal motivation. This paper presented a synthesis of research that discussed the applications of Knowles' andragogy in different settings.",

        "author":["Barker, Trevor"],
        "description":"The recent National Students Survey showed that feedback to students was an ongoing problem in Higher Education. This paper reports on the extension of our past research into the provision of automated feedback for objective testing. In the research presented here, the system has been further developed for marking practical and essay questions and providing automated feedback. Recent research at the University of Hertfordshire was able to show that learners and tutors accept and value our automated feedback approach based on objective tests and Computer Adaptive Testing. The research reported in this paper is an important extension to this work. The automated feedback system developed for objective testing has been extended to include practical testing and essay type questions. The automated feedback system, which can be used within any subject area, is based on a simple marking scheme created by the subject tutor as a text file according to a simple template. Marks for each option and a set of feedback statements are held within a database on a computer. As marks are awarded for each question by the teacher an individual feedback file is created automatically for each learner. Teachers may also add and modify comments to each learner and save additional feedback to the database for later use. Each individual feedback file was emailed automatically to learners. The development of the system is explained in the paper and testing and evaluation with 350 first year (1 final practical test), 120 second year (1 written and 1 practical tests) and 100 final year (1 final practical test) undergraduate Computer Science students is reported. It was found that the time to mark practical and essay type tests was reduced by more than 30% in all cases compared to previous years. More importantly it was possible to provide good quality individual feedback to learners rapidly. Feedback was delivered to all within three weeks of the test submission date. In end of module tests it was very beneficial indeed as it had proven difficult to provide feedback in the past after modules had ended. Examples of the feedback provided are presented in the paper and the development of the system using a user-centred approach based on student and staff evaluation is explained. The comments of staff teaching on these modules and a sample of students who took part in this series of evaluations of the system are presented. The results of these evaluations were very positive and are reported in the paper, showing the changes that were made to the system at each iteration of the development cycle. The provision of fast effective feedback is vital and this system was found to be an important addition to the tools available. (Contains 8 tables and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"The correct grading of free text answers to exam questions during an assessment process is time consuming and subject to fluctuations in the application of evaluation criteria, particularly when the number of answers is high (in the hundreds). In consequence of these fluctuations, inherent to human nature, and largely determined by emotional factors difficult to mitigate, it is natural that small discrepancies arise in the ratings assigned to similar responses. This means that two answers with similar quality may get a different grade which may generate inequities in the assessment process. Reducing the time required by the assessment process on one hand, and grouping the answers in homogenous groups, on the other hand, are the main motivations for developing the work presented here. We believe that it is possible to reduce unintentional inequities during an assessment process of free text answers by applying text mining techniques, in particular, automatic text classification, enabling to group answers in homogeneous sets comprising answers with uniform quality. Thus, instead of grading answers in random order, the teacher may assess similar answers in sequence, one after the other. The teacher may also choose, for example, to grade free text answers in decreasing order of quality, the best first, or in ascending order of quality, starting to grade the group of the worst answers. The active learning techniques we are applying throughout the grading process generate intermediary models to automatically organize the answers still not fixed in homogeneous groups. These techniques contribute to reduce the time required for the assessment process, to reduce the occurrence of grading errors and improve detection of plagiarism. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Research in automated creation of test items for assessment purposes became increasingly important during the recent years. Due to automatic question creation it is possible to support personalized and self-directed learning activities by preparing appropriate and individualized test items quite easily with relatively little effort or even fully automatically. In this paper, which is an extended version of the conference paper of Gutl, Lankmayr and Weinhofer (2010), we present our most recent work on the automated creation of different types of test items. More precisely, we describe the design and the development of the &quot;Enhanced Automatic Question Creator&quot; (EAQC) which extracts most important concepts out of textual learning content and creates single choice, multiple-choice, completion exercises and open ended questions on the basis of these concepts. Our approach combines statistical, structural and semantic methods of natural language processing as well as a rule-based AI solution for concept extraction and test item creation. The prototype is designed in a flexible way to support easy changes or improvements of the above mentioned methods. EAQC is designed to deal with multilingual learning material and in its recent version English and German content is supported. Furthermore, we discuss the usage of the EAGC from the users' viewpoint and also present first results of an evaluation study in which students were asked to evaluate the relevance of the extracted concepts and the quality of the created test items. Results of this study showed that the concepts extracted and questions created by the EAQC were indeed relevant with respect to the learning content. Also the level of the questions and the provided answers were appropriate. Regarding the terminology of the questions and the selection of the distractors, which had been criticized most during the evaluation study, we discuss some aspects that could be considered in the future in order to enhance the automatic generation of questions. Nevertheless the results are promising and suggest that the quality of the automatically extracted concepts and created test items is comparable to human generated ones.

        "description":"The aim of the paper is to present the scientific model and several methods for the expert evaluation of quality of learning objects (LOs) paying especial attention to LOs reusability level. The activities of eQNet Quality Network for a European Learning Resource Exchange (LRE) aimed to improve reusability of LOs of European Schoolnet's LRE service for schools are analysed in more detail. As a pan-European service, the LRE particularly seeks to identify LOs that can &quot;travel well&quot; (i.e., reusable) across national borders and can be used in a cultural and linguistic context different from the one in which they were created. The primary aim is to improve the quality of LOs in LRE. eQNet is doing this by establishing a network consisting of researchers, policy makers, and practitioners (teachers) that develops and applies &quot;travel well&quot; quality criteria to both existing LRE content as well as that to be selected in future from national repositories. The vision driving the LRE is that a significant percentage of high quality LOs developed in different countries, in different languages and to meet the needs of different curricula can be re-used at European level. The main problem of all existing approaches in the area is a high level of the expert evaluation subjectivity. The authors analyse several scientific approaches, theories, methods and principles to minimise the subjectivity level in expert evaluation of LOs quality, namely: (1) multiple criteria decision analysis approaches for identification of quality criteria, (2) technological quality criteria classification principle, (c) fuzzy group decision making theory to obtain evaluation measures, (d) normalisation requirement for criteria weights, (e) scalarisation method and (f) trapezoidal fuzzy method for LOs quality optimisation. The authors show that the complex application of these approaches could significantly improve the quality of expert evaluation of LOs and noticeably reduce the expert evaluation subjectivity level. The paper also presents several examples of practical application of these approaches for LOs quality evaluation for Physics and Mathematics subjects. (Contains 6 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "author":["Levinsen, Karin Tweddell"],
        "description":"In the globalized economies e-permeation has become a basic condition in our everyday lives. ICT can no longer be understood solely as artefacts and tools and computer-related literacy are no longer restricted to the ability to operate digital tools for specific purposes. The network society, and therefore also eLearning are characterized by fluidity and the key competence for social actors in this ever changing e-permeated environment is the ability to cope with change--or Castells' conceptualisation &quot;self-programming&quot;. Castells' theory has influenced international definitions of future key competencies. Both lifelong learning and digital literacy understood as &quot;bildung&quot; have emerged as central for the definitions of and standards for future key competencies. However, definitions and standards only tell us about the desired destination and outcome of digital competence building. They tell us nothing about how we may get there. In the educational system ICT and e-learning are becoming an everyday condition and the basic challenge for the educational system is twofold: 1) The actually making of digital literate and self-programming social actors--students and teachers; and 2) How to develop adequate designs for teaching and learning for that purpose. We need research that aims to describe the phenomenology of acquiring digital literacy and self-programming in order to be able to identify relevant learning objectives and scaffolding. Findings from such studies are expected to be relevant for eLearning scenarios as well as for ICT and designs for learning in general. This paper presents a case study that aimed to explore the phenomenological appearance of self-programming as agency and learning among postgraduate students who participated in a specially designed eLearning workshop in the autumn 2009. The findings relate to both the individual and collaborative barriers and proactive strategies that come into play among the students. Drawing on the findings, it is argued that the presented workshop design contributes to the networked society's design for ICT, teaching and learning, as the design--at least for this small group of students--have proved to support the development of digital self-programming as a sustainable competence. In the autumn 2010 the study will be expanded to a larger group of students. (Contains 6 figures and 1 table.)",

        "description":"Nowadays, Web based platforms are quite common in any university, supporting a very diversified set of applications and services. Ranging from personal management to student evaluation processes, Web based platforms are doing a great job providing a very flexible way of working, promote student enrolment, and making access to academic information simple and in an universal way. Students can do their regular tasks anywhere, anytime. Sooner or latter, it was expected that organizations, and universities in particular, begin to think and act towards better educational platforms, more user-friendly and effective, where students find easily what they search about a specific topic or subject. Profiling is one of the several techniques that we can use to discover what students use to do, by establishing their user navigation patterns on Web based platforms, and knowing better how they explore and search the sites' pages that they visit. With these profiles Web based platforms administrators can personalize sites according with the preferences and behaviour of the students, promoting easy navigation functionalities and better abilities to response to their needs. In this article we will present the application of Markov chains in the establishment of such profiles for a target eLearning oriented Web site, presenting the system we implemented and its functionalities to do that, as well describing the entire process of discovering student profiles on an eLearning Web based platform.

        "description":"Assessment surveys of students are often conducted in order to evaluate online learning activities. Most surveys measure responses to questions which are based on students' subjective impressions. The purpose of this study is to examine participants' assessments made during the transitional phase in an online learning environment which includes blended and fully online courses at a Japanese national university. Students were enrolled in two-unit Master's or Bachelor's degree courses which were taught by the same professor. The total number of students with valid survey data was 184 (92 Masters, 67 Bachelors for the blended learning course and 25 Bachelors for the fully online course). A survey questionnaire consisting of 10 questions measured the self-assessments of students' online learning experiences. Three factors were extracted. There are no significant differences in all factor scores between the beginnings and the ends of the courses. These results show the coherence of students' assessments during the course. The correlation coefficients of the first factor scores (e-learning evaluation) between the beginnings and the ends of the courses are not high, however (Masters: r=0.35, Bachelors for blended learning: r=0.46, and Bachelors for fully online: r=0.33). Therefore, some participants have changed their evaluations between the two surveys. When the differences in factor scores from the initial and final surveys are compared between students who rated the course highly at the beginning (high raters) and students who did not (low raters), the scores for the high raters decrease and the scores for the low raters increase. Also, the relationships between students' transitions and the metrics of their behaviour were investigated. (Contains 10 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"Improve students' ability to link knowledge with real life practice, through enhancing children or teenagers' ability to think critically by way of making observations, posing questions, drawing up hypotheses, planning and carrying out investigations, analysing data and therefore improve their decision making is an educational challenge. Learning through sports can be effective for developing life skills because sport has a potential to contribute over a wide range and is a discipline that most children like. The constructions of real situations or &quot;Problems&quot; must achieve and incorporate certain aspects such as (a) encourage curiosity, (b) be perceived by students as relevant to their personal goals, (c) represent a motivated challenge, (d) stimulate group collaboration for older students, (e) technological equipment as a way of support, to motivate the learning process, and (f) demonstrate how simple scientific concepts can improve everyday activities. The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate the usefulness of the representative tasks created by a systematic integration of approaches (electronic and non-electronic devices) with interactive situations. Four tasks were applied to 140 children between 6-10 years old at elementary school level. The tasks were constructed considering the follow proposals: (1) promote the benefit of physical activity and (2) explore some science concepts using sport. To evaluate the process effectiveness, two groups were formed, group A was submitted to a more theoretical explanation of the concepts and group B was exposed to problem solving through sport situations. Data were analysed by using quantitative methods. Results show that when children participate in an active way they are more motivated, and the use of their own movement or body to resolve a problem (with electronic devices) contributes for knowledge acquisition by adapting their actions and looking for the best window of possibilities to solve the task situation. Further and longitudinal studies are recommended to consolidate the results. (Contains 3 tables and 7 figures.)",

        "description":"Research methods modules have become a core component of a range of nursing and allied health professional educational programmes both at pre-qualifying, undergraduate level and at post-qualifying and Masters' level, in keeping with requirements of professional bodies. These courses are offered both on a full time basis and part time for qualified practitioners working in the field accessing continuous professional development (CPD). Evaluation of these courses suggests that some students find research methods challenging to understand and the pace of sessions demanding, and has highlighted a need for additional ways to support learning and teaching. There are a number of existing electronic resources relating to research methods accessible to students via the internet, which could help to support learning and teaching in this area and meet the wide range of learning styles among students. However, many are not specific to health research. In addition, the quality of content can be variable and use/accessibility unpredictable. This, combined with the need for innovative ways to engage interest in research methods, suggested the need for a new electronic resource for health research, for use within the context of a classroom taught course. The process of developing an interactive resource incorporating a narrative element is described. A narrative approach recognises the power of story in capturing interest and transferring information and offers scope for imagination and intrigue within learning. A story of two fictional health practitioner characters working in a local health centre was created to weave around research methods theory. Interactive elements such as question-and-answer tasks, audio extracts, games and interactive graphics were added to offer varied and stimulating ways of presenting material to meet a range of learning styles. The resource also incorporates a number of self-assessment opportunities to reinforce learning. The use of voices heard in realistic scenarios arising in the health centre anchors learning in everyday practice aiming to help students appreciate the need for evidence and the value of research understanding.",

        "description":"Metaphors are figures of speech in which a word or phrase that denotes a certain object or idea is applied to another word or phrase to imply some similarity between them. Due to their ability to make speaking and writing more lively and interesting, metaphors have always been popular among students. While metaphors provide significant enhancement of contexts and build upon the sense of community, they can limit the boundaries of the communication between students and teachers. In order to carry out student oriented courses, teachers ought to consider the metaphors students use. In an effort to understand and fill in this communication gap, the authors of this paper have initiated a study that aimed to drive out the e-education students' metaphors in order to suggest a vision for future e-courses. The authors have designed the &quot;E-Education Metaphor Analysis Survey&quot; that comprised 35 items and captured data about e-education students' metaphors. The questionnaire was posted on Surveymonkey.com and was distributed to e-education students in two countries: Turkey and Cyprus. 352 students filled the questionnaire. The answers revealed that the metaphors students use are influenced by their way of life, their personal characteristics, their educational background and their feelings. Internet was the most common metaphor used for e-education. A very interesting fact was that 47% of the students considered E-Student to be equivalent to &quot;rich students' education&quot; and that the term recalled them the metaphor &quot;richness&quot;. Although there were many research studies on common metaphors and their impact on e-education, there were no studies in the literature about eLearning metaphors. This paper presents an innovative approach that focuses on 7 key research questions and represents a first step of a more detailed future project undertaken by the authors.

This ethnographic study examines the work of six secondary science teachers in Northern Ontario, Canada, as they engage in an action research project focused on merging environmental education in their science lessons. Over the course of five months the teachers examine and discuss their views and their professional development related to the project. In the place of definitive conclusions, six propositions relating the work of secondary science teachers to environmental education, form the basis for a discussion of the implications of the study. The implications are particularly relevant to secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, where the embedding of environmental education in science studies has been mandated. (Contains 1 table.)",

To understand the challenges and difficulties of the practice of inquiry practical work, this study particularly aims to understand how pre-service teachers' understandings of inquiry and practical work have been shaped in educational and social contexts in Korea and later how their views and willingness could be developed through redesigning and practicing textbook activities. 25 third-year students in an elementary science methods course in Korea participated in the study. Mixed methods including questionnaires and reflective discussion and writing were employed for data collection. The pre-service teachers expressed their ideas and difficulties of inquiry approach in their everyday classroom conditions and social situation and thus unwillingness to attempt its practice. Throughout the study, they gradually overcame their resistance and reluctance toward inquiry and practical work and develop willingness and motivation to practice in everyday science classrooms. This study further suggests need for thorough examination on teachers' situated contexts for developing ways of inquiry-based practical work. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

This study adopts a quasi-experimental approach to evaluate the learning of two groups of students after completing a nine-week semester syllabus. Aided by ANCOVA data, we probe the processes of the students' chemistry learning, its effectiveness and their attitudes. The result analyses verify that our ICT-integrated environmental learning has a more significant effect on the students' learning performance. Therefore, it is our goal to design an effective approach for upgrading students' cognizance and learning attitudes. The results obtained from our ICT-integrated environmental learning when compared with other chemical experimental results show the same positive and scientific perspective for academic research.

        "description":"Knowing &quot;what do I know&quot; and thinking about &quot;how do I learn&quot;, that is metacognition, is an important element in learning. The Finnish curriculum points out metacognition in the choice of the studying methods. The methods should help the students to become aware of their own learning, to develop better learning strategies, and skills to apply the strategies in new situations. In this qualitative case study the metacognition of Finnish sixth graders (N = 19) was studied in a virtual learning environment, ENO--Environmental Online. Pupils' metacognitive knowledge and skills were studied in one ENO course. The aim was to describe what and how pupils monitor in their learning processes. It was found that 11-year-old sixth graders possessed declarative and procedural metacognition, and also some conditional metacognition. In this study, the social component of learning was especially emphasized. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate what Greek secondary school students (grades 8 and 11) believe about the greenhouse effect and climate change. A total of 626 students completed a closed-form questionnaire consisting of statements regarding the causes, impacts and solutions for this global environmental issue. The possible influence of three factors--i.e. educational level, gender and previous participation in Environmental Education  extracurricular programs--on students' ideas was examined. The results suggest that eleventh graders were much better informed than eighth graders although some of the misconceptions reported in the literature (such as the cause-effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and ozone layer depletion) persist, irrespective of educational level. Students have fairly clear ideas of impacts while they seem to be somewhat confused about solutions and especially causes. Among the possible explanations of these trends, the logical sequence of physical consequences and students' difficulty in recognizing causes that presume specific scientific knowledge are emphasized. In addition, the role of information sources, especially television which emerged as the dominant source, is discussed. Finally participation in Environmental Education programs appears to be a critical factor since it has clearly influenced students' ideas in a positive way. (Contains 4 tables and 3 figures.)",

Five questions were asked of students and interviews were used to collect data. The interviews were conducted with 12 students, four students from each grade, after they finished the formal courses related to the particulate nature of matter. The results show that the understanding level of students in all grades about the microscopic properties of matter was quite low. They have little knowledge of or alternative conceptions about the microscopic properties of the particles such as the order of the particles, spaces between particles, the number of particles in different phases, the size of particles and the movement of the particles. And also, progression of students' conceptions on the particulate nature of matter is multifaceted. In addition, it was also determined that students have trouble connecting science knowledge to their daily-life experiences. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "author":["Broom, Catherine"],
        "description":"This paper argues that environmental destruction arises from a discourse rooted in Western Economic and Scientific Theory. This discourse artificially separates individuals from our natural world and argues that competition and utilitarian actions are beneficial to society. It is however, a discourse that is taking us to a Shakespearean tragic end: it is resulting in actions that actively harm our natural world, as all too familiar statistics of environmental damage make clear. It is a discourse that does not match our underlying physical reality, which is why calls for Environmental reform \"within\" this discourse will not be effective. Hearing about global warming, deaths caused by hunger every two seconds, and the extinction of plants and animals on a scale never seen before can be enough to envelop us in a sense of hopelessness: we are headed, it seems, for an inevitable tragic ending. However, Shakespeare makes clear that this is not necessary the case. We are not yet at our end; we are yet still storying ourselves. We can thus rewrite a better ending by shifting ourselves into a Shakespearean comedy. The potential lies in our discourse which is not truth, but a contingent creation. After describing these ideas in more detail, this paper goes on to present the parameters of a new Ecological discourse rooted, like Shakespeare's Comedy, in care and humanity that dovetails with our natural world and provides for hope through transformed consciousness. It concludes with recommendations on how this new discourse can be spread and taught in schools. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Here the model is extended to incorporate teachers' perceived usability and self-efficacy measures toward the technologies they are currently using. The authors administered a survey to K-12 teachers in two rural school districts in Virginia, and 99 teachers responded. We then analyzed the responses with both reliability statistics and general linear modeling techniques. The results indicated that the incorporation of perceived usability into the TAM explained more variance and was more influential to TAM elements than its absence, thereby supporting the importance, positive influence, and necessity of evaluating usability when investigating educational technology acceptance and usage behavior. Furthermore, the study found teachers' technology self-efficacy (TSE) was more beneficial to the TAM than their computer self-efficacy (CSE); however, this impact might vary for the evaluations of different populations and technologies.

These applied programs for practitioners require a traditional dissertation based on rigorous research that address problems of practice. This qualitative case study explores how CSU doctoral faculty and program directors conceptualize the purpose and nature of the applied dissertation and the professional and institutional factors that shape their views. It is important to document program norms at this critical early stage to guide improvements at these and other new Ed.D. programs and to contribute to the ongoing debate. Interviews and document review revealed mixed evidence, with some programs stressing scholarly rigor similar to a Ph.D. and others advocating a more relevant, practitioner-oriented approach, such as esummaries of dissertations geared toward educators at the research site. Participants agreed, &quot;We are still feeling our way&quot; regarding dissertation expectations, and greater collegial deliberation is needed. State legislation, accreditation requirements, faculty's own doctoral experience, and other factors tend to reinforce the status quo and inhibit the development of applied approaches. Implications for practice include facilitation of faculty dialogue and consensus-building around visions of the applied dissertation within and across Ed.D. programs.",

        "description":"NIMBYism, the popular and short form for \"Not In My Back Yard\", describes the resistance and outright opposition by residents, either within a distinct place such as a neighbourhood, or, more broadly, in a larger civic area right up to a town or city level, against some planned nearby facility, service, or changed land use. NIMBYism is also about people's more extensive relation to the world of change, and their understanding of the wider places in which they move. It is an existential issue touching on the ways people find meaning in the world. As such it is an ethical issue connected to choices which are often less about care for others then one's ability to consume. It is tied into the integrated nature of people's civic, economic and environmental obligations. In this article, the author talks about environmental engagement and the problem of the \"Not In My Back Yard\" syndrome. He first describes the historic roots of NIMBYism and the contemporary forces in continuing NIMBYism. He then offers solutions for overcoming NIMBYism.",

        "description":"University faculty is typically evaluated on their teaching, service and scholarship. Recent literature, faculty comment and legal rulings have called for the inclusion of collegiality as a fourth evaluation category. Collegiality may be thought of as any extra-role behaviour that represents individuals' behaviour that is discretionary, not recognized by the formal reward system and that, in the aggregate, promotes the effective functioning of the educational organization. There is not professoriate agreement about the inclusion of collegiality in faculty evaluations. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) recommended against including collegial behaviours in faculty evaluations stating that the inclusion could hinder academic freedom by not allowing for dissent. Other critics have stated that the construct of collegiality is amorphous which prevents the creation of an effective tool available to evaluate collegial behaviour. This paper suggests that both of these concerns could be reconciled by delineating and validating behavioural indicators of collegiality. The delineation would allow faculty to reject any behaviours that threaten academic freedoms and add behavioural precision to the construct. The indicators could provide a basis for an effective tool for use in job descriptions and faculty reviews. Indicators were derived from education evaluation and organizational literature and reviewed for validation by a national random sample of 740 Research University I and II professors. A list of 27 indicators of collegiality were subsumed under five organizational categories and compiled for use. (Contains 2 tables.)",

He asserts that technology, and it's role in teaching, has been evolving throughout recorded history. Technological change is not new; if there is any significant difference in the past fifteen years, it is simply the rate of change, not the existence of change. At the same time, rate does matter, especially when the changes come so quickly within a human lifespan. While the learning capacities of the human brain have not changed in the past fifteen years, this does not mean that teaching can or should remain static--and trying to sort out what to change, and what not to, has been an on-going journey for the author. To understand this journey (which has been shared by many others involved in teaching), the author describes his personal experiences. He highlights a few examples drawn from his own experiences, in the hope that they may help others who struggle to sort out the role of technology in their own teaching.",

To teach creatively and to explore and shape knowledge amidst vast technological changes is the test of contemporary educational success. Part of that test involves the protracted assault on the liberal arts in the presence of transformational information technology, an increasingly competitive global economy and the neoliberal market mentality. Liberal arts defenders have confronted disparaging critiques with three basic types of argument: autonomy (the liberal arts are inherently valuable); service (the liberal arts support vocational training); and complementarity (the liberal arts properly balance marketable skills). A fourth position is that humanity's precarious position in dangerous times provides the liberal arts' principal rationale: The liberal arts are essential for ecological sustainability, social survival, the future of our species.",

Some of the recommendations made were the need to have targeted employment equity plans that aim to increase representation of quality employees of diverse backgrounds by instituting measures that provide needed understanding and support of employees, particularly racialized leaders. Increasing recruitment efforts and better training hired managers to conduct and supervise staff of various backgrounds was also another general recommendation articulated.",

The author supposes that in some sense professor Daley may be right. Professor Daley, however, seems to mean something more specific. He is interested in college and university education, which is more problematic. When thinking about student retention, the author argues that it is possible to focus on the individual student. This is something that Professor Daley does splendidly in his work with students. He and his colleagues really do help students to change their own lives, to become focused, attentive and thoughtful in their efforts to define and achieve meaningful goals. Here, the author offers a complementary set of concerns. In addition to looking at the individual student and risking the problem of taking the nature of college programs and the designated role of official education in the perpetuation of the fundamental structures of social reproduction and control, the author contends that it is important to see education in a larger context. While it is important for students to reform themselves, there is at least as much to be done in interrogating and redesigning the society to which they are being asked to adapt and into which they are expected to integrate.",

        "description":"North Americans have had a lengthy and often one-sided relationship with Great Britain. Long after the waning of the British Empire and the apex of Britain's exercise of global political and economic hegemony, its cultural influence remains strong. Beyond the commercial successes in the box office and the bookstore, there is a much more immersive, even fetishistic and nostalgic, preoccupation with British culture, texts, and worldview within North American society, as well as other parts of the world. Described as anglophilia, or &quot;Masterpiece Theatre Culture,&quot; its presence in North America is not wide, but its influence on those who exercise and maintain the traditionally dominant ideology has been significant, especially within the realms of economic and political power and academia. Anglophilia can be characterized by its adoration of the class system in Britain, in particular, the upper classes and their values. It is a form of leisure which is both consumptive and performative. As an antimodernist tendency it creates nostalgia for an English past, typically a genteel one.",

        "description":"Makeover shows are ideal sites from which to examine mediated images of the individual and the cultural values imparted through program viewing. The author ventured to investigate the interpellation of viewers and the decoding of the messages and ideology of the television program \"What Not to Wear\" (WNTW), a popular weekly makeover program that focuses on the physical appearance of its \"ambushed\" victims. WNTW speaks to viewers as learners with \"rules\" on how to dress for a better appearance, but it also carries messages and implications of the necessity to improve oneself, along with strict definitions of gender correctness. Do viewers recognize the hegemonic messages of prescribed notions of gender and acceptable appearance, or do the rituals of the program disguise them as natural parts of the narrative so as to desensitise viewers to the forces at play? In order to answer these questions the author undertook an exploration of viewer participation as the program was both watched and discussed, listening to feedback and impressions of a group of 6 women, during the airing of WNTW. Through these observations and the author's own participation in the viewing of the program, she was able to explore the implications of WNTW for a particular audience, examining the meaning taken from the experience, both overt and suggestive.",

AMES is a high-performing Title One STEM early college high school in Salt Lake City. Teachers learned that a key factor in moving students from aspiration to achievement is mentoring. The NSF program and other AMES campus efforts, the required AMES community-based internship program, opportunities with mentors, role models, and supportive adults in STEM fields prove to be turning points and driving forces in the lives of aspiring AMES students.

        "description":"Educators and employers increasingly acknowledge the value of intercultural competence. While most higher education institutions consider these skills as important outcomes for their graduates, few have specifically addressed the means by which to measure the wide variety of results. Having and using intercultural assessment tools will allow educators to understand and measure the effectiveness and outcomes of their initiatives and will also aid them in developing appropriate interventions and responses at a variety of levels. There are several instruments that are specifically designed for the assessment of intercultural sensitivity or competence of students, faculty, or staff. Five of the most common instruments appropriate for use in higher education institutions are: (1) the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI); (2) the Cross-Cultural Adaptability Inventory (CCAI); (3) Cross-Cultural World-Mindedness Scale (CCWMS); (4) Intercultural Sensitivity Inventory (ISI); and (5) the Assessment of Intercultural Competence (AIC). The IDI and CCAI are two commercially available tools that have dominated the research landscape in recent years. The latter three instruments represent the emerging non-commercial sector. In this article, the author offers a review of the purpose, application, availability, reliability, and scoring of each of these assessment tools.",

A graphing calculator, or spreadsheet, with appropriate knowledge of how to use it, can be an empowering tool to help create a more equitable situation or circumstance. Given the proper technology tool, one may find it easy to calculate a correct payment and a remaining mortgage balance respectively. This article presents stories that illustrate how technology, together with relevant mathematics knowledge, can help all consumers make more informed financial decisions. Equity requires that all students have opportunities to learn the mathematics of compound interest in high school mathematics courses and to learn how to use today's commonplace technologies to apply this important mathematical knowledge to their own finances over the course of their lives. The authors point out that if teachers want school mathematics courses to prepare their students for life in the real world they need to include the useful and simple technologies that allow them to succeed.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Congressional Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering (CEOSE) have been assigned to work together in an attempt to broaden the diversity of the U.S. STEM workforce across the past three decades. As diversity continues to increase among the U.S. population and since many STEM professionals are nearing retirement, this initiative has never been more important for the economic success of the country. With the U.S. not being the leading country in science and mathematics according to measures such as the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), one important strategy is to direct the attention of the NSF and CEOSE to data and trends related to under-represented students participating in advanced high school STEM programs. The authors suggest exploring programs that allow under-represented students to overcome issues linked to educational underachievement, including socioeconomic status, cultural trends, and awareness of STEM opportunities and career fields.

The schools are clustered in the Midwest, South, and Southwest, and for brevity, references to these institutions will employ state names only. Diversity at most of the state STEM schools is understood broadly to encompass inclusion by ethnicity as well as by region, socioeconomic status, and gender. Specific initiatives are tailored to underrepresented targets, while general strategies such as field visits apply to constituencies at large.

Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 177 undergraduate university students (89 males, 88 females). Key benefits observed include note-taking activities, in-class laptop-based academic tasks, collaboration, increased focus, improved organization and efficiency, and addressing special needs. Key challenges noted include other student's distracting laptop behaviours, instant messaging, surfing the web, playing games, watching movies, and decreased focus. Nearly three-quarters of the students claimed that laptops were useful in supporting their academic experience. Twice as many benefits were reported compared to challenges. It is speculated that the integration of meaningful laptop activities is a critical determinant of benefits and challenges experienced in higher education classrooms. (Contains 6 tables.)",

        "description":"Generation is often used to explain and rationalize the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in higher education. However, a comprehensive review of the research and popular literature on the topic and an empirical study at one postsecondary institution in Canada suggest there are no meaningful generational differences in how learners say they use ICTs or their perceived behavioural characteristics. The study also concluded that the post-secondary students at the institution in question use a limited set of ICTs and their use is driven by three key issues: familiarity, cost, and immediacy. The findings are based on focus group interviews with 69 students and survey responses from a random sample of 438 second year students in 14 different programs in five schools in the institution. The results of this investigation add to a growing body of research that questions the popular view that generation can be used to explain the use of ICTs in higher education.

        "description":"A qualitative research project was conducted to test the viability of augmenting an e-learning program for workplace learners using mobile content delivered through smart phones. Ten learners taking a six week web-based e-learning course were given smart phones which enabled them to access approximately 70% of the course content, in addition to having access to the full course via a standard e-learning website. Mobile content was provided in a variety of forms, including text, audio and video files, a mobile multiple-choice quiz website, and links to streaming videos. Study participants who were regular users of mobile phones found the mobile learning materials to be user-friendly, offering increased convenience and flexibility. Use of the mobile content tended to increase as learners spent more time in their day away from locations where Internet-linked computers could be found. Video was found to be the most effective means of presenting content, followed by audio and text. The most promising role of mobile learning appears to be to augment rather than replace e-learning or blended learning. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)",

        "description":"Computer-aided design (CAD) software and other product life-cycle management (PLM) tools have become ubiquitous in industry during the past 20 years. Over this time they have continuously evolved, becoming programs with enormous capabilities, but the companies that use them have not evolved their design practices at the same rate. Due to the constant pressure of bringing new products to market, commercial businesses are not able to dedicate the resources necessary to tap into the more advanced capabilities of their design tools that have the potential to significantly reduce both time-to-market and quality of their products. Taking advantage of these advanced capabilities would require little time and out-of-pocket expense, since the companies already own the licenses to the software. This article details the work of a small research team working in conjunction with a major turbine engine manufacturer endeavoring to make better use of the underutilized capabilities of their design software. By using the scripting language built into their CAD package for design automation, knowledge-based engineering applications, and efficient movement of data between design packages, the company was able to significantly reduce design time for turbine design, increase the number of feasible design iterations, increase benefits from relational modeling techniques, and increase the overall quality of their design processes.

Photovoltaic solar panels are now being manufactured via various methods, and different printing processes are being incorporated into the manufacturing process. Screen printing has been used most prevalently in the printing process to make solar cells, but some companies have used the offset web press type methods to put material onto foil; they also have created solar cells with inkjet printing. The printing of solar cells has helped to reduce manufacturing costs in most cases, and it also has increased the various applications in which solar power both is and can be used. Many more options for photovoltaic solar panels are available, and not simply the traditional ones that are often placed on rooftops. Such a variety of solar panels are partially to the result of the implementation of suitable printing processes during the production of these cells.",

There is a discussion of study findings and research limitations and suggestions for researchers and future research. Yoga appears to be an effective clinical intervention for anxiety and depression. However, more rigorous research needs to be completed to further support using yoga in mental health treatment planning. This article concludes with practical suggestions and implications for mental health professionals interested in using yoga.",

The findings indicate that the majority of students favored the instructor's provision of e-feedback. From their perspectives, the feedback was helpful, immediate, and convenient, allowing them to know whether they were &quot;on the right track&quot;, encouraged them to think, enhanced their learning through reflections and corrections, and promoted their time management and writing skills.

Our results are going in the desired direction. The ability to decide and make inductive inferences was improved, and this improvement was also seen in argumentation, although indirectly. In the future we must therefore improve our interventions in all factors, but in particular those referring to induction and problem-solving. Much remains to be done from the procedural point of view, but the preliminary results are very promising and we are convinced that our initiative has a good conceptual grounding.

In this case study, mini-lectures in combination with active-learning activities were evaluated as strategies to promote a culture of learning and participation in a required botany course. These activities were designed to develop critical-thinking skills, i.e. Bloom's synthesis, application, and analysis. Student attitudes toward learning, participation, and class activities were assessed with feedback surveys following each activity, at the beginning with a pre-survey and at the end of the semester with a retrospective survey. Students identified concept maps, problem-solving exercises, and the categorizing grid as helpful to their learning. Based on instructor observations, students were especially engaged in activities that allowed them to demonstrate creativity and resourcefulness. Based on the retrospective survey results, students were more conservative in their perception of personal critical-thinking skills at the end of the semester, which may be a reaction to the challenges in developing critical-thinking skills. The incorporation of mini-lectures with class activities helped to promote student engagement in the classroom and thus, was a positive instructional strategy. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"The European Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students (ERASMUS) supports students to pursue temporary periods of study in other European universities. During the academic year 2007/08 the UK received 15, 975 ERASMUS students. Although much research exists about the experiences of international students less attention has been given to the specific disciplines of study and the ways this might mediate the experience. With this in mind this paper is based on a piece of work currently in progress with ERASMUS students from Poland who have engaged in an exchange onto the final year of a UK Psychology degree course. Observations are made about the relative compatibility of Psychology in Poland and Britain by considering the course structure, curriculum and modes of assessment. Interview data is drawn on to explore the students' accounts of their experiences of studying Psychology in the UK. Findings indicate that that there are some contrasting pedagogical and epistemological areas within the two systems which make integrating them a challenge for students. It is suggested that flexibility is required in order to better accommodate the students prior learning experiences. (Contains 1 table.)",

It was the researcher's expectation that group work, would provide a means of reducing cognitive load (Kirschner, Sweller & Clark, 2006) and encouraging on task behaviour (Wentzel & Watkins, 2002). This would result in a positive impact on students engagement with, and understanding, of introductory material necessary for progressing on to more complex issues covered at Level 5 of a psychology course. The implication of these research findings on future group work and other aspects of teaching practice are discussed. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "author":["Ruggeri, Kai"],
        "description":"Statistics is one of the most common topics across disciplines and levels of study. This is mainly due to a rise in need for students to apply analytical skills in almost any academic area or profession. The statistical component of academic programmes is considered critical, and it is listed as one--if not the--focal point of higher education. Lessons learned by researchers in the teaching of statistics reveal much about the variety of obstacles faced by lecturers and students, such as statistics anxiety, negative attitudes, deficits in maths backgrounds, and expectations. To this end, Batanero (2004) expressed the need for continued work on identifying and addressing these problems explicitly. This particularly included distinguishing statistics from maths and learning more about the nature of issues in statistics education across disciplines. Common goals from published work on teaching statistics classes include overcoming obstacles presented by anxieties, beliefs, and negative attitudes toward statistics. A limited but growing amount of work has been done to confront each of these and characterise the affect on learning and applying ways to address problems in teaching statistics. In this article, the author presents results that were selected from a comprehensive series of studies of statistics education in undergraduate psychology. The main focus of the overarching study was to determine the nature of statistics anxiety and attitudes toward statistics by using multiple measurements and analyses.

        "description":"When teaching at A-level, educators often present a model of psychology that does not extend beyond the confines of the specification. However, sometimes not only is it possible to provide insight into other areas of psychology, it provides a novel way of understanding a concept included in the specification itself. By extending student's knowledge into other areas of psychology teachers offer them an opportunity to explore research extending their knowledge into degree level psychology, and outside of the fairly strict paradigm approaches taught at A-level (cognitive, behavioural, etc.). In this article, the author describes the use of the ultimatum game, a simple one-shot two player game, to teach economic theories of relationship maintenance to A-level students. By using the game theoretic expectation for the ultimatum game alongside the experimental result, teachers can provide an analogy for teaching concepts including the social exchange and equity theories of relationship formation and maintenance.",

This paper describes an action research project which examined employability skills within a psychology department's curriculum. The first cycle involved conducting a curriculum audit, focus groups and a survey of psychology undergraduates' views on employability. Analysis of the findings suggested a strong focus on development of generic graduate skills, such as communication, IT and working with others, whilst students had difficulty in recognising the applicability of these skills beyond an educational context. Furthermore, examples of explicit career development planning were minimal in both module information documentation and undergraduates' accounts. After a process of evaluation and reflection, the second cycle involved embedding employability skills into the psychology curriculum. The process is described along with discussion on methodological issues and the benefits and challenges of embedding employability in a curriculum. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Forty-seven psychology undergraduates volunteered to complete diaries outlining their daily academic and non-academic routine, covering semester one of their first year at a post-1992 university. The aim of the research was to investigate whether diaries were an appropriate method for exploring student engagement; also we wanted to measure whether the themes found through thematic analysis corresponded with those reported in previous research or whether new themes would emerge, not previously explored. In the course of the research we found themes that related to student engagement, disengagement, withdrawal concerns, and more general concerns regarding course choice, and university choice. We also found evidence which suggested that for some students there is a conflict between what is expected of them from the institution, in regards to the amount of time they could devote to their studies and the pressure from external forces which may take them away from studying, such as social commitments and paid work. We conclude with a discussion around the relationship between these themes, and the use of diaries as a research tool. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The study here intends to add insight into how cybermothers raising children with ASD experience their social networks. Such perceptions may potentially help educators foster positive partnerships with similar parents. The researchers undertook this phenomenological study with the assumption that cybermothers who blog expressed their authentic voices and would best represent their lived experiences. Eighteen months of data collected from 24 blogs was coded within a strengths framework that classified relationships into inhibiting and assisting categories and sorted it by themes that emerged within each strength category. Inhibiting relationship themes included role strain and isolation. Assisting themes were examined within the context of supportive relationships.",

This article takes a narrative approach to present one family's experience with a portfolio system in order to personalize the discussion and interpret the possible utilization of this family-generated portfolio as an aid for families communicating the needs of their child to educators. A family-created portfolio is a practice that gives families more control over their involvement by providing them with an opportunity to express their child's individuality beyond who the child is perceived as at school.",

Charter schools, as schools of choice, have been assumed to have fewer involvement barriers for minority and low-income parents, but a 2007 survey of charter leaders found that parent involvement remains a significant challenge. This qualitative study utilizes Epstein's model of family involvement to examine parent involvement programs at twelve charter schools across six U.S. states. Findings suggest that parent involvement \"activities\" in the study sample of urban charter schools fit Epstein's typology fairly well. However, the \"strategies\" used to implement these activities and to attract hard-to-reach parents are fairly innovative: Study schools offered wrap-around services, incentives, and contracts to enhance and ensure participation; utilized technology for advertising parent volunteer opportunities; and involved parents in the decision-making and governance of the school. Overall, these strategies were linked with increasing parents' self-efficacy and comfort level in participating in their children's education. (Contains 1 endnote and 3 tables.)",

The study utilized mixed methods combining a semantic differential study of graduate student attitudes with a qualitative analysis of the students' perceptions of their experience in the course. Results from the semantic differential (p less than 0.05) and qualitative data indicate a significant change in teachers in three global areas: (a) their professional knowledge and skills, (b) their professional dispositions, and (c) their authentic relationships with students, their families, and the community. The findings from this study can be used by teacher education programs, university professors, and school districts as they structure and implement programs that support and encourage teachers in interfacing with their students' families and communities.

The other approach connected graduate candidates with community partners in support of the development and implementation of specific projects of value to the community agency. Each of these collaborative learning opportunities created a win for the community partner and a win for the teacher candidates, as each of these opportunities better prepared these candidates to build a strong sense of community from within their school and also by reaching beyond the walls of their own setting.",

The paper describes success stories of students and communities affected by poverty from a diverse sample of eleven elementary schools throughout the province of Ontario. Over the period of one school year (2007-2008) and through school visits, interviews, focus groups, and document analysis, researchers developed narratives that describe the ways that adult members (teachers, parents, administrators, and community groups/partners) in the sample schools thought about and shaped their work with students living in challenging socioeconomic circumstances. The paper illustrates examples from the project that draw on themes related to: commitment to high-quality collaboration, teacher mentorship, and community building; parent and community partnerships; and administrative leadership and the culture of leading.",

New models eschew an emphasis on conformity to open communities up to difference, both among members, and between members and an ever more complex social world. The data here are taken from a student-experience study of a diverse post-secondary preparatory academy for high schoolers. The paper examines student reports of the changes they experienced as they progressed through the Academy, building faith, faith in each other and in themselves, hope, necessary to support long-term investment, and tolerance, sufficient to find in their diversity the resources they need to fulfill their dreams. The analysis relies on David McMillan's (1996) sense of community to develop a thick description of student experience in this school community.",

One of the classes was assigned to be the experimental group and the other was the control group. The experimental group learned with computer games, while the control group learned with the traditional teaching approach. The result showed that the learning achievement of the students in the experimental group was significantly better than that of the students in the control group. Similar results were obtained in terms of the learning interest of the students. Moreover, most of the students revealed quite positive attitudes toward the use of the game-based learning approach in nutrition education. An in-depth analysis showed that there was no significant difference between genders in terms of nutrition knowledge and learning attitudes. (Contains 6 tables and 5 figures.)",

The theoretical foundations of this research include the experiential learning theory, constructivist learning theory and joyful learning. The developed JCLS consists of the robot learning companion (RLC), sensing input device, mobile computation unit, mobile display device, wireless local network and operating software. The aim of this research is to design and evaluate the JCLS, which is implemented by using robot and RFID technologies. The developed JCLS system has been applied in real world for supporting children to learn mathematical multiplication. Both pilot experiment and formal experiment were conducted and the results showed that the JCLS can provide learners with more opportunities for hands-on exercises and deepening their impressions about the learning contents. Having many opportunities for hands-on exercises, learners can have more thinking time for knowledge construction. Using robot to design RLC can simultaneously increase learners' motivations and offer a more joyful perception to learners during the learning process. On the other hand, the JCLS can support instructors to immediately acquire the learning statuses of every learner for adjusting his/her in-class instructional strategy and giving after-school assistances.

        "description":"This study attempts to investigate whether a difference exists between learning vocabulary via animation and via traditional paper-based method. This small scale study was conducted at Karadeniz Technical University in academic year 2009-2010. Two pre-intermediate classes were randomly selected as the experimental group (n = 17), and control group (n = 22) as each class accommodated that number. Results obtained from the data gathered with a pre-test and a post-test applied to each group was analyzed using t-test in SPSS 16.00 version. The findings show that although there is no statistically significant difference between post-tests of each group, there was an increase in the post-test scores of animation group as compared to the pre-test scores. This increase implies that using multimedia such as animations contribute to students' achievement in vocabulary learning. Besides, the teachers' observations and students' opinions indicate that there were relatively positive attitudes towards using such kind of animations in vocabulary learning. They were useful since they address more senses than using paper-based texts; however, they can be distractive if teachers do not pay attention to the proficiency level of students and the content presented. The study supports the idea that multimedia applications can be integrated into language classes not as an alternative way but as an additional way to contribute positively to the atmosphere of class and motivation of students.

It has become important for both academics and practitioners to understand the behavioural intentions of students towards media technology. Many scales have been developed to measure the attitudes of secondary students towards the usage of media technology. However, few scales have been developed to assess media literacy in primary school students. To develop a validated scale for the media literacy of elementary school students, the Media Literacy Self-assessment Scale (MLSS) was adopted and modified in this study and then validated using a sample (N = 594) of students from Taiwan. The MLSS is a two-factor scale that measures learning with media (LWM) and media communication &amp; ethics (MCE); these components have been proposed to constitute the multidimensional constructs. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on a proposed nine-item model of the MLSS, and it was found the model provides a good fit. Gender and grade comparisons of the results are discussed.

Online interactive instruction was one of moral teaching forms to assist moral instruction. However, most moral-related interactive online games lacked functions for players to explore themselves while game playing, that resulted in less participation in deeper learning and decrease understanding of moral values. Therefore, we, digital game-based learning lab of National Taiwan Normal University, developed the interactive moral online game, named &quot;To do or not to do&quot;, to help students explore and establish appropriate moral values. Results of Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses indicated that behavioral intention was significantly influences by behavioral control, self-worth, attitude toward the game, subjective norm and parenting style.

        "description":"The present study was intended to explore EFL students' perceptions of learning vocabulary collaboratively with computers. We recruited 91 eighth-graders from three intact classes in a junior high school in Taiwan, assigning one class to learning individually without computers, another learning collaboratively without computers and the other learning collaboratively with computers. All participants took a pretest before three sets of vocabulary exercises in three periods; after each set, they took an immediate posttest; and, a month after the experiment, all took a delayed posttest. The computer group also completed a questionnaire and six students were interviewed. The quantitative data showed that students, learning collaboratively with computers, were not outperformed in vocabulary tests designed for individual study; however, they showed better retention, outperforming the others in the delayed posttest. From the qualitative data, more than 70% of the participants in the computer group reported a positive attitude and anticipation to learning vocabulary in such an environment. A further analysis found the nature of tasks, sharing of computers and grouping effective to their approaches to learning. Finally this study agrees that success is not guaranteed but deliberate design needs to be considered before learners are engaged in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment.

The challenges that might occur in applying situated cognition in teacher education programs, including insufficient opportunities for cognition apprenticeship, limited social interactions, and constraints in microteaching, are then presented. Correspondingly, this paper suggests three principles--enhancing peripheral participation, strengthening cognitive apprenticeship, and forming special interest groups online--in order to integrate situated cognition with a Web-based environment as a way to overcome the defects of conventional teacher education programs. Further, a recent application trial is described as a demonstration of how to innovate teacher education using a Web-based environment. Finally, a group of pre-service teachers participated in the research, and their perceived usefulness of the Web-based environment were measured and discussed. The results substantiate the applicable principles to establish a Web-based environment to support the course in teacher education. These outcomes are believed to contribute to both teacher education and educational technologies in the contemporary milieu of education. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"In the last few decades, analogy, which is considered as a special case for reasoning, has attracted a great deal of attention from cognitive scientists. Although analogy was rarely applied in previous decades, now it is often considered by educators and researchers as a strategy to provide creative solutions and poetic writing (Paris &amp; Glynn, 2004). Today, teaching models through analogy are used in different fields successfully and found to be beneficial for unobservable phenomena (Trey &amp; Khan, 2008). Moving from the findings of previous studies, this study aims to explore the effects of detailed analogies on students' learning success in studying the working rationale and hardware components of the computer. 86 students in 1st and 2nd grades of Computer and instructional Technology Department volunteered to participate in the study. The sample was divided into two groups randomly: the control group who received the lectures without using analogies and the experimental group who were taught using detailed analogies. The data was collected through pre- and post-tests at the beginning and at the end of one academic term. The results of the analyses show that the students' success was significantly higher for the group taught via detailed analogies. Considering the low number of studies conducted to identify the effects of analogies on computer sciences learning, the findings of this present study are supposed to contribute to other studies in the field.

Private teaching institutions have become one of the most important entities in the educational system of Turkey. The topics spelling at private teaching institutions will determine the university as well as the departments that the students are going to be enrolled as well as the quality of the education and instruction they will receive at those institutions. Physics classes, due to the extensive amount of abstracts concepts, are at the top of the classes causing students difficulties. Therefore, computer supported instruction will facilitate the comprehension of the students which would otherwise be difficult to understand. The present study is conducted with 40 physics teachers, 24 males and 16 females, working at the 20 branches of a private course in Ankara throughout the spring semester of the 2009-2010 academic year. The statistical analyses conducted showed that the majority of physics teachers believed that the use of computers facilitates learning. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Promoting the development of students' scientific inquiry capabilities is a major learning objective in science education. As a result, teachers require effective assessment approaches to evaluate students' scientific inquiry-related performance. Teachers must also be able to offer appropriate supplementary instructions, as needed, to students. Scientific inquiry capabilities should be assessed by evaluating students' scientific inquiry portfolios in actual hands-on experiments. Although virtual laboratory systems can reduce the cost of conducting scientific inquiry experiments, the manual portfolio assessment approach is still difficult and time-consuming for teachers. Therefore, in this paper, in order to provide students with personalized learning guidance concerning not only the conceptual knowledge, but also the high-order, integrative abilities of scientific inquiry, an Online Portfolio Assessment and Diagnosis Scheme, called OPASS, was proposed to assist teachers in automatically assessing and diagnosing students' abilities as they relate to scientific inquiry performance. Personalized diagnostic reports were generated by employing the rule-based inference approach, which diagnosed learning problems and provided corresponding reasons and remedial suggestions based on teacher-defined assessment knowledge of the scientific inquiry experiment. For the evaluation, experimental results showed that the OPASS was helpful and beneficial for both students and teachers. (Contains 13 tables and 11 figures.)",

One of the most important reasons for this change is social network sites (SNS). It can be seen that the most adhesive users of SNS in Turkey which have gained an increasing global quality are students. This descriptive study was made in order to determine the aims of 180 students who attend Sakarya University (SU) Physical Education and Sports Teaching Department (PESTD) in 2010 to use SNS, the duration they use SNS and their opinions on the credibility of SNS. Data were obtained through an interview and a questionnaire established by the researcher. They were evaluated by the program SPSS 15.0. In the statistical evaluation factor analysis, T-test, ANOVA and Chi-Square tests were implemented. At the end of the study, it was found that the participants use SNS mostly in order to learn what their friends are doing (66,7 %), to spend time (57,2 %), to be informed about sports organizations (55,6 %); and that they use the Internet to log in SNS (53,9 %) 1-2 hours (40,6 %) or less than 1 hour (24,4 %) a day. Moreover, it was found that SNS cause interference in their private lives (58,4 %); their negative effects are more than positive ones (46,2 %); and SNS are not safe (43,9 %). When results are evaluated generally, it can be said that the participants are conscious of SNS and the Internet. (Contains 15 tables.)",

Based on the analysis of parallel factors and the comparison of the manual generated mode and the computer generated mode, the most time-consuming and experience-consuming steps are found. By providing supports to those steps automatically, a semi-auto computer generated testing paper system was designed and developed for reducing the workload of the experienced faculties to generate testing papers. The papers were generated based on a gradually constructed item-bank. The system offered multiple templates of the testing paper structure plan for assisting semi-auto paper generated procedure and guaranteeing the parallel of the generated papers. In order to construct an item-bank in a short time, an easy-to-use authoring tool with powerful functions was designed and developed. The system supported the spring entrance examination of SCECUGB in 2010 successfully. Faculties gave positive feedback toward the system. (Contains 8 figures and 4 tables.)",

Having a quasi-experimental design, the study made use of both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The participants of the study, which was conducted in 2008-2009 academic year in Giresun University's Education Faculty, were 47 preservice elementary teachers. Data were obtained by using open ended questions, the Global Warming Attitude Scale (GWAS) and semi-structured interview forms. The results showed that both experimental and control group individuals had knowledge gaps and certain misconceptions about the reasons underlying global warming. However, preservice teachers were more successful in rectifying the gaps and misconceptions via instruction with visual materials. After the intervention, the experimental group had higher global warming attitude scores. However, no meaningful relationship existed between the groups with respect to their attitude scores.

An 8-week quasi-experiment was conducted with 125 sixth-grade elementary school students. The study shows the following results. First, a significant correlation was evident between pre-reading with a Web-based annotation tool and learning achievement. Furthermore, implementing a pre-reading sharing mechanism with Web-based annotation capabilities could stimulate and help students perform more useful pre-reading by reviewing others' annotations, thereby enlarging the effectiveness of pre-reading as it relates to learning. Second, participants' pre-reading exercises with a Web-based annotation tool revealed their preparation before class as well as reflected their prior knowledge, thereby helping the instructor to prepare the lecture well in advance. In the future, more advanced mechanisms, such as self-regulation learning, will be studied to encourage students to efficiently manage learning before class. (Contains 5 tables and 4 figures.)",

Participants are 25 6th graders of a suburb elementary school of Tai-Chung City. The results suggest that children's competency in rotation and space of shapes had been improved and the scores gap between lower and higher achievers had been narrowed. Such a collaborative Chinese Tangram activity may facilitate peer negotiation, enhance children's belief toward problem solving, and benefit each child to share resources, and a positive interdependent learning context can naturally be developed.

        "description":"Studies examining educational leadership in northern Canada appear rare. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to present findings from a 2010 study of educational leadership in Canada's Yukon Territory. The study adopts a critical ethnographic approach to unpack educational leadership as construed and enacted by two male and two female non-Indigenous principals living and working in Indigenous Yukon contexts. Extensive interviews, observations, and document reviews in four Yukon schools were conducted to shed light upon the research questions. This research reveals how school principals, individuals often referred to as &quot;educational leaders,&quot; define educational leadership despite the inability on the part of universities, the extant body of literature, or educational systems to articulate what this term even means (Allix &amp; Gronn, 2005). The study identifies that these Yukon principals define educational leadership in managerial and administrative ways, referring to themselves as principals who have a &quot;function&quot; and a &quot;job&quot; as they juggle the continuous ambiguity they face while wearing the multiple &quot;hats&quot; of teacher, principal, and community leader.

Few studies have compared teacher efficacy, student efficacy, and student ability at once. This study examined the relationship between teacher self-efficacy, student self-efficacy, and student ability. Teachers' perceptions of the students' self-efficacy was significantly correlated with students' abilities; however, student literacy self-efficacy was not correlated with their literacy ability. Additionally, there was no correlation between the teachers' perception of the students' literacy self-efficacy and the students' literacy self-efficacy. Finally, the teachers' self-efficacy was significantly correlated with their perception of the students' self-efficacy. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The program was uniquely designed to prioritize the voice of community organizations over the critical discourse of academic partners. Program structure was analysed and data collected from 24 of the participants using a questionnaire (response rate of 33%). Two variables were constructed, COLLABORATIVE and CRITICAL, to compare how formal and practical knowledge were prioritized in the service-learning program. The difference between the means of these variables obtained significance in a one-tailed t-test at the 0.01 level. Responses to open-ended questions about the event indicated that the program emphasized problem-solving, civic engagement, and the complexity of the issue under discussion. Results indicate the program's unique design successfully prioritized community voices, supporting other researchers' service-learning findings of tension between the academic discourse of rigor and the collaborative discourse of community development.

        "description":"It has become increasingly common for education scholars to claim a social justice orientation in their work. At the same time, education programs seem to be adding statements about the importance of social justice to their mission, and a growing number of teacher education programs are fundamentally oriented around a vision of social justice. Despite all the talk about social justice, it is often unclear in any practical terms what one means when he/she invokes a vision of social justice or how this influences such issues as program development, curricula, practicum opportunities, educational philosophy, social vision, and activist work. In this article, the authors intend to sort through the social justice literature in education in order to develop a better understanding of what this work is all about and why it is important. Better understanding the types of work done under the banner of social justice may help educators to more productively work together across differences and amid the variety of ways they are committed to social justice. Here the authors share Carlson and Dimitriadis's (2003) desire to develop a more powerful and \"strategically unified progressive vision of what education can and should be\" that ideally can emerge when educators find ways to work together despite different passions and while keeping alive real tensions. Throughout the article, the authors aim to provide some useful orientation and framework to characterize what has been written about education for social justice and the theories, passions and agendas that inform it. They offer five broad strands or usages of social justice in the education literature. They provide an entry point into the literature that can help educators to better understand and frame some of their goals in working for social justice.",

        "description":"Within the broad discussion of social justice in education, multiple conceptualizations of the term have been posited. Although there is no uniform notion of social justice, most would concur that, \"Social justice, broadly defined, refers to a condition whereby all people are afforded fair opportunities to enjoy the benefits of society\" (Miller, 2008, p. 821). Scholars and practitioners commonly write about and seek social justice as it relates to issues of race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation, and ability. In this article, the authors posit that for conditions of social justice to be expanded several fundamental connections must be made in the broader society where schooling is situated. Framed within democracy theory's description of the public sphere, the authors examine the \"bringing about of social justice\" through two broad propositions. They assert that: (1) The structural linkage of the public sphere maximizes opportunities for social justice; and (2) The structural linkage of the public sphere occurs best through institutional means. To concretize their discussion, the authors comprehensively interrogate the viability of churches as institutional partners for public school-based social justice movements.

        "author":["Brooks, Julia G."],
        "description":"In this paper, the author seeks to initiate a conversation about the discomfort that can emerge and the violence that might possibly take place in the \"critical\", dialogic, and justice-oriented Foundations of Education classroom between students and instructors when all are invited to negotiate \"the necessary conditions\" for learning. Believing that the intentions for the justice-oriented Foundations of Education are to stimulate and support a classroom atmosphere that underscores interconnectedness between students and instructor, and surveys liberatory change for individual learners, educational communities and society at large, the author has been especially concerned that the \"critical\" dialogic process to manifesting these intentions may \"cover over\" the rich and textured potential for less violent and compassionate relations in the classroom. It is the possibility of this \"covering over\" that leads the author to wonder about the limitations of the ideological approach that situates the \"critical\" dialogic endeavor of the justice-oriented Foundations class, namely that it places priority on a detached, cognitive, rational, and oppositional approach to learning at the expense of students' and instructors' becoming more relational, compassionate and dialogically savvy. The author begins her inquiry by situating the intentions of the dialogic classroom and justice-oriented curriculum, and describes an account from her own Foundations of Education class that illustrates the power and potential of addressing emotion as a provocative element in the augmentation of the \"critical\" dialogic project. Drawing then on Megan Boler's (1999) conceptualization of a \"pedagogy of discomfort,\" the author explores the potential role that discomfort might play in enhancing the \"critical\" dialogic project of the justice-oriented Foundations course as students and instructors individually and collectively risk questioning the authority of various norms and narratives regarding justice and equity in education. She reflects on the appearance of anger, despair, fear, and paralysis in her own Foundations classroom, and examines the influence that these provocative emotional experiences have uncovered for her as an instructor who is continually seeking to clarify her understanding of and approach to justice-oriented education. Finally, she considers Sharon Todd's (2003) idea of violence in social justice education as a necessary condition for more relational and compassionate learning, and draws on Paulo Freire (1998) to help her to entertain some implications for engaging a less violent and more relational approach to learning in the justice-oriented classroom.

        "description":"This essay documents a few key examples of the critical pedagogy and curriculum that the authors employ to challenge pre-service and in-service teachers to consider the concrete and theoretical contexts of taking on a social-activist-teacher persona. Their vision of social justice is rooted firmly in the critical tradition, as it is anchored in excavating unjust social and economic formations that imperil the vast majority of the world's population, while concomitantly empowering the economic elite. Not only do they believe that teacher educators must take the lead in helping their students recognize the social, political, and economic forces creating injustice in schools and in the wider society, but they must help current and future teachers develop emancipatory visions of how to develop instructional designs, collaborate with educators, and engage in activist initiatives which have the potential to eliminate social inequalities and build institutional structures based on democracy, equity, and fairness. Like many teacher educators, the authors have worked in institutions where almost 95% of the teacher education students have self-identified as \"White.\" Because of the difficulties of working with this nearly ubiquitous at-risk group (at risk for acting as oppressors), the authors focus their attention in this essay on the challenges White in-service and preservice teachers pose to practicing critical pedagogy.

Although school poverty and inequities among schools in the U.S. pale in comparison to conditions in South Africa, the two nations have much in common, including histories of state-sanctioned segregation in schooling as well as halting efforts to refashion education systems without undermining structures of advantage. In this article, the authors aim to consider the broader significance of the South African teachers' experience of educational reform--specifically, lessons U.S. policymakers might learn from these teachers about education and social justice. They offer a brief overview of the political and historical circumstances of schooling in South Africa and a short discussion of the theoretical foundations and methodology of the study. The article concludes with discussion of the significance of the teachers' comments for those seeking educational reform that leans towards social justice. (Contains 6 notes.)",

        "description":"In a context of increasing attention to issues of scientific integrity in university research, it is important to reflect on the governance mechanisms that universities use to shape the behaviour of students, researchers, and faculty. This paper presents the results of a study of 47 Canadian university research integrity/misconduct (RIM) policies: 41 institutions (87%) had distinct policies dealing with research misconduct, 37 (90%) of which took the form of research integrity/misconduct policies. For each of these 41 documents, we assessed the stated policy objectives and the existence (or not) of procedures for managing allegations of misconduct, definitions of misconduct, and sanctions. Our analysis revealed that, like their American counterparts, most Canadian universities had policies that contained the key elements relevant to protecting research integrity and managing misconduct. Yet, there was significant variability in the structure and content of these policies, particularly with regard to practical guidance for university personnel and review bodies.

        "description":"This paper analyzes the ideological orientations of Canadian university professors based on a unique 2000 study of a representative sample of Canadian academics (n=3,318). After summarizing methodological problems with extant research on this subject, and tentatively comparing the political views of Canadian and American academics, the paper demonstrates that Canadian academics fall to the left of the political spectrum but are not hugely different in this respect from the Canadian university-educated population. Multivariate analyses reveal considerable heterogeneity in the ideological views of Canadian professors, suggesting that contemporary characterizations of the North American professoriate as left- or right-leaning tend to be overdrawn. Multivariate analyses demonstrate the importance of disadvantaged status and disciplinary socialization in shaping professors' ideological views, although self-selection processes are not discounted.

        "description":"Invasive alien species (IAS) cause major environmental and economic damage worldwide, and also threaten human food security and health. The impacts of IAS are expected to rise with continued globalization, land use modification, and climate change. Developing effective strategies to deal with IAS requires a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach, in which scientists work co-operatively with social scientists and policy-makers. Higher education can contribute to this process by training professionals to balance the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of the IAS problem. We examined the extent of such training in Canada by reviewing undergraduate and graduate university curricula at all 94 member institutions of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada for IAS content. We found that degree and diploma programs focusing on IAS issues are lacking at Canadian post-secondary institutions. Furthermore, few courses are devoted solely to IAS, and those that are typically adopt an ecological perspective. We argue that the absence of interdisciplinary university curricula on IAS in Canada negatively affects our ability to respond to this growing global challenge. We present several international educational programs on IAS as case studies on how to better integrate training on invasive species into university curricula in Canada. (Contains 1 table.)",

The paper establishes the beginning of the contemporary post-secondary system with the 1967 decision of the Manitoba government to abandon the &quot;one university&quot; system model, a move akin to a &quot;big bang,&quot; redefining system norms and expectations, and setting direction which continues to be relevant today. The study revealed extensive structural change in Manitoba's post-secondary system after 1997, the nature of which reflected the trends associated with globalization, but also reflecting the important influence that local forces have had in shaping the province's post-secondary system.",

Of interest is how similar or different the experiences are of women and men who have been appointed to Canada Research Chairs (CRCs). In particular, we examine the impacts of holding a CRC position and consider the factors that shape that experience for women and men. Based on interviews with 60 CRCs, we find that when women and men are given similar opportunities, their experiences are more alike than different. Where differences arise, these are often related to the experience of status/prestige associated with the CRC, and to family care responsibilities. Using expectation states theory, we demonstrate that when women are equal to men, the significance of gender as a determinant of the academic experience is diminished.

Among them are the recession and the financial strain it places on institutions' ability to develop programs, trying to meet the demand for trained workers that is a projection and not a certainty, and training low-skilled individuals for jobs that demand higher skills. For training, many community and technical colleges are implementing strategies such as prep-academy programs, bridge courses, and career pathway programs to effectively fill in the education and resource gaps experienced by many low-skill individuals. Though the challenges to developing a green energy workforce are at times significant, community and technical colleges, through both partnerships with other organizations and the implementation of education strategies that assist low-skilled individuals, can build a green energy workforce that fulfills the lofty projections and, ultimately, succeeds in helping restore America's economic vitality.

But for secondary and junior high career development teachers, the &quot;how&quot; to implement green career development concepts is still lacking. Limited resources are available for classroom instructional strategies that connect sustainability with career development, thus giving purpose to a project in Illinois. At Community High School in West Chicago, Illinois, the authors have found an exciting way to connect sustainability, service-learning, career exploration, and the Career Cluster Framework.

        "description":"The economic downturn and growing skills mismatch dramatically highlight the importance of programs that retrain workers for the demands of the current workplace. The career and technical education (CTE) system has played a large role in the development of these programs, and CTE educators are leading efforts to ensure that new and newly redesigned programs are relevant and accessible to those most in need of additional education and training. CTE programs offer a wide variety of workers the opportunity to update their current skills, develop new skills and knowledge, and obtain the necessary certificate or degree for desired employment. Institutions target the adult learner through short-term and accelerated programs that decrease the time required for completion; utilize flexible learning approaches to account for students' other responsibilities; concentrate education and training on high-demand career areas to ensure students are prepared for jobs that exist in local economies; and include wrap-around support services to increase student success.

        "description":"Career and technical education (CTE) programs that provide 21st century skills may begin in secondary education, but they are not educating just high school students. Many adults are benefiting from these programs, often at one of America's community colleges. According to the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), in the fall of 2007, 11.8 million students were enrolled at 1,173 community colleges in the United States. That includes both full-time and part-time, and credit and non-credit students. Among those who have recognized the significant contribution community colleges have made to expand educational opportunities is Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. The reality is that CTE programs at today's community colleges are training not only economically disadvantaged young people, but working professionals as well. Community colleges provide adults with the work and life skills they need to succeed at all junctures in life, in a world in which change is the one constant and lifelong learning essential.

This article looks at these high-opportunity industries and the kinds of jobs they are expected to open up. In the global economy of the 21st century, many low-skill jobs can be done either by computers or by workers in low-wage countries. The American industries that remain competitive will be those that focus on what the nation does better than most other countries; creativity and innovation. But these do not happen by accident. They rest on three pillars: a highly educated workforce, a healthy workforce, and an outstanding infrastructure. All three of these pillars have been threatened over the last few decades, but the government has targeted them all for renewal, and each is associated with industries that will provide many jobs in the coming decade.",

        "description":"As of September 2010, the U.S. manufacturing sector grew for the 14th consecutive month, leading some economists to speculate that, as with the Great Depression, American manufacturing will lead the economy out of the recession. It is a little bit of good news in a long stream of depressing employment reports. Career and technical educators contribute to the growth of this sector by training career-ready graduates for increasingly high-skilled manufacturing jobs. However, skills are not the only important aspect of career-readiness--so are work philosophies, like a commitment to continuous improvement. This article relates how one manufacturer, Dant Clayton Corporation in Louisville, Kentucky, applied lean manufacturing philosophies to its welding shop, and describes how educators might incorporate lean philosophies into instruction in all skill areas. The author posits that continuous improvement philosophies could change career and technical education (CTE) instruction and training by making graduates with an awareness of, and training in, these philosophies more employable.",

These efforts included providing online registration, online classes, an expanded class schedule, a student loan program, dual enrollment courses at area high schools, intensified student recruiting, focused marketing and promotions, and community events on campus to bring area residents to the college. As a result, the college saw a jump in credit headcount enrollment. Those enrolling at the college due to the economic downturn added to the college's already surging numbers, and many of these new students were adult learners. This article describes how NACC provided educational opportunities and support for everyone, in particular for those adult learners who are enrolling in large numbers as a consequence of the economic downturn and its ravaging effect on local industries.",

In today's complex workplace and ever-changing economy, apprenticeships are not just for young people entering the workforce. They may also help older workers find new careers or upgrade their skills. There are many ways that apprenticeships are being utilized in today's CTE to help young people find a craft and acquire the skills to master it, but this traditional path also has been modernized to help adults upgrade their careers.

The three films in the franchise--\"Toy Story,\" 1993; \"Toy Story 2,\" 1999; and \"Toy Story 3,\" 2010--incorporate an innovative blend of many different genres, having spun off video games and dozens of film and game-related consumer products. The film was used to introduce students at Washington County Technical High School--located in Hagerstown, Maryland--to interactive media. In this article, the author discusses how Washington County Technical High School uses the blockbuster movie \"Toy Story 3\" as a tool to help students learn the ins and outs of interactive media. Computer Game Development and Animation (CGDA) program students and students from the multimedia program worked together to discover and explore the components of interactive media with the Disney/Pixar \"Toy Story 3\" theme.

        "description":"The quality of math standards within career paths is an important one, as it can indicate whether career and technical education (CTE) students are receiving a rigorous academic and technical curriculum. This is especially important as the CTE field has expanded to include technology and pre-engineering (often called STEM fields) as well as more &quot;traditional&quot; fields, and many CTE concentrators go on to postsecondary education. In this article, the author describes the results of her review of the embedded academic standards in CTE disciplines in eight states--Nebraska, Georgia, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, Alabama, and Louisiana. Through a review of state CTE standards, state academic standards, and crosswalk documents, the amount and type of state math standards linked to CTE was evaluated. These standards were compared with the Common Core (2010) academic standards to determine whether the requirement for academic rigor that Perkins IV requires was being met. The data revealed a wide variation in presentation of state standards, and the levels of math knowledge linked to CTE areas. Overall, the results of the data review show that states are making progress toward defining a curriculum that is both rigorous and integrated. The level of math achievement in CTE continues to be a problem, though, with many standards not truly reaching the levels set forth in the Common Core curriculum for high school math courses.",

The push to find sources of sustainable energy, the growing demands of the health care field and that of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)-related sectors are all driving the high-demand jobs in today's growing workforce. Vocational education is now career and technical education (CTE) and it is evolving and adapting its programs to meet the needs of business and industry. While the field of CTE is changing, the perception of it has not. The general public, policymakers, and media have a misconception about the quality, rigor, and relevance of CTE programs today. In order to change the perception of CTE, CTE educators, students, and the business community need to collaborate and launch a local and national public awareness campaign. This movement should inform media, policymakers, and parents about how CTE has changed; an integral part of that campaign has got to be the inclusion of success stories, information about how programs are evolving and training the future workforce, and how CTE is helping students stay engaged in their learning.",

The quality of teachers and their capacity to construct rich learning experiences for students represents the \"front line\" of the work in CTE. Teachers shape the learning experiences that produce competent and confident graduates who are ready to begin their career paths; well-trained graduates are both advocates and evidence that the field is truly living up to a new image. To improve CTE teacher quality and ultimately the quality of CTE programs and their image, the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) is working in collaboration with the National Research Center for Career and Technical Education (NRCCTE) to develop an induction model for teachers seeking an alternative route to enter the profession. The induction model is based on high-quality professional development and high-quality support during the first year of teaching, and is designed to increase beginning teachers' competence, self-efficacy and career commitment. The model, once developed, can be used by states, teacher preparation programs, and school districts to boost teacher quality.",

Accountability and data have increasingly become a core focus of research, news, and commentary about education in recent years. Though some of the attention to accountability and data use may be tied to regulatory requirements, there is also recognition among educators that metrics matter. Throughout its existence, CTE has focused on performance and on measuring that performance. The use of evaluation and assessment data will continue to be a challenge for all of education. The authors argue that it is imperative that CTE shows its commitment to the continuous improvement of programs based on teacher-led data usage and analysis. They describe NOCTI's focus which is to research, design, refine and launch a program to help CTE educators understand and use technical data to create real and sustainable program improvements. They also describe CTEDDI (Career and Technical Educators using Data-Driven Improvement) as a new tool for program improvement and take a look at case studies of professional development.",

Despite these misconceptions, CTE is often a perfect option for many students to discover their passions, and to develop skills to enter the workforce or to continue on to college. The Partnership for 21st Century Skills identifies skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, communication and collaboration as vital skills for the future. The hands-on approach to education in CTE equips students with all of these skills. Indeed, the CTE community has made excellent strides toward image change, but how can it become more prolific? How can CTE enhance its image so as to attract new students? One solution is through sustainability. Sustainability in education is about teaching students to be environmentally and socially responsible, therefore protecting the planet for future generations.

That is just what industry thinks about the current global &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; concept of education. The perception from business, government and education leaders of 50 nations at the Bahrain 2010 Global Education Conference held last December, is that the global achievement gap between what industry expects and what education delivers is not caused by a lack of content. It is caused by a failure to provide opportunity for creativity, collaboration, context, and practical application. The antiquated assembly line model of education fails to grasp the fact that the prescribed &quot;hole&quot; simply is not shaped like the student &quot;pegs&quot; who are being pushed into it, nor does it resemble the needs of a high-tech, knowledge-based workforce. The problem stems from the fact that institutions mistakenly interpret rigor as adding more difficult coursework rather than demanding mastery of existing content at all levels. They are also mired in an archaic industrial revolution system that fails to deal with the requirements of an agile, pull-oriented, media-rich, and increasingly accessible knowledge-based economy. Productivity is less time and space dependent. Knowledge and information are commodities. Geographic and job mobility have increased. These shifting conditions leave students at all levels feeling increasingly unprepared to meet the challenges of a 21st century workplace.

        "author":["Collyer, Fran"],
        "description":"Until recently, the social-technical process of invention has fallen between sociological investigation of the genesis of a new idea (an ideational phenomenon) and the production of a new technology (a material phenomenon). The advent of post-modernism and post-structuralism offered new avenues for theorising invention, accounting for, on the one hand, its material nature, and, on the other, its ideational nature, through the notion of socio-technical ensembles: phenomena constructed through the co-producing, mutually constitutive action of actants (both human and otherwise). This paper argues that despite its potential, theorising within the sociology of science and technology is hampered by insufficient attention to the role of the researcher and the concept and practice of reflexivity. Reflexive practices within this field of knowledge are explored, and drawing on an empirical case study of an antibiotic preparation, a case is made for the necessity of reflexivity in the production of knowledge about invention.",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to substantiate and further develop a previously formulated conceptual model of Role Acceptance in Mexican American family caregivers by exploring the theoretical strengths of the model. The sample consisted of women older than 21 years of age who self-identified as Hispanic, were related through consanguinal or acquired kinship ties to an elder, and had provided at least one intermittent service (without pay at least once a month). A comparative analysis method was used to test the existing theory, which consists of four phases: (a) Introduction/Early Caregiving Experiences, (b) Role Reconciliation, (c) Role Imprint, and (d) Providing/Projecting Care. Results substantiated and elaborated all four phases and 14 categories of the existing model. This study provides further evidence that the intergenerational caregiving Role Acceptance model can be used to study Hispanic caregivers in varied geographic locations. It also provides a framework for comparison with other groups of caregivers. In addition, results inform health professionals about the ways in which Hispanic caregivers view caregiving. This information has the potential to increase cultural competence in the delivery of health care to elders and their families. (Contains 3 tables, 1 figure and 3 footnotes.)",

Fifty one-to-one interviews were done with five student groups, each of which was presented with a scenario ending with one factual outcome and three alternative outcomes that actually did not happen. Confirming the already proven role of the provided event outcome in overestimating the probability of its occurrence, this study expands the current understanding of the processes neglected by the research on the hindsight effect. It does so by highlighting the strategic use of vagueness, self-empowerment and selective perspective-taking that question the assessment of the past for its own sake and emphasize the importance of self-presentation.

Furthermore, I present the implications for the contemporary Aboriginal community's understanding of their current culture as dynamic and open to change. (Contains 4 footnotes.)",

Those who first completed mind maps identified a greater number of unique concepts and provided more in depth responses about their experience in later interviews. Participants suggested that by first completing a mind map, they were better able to recall, organize, and frame their reflections of past experience.

A sample of 9 women, who completed a behavioral lifestyle intervention, participated in individual, structured, in-depth interviews. Life stressors, ranging from personal illness to changes in employment status, had varied effects on participation. Some women coped with life stressors by using them as a motivational tool to improve their own health, while others reported limited ability to devote time to attend meetings or engage in the prescribed lifestyle changes due to life stressors. A critical key to improving weight loss outcomes for African American women may be using intervention strategies that teach positive coping skills to alter maladaptive responses to life stressors.

Ten female graduate students, with qualitative research experience, participated in individual interviews and focus groups. Findings indicated our participants were open to the differences expressed, focusing on commonalities, rather than accentuating or suppressing stated differences. This negotiation of difference enabled our participants to co-construct more complex and legitimate understandings of mentoring. Collectively, our participants expressed a need for mentoring that addressed psychosocial, as well as career functions and mentoring relationships that supported the development of both mentor and mentee as scholars and researchers.

First, like many qualitative research approaches, such as grounded theory, text mining encourages open-mindedness and discourages preconceptions. Contrary to the popular belief that text mining is a linear and fully automated procedure, the text miner might add, delete, and revise the initial categories in an iterative fashion. Second, text mining is similar to content analysis, which also aims to extract common themes and threads by counting words. Although both of them utilize computer algorithms, text mining is characterized by its capability of processing natural languages. Last, the criteria of sound text mining adhere to those in qualitative research in terms of consistency and replicability.",

This study explored ways in which survivors of ABI and members of their support networks perceive relationship changes as recovery extends into the long-term stage. Two survivors of ABI and members of their respective support networks participated in this case study integrating information from interviews, field notes, and artifacts. Inductive data analysis revealed themes of adjustment to impairments and compensations, connection changes with other people, feelings of protectiveness toward the survivor, emotional intensity, and the influence of personality traits on the recovery process. Application of these themes to intervention suggests health care professionals might benefit from shifting their focus from the survivor alone to the survivor functioning within a social support network.",

Therefore, it is fundamental that the measure of death penalty opinion be heavily scrutinized. Utilizing a methodological approach not typically employed in this area, the current study conducted six focus groups to gain a better understanding of the complexity of these opinions. During the focus groups, participants were asked to state their general beliefs concerning the death penalty, respond to scenarios, and respond to research findings regarding the death penalty (i.e., costs, deterrence, wrongful convictions, race, etc.). The findings suggest that participants' views regarding the death penalty are more multifaceted than previously believed. This study further suggests that current methods used to measure public support of the death penalty fail to capture the complexity of sentiment on this issue. (Contains 1 table and 1 footnote.)",

In this paper, the author considers the issue of communicating qualitative research study designs in the context of institutional research ethics review and offers suggestions for researchers to consider in their communication of study designs to research ethics review boards. General information about the mandate of research ethics review boards is provided. In light of wide international variability with respect to research ethics regulatory environments and review board processes, specific considerations and suggestions about communicating qualitative study designs effectively are presented within a Canadian case study example.",

This study addressed the following research questions: (a) Can extensive reading improve students' reading comprehension? and (b) can shadowing enhance the effects of extensive reading? The participants in the study were 89 Japanese university students majoring in human science. Based on two experimental groups and two control groups, we examined the relationships and interactions of the two variables (ER and shadowing) over a one-year treatment (two semesters), using ANOVA. Three reading comprehension tests, a pretest, posttest 1 (after the first semester), and posttest 2 (after the one-year treatment), were administered. The results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference among groups, but a significant difference was found between the three test scores. Results are also considered in terms of an increased understanding of shadowing, and implications for curricula and classroom applications are discussed.

The purpose is to facilitate the building of a knowledge base on topics associated with the core material in order for students to engage on a deeper level with that core material.

A reading comprehension test was developed and validated as the pre-test and post-test. The test, including items for assessing the comprehension of students in their area of specialization, was administered to 100 lower-level and 100 higher-level language proficient undergraduates who were randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions. Then, participants attended ten class sessions on hedging. During the first three sessions, the participants in the experimental group were instructed on the essential meaning of a hedge, as well as the types and functions of hedging devices. The next sessions focused on the practical use of these markers as they appear in academic texts. After the treatment, the test was again given to the same students as the post-test. The results of two \"t\" tests and a two-way ANOVA provided empirical support for the facilitative effect of explicit instruction in recognizing hedging devices that improved their language proficiency and, therefore, improved their reading comprehension scores.

The article considers how the teacher asserted control over physically handling the text, the processes of reading it, and the classroom discourses about the text. Data analysis and discussion unpacks the teacher's claim that what she wanted students to get out of their experience of reading &quot;The Cay&quot; was &quot;just to read a book.&quot; This claim, and the teacher-student interactions which followed, is considered against the backdrop of curriculum goals aiming to create sophisticated, critical readers.

Although these differences present challenges for educators, they also provide opportunities for educators to embrace the life experiences and wisdom that these adult learners bring to the collegiate community.

Guilford's FFOE model of divergent thinking from the 1950s offers four dimensions to describe creativity: (1) Fluency; (2) Flexibility; (3) Originality; and (4) Elaboration. FFOE makes time spent on projects worthwhile because creativity is supported, deliberate, and meaningful while still connected to the curriculum. Promoting and analyzing creativity becomes a simpler matter of using the terms and involving the students, not teaching separate lessons or developing new materials. In fact, student projects may already be building creativity but may just not have a vocabulary to talk about it. Though imagined long before Web 2.0, this model is evergreen. The terms are simple enough to use with students from kindergarten to AP, as well as with parents to publicly value and promote creativity across the curriculum. In this article, the author offers a few ideas on how to use the FFOE model to promote creativity in the classroom. (Contains 5 online resources.)",

They believed that stakeholder input would be the key to any initiative that improved learning, and that stakeholders must be involved in and take ownership of technology planning. They also knew that leadership would be critical to the success of the tech integration. Even with a clear vision, it would take at least a couple of years to engage the staff and get them working collectively. And with the transient nature of an international school's students and staff, lasting school change would be even more of a challenge. Tech leaders would have to deal with new systems and practices, new guidelines and plans, and conditions for change. In this article, the authors describe how they adopted a distributed leadership approach with these essential elements: (1) Technology leadership team; (2) Technology planning; (3) Commitment to fostering change; (4) Test-bed culture; and (5) Commitment to sustaining change.",

        "description":"It's no secret that fewer and fewer women are entering computer science fields. Attracting high school girls to computer science is only part of the solution. Retaining them while they are in higher education or the workforce is also a challenge. To solve this, there is a need to show girls that computer science is a wide-open field that offers many interesting career choices. That's why the author decided to take a group of high school sophomores and juniors from Columbus School for Girls (CSG) in Ohio on a service trip to the Caribbean, where they delivered 60 laptops to three classrooms of third through fifth grade students and taught them how to use the computers. Her intent was to expose her students to computer science through a service trip and show them that this field has many fulfilling pathways. This project can easily be carried out in other private or public schools, either as an elective, after-school activity, or club. What works for girls will also work for boys and minorities, both of which have declining numbers in computer science in the United States. (Contains 6 online resources.)",

Readability measures are one such tool that authors can use when evaluating text comprehensibility. This study compares the Coh-Metrix Second Language (L2) Reading Index, a readability formula based on psycholinguistic and cognitive models of reading, to traditional readability formulas on a large corpus of texts intuitively simplified for language learners. The goal of this study is to determine which formula best classifies text level (advanced, intermediate, beginner) with the prediction that text classification relates to the formulas' capacity to measure text comprehensibility. The results demonstrate that the Coh-Metrix L2 Reading Index performs significantly better than traditional readability formulas, suggesting that the variables used in this index are more closely aligned to the intuitive text processing employed by authors when simplifying texts.

In response to this situation, a two year action research project explored the broad issue of higher education access for young people from low socio-economic backgrounds in South East Queensland, Australia. This paper focuses on one specific aspect of that project, and reports on the underlying factors which constrain access to higher education access for one cultural community in Australia. Analysis is based on interview data from young people and parents from this community, and presents a rich description of their lived experiences.

When the perception is that student engagement is in decline, there is genuine concern amongst committed academic teaching staff. This paper reports on a pilot study designed to foster an understanding of the factors that influence engagement in undergraduate students in the business school at a regional Australian university. Two focus groups were conducted with the assistance of 22 students enrolled in the major study areas of the school, and the information obtained informed the development of an on-line questionnaire aimed at exploring the drivers of engagement and disengagement. Eighty-five students completed the questionnaire, and 67 usable responses were available for analysis--a response rate of 17 per cent, which could be seen as illustrative of student disengagement. However, the findings of the pilot study suggest that the majority of students believed themselves to be engaged with their studies. Students reported that the instructors' approach, class and assignment structure, learning support and other personal factors affected their level of engagement. A &quot;preliminary model of student engagement&quot; was developed from the findings. Key factors have been drawn from this to inform learning and teaching policy and practices within the School.

This paper focuses on the broader publication of these mean scores pertaining to individual staff members. The paper investigates forces that drive such an approach and the attractions thereof, and enumerates its outcomes and effects, while investigating potential theory-method mismatches.

        "description":"One of the outcomes of the &quot;Bradley Report&quot; (Bradley et al. 2008) is that Australian universities have a new incentive to enrol students from low socio-economic status. Consequently, a flurry of interest is growing around knowledge concerning the targeting, recruitment and retention of low socio-economic status (SES) students. Working class people in general, and low SES students in particular, are no more or less intelligent than anyone else. In their under-representation at universities, however, low SES students are sometimes wrongly positioned as intellectually deficient (Kadi 1996). The problem in extending the opportunities higher education affords to under-represented groups lies not in low SES students themselves, but in the social relations that produce them as such. Looking for the first and most influential point of intervention is like looking for the beginning of a loop. Instead, one should attend to the wisdom and experience of those whose situation has some resonance with one's own, and build along the paths their steps have already worn. Most of all, universities should be places where class differences, along with other diverse personal and cultural identifications, can be critically productive rather than shaming and exclusive. And this has to start, both inside and beyond the classroom, now.",

Not that she studied for all that time, of course, but she first enrolled in 1976 and she didn't graduate with her BA until April 1998. Why did it take so long? Was there something wrong with her? Was there anything anyone else could have done to help her get through university earlier? These questions are very much on her mind at the moment as programmes have been and are being put into place to encourage more school leavers from low socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds to go on to university. Her interest in the Federal Government's push to increase the representation of students from low socio-economic backgrounds from less than 15 to 20 per cent by 2020 (Bradley et al. 2008) is both personal and academic. It's personal because she was a student from a low socio-economic background, and it's academic because she now teaches in a university. She thinks that studying has been worthwhile, not only because she loves her life now, but also because she has demonstrated that one doesn't have to be an academically gifted high school student from a low SES background to get a PhD--being average will get anyone there too.",

To put this modest project another way: what in 2060 might a historian (assuming there are, then, historians) write about their topic over the previous 100 years? To help provide a testamentary source for a future historian, the authors have picked out three intertwined social and educational phases over the last fifty and-a-bit years, starting around 1957 and ending now. Then they make some guesses about the social order in 2060, and therefore about how Australian post-secondary education might be in that year.",

He argues that it is not simply that the methodologies adopted by the main rankers -- Times Higher Education (THE), QS and the Shanghai Jiao Tong University -- are diverse and open to the usual interpretation, but there appears to be a significant leaning towards the Anglo-American scene with no fewer than 18 American and British universities figuring in the top twenty of the THE ranking, with the exceptions being the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and the unassuming but almost Anglo-American University of Toronto. He goes on to say that the pathetic performance of Australian universities in the latest THE ranking headed by the University of Melbourne (36), Australian National University (43) (17 last year) and the University of Sydney (71) (36 last year), has for now at least, put the skids under the tertiary \"education revolution\". In order to have a more open and competitive system that truly reflects the new culture of public transparency that is the \"My University\" website, he suggests that Australia develops a more innovative approach to its own internal system of rankings by adopting the league table system of the English Football Association. Each year two universities will be promoted and two relegated and the university topping the Foster's Premier League will be declared champions and the respective vice-chancellors ensconced in Sudan chairs and paraded before an assembled House of Representatives.",

Using an online survey inviting both qualitative and quantitative responses, 798 international students provided a rich source of data. Students provided information on their attitudes, motivation and beliefs about language learning, their strategies for improving their language skills, and their strategies for academic learning. The study shows that students employ a considerable range of academic and language learning strategies to improve their English. Of the academic learning strategies the authors have noted evidence of social strategies, such as creating or joining study groups and participating in tutorial discussions. Numerous cognitive learning strategies were offered by the participants, ranging from simply making lists and learning by rote, to reading as widely as possible and preparing for classes. The metacognitive strategies of organisation, planning, and self-evaluation were less frequent in the qualitative data which suggests a need to promote these strategies within university support services and within faculties.",

Tutoring is an effective practice (Boylan, 2002) and peer tutoring is one of the most successful forms of tutoring, due to the personal connections that are made (Tinto, 1993). A peer is defined as one at the same level, at the same institution, and having equal status (Falchikov, 2001). An onsite peer tutor is someone enrolled in the same course, with similar demographics, offering tutoring in the classroom before or after class. This research project created an onsite peer tutoring program for college students enrolled in three mathematics content courses designed specifically for future PK-8 teachers. The purpose of this research study was to measure the impact of the onsite tutoring program and explore reasons for non-attendance. (Contains 4 figures.)",

The theoretical framework of this research lays the foundation for a pedagogical learning model based on digital games. We analyzed the game reward system, which is recognized as one of the most important mechanisms to engage players in active sustainable digital game playing. In general, the reward system is designed similar to an exponential learning model. This paper compares the reward systems of four typical digital games which have more than 10 million school-age players around the world. Based on the results, we propose a computer-assisted exponential learning model similar to that applied in digital game based learning models. By applying these results to educational algorithms associated with the field of artificial intelligence, we are able to motivate emergent learning. Using the proposed method, it is possible to form a model of computer-assisted learning, adequate for all learning levels. (Contains 7 figures and 5 tables.)",

Furthermore, the IAB system offers an interactive environment both for disabled individuals and educators, and enables a rapid improvement of disabled individuals' responses to various stimulants, and increases attention duration on a certain object. IAB aims to decrease disabled individuals' reaction time to stimulants, and to increase total concentration and attention period on a single object. Thus, these improvements in the attention help the educator to teach individuals about various cognitive concepts such as long, short, small, big, and colors, as well as educational concepts such as animals, vehicles and professions.

Specifically, the researcher tried to find out whether teachers' gender, service length, having a personal computer, receiving an in-service training regarding the use of teaching materials, having an interest on using technological devices and sufficiency of the teaching materials in schools effect the usage of printed materials, audiovisual materials or experience-giving methods (e.g. field trips, a visit to an institution) in social studies lessons. The data were collected from 160 teachers (N=87, female; N=73, male) who worked in Istanbul and Sakarya during 2008-2009 spring semester. A scale was developed and applied by the researcher on the participating teachers to score and measure the usage of teaching materials in the Social Studies lessons. The results of the study showed statistically significant differences on the usage of printed materials and experience-giving methods based on the gender of the teacher and in service training, in favor of both female teachers and teachers who have received an in-service training. Moreover, statistically significant differences were also observed on the usage of print materials, experience-giving methods and the total score due to the service length of the teacher. The teachers, who have been working for 16-years or more, had significantly higher scores on the aforementioned variables. In addition, it was found that if schools had sufficient materials/equipment, the teachers tended to use the teaching materials more in their lessons. No correlation was found between the service length and the usage of audiovisual materials by teachers, as well as between having a personal computer and usage of teaching materials.

Adding a Turkish perspective, the purpose of the present study was to explore secondary school teachers' perceptions of computers and influencing demographics  characteristics. Cross-sectional survey methodology was employed in three secondary high schools known for their educational and technological eminence. A total of 130 secondary school teachers participated. Teacher perceptions were defined to include computer attitudes, technological affinity, technological aversion, and confidence and comfort. The survey instrument measured these dimensions in four scales. General Linear Model findings illustrated effects of computer experience and training, gender, teaching field and Internet connection availability on perceptions. Ownership of personal computer appeared to be an important predictor of higher level computer experience and training, and consequently, more positive attitudes and higher confidence and comfort. Implications address pre- and in-service teacher development programs. Further research recommendations are made. (Contains 12 tables.)",

        "description":"The aim of the present research was to understand how office workers cope with back, neck and upper limb musculoskeletal disorders at work (and their implications for work). A small (N = 120) questionnaire survey collected information about potential participants' background and history of musculoskeletal disorders. These data were used to inform a sampling process for a qualitative study of 18 office workers who had a back, neck or upper limb musculoskeletal disorder. Each participant was interviewed one-to-one.  Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analysed using NUD*IST (N6) qualitative data analysis software. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach and a conceptual framework that was developed based on pre-specified themes derived from the literature. The results demonstrate that office workers use an extensive range of both cognitive and behavioural strategies to cope with musculoskeletal pain at work. Cognitive strategies include techniques such as distraction, visualization, self-talk, and blocking thoughts. Seeking-social support, exercise/stretching, exposure management, self or accompanied treatment, eating/drinking have emerged as categories that made up the behavioural coping strategies. Many of these had the potential to either further exacerbate the problems or lead to new problems including accidents or impaired work performance. The present study indicates the dangers inherent in the haphazard and trial-and-error nature of many of the coping strategies. Improved guidance and better evaluation of existing advice are required for those who remain at work but in pain. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"The development of remote laboratory suitable for the reinforcement of undergraduate level teaching of mechatronics is important. For the reason, a Web-based mechatronics learning system, called the RECOLAB (REmote COntrol LABoratory), for remote learning in engineering education has been developed in this study. The web-based environment is an educational technology for learning the principles and methodology of performing operations on a mechatronics rig at any time and from any location through the Internet. This study concentrates on a color identification experiment as a case study to illustrate the processes involved in the development and evaluation of the remote experimental procedure. The study was carried out with 55 students at National Changhua University of Education, in Taiwan. Students were divided into two groups with an equal number of students at the same academic level in each. One group was labeled as &quot;Traditional&quot; (without RECOLAB support) and the other &quot;RECOLAB&quot; (with support). The evaluation results elicit some relevant facts: (1) Students mainly agreed that the experiment was challenging and interesting and that they learned useful things during the laboratory. (2) Students valued the process performance. (3) Students enjoyed the way that the classes were devised. They valued the fact that participation was encouraged. (4) The students were not content with the number of laboratory practices and the number of hours assigned to the practices. (5) After evaluating the results, the teachers believe that the experiment significantly improved the quality of the laboratory. This study demonstrates RECOLAB's effectiveness in helping students to understand the concepts and master the technologies for the web-based mechatronics monitoring and control learning system. The architecture proposed in this study is not dependent on specific hardware or software configuration, it represents a generic infrastructure. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)",

One of the two main aims of this study is to measure comprehension and remembering effect of the traditional media instruments and the Internet. It includes a comparison of the media instruments and the Internet in order to find out the most effective media instrument for comprehension and remembering. The second aim of this study, after finding the most effective media instrument, is to find the preferences of the user of these instruments in terms of the presentational formats. The results of this study indicate that comprehension and remembering are not due to the individual effects of a stimulus, but rather an increase in the quantity of stimuli also increases the preference of users. When users are exposed to multiple stimuli, they select the dual-stimuli format with which they feel most comfortable, or they are most familiar. (Contains 3 tables.)",

To construct new knowledge, educational technology materials are used. These materials are related to the model's goals and objectives. The new model is described as a five-step systematic planning process: (1) input; (2) process; (3) output; (4) feedback; and (5) learning. This process can be used to plan a variety of instructional approaches, ranging from teacher lectures to hands-on student-centered activities.

        "description":"This study examined the challenges faced by the Pakistani higher education system (HES) in integrating information and communication technology (ICT); it aimed at understanding ICT needs, measuring the increase in ICT demand, determining the relationship between ICT and HES performance, and understanding how the HES copes with the challenges of implementing ICT. The results of these analyses were used as the basis to suggest solutions. The normative Delphi method was applied to evaluate a sample of 30 HES experts randomly selected from urban and rural areas of Pakistan by administering a literature-based 35-item questionnaire. The experts revealed significant gaps in ICT demand and supply, ICT use, ICT-based higher education problems, and reasons for delays in ICT integration and provided suggestions for developing ICT-driven HES in Pakistan. This study's findings suggest that an effective and robust HES ICT policy could greatly improve the status of the Pakistani knowledge-based economy, thus helping establish ICT policy and planning, administration, and integration at the higher education level.

        "description":"This experimental study was done to see if using computer supported notation and vocalization program for teaching songs instead of using block flute accompanied song teaching has any significant effect on students' singing behavior. The study group is composed of the 5th, 6th and 7th graders of 2008-2009 educational term in T.O.K.I. Yahya Kemal Beyatli Primary School, Turkiye Yardimsevenler Dernegi Primary School and Turan Primary School in Burdur province. The song titled &quot;Bir Dunya Birakin&quot; was taught to randomly chosen pilot group of 5th, 6th and 7th graders accompanied by block flute and it was also taught to the experimental group accompanied by notation and vocalization program written in the stringed orchestra using aural-song teaching method for 10 minutes, then the students sang the song without any accompaniment one by one and these were recorded in the tape. In these recordings, the success rate of the experimental and pilot groups were evaluated separately by three experts in terms of singing the song in accordance with its melody, singing the song in accordance with its rhythm, singing the lay of the song in accordance with its rhythm, singing the song in accordance with its intonation and singing the song as a whole. The data were processed in the SPSS program, frequency was used to get the means and t-test was used to see the success differentiation between the two groups. When the data were analyzed, it was concluded that the experimental group had a higher level of success in all the five dimensions mentioned above. In the result of the study, it can be argued that teaching songs accompanied by multi-sound written in notation and vocalization program will bring a new aspect to music teaching, contributing easy application and higher success rate.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of variations in text density levels and the cognitive style of field dependence on learning from a CBI tutorial, based on the dependent measures of achievement, reading comprehension, and reading rate, and of lesson completion time. Eighty college undergraduate students were randomly assigned to text density levels, after being assigned to three cognitive style groups: field dependent, field neutral, and field independent, based on their Group Embedded Figure Test scores. Instruction was delivered by means of two versions of a CBI tutorial: low density text and high density text. A two-way analysis of covariance was used to investigate whether there are main effects and interactions between the cognitive style of field dependence and text density levels. In order to control statistical power and to equate the treatment groups, Nelson-Denny Reading Comprehension Test scores were used as a covariate. The analysis of regression coefficients between text density type and dependent variables and between field dependence and dependent variables were shown in tables. Although the findings show non-significance in formal tests of hypotheses, a preference for the high-density level was found. Then, the interaction effects between field dependence and text density levels on dependent measures were clarified. Six research questions converted to statistical hypotheses were tested according to the factorial design model. Specifically, the tests of hypotheses generated discussion and conclusions were given at the end of the study. (Contains 1 figure and 5 tables.)",

In a statewide reform effort to improve teacher quality in Georgia, the State Department of Education, Board of Regents, and Professional Standards Commission have all adopted the Georgia Framework for Accomplished Teaching (Georgia Department of Education, 2003.). The Georgia Systemic Teacher Education Program (GSTEP, n.d.) developed this framework with a grant funded by the U.S. Department of Education. The Georgia Framework provides a description of accomplished teaching using six broad categories of teaching skills and abilities: curriculum and content, knowledge of students and their learning, learning environments, assessment, planning and instruction, and professionalism. This qualitative study focused on a Career and Technical Education (CTE) preservice teacher education program that has been structured around the Georgia Framework. Student teachers provided in-depth reflections on their skills and abilities in the six broad areas described in the Framework. Findings support use of the Georgia Framework for Accomplished Teaching in CTE teacher preparation. Students felt most prepared in the areas of curriculum and content, knowledge of students and their learning, planning and instruction, and professionalism. Students felt less prepared in the areas of learning environments and assessment. (Contains 7 tables.)",

Yet, a review of literature revealed that a comprehensive model focusing on the structure and content of EFE was an important element missing from the literature. The primary purpose of this study was to synthesize the literature related to the structure and content of EFE. This study resulted in the development of a four-component model depicting a framework for EFE programs. The four primary components of the model are foundation, organization, implementation, and evaluation. The model provides the structure for developing a variety of early field experiences while maintaining continuity among programs and allowing for cultural diversity and individual flexibility. The EFE model provides a framework for focused research within EFE as well as the development, reorganization, and assessment of EFE programs. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

The CAP program was expected to increase the number of technical graduates in the state. This study reviewed first-year data on the CAP program and found CAP students had earned more credit hours, were more likely to be retained in their degree programs and had higher GPAs than students who did not participate in CAP.

Programs have integrated classroom instruction with laboratory experiences to provide students a significant opportunity to learn. However, it is questionable as to the level of authentic experiential learning instructional practices that are actually taking place. This paper explores the tenets of experiential learning and considers the application of true experiential learning pedagogy into secondary career and technical programs along with teacher education programs in career and technical education. If the concept of experiential learning instructional pedagogy is to provide an authentic context in which students can benefit from it, educators should expand their knowledge of implementing experiential learning into their programs. Additionally, career and technical education teacher educators may enhance their programs by providing instruction to pre-service teachers in authentic experiential learning pedagogy.

The researcher examined the impact teacher beliefs and instructional practices had on students' performance on Florida Comprehensive Reading Assessment Test in 10th grade. Teachers at four schools with a majority of at-risk students were observed and interviewed. Findings showed that teachers at high performing schools emphasized learner-centered teaching and teachers at low performing schools emphasized teacher-centered behaviors. These findings suggest that there is a positive relationship between student-centered learning and Florida Comprehensive Reading Assessment Test performance, and a negative correspondence between Florida Comprehensive Reading Assessment Test emphasis and student success.

        "author":["Mirel, Jeffrey"],
        "description":"For at least a half century, education reformers have quipped that 120th Street in New York City, the street that separates Teachers College from the rest of Columbia University, \"is the widest street in the world.\" Underlying this quip is the belief that Columbia's liberal arts faculty members regularly dismiss the child-centered educational methods promoted by their colleagues at Teachers College as at best misguided and at worst anti-intellectual. In turn, professors at Teachers College routinely denounce their liberal arts colleagues as musty traditionalists who fail to recognize that most elementary and secondary students in American schools find discipline-based education useless and irrelevant to their lives. And for more than a century, teacher educators and their colleagues in the liberal arts have failed to collaborate in linking two of the most vital aspects of the instructional experience--subject matter and pedagogy. Today, however, with the movement toward a common core curriculum and the growing influence of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) in schools and colleges of education, there is a new and exciting opportunity to span the subject matter and methods divide. Realizing this opportunity will take a great deal of work, long-term commitments, and lots of goodwill. But if the last century of failed unilateral reforms teaches people anything, it is that both sides need each other and that even the widest street in the educational world can be bridged if colleagues on both sides agree to meet each other halfway.

        "description":"Focusing directly on the development of instructional practice and its effects is not easy. One major shortcoming in the educational infrastructure has been the lack of a common curriculum. A second has been an impoverished approach to supporting teaching practice. These two are related, for any effort to develop and improve teaching is weakened when there is no agreement about what to teach. Taken together--no agreed-upon curriculum and no system for developing skilled teaching practice--hope for instructional improvement is slim. In this article, the authors propose a departure from inherited ideas about instruction and its improvement. Their proposal shifts away from individual &quot;style&quot; and open-ended &quot;learning from experience&quot; as the building blocks of practice, and emphasizes instead the importance of common professional standards. Given the strong individualistic culture that permeates teaching and learning to teach in the United States, why might a shift to shared specific standards for professional practice be possible? The Common Core State Standards, which specify a set of learning goals in mathematics and English language arts, represent a watershed for this country. They offer the possibility of a common foundation on which a stronger educational infrastructure could be built. And more Americans now understand that skillful teaching is crucial for students' success. Skillful teaching can make the difference between students being at the top of the class or the bottom, completing high school or dropping out. (Contains 14 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Self-regulation refers to the ability to inhibit the automatic response and to do something else; more generally, it refers to the ability to control one's emotions, to control attention and other cognitive processes, and to plan and control behavior. This capacity turns out to have enormous consequences for academic and social success. And, as teachers observe daily, children differ widely in how much of this capacity they seem to have. Recent research indicates that teachers can help students--especially students having the most trouble--by providing an organized classroom environment, and by removing elements in the environment that can trigger impulsive behavior. Helping students better self-regulate is a daunting task because it seems such a personal, permanent quality of an individual. But researchers have shown that it is open to change, and they also have shown that good self-regulation is associated with a broad spectrum of positive academic and social outcomes, and that poor self-regulation is associated with greater risk for correspondingly bad outcomes. These facts highlight the urgency for teachers to do all they can to help students grow in this area. (Contains 49 endnotes.)",

Teachers hold those future earnings before their students like a carrot while beating them with a fear of failure. No wonder then so many dig in their heels at the sight of anything as impractical as poetry. How can one expect anything else when this attitude is validated from the very educators, school boards, and state superintendents most responsible for deciding what students should know?

A standardized interview protocol was utilized with 98 directors chosen to represent a range of center types from across the three main regions of the state. Interviews were conducted over the phone. The study examined the kinds of preparation that these directors received for their work as program leaders, the areas that these directors identified as strengths and weaknesses, and the kinds of professional development that they perceived as necessary to perform their jobs well. Results indicate that given the wide range of qualifications and work experiences among directors in this mixed service delivery system, targeted professional development focusing on both administration and early childhood content is needed. These findings suggest that policy makers and administrators of preschool programs should conduct needs assessments of their preschool directors and school leaders to ensure that professional development opportunities address different levels of experience and expertise appropriate for leaders working in these systems. Because of the complexity of leading programs with mixed sources of funding and policy mandates, it is also suggested that competencies be articulated for preschool leaders and that institutions of higher education develop early childhood leadership preparation programs.

The purpose of this survey study was to explore the support strategies that parents use to facilitate their children's friendships. Forty mothers of preschool-age children completed surveys. Both groups of mothers (parents of children with and without disabilities) reported using similar strategies to support their children's friendship development. However, mothers of children with disabilities engaged directly in the children's play far more frequently than did mothers of typically developing children. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Most attention has been paid to infants' relationships with adults. However, children are increasingly spending greater amounts of time in group care and with peers at even the early stages of infancy. In these settings, adults are often fearful of the interactions between children of this age because toddlers do not yet understand how they might harm others. This study explored what happens when infants are given the opportunity to interact with older children, such as toddlers and 2-year-olds. Teachers and administrators in an infant room and toddler/2-year-old classroom carefully examined the relationships between children over the course of a year and began over time to cultivate these relationships, focusing on building relationships between the infants and the toddlers/2-year-olds. Findings support the idea that these children, with support, can be quite capable in interacting with each other. (Contains 26 figures.)",

This particular teaching team struggled with several factors--the demands of fitting Conscious Discipline to every child and to various classroom situations, questions or doubts from some parents, the apparent lack of response and incomplete communication from program administrators, discrepancies between the administrators' and teachers' views of the implementation and efficacy of Conscious Discipline, and the conflicting demands of addressing both academic and social-emotional outcomes.

Material and methods: The following groups of schoolboys aged 12 years were studied: untrained control (UC; n = 14) and those training swimming for two years. The latter ones were subjected to 8-week training in classical style (CS; n = 10) or free style (FS; n = 13). In all boys maximal oxygen uptake (VO[subscript 2]max) was determined, and the CS and FS groups were subjected to 6 tests: swimming at 50 and 400 m distances (time recorded) and to 12-min swimming (distance recorded), all by free and classical styles pre- and post-training. From swimming times at 50 and 400 m distances the so-called critical swimming speed (CSS) was computed: CSS = (400 - 50) / (t[subscript 400] - t[subscript 50]). Results: No training-induced improvement in VO[subscript 2]max was noted in any group. Yet, boys subjected to classical style training significantly (p less than 0.05) improved their free-style swimming velocity at CSS and at the 400-m distance by about 6%, and their heart rate following the 12-min test in classical style decreased by nearly 16% (p less than 0.001) compared with the pre-training values. Conclusions: The 8-week training in given swimming style does not negatively affect the performance in other style than the trained one. This may be of importance in competitive training.

Not only does a lack of activity result in a decrease in quality of life for women during term, but the effects can carry over well after pregnancy, potentially leading to increased morbidity and mortality. What's more, reduced prenatal activity can cause adverse effects on the foetus, with impairments seen in physical health as well as cognition. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to examine the socio-demographic data and psychosocial influences that modify exercise behaviours in pregnant women and, second, to make recommendations as to effective intervention strategies that can be adopted by health and fitness professionals to help improve maternal exercise participation and adherence.",

The latter ones undertook Nordic Walking training (3 sessions a week throughout the school year). Group A undertook no motor activities except regular PE classes. At the beginning (Pre) and at the end of the study (Post) all boys were subjected to 7 fitness tests: 50-m run (50 m), shuttle run 4x10 m (SR4), 1000-m run (LDR), sit-ups (SUP), standing broad jump (SBJ), pull-ups (PUP) and stand-and-reach (STR). Results: Mean Post-Pre changes in Group N evidenced significant improvements, compared with Group A, in most studied variables--body mass, body fat content, 50-m dash velocity, PUP, SUP, STR, SR4 velocity, no significant, unfavourable changes being noted. Conclusions: Nordic Walking, being an attractive form of activity, may be an easy way to encourage people to undertake motor activities thus improving the health status.

In depth qualitative interviews were conducted with Washington State Legislators, legislative staff, key state education agency officials, and college and university representatives. Document analyses of agency records, public hearings, testimonies, position papers, reports, and public meeting records were also conducted. This study found that Washington has many key programs in place to enhance student transitions between the K-12 system and the higher education, but the state's current approach lacks coherence and cohesion. This study also found that the state has developed a new and innovative model with the potential to solve many transition related issues, but it will require assessment to determine its actual effectiveness.

After adjusting for student traits, local education agency characteristics, and the mix of available special education services, a multilevel logistic regression analysis suggests that students who had more severe and thus more expensive disabilities were less likely to attend an Arizona charter school. Findings from an ancillary set of hierarchical linear models suggested that special education students enrolled in charter schools were less expensive on average than similar traditional public-school special education students.

Consistent with previous research, we find evidence of increased racial segregation. Greater percentages of African-Americans attend charter schools than reside in surrounding areas. We add to the existing charter school literature by more fully considering the importance of charter school supply and examining student enrollments across three geographic scales: school districts, census tracts and block groups. We demonstrate that racial segregation is most severe within charter schools' immediate neighborhoods (i.e. block groups), suggesting that analyses comparing charter schools to larger school districts or nearby public schools may misrepresent student sorting. This finding appears to result from the tendency of charter schools in New Jersey to cluster just outside predominately African-American neighborhoods, encircling the residential locations of the students they are most likely to enroll.

        "description":"Using Kentucky as a case study, the research described in this paper examines efforts to provide equality of educational opportunity. Standards based educational reform has produced myriad data on student achievement that are used by educators, policy analysts, legislators, and researchers to discern progress. This research makes use of multiple sources of data (CATS index, reading proficiency, math proficiency) in an attempt to more thoroughly consider progress in attempts to ameliorate gaps in student achievement that have been found to exist as related to local wealth. Findings from the study show mixed results. Although local wealth has decreased as a predictor of student achievement in reading, it is still a significant predictor of achievement in math. Gaps are closing more rapidly at the elementary school level which suggests the need to study the process of education at the secondary level. Lastly, student demographics, especially students qualifying for free and reduced lunch continue to be a significant predictor of student achievement. We conclude that changes to state accountability systems that move the unit of analysis from the school to the student level offer the best opportunity to utilize emerging research methodologies that will enable practitioners and analysts to better analyze educational process.

This paper describes issues to consider when designing a longitudinal data collection and management system, drawing on seven years' experience developing such a system. The recommendations provided stem from an attempt to use data collected for accountability more broadly to look at the specific issue of teacher retention and attrition. Recommendations include: involve stakeholders in all phases of the project; minimize staff turnover; attend fastidiously to record keeping and documentation; minimize changes in measures; expect that costs will be underestimated; and gather data on multiple cohorts.

        "description":"School choice is intended to leverage competition between schools to produce better educational opportunities for disadvantaged students. Yet we know very little about how competition impacts entire populations of schools of different types in distributing educational options across segregated social landscapes. We draw on theories from the literatures on institutional environment, organizational behavior, and positioning strategies to investigate how different types of schools (public, private, and charters) respond to market competition within Metropolitan Detroit's highly competitive and segregated environment. Mapping illustrates patterns of school types that have opened, relocated, and closed relative to socioeconomic and demographic neighborhood contexts. Our analysis explores the location incentive of high vacancy rate as proxy for affordable spaces suitable for new schools. Findings suggest that competitive incentives have similar effects on different types of organizations. (Contains 4 maps, 1 table, and 5 footnotes.)",

        "description":"In this manuscript we examine an example of globalization--the international organization-aided reform of faculties of education in Egypt. We first sketch the historical context during which secondary and primary-level teacher education became a part of Egyptian higher education. Then we draw on extensive documentary analysis and our own roles as observant participants to investigate the objectives, organization, and activities of two projects launched during the early years of the 21st century to achieve goals ascribed to the government of Egypt: a) the &quot;Faculty of Education Enhancement Project&quot;, which was a component of the Higher Education Enhancement Project funded by the World Bank, and b) the &quot;Faculty of Education Reform Project&quot;, which was part of the Education Reform Project funded by the United States Agency for International Development. We describe how the proposed policy and practice reform ideas reflected global discourses, while at the same time exploring the interplay between and among local and global actors and identifying individual and organizational factors that enabled or constrained these efforts to improve the quality of pre-service teacher education in Egypt. In particular, we document how these two projects, with similar objectives, operated in a relatively separate manner during planning and implementation stages, limiting the impact that they might have had if their activities had been more fully coordinated. This study thus contributes to theoretical debates about globalization as well as provides insights for educators, national government officials, and international organization personnel who seek to champion or resist global educational reform initiatives.

This program was funded through the generous support of anonymous donors, and a federally-funded evaluation is underway to examine potential changes that result from its implementation. This paper situates perceptions of school climate in this moment of punctuated equilibrium of school reform, and in the context of this universal postsecondary scholarship program. This evaluation research draws from multiple data sources including interviews with educators, and surveys and interviews with students in the school district. Findings indicate that school climate has improved since the announcement of the program. We discuss the implications of research findings and the potential of the Kalamazoo Promise as a catalyst for systemic change in the district. (Contains 1 table, 1 footnote and 3 figures.)",

Outcomes of both assessments showed correspondence in 6 of the 10 cases and partial correspondence in a 7th case. Results of the standard functional analysis suggested reasons for obtained differences in 2 cases of noncorrespondence, which were verified when portions of the trial-based functional analyses were modified and repeated. These results indicate that a trial-based functional analysis may be a viable assessment method when resources needed to conduct a standard functional analysis are unavailable.

Although maternal vocal imitation has been associated with later verbal development, its potentially reinforcing effect on infant vocalizations has not been explored experimentally. This study examined the reinforcing effect of maternal vocal imitation of infant vocalizations using a reversal probe BAB design. Eleven 3- to 8-month-old infants at high risk for developmental delays experienced contingent maternal vocal imitation during reinforcement conditions. Differential reinforcement of other behavior served as the control condition. The behavior of 10 infants showed evidence of a reinforcement effect. Results indicated that vocal imitations can serve to reinforce early infant vocalizations. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)",

Because most early research on FM DRO included presentation of a signal at the end of the DRO interval, it is unclear whether the limited effects of FM DRO were due to (a) the momentary response requirement of the schedule per se or (b) discrimination of the contingency made more salient by the signal. To separate these two potential influences, we compared the effects of signaled versus unsignaled FM DRO with 4 individuals with developmental disabilities whose problem behavior was maintained by social-positive reinforcement. During signaled FM DRO, the experimenter presented a visual stimulus 3 s prior to the end of the DRO interval and delivered reinforcement contingent on the absence of problem behavior at the second the interval elapsed. Unsignaled DRO was identical except that interval termination was not signaled. Results indicated that signaled FM DRO was effective in decreasing 2 subjects' problem behavior, whereas an unsignaled schedule was required for the remaining 2 subjects. These results suggest that the response requirement per se of FM DRO may not be problematic if it is not easily discriminated. (Contains 4 figures, 1 table, and 1 footnote.)",

Identification of the RCH comprised the baseline phase, during which computer access was denied by saying \"no\" and providing an explanation for the restriction. Two alternative methods of saying \"no\" were then evaluated. These methods included (a) denying computer access while providing an opportunity to engage in an alternative preferred activity and (b) denying immediate computer access by arranging a contingency between completion of a low-preference task and subsequent computer access. Results indicated that a hierarchy of problem behavior may be identified in the context of denying access to a preferred activity and that it may be possible to prevent occurrences of escalating problem behavior by either presenting alternative options or arranging contingencies when saying \"no\" to a child's requests.

The efficacy of and preference for three strategies that varied in teacher directedness were assessed in a multielement design and concurrent-chains arrangement, respectively. The strategy that involved the most teacher direction was most efficacious and preferred. In addition, embedded teacher prompts, common in child-led teaching procedures, functioned as a punisher for the child's toy play. Implications for designing effective and preferred teaching conditions are discussed. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Following the model and prompts, all participants showed immediate significant increases in intraverbal categorization, and all prompts were quickly eliminated. Use of audible self-prompts was evident initially for all participants, but declined over time for 3 of the 4 children. Within-session response patterns remained consistent with use of the problem-solving strategy even when self-prompts were not audible.

        "description":"It has been suggested that verbally sophisticated individuals engage in a series of precurrent behaviors (e.g., covert intraverbal behavior, grouping stimuli, visual imagining) to solve problems such as answering questions (Palmer, 1991; Skinner, 1953). We examined the effects of one problem solving strategy--visual imagining--on increasing responses to intraverbal categorization questions. Participants were 4 typically developing preschoolers between the ages of 4 and 5 years. Visual imagining training was insufficient to produce a substantial increase in target responses. It was not until the children were prompted to use the visual imagining strategy that a large and immediate increase in the number of target responses was observed. The number of prompts did not decrease until the children were given a rule describing the use of the visual imagining strategy. Within-session response patterns indicated that none of the children used visual imagining prior to being prompted to do so and that use of the strategy continued after introduction of the rule. These results were consistent for 3 of 4 children. Within-session response patterns suggested that the 4th child occasionally imagined when prompted to do so, but the gains were not maintained. The results are discussed in terms of Skinner's analysis of problem solving and the development of visual imagining. (Contains 9 figures, 1 table, and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"We observed 11 undergraduates in an experiment designed to simulate infant caregiving. In negative reinforcement conditions experienced by all participants, a targeted caregiving response (e.g., rocking a baby doll) produced escape from, and avoidance of, a recorded infant cry. Nine participants' caregiving was shown to be controlled by this negative reinforcement contingency. Nine participants experienced an extinction condition that consisted of an inescapable cry, and the previously reinforced caregiving responses of 2 of these participants were resistant to extinction. For both of these participants, the previously reinforced response was eliminated when an alternative form of caregiving was reinforced. These results highlight the role of negative reinforcement in infant caregiving and suggest the need for additional research on the effects of crying on caregivers as well as the development of effective strategies for minimizing infant crying.

        "description":"Previous research indicates that pairing pictures with associated words when teaching sight-word reading may hinder acquisition (e.g., Didden, Prinsen, & Sigafoos, 2000; Singh & Solman, 1990; Solman & Singh, 1992). The purpose of the current study was to determine whether this phenomenon was due to a previously learned association between the spoken word and picture (i.e., blocking) or due to the mere presence of a picture as an extrastimulus prompt (i.e., overshadowing). Three participants were taught to recognize words that were presented alone or paired with pictures that the participants either could or could not identify prior to training. All participants learned the words more quickly when they were presented alone rather than with pictures, regardless of their prior learning history with respect to pictures representing the words. This finding is consistent with the phenomenon of overshadowing. Nonetheless, consistent with blocking, all participants also acquired the words presented alone more quickly if they could not identify the associated pictures prior to training. Together, these findings have important implications for using prompts when teaching skills to individuals with developmental disabilities. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)",

A possible reason for lack of response variability emitted by children with autism is that they do not have a variety of response forms in their repertoire. Multiple-exemplar training through the use of scripts is one strategy that has been used to build verbal repertoires of children with autism. Extinction also has been shown to increase response variability. Given the effectiveness of script training in increasing verbal repertoires and the effectiveness of extinction for increasing response variability, the authors attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of these procedures, in isolation and in combination, on the response variability of young children with autism as they requested preferred items during snack time. Results demonstrated that extinction following script training was effective for increasing variability for 2 of the 3 participants. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "author":["Misawa, Mitsunori"],
        "description":"Bullying is a serious problem in contemporary American society. Many adults are now suffering from bullying, which has conventionally been thought of as a childhood behavior. While a general form of bullying has been focused on by contemporary scholars, specific types of bullying (racist bullying and homophobic bullying) have not well been studied. Furthermore, no study on the intersection of racist and homophobic bullying exists at this point. This article examines how racist- homophobic bullying is manifested in adulthood in the context of higher education. First, some concepts of general forms of bullying and bullying based on race and sexuality are stated. Then, narratives from two gay male college students of color are provided as examples to conceptualize racist-homophobic bullying. Last, implications for adult educators and Human Resource Development (HRD) practitioners are provided to lead anti-bullying initiatives in learning and workplace environments.",

        "description":"This manuscript takes as its centerpiece fragments of the author's personal story of growing up as a closeted lesbian in school, in the Fortune 500, and in the community and of a number of years attempting to integrate her lesbian identity into her professional persona--outside of the closet. This manuscript makes an attempt at a \"duality search\" based on the work of Boje (2001), deconstructing the story as it examines the bifurcation between personal and public and, in this case more exactly, professional and sexual orientation identities. The tension between closeted outsider and the prevailing expectations for promising \"insiders\" in organizational settings is viewed in this manuscript through two related frames. The first draws from the concept of the Borderlands as articulated by Gloria Anzaldua (1987), and Adrienne Rich's (1979) work and perspective on lying. The second peers into the story through the lens of Benita Luckmann's (1978) concept of the modern emergence of separate, small worlds. [For Part One, see EJ905795.]",

        "description":"The idea for a pre-conference session focusing on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender  (LGBT) issues in human resource development (HRD) seemed an appropriate topic for an international conference on HRD. The LGBT rights movement has been closely linked with the world of work and the opportunities made available through shifts from an agrarian economy (see D'Emilio, 1993; Foucault, 1978). The modern gay rights movement started in 1969, when patrons of a New York gay bar, The Stonewall Inn, fought back after a routine police raid (D'Emilio & Freedman, 1997). The riots that resulted from this raid launched the modern demand for LGBT rights. In the years since 1969, unprecedented gains in this movement have resulted in awareness and acceptance in many venues and situations, including workplaces. Policies banning discrimination based on sexual orientation have appeared at state, local, and organizational levels. More companies than ever offer domestic partner benefits, and LGBT employee groups (e.g., affinity networks) have formed within many organizations. However, as is the case with many movements, change does not come easily. In her observation of the gay rights movement as a whole, Hornsby (2006) notes that these changes have resulted in backlash and fear. The resulting conflict is apparent in many places, including workplaces. In response to this conflict, Hornsby (2006) recommends a strong foundation of LGBT-friendly policies in the workplace to both protect individuals and foster inclusion. However, efforts to promote this protection and inclusion can be difficult. The purpose of this essay is to illustrate the difficulties that can be associated with civil and workplace rights movements, as experienced by organizers of a pre-conference on LGBT workplace issues.",

The design selected for this study was quasi-experimental. A total of 140 students took part in the study and they were selected by a random sampling technique. A structured questionnaire titled Students' Attitude Towards Physics Questionnaire (SATPQ) on 4-point scale was used to collect the data. The Students' Attitude Towards Physics Questionnaire (SATPQ) was validated and trial-tested to establish reliability using Cronbach Alpha. The instrument had a coefficient of internal consistency of 0.86. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used in analyzing the data. The result of the findings showed that cooperative learning strategy was the most effective in facilitating students' attitude towards physics. This was then followed by competitive strategies with the individualistic learning strategies being seen to be the least facilitative. The results also showed an insignificant gender difference in the attitude of students toward physics when taught with cooperative, competitive and individualistic learning strategies. Consequently, it is recommended that cooperative learning strategy should be used in schools to facilitate students' attitude towards physics. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Two of the three teachers considered that the strategies resulted in limited academic gains, but provided opportunities for students with MD to enhance their social experience. All students were positive about certain changes to their classroom, particularly in working with their peers, but did not see the classroom teachers' instructional methodologies as being different, despite a series of changes to the classroom pedagogy.

This involves various departments of state and federal governments, third-party bodies funded by government such as the Curriculum Corporation and Teaching Australia, and non-government organisations such as the Business Council of Australia. These agencies are producing models and principles which aim on establishing standards of best practice for how they want teachers to teach. Within all of this activity the term &quot;pedagogy&quot; is often employed to represent aspects of these best practices. Examples include &quot;productive pedagogies&quot;, &quot;new pedagogies&quot;, &quot;pedagogical content knowledge&quot; and &quot;pedagogical strategies&quot;. However these are all means only without any end purposes which identify them as being valuable for education. In this paper I will argue that in order to have educative value teachers themselves must exercise a degree of professional autonomy to bring their own end purposes to their choice of pedagogy.",

It does so on the grounds that such understandings, and the essentialist discursive knowledges informing these, fail to take account of the complex and multifarious ways in which boys come to construct themselves as masculine subjects. In demonstrating the short-comings of such \"common sense\" understandings, and indeed to need to call these into question, the paper examines the ways in which a group of boys took up positions of dominance within their classroom and, more specifically, focuses upon the ways in which they came to perform as embodied masculine subjects. In doing so, it explores the repertoire of practices, or range of performance techniques, mobilised by these boys--a repertoire constituted by, and constitutive of, hegemonic versions of masculinity.",

Overall results of the study suggested that the relationships among teacher efficacy, motivational beliefs, and conceptions about teaching and learning are not negligible.

        "description":"In this paper I argue that the kinds of literacy needed for making sense of information on websites is more nuanced and embedded in our everyday context that we are currently providing for learners. The kinds of analysis of websites which allow the processing of information in context are presented. This is demonstrated by an analysis of a scam site, which sold non-existent tickets to the Beijing Olympics and a description of a phishing attempt at Twitter. The skills required to understand information presented on the web have evolved far quicker than the parallel shifts in road safety skills, and people are now required to read web sites contextually if they are to be able to make informed decisions about information available on the World Wide Web. It is proposed that this is achieved through education rather than filtering out undesirable information. (Contains 4 footnotes and 4 figures.)",

        "description":"Transformational learning, according to Mezirow (1981), involves transforming taken-for-granted frames of reference into more discriminating, flexible &quot;habits of mind&quot;. In teacher education, transformative learning impacts on the development of students' action theories, self-efficacy and professional attributes. Although considered imperative to reflective practice, not all students take a transformative, &quot;double-loop&quot; approach to learning; reflexive and adaptive learning are also identifiable. This paper discusses the integration of the three learning approaches in the conceptualisation of LEARnT Theory (Jones, 2008), whereby Learning evolves as: Efficacy informs Actions, and Reflection impacts Theory building. LEARnT integrates reflexive, adaptive and transformative approaches. In Reflexive approaches, learning is restricted, action theories remain covert, efficacy remains stable and actions are automated. In Adaptive learning, reflection is &quot;single-loop&quot; in nature; it involves the modification of concepts whilst maintaining existing schema; theories of action, efficacy and behaviours may alter. LEARnT theory provides a challenging paradigm for a larger study into teacher education student learning approaches. (Contains 4 figures.)",

The current study assessed North Queensland teachers' knowledge on youth suicide. The sample comprised 201 secondary school teachers. A survey research design was used and data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Teachers scored, on average, 69% of the knowledge statements correct; however only 15% correctly recognized a high-risk situation. There was substantial variability in the accuracy of knowledge on youth suicide with some teachers maintaining high levels of knowledge, and others having very little accurate information. Findings highlight the need for youth suicide education for teachers in order to fulfil this &quot;gatekeeper&quot; role in dealing with suicidal students. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Studies have established that with a well developed and structured tutoring programme, as well as high quality training and supervision, volunteers can be used to provide tutoring in a one-on-one early intervention reading programme. The current study suggests that there is an opportunity for preservice teachers to gain valuable information to increase their knowledge of the reading process, while providing effective support to schools as trained tutors.

Of particular focus are teacher education courses that model interdisciplinary ways of working. The inquiry found that interdisciplinary course work was replicated and built upon by beginning teachers and where schools encouraged the notion of interdisciplinarity beginning teachers flourished as designers of curriculum.

Despite the frequency with which teachers and teaching are treated metaphorically there has been no previous systematic attempt to explore them in Greece. Our paper seeks to fill this void by examining the various metaphors used by teachers to describe the experience of teaching and suggests how and to what extent the understanding of the metaphors can be useful in exploring teachers' beliefs and how they may contribute to teacher education programs. A questionnaire was devised to a sample of 156 in-service teachers which focused on teachers' metaphors and their beliefs about teaching, teacher-student roles, classroom climate and their beliefs about knowledge. The findings of our research illustrate the various metaphors that Greek teachers hold, indicating that they have probably not elicited and elaborated them. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)",

In this paper we describe how the process of conceptualising an innovative first year teacher education program, designed to facilitate student retention and engagement, increased our own engagement, motivation and teaching practice. Our experiences suggest that collaboration in Higher Education is not only beneficial to those involved in a community of practice, but also enhances student engagement and transition.",

        "description":"The main purpose of the study was to ascertain the benefits of employing a hybrid evaluation approach to assessing a teacher education programme's objectives or intended outcomes. The benefits of employing the hybrid evaluation approach enacted through its evaluation survey component was seen in the fact that it acts as a guide for participants' thinking, facilitates the acquisition of a broad overview of their thoughts and could provide stakeholders with statistical data, if needed. The benefit of employing the hybrid evaluation approach enacted through its reflective journaling component, was seen in the fact that journaling helped participants to carry out in-depth &quot;thinking about&quot;, and formulating written perceptions of various aspects of the programme. The strength of the hybrid evaluation approach rests in the combined and simultaneous use of both components in a single process of programme evaluation.",

There were three stages in the investigation: First, open-ended questions concerning the boiling and freezing of water were given to two groups of prospective primary school teachers (Group-A had science background; Group-B had non-science background). Second, the participants' answers were examined and analyzed. Finally, those participants who had misunderstandings were given semi-structured interviews to have a deeper insight into their perceptions. The results showed that the participants in Group-B held more misunderstandings about boiling and freezing than Group-A. A further examination of the participants' perceptions showed that the misunderstandings were based on participants' daily life experiences related to an inadequate knowledge of science. This paper discusses the answers received to the questions and interviews and makes, implications for equipping primary school teachers with scientific knowledge. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The study shows that many refugee students in Australian high schools experience difficulty with academic transition in mainstream classrooms due to their previous experiences in war-torn countries. As a result of the trauma suffered, many refugees have difficulty adjusting to the host society. The problem is   further exacerbated by the fact that many of the refugees may not previously have had any form of formal schooling. Their literacy development may therefore be impacted by both individual and structural factors. Structuration theory helps us understand how literacy was improved for these refugee students and how practice was mediated as a result of the Refugee Action Support program.",

        "description":"Over the last decade in Australia, the role of the teacher has changed. Teachers are now expected to model and foster in their students a wide range of skills such as critical thinking, self-regulated learning, knowledge of self and others and lifelong learning. These changes are having a significant impact on the design of pre-service teacher education programmes, with university educators re-evaluating the teacher training curriculum and embedded pedagogical processes in order to consider how they might develop these skills in pre-service teachers. One approach is to consider the processes and practices inherent in philosophical inquiry. This paper reports on three participants' reflections of a 12-week philosophy programme that was conducted for teacher educators at Queensland's University of Technology (QUT) in 2008. The programme was facilitated by teachers from Buranda State School who have been teaching philosophy in their P-7 school for more than ten years. This paper provides insight into teacher educators' reflections on the philosophy programme and the associated changes and challenges of implementing such a programme in pre-service teacher education degrees.",

However, research regarding the attractors of teaching has been conducted almost entirely in developed countries and has not focused on particular subject areas to be taught. In addition, only limited lists of attractors have been used. Accordingly, the main purpose of this study was to examine what attractors influence people who choose teaching biology as a career, and what about the Turkish culture has caused people to make this career choice. The sample consisted of 37 freshman biology student teachers (31 female, 6 male). The questionnaire included open-ended questions that were used to determine the student teachers' ideas about their career decisions. According to the results of this qualitative study, enjoy working with children or adolescents, enjoy biology and light workload were attractors that were mostly reported by student biology teachers. In addition, competitive job market, national examination system, family customs, and religious beliefs in Turkey were determinants of some attractors. (Contains 8 tables and 1 figure.)",

It examined the social effects of the online mailing list technology on their participation and factors that influenced their collaboration with other colleagues. In mapping these elements, the motivations of educators and the effects on online communities of practice can be distilled and then used to build and sustain other architectures of participation. It was found that mailing list subscribers seem to trade a currency of support, thoughts, ideas and answers, which helped them in their day-to-day teaching. Online communities of practice provide a convenient way to keep up professional networks while continuing to stay abreast with subject specific knowledge and skills. The findings of this case study may be generalised to other educational mailing lists to guide designers and managers and inspire educators to join and ultimately benefit from these text based online environments.

This paper discusses one response, a collaborative self-study, around the introduction of an e-portfolio as a pedagogical device. It highlights two key aspects of the study: first, it considers how collaborative self-study as a methodology proved crucial for sustaining lecturer motivation and commitment to the innovation; second, it describes how the e-portfolio was used to enhance the student experience in the science curriculum area which can be a challenging curriculum area for some students.

        "author":["Hudson, Peter"],
        "description":"Australia has had many inquiries into teaching and teacher education over the last decade. Standards for teaching have been produced by national education systems with many state systems following suit. The Queensland College of Teachers (QCT) advocates ten professional teaching standards for teachers and preservice teachers. How can preservice teachers be measured against advocated professional standards? This study investigated 106 second-year preservice teachers' perceptions of their development against the QCT standards. A pretest-posttest survey instrument was developed based on the QCT standards and administered to these preservice teachers before and after their science education coursework. Percentages, ANOVAs and t-tests were generated to analyse the results. Findings indicated that 22 of the 24 paired pretest-posttest items were highly significant (p less than 0.001). Percentage increases ranged from as low as 27% in the pretest to as high as 97% in the posttest, yet, there were two items with lower significance (i.e., working in professional science education teams and supporting students' participation in society). Understanding preservice teachers' perceptions of their abilities to implement these standards may be a step towards the process of determining the achievement of teaching standards; however, more rigorous measurements will need to be developed for both teachers and preservice teachers. University coursework and related assessments can provide an indication of achieving these standards, especially authentic assessment of preservice teachers' practices. (Contains 3 tables.)",

It involved forming three-way or &quot;triadic&quot; partnerships, consisting of a final year pre-service primary teacher and an in-service colleague, to teach science in the colleague teacher's classroom, with the support of a teacher-educator. The pre-service teachers had to collaboratively plan, develop and deliver a sequence of science lessons and take major responsibility for teaching a 90 minute science lesson, at least once a week over a six week period. The data was collected during 2007 and 2008. The pre-service teachers kept a reflective journal of their experiences using a process devised to guide and support them. The results indicated improved attitudes to and confidence in teaching science for the pre-service teachers and their in-service colleagues. The results indicate triadic partnership approach may be an effective way to support teacher professional learning in science. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Second language teacher education community has become increasingly interested in the pedagogical knowledge base of teachers as a window into practitioners' mental lives. The present study was conducted to document likely differences between the pedagogic thoughts of experienced and less experienced teachers. Eight teachers participated in the project. Data were collected through the use of stimulated recall. The analysis of the data shows that there are differences both in the number and the order of the thoughts teachers produced in different groups. Experienced teachers produced an average of five pedagogical thoughts per minute, while their less experienced counterparts produced 3 thoughts. The top thought category for less experienced teachers was Language Management, while for the experienced teachers Self-Reflection ranked first. Some thought categories were also absent in the report of less experienced practitioners. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"This paper presents snapshots of a qualitative study that investigated how Year 8 boys in an ethnocentric community school configured their constructions of masculinity. Fifteen boys participated in focus group discussions that extended over a six-week period. For one focus group, the boys were invited to bring a &quot;totem&quot;, which was an embodiment of their masculinity. The findings from the focus groups revealed both collective and individual constructions and enactments of masculinities that were talked into existence and transmitted through hegemonic discourses. Yet the findings also revealed the boys' individual agency to engage with other ways of doing and being a boy. Key recommendations emerging from the study include the need for boys to have opportunities to talk more openly among themselves about their gendered identities and for access to the thinking and experiences of how masculinity might be conceived within a wider community of practice.

        "description":"A former head of the American Federation of Teachers, Albert Shanker, once called out-of-field teaching education's &quot;dirty little secret&quot; (Ingersoll, 2003, p. 5). The practice of allowing or assigning teachers to teach subjects or year levels for which they do not have any formal qualifications has lead to considerable debate within the educational community. Such concerns over the possible negative impact of out-of-field teaching on students, teachers and the broader school community led the Western Australian College of Teaching (WACOT) to commission an exploratory empirical study of the extent of the phenomenon in Western Australia. This paper presents the main findings from the empirical study and literature review and seeks to contribute to a greater understanding of the extent, causes, impact and possible solutions to the phenomenon of out-of-field teaching.",

It is argued that better outcomes may result from a more strategic &quot;tailoring&quot; of mentoring &quot;type&quot; for different aspects of new teacher induction, especially as school-based mentors often have insufficient time or training to support them. The ESP has been trialling its more &quot;distanced&quot; mentoring model, tracking the issues that a group of new teachers chose to discuss with their mentors, and exploring this further through focus groups and case studies. The project has indicated that more flexible, off-campus mentoring assistance may serve some needs particularly well, and that it may also alleviate the pressure placed upon teachers in schools. A secondary aim of the ESP research was to prepare an appropriate resource for teachers, based on its findings, and this has now been done. (Contains 4 figures.)",

Three hundred and seventy-six teachers from 12 elementary schools in Nigde, Turkey participated in the study. Teachers were chosen by the three-layer group sampling method according to the socioeconomic structures of their districts. In this study, the Student Control Ideology Scale and the Maslach Burnout Inventory were used to collect data to answer the research questions. The correlative investigation model was adopted in the research and SPSS 17.0 was used to analyse the data gathered. Pearson moment's correlation coefficient analysis showed that there were some negative significant correlations among teachers' student control ideologies and their perceived burnout levels. It was also found that teachers' student control ideologies were significant predictors of their burnout levels and approximately 17 per cent of the total variance for teachers' burnout was explained by their student control ideologies.

This involves being able to control a wide range of language functions, which are how speakers use language for requesting, congratulating, apologizing, complaining, consoling, and promising, among many other functions. The author was relieved when she found that the popular game of \"Sudoku\" offers an ideal, authentic context for incorporating modal verbs and colloquial expressions to teach the useful language functions known as \"confident hypothesizing\" and making \"logical conclusions.\" Playing Sudoku provides a meaningful context for many learners to get actively involved in generating, at a very high frequency, the functional language of confident hypothesizing and concluding. Likewise, the colloquial expressions and language of challenge come so naturally in the context of a game that one forgets how highly form-focused the language of play actually is.

        "description":"According to Ur (1996, 120), &quot;of all the four skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing), speaking seems intuitively the most important.&quot; Indeed, whether for business or pleasure, a primary motivation to learn a second language is to be able to converse with speakers of that language. However, in addition to being an important skill, speaking is also a great challenge for foreign language learners, and students must master several difficult microskills, including the pronunciation of unfamiliar phonemes, the correct placement of stress and intonation, and the appropriate use of formal and informal expressions. Opinions are divided on how to go about making a change in the way English is taught, although many see a problem with the traditional overemphasis on grammar and vocabulary in English classes where students receive intensive but separate practice in reading, writing, and listening, with no speaking involved. In this article, the author presents three activities that provide students with opportunities to practice their spoken English. In the activities described, integrating speaking and reading skills deepens students' understanding of the reading material, reveals any problem they have understanding a text, and, most importantly, lets them apply the information they have read into authentic speaking practice that improves their fluency.",

All the states have their stories, but as a string of islands in the vast Pacific Ocean, more than 2,000 miles from any other land mass, Hawai'i has a story that is unique in many ways. Consider, for example, that Hawai'i has two official languages, English and Hawaiian. In this article Hawaiian words are spelled following the accepted method of including the &quot;okina&quot; (a backwards apostrophe indicating a glottal stop) and the &quot;kahako&quot; (a macron over the vowel indicating that it is lengthened). Perhaps more importantly, one calls Hawai'i the &quot;Aloha State&quot; for good reason. Although the word &quot;aloha&quot; is used to say &quot;hello&quot; as well as &quot;good-bye,&quot; its basic meaning is &quot;love, affection, kindness&quot;--something people in Hawai'i earnestly try to show to each other and extend to Hawai'i's many visitors.",

However, many of the language teaching techniques and materials require students to rely heavily on these skills. The use of textbooks and handouts, the assigning of tasks and homework, and the planning of a syllabus or curriculum all presuppose competent organizational skills in students. This article presents a rationale and approach for incorporating organizational skills development into the mainstream curriculum to help all students and especially to help those students with weak organizational skills, without setting them apart from the rest of the class. While students need much more than organizational skills to learn a language, mastery of this set of skills can foster student success in the language learning classroom. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Student presentations may consist of either individual or group speeches based on class lessons or outside projects. Debates are interactive tasks, and usually require a greater degree of organization. They can be held with two or more students who take turns speaking on either side of an issue. The public speaking tasks suggested here rely on authentic language use and communication toward an audience.

        "description":"Upper-level English classes often pose special problems for teachers. Known as English for Specific Purposes (ESP), this type of English instruction integrates the specialized subject matter of the field into the classroom. ESP requires the acquisition of highly specialized terminology and the ability to explain formal processes as students prepare for the high-level competence they will have to demonstrate in their chosen careers. Because this advanced material is often difficult and challenging, students can easily fall behind or become nonresponsive. It is therefore imperative for teachers to use methods that make upper-level classes effective and communicative. One good solution is task-based teaching, which links pair and group work with relevant activities to make language lessons more interactive, thus increasing student engagement and comprehension. This article describes how the author implemented task-based teaching to improve language learning in an upper-level ESP class for engineering students. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"For many university teachers of English as a foreign language (EFL), the study of literature is indispensable because it exposes students to meaningful contexts that are replete with descriptive language and interesting characters. Structuring lessons around the reading of literature introduces a profound range of vocabulary, dialogues, and prose. In addition to developing students' English language skills, teaching literature also appeals to their imagination, develops cultural awareness, and encourages critical thinking about plots, themes, and characters. Most importantly, the activities that one can apply with literature lessons easily conform to the student-centered and interactive tenets of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT). Unfortunately, many postgraduate EFL teacher-training courses focus mainly on language teaching methodology and offer little guidance on the analytical methods that are essential to interpreting literature and designing effective classroom activities. This article presents a basic review of six approaches to teaching literature and includes a discussion based on the author's own experience as well as feedback from colleagues who are familiar with the different approaches. Although this discussion pertains to the university-level EFL context in Vietnam, it can be generalized to the wider global audience of instructors of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL).",

        "description":"Since the launch of far-reaching higher education reforms several years ago, many institutions across Morocco have begun revamping their English for Special Purposes (ESP) programs to bring them in line with the needs of local employers. These reforms recognize the correlation between what students learn in class and success in their future professions. Therefore, a main objective of English departments is to ensure that ESP courses impart the key communicative skills that are most useful to graduates in their chosen careers. An important component of an effective ESP course is a textbook that contains job-related English lessons. However, there often is a mismatch between the content of ESP textbooks and actual workplace language demands. To help teachers recognize and rectify the mismatch, this article describes a three-step method to (1) collect data about the needs of employees and employers; (2) use that data to evaluate classroom material--in this case an ESP textbook for English language learners who work in the local Moroccan hospitality industry; and (3) supplement the ESP textbook to make it more relevant to the employment setting.

Teacher-centered lessons featuring lectures on sentence structure and how to write effective paragraphs are bound to create passive students who do not take an active role in class. Clearly, English classes need to be more interactive to keep students interested in the lessons. After ten years of teaching the author has learned that English need not be a boring subject; on the contrary, it can be fun if teachers supplement the formal lessons with alternative methods and techniques. In this article the author shows how teachers can easily adapt available games and develop new ones to add some fun and excitement to the learning process. In addition, she reports on feedback from her students regarding how they feel about the use of games in the ESL classroom. (Contains 1 note.)",

With English being the dominant language of the Internet, international business, and academia (including science), beginning and advanced students alike face pressures to develop their second language (L2) reading abilities. The acquisition of reading skills, however, is never easy, and students need consistent practice to become fluent readers. But what can teachers do to motivate students to read in English? Some research on this subject points to successful methods and techniques, such as choosing reading topics that appeal to students, assigning material and tasks at the right level, organizing collaborative work, and offering positive feedback and other incentives for students' efforts. However, in their efforts to motivate students to read, teachers often do not realize that different instructional methods actually promote different types of student motivation. The purpose of this article is to distinguish among these different types of motivation and illustrate how to apply motivation-supportive instructional strategies in the classroom to create a dynamic environment where reading comes alive.

        "author":["Kellem, Harlan"],
        "description":"In English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms, where acquisition of English is the ultimate goal, one of the main tasks for the teacher is to provide students with language input and activities that best aid them in their learning process. As different researchers have reported, including poetry-based activities in the EFL classroom is beneficial. Among other reasons, poetry is a source of content-rich reading material; a model of creative language in use; a way to introduce vocabulary in context; and a way to focus students' attention on English pronunciation, rhythm, and stress. Two main pedagogical approaches to teaching poetry and literature have their roots in literary criticism: (1) Stylistics, an approach that analyzes the language forms of the text; and (2) Reader-Response, an approach that concerns itself with the reader's interaction with the text. Although these two approaches are typically considered mutually exclusive, one way to marry the two when teaching poetry is to use what the author calls the \"Formeaning Response\" approach. This approach places equal importance on the study of language elements and on responding personally to poetry. This article first reviews the Stylistic and Reader-Response approaches and their roles in second language acquisition, and then demonstrates how to combine them to teach poetry in the EFL classroom with the Formeaning Response approach.",

        "author":["Byrd, Anne Hammond"],
        "description":"Cooperative learning, put quite simply, is a type of instruction whereby students work together in small groups to achieve a common goal. Cooperative learning has become increasingly popular as a feature of Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) with benefits that include increased student interest due to the quick pace of cooperative tasks, improved critical thinking ability, and the opportunity to practice both the productive and receptive skills in a natural context. The array of benefits extends beyond increased language learning to include increased self-esteem and tolerance of diverse points of view. Although cooperative learning has numerous variations, Johnson and Johnson (1999) indicate five features of a successful cooperative learning activity: (1) students learn that their success depends upon working together interdependently; (2) students are individually accountable while achieving group goals; (3) students support and assist one another's success through face-to-face interactions; (4) students develop social skills by cooperating and working together effectively; and (5) students as a group have the opportunity to reflect on the effectiveness of working together. When these principles are realized, cooperative learning creates a rich environment for students to learn language and simultaneously develop their capacities for collaborative twenty-first-century communication and problem solving. Students can reap all of these benefits by working cooperatively in the classroom, so it is no wonder that teachers desire to pool the resources in the classrooms, namely the students, to maximize student learning through cooperative learning opportunities. In this article, the author offers language teachers hoping to implement successful cooperative learning activities with young learners seven suggestions for helping students.",

        "description":"The challenges of teaching writing and encouraging students to write are many. However, one of the most difficult issues to deal with is students' reluctance to write in any language, even their home language. Because of this reluctance, being asked to write in English as a foreign or second language can feel like a double burden. Learners of English often are not confident that they have the basic writing skills or the language skills needed to compose a piece of writing in English. This article suggests ways to build students' confidence in their ability to write in English. One way to address the issue is by creating opportunities for students to state what they perceive they are able to do. The statements students produce about their perceived abilities can be referred to as I-can statements, such as \"I can write names of foods in English\" or \"I can write about daily activities in English.\" This approach is most effective when students are given a target so that even before they begin, they have a sense of what they are expected to accomplish. In this article, the authors present a series of basic writing activities that demonstrate how I-can statements can be used. While the activities are appropriate for young learners, they can benefit students of any age who are in the beginning to lower-intermediate stages of learning English.",

Besides giving teachers something tried and true to work with, successful lesson plans help teachers reflect upon what makes an approach to language teaching effective in the classroom. An excellent way to share a successful idea with colleagues is to write down detailed step-by-step procedures to implement the lesson and then hand them out to colleagues. Teachers often eagerly collect such materials; some collections of classroom activities are preserved for years and adapted by other teachers for students of all ages and abilities. One of the more formal ways to share an idea is to write an article for publication in the English department's newsletter or in a professional teacher's journal. Often teachers feel at a loss as to how to transform a lesson plan into a publication. In this article, the author describes five essential steps to prepare an article for publication.

        "author":["Salas, Spencer",
          "Mercado, Leonardo"],
        "description":"While an extensive body of literature in TESOL studies the different paradigms that drive second language (L2) teachers' conceptualizations of their professional identities and practice, there is still a need for more research into how L2 supervisors construct the realities of supervision and how their interpretations of those realities inform their interactions with teachers. Often, supervisors charged with improving teacher practice through a collaborative cycle of formal observation, feedback, and evaluation use their memories of experiences with supervisors as a guide. Unfortunately, the memories that supervisors typically work from derive from a vertical top-down supervisor-teacher relationship. Consequently, both parties commonly frame observation and post-observation exchanges as a time for the supervisor to identify and correct what was \"wrong\" in that particular classroom on that particular day--hopefully with little protest on the part of the teacher. The authors believe that L2 teacher observation and feedback can and should be much more. In this article, they argue that rather than a checklist of what was \"right\" or \"wrong\" and a prescription for fixing those errors, teachers need broader strategies to make their instruction respond dynamically to the changing contexts and circumstances of classrooms. Referring to L2 teachers and the L2 classroom, Kumaravadivelu (1994) calls these big ideas about teaching \"macrostrategies\". The authors contend that supervisors need macrostrategies too--big ideas about teaching and big ideas about working for and with teachers. This article enumerates six macrostrategies which are specifically directed toward supervisors. At the same time, however, the authors believe that teachers working by themselves or wanting to work better with their colleagues can consider how these guidelines might enrich their own reflective practice.",

However, professionals in disability service offices typically report that while they understand and value the need to evaluate their programming, they are often too overwhelmed with the daily needs of individual students to find the time to engage in program evaluation (Goodin, Parker, Shaw, & McGuire, 2004). Experts in service provision for students with disabilities at the postsecondary level were asked to participate in a study that would culminate in an assessment tool for the purpose of evaluating a disability services office. The outcome of the study is the iEvaluate OSD assessment instrument.

Participants reported that the Office for Students with Disabilities acted as an important support mechanism at the overall school-level. Findings indicate that postsecondary institutions should support students with disabilities not only by providing accommodations but also by addressing hidden attitudinal barriers to enable equal participation opportunities for all.

Coaches in the study had extensive qualifications, including specific training to address the needs of college students with ADHD. Three major themes emerged from qualitative interviews conducted with participants. First, students reported that their goal attainment skills improved by working with their coaches. In addition, students stated that they enjoyed working with coaches, whom they found to be effective and supportive. Finally, coaching helped students achieve a greater sense of well-being and self-regulation. These findings from thematic analysis of interviews are supported by quantitative data including administration of the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI), which resulted in a substantial mean gain pre/post in self-regulation, and analysis of students' grade point average data. It appears that coaching holds promise as an emerging type of academic support for college students with ADHD to promote improved executive functioning. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

The Common Core State Mathematics Standards (CCSMS), which were released in June of 2010, have been adopted by almost all states and will be phased in across the nation in 2014. The main difference between these standards and most of the others is that the CCSMS are mathematically very sound overall. They could serve--at long last--as the foundation for creating proper school mathematics textbooks and dramatically better teacher preparation. In this article, the author gives two examples of the kind of change the CCSMS (if properly implemented) will bring to the mathematics classroom. (Contains 7 footnotes and 10 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Successful early college high schools (ECHSs) are formed through partnerships between high schools and colleges (usually community colleges). Think of it as preparation through acceleration. ECHSs enroll disadvantaged students who have not excelled with ordinary grade-level academic content and have them take college courses while still in high school. It is not easy--and it does not always work. But successful ECHSs support their students in five ways: (1) Instead of relying on student choice, ECHSs show students what content and skills they need for college and provide a \"package-deal curriculum\" that leads to mastery of that content and those skills; (2) Instead of assuming students are motivated, ECHSs \"foster motivation\" by offering incentives and bolstering students' confidence; (3) Instead of student-initiated guidance, ECHSs \"keep students on track\" by providing frequent mandatory guidance and closely monitoring students' progress; (4) Instead of a student-initiated college search, ECHSs \"manage the transition\" from high school to college; and (5) Instead of assuming that students have study skills, ECHSs explicitly \"teach study skills\". Like other education reforms, ECHSs have often been presented as a sure-fire way to boost student achievement. After all, these schools seem to offer a simple solution: just incorporate college courses into high school. In this article, the authors take a close look at each of the five features of successful ECHSs and show how the reality of these schools is much more complex.

        "description":"In 2005, the Hidalgo Independent School District made an ambitious commitment. In partnership with nearby University of Texas-Pan American, the University of Texas System, the Communities Foundation of Texas/Texas High School Project, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the district promised that all of its students, not just a select group, would earn college credits before graduating from high school. This commitment by a small district in South Texas could be seen as part of a nationwide pattern: many districts are engaged in high school reform efforts to improve the college readiness of students. Many are also actively supporting dual enrollment in college classes for motivated students. But Hidalgo appears to be the first comprehensive public school district in the United States to expect all students to earn college credits--including credits in career-focused college programs--while in high school. The demographics of Hidalgo's student body--99 percent Hispanic, 89 percent economically disadvantaged, and 53 percent English language learner--make this commitment even more remarkable. The story of how this district took up the mantle of providing college credits for all its students--and how students and families responded--says a lot about the priorities of &quot;this little treasure on the border,&quot; as the district has become known.

In this regular feature, the work of professional educators is explored--not just their accomplishments, but also their challenges--so that the lessons they have learned can benefit students across the country. After all, listening to the professionals who do this work every day is a blueprint for success. This story of the partnership between the Pittsburgh Public Schools and the Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers offers a powerful counterpoint to the current rhetoric about district-union relations. At its core, the story is deceptively simple. District and union leadership modeled a new way of partnering. Successive, successful collaborations on issues that grew in complexity built trust, capacity, and a sense of possibility. A commitment to focus on vision and problem solving created space for creativity. And engaging teachers at every step in the work built ownership, leveraged expertise, and led to better results for teachers, the system, the union, and, most importantly, for students and their learning. There are important lessons to be learned from Pittsburgh's transformation from traditional, adversarial management-labor relations to the productive partnership that exists today.",

        "author":["Sticht, Thomas G."],
        "description":"The idea that families need to provide enriching educational activities is not new. In 1908, Edmund Burke Huey, regarded as \"one of the foremost leaders\" in educating children with learning disabilities, wrote, \"The school of the future will have as one of its important duties the instruction of parents in the means of assisting the child's natural learning in the home.\" This insight was just one of many in his classic work \"The Psychology and Pedagogy of Reading,\" a 500-page book so highly regarded that it was reprinted by the MIT Press in 1968 and again by the International Reading Association in 2009. Today, a substantial body of scientific evidence supports Huey's call for the instruction of parents in the means of improving children's learning at home, and therefore their learning at school. Much of this evidence comes from the best research in early childhood education and, in particular, one recurring finding: the most effective early childhood education programs include \"early parenthood education.\" The results of studies of major early childhood education programs suggest that some of the long-term academic and social outcomes of early childhood education result not so much from the direct education of the children, but rather from education provided to highly disadvantaged parents. Changes in parenting help explain why relatively short-term education programs for children could sustain them through school, and into adulthood. Better parenting provides a long-term educational intervention for children. In this article, the author takes a closer look at why Huey concluded that schools would need to teach many parents to facilitate learning at home. As Huey understood--and cognitive scientists have since demonstrated--literacy follows oracy, so parents who foster their young children's listening, speaking, vocabulary, and knowledge are also fostering success in school.

Based on their research findings and their personal engagement with open-ended problem photos, the authors argue that while the process of developing open-ended problem photos is not without its challenges, it can ultimately enhance an educator's ability to connect with mathematics in ways that open possibilities for seeing mathematics differently. They contend that through creating open-ended problem photos, teachers and students will see mathematics through a new lens. (Contains 4 figures.)",

        "description":"There is persistent evidence of poor levels of financial literacy in a number of sectors of the Australian community. Young people, in particular, tend to fare badly in studies of financial literacy levels. A recent study commissioned by the Commonwealth Bank Foundation found that 16-25 year-olds constitute 42% of the bottom quartile, and only 4% of the top quartile in  terms of their financial literacy (Commonwealth Bank Foundation, 2010). Yet it is this age group whose financial literacy skills can potentially be influenced through school education. It is not surprising that schooling is seen as an essential contributor to financial literacy levels, and that, given this evidence, more needs to be done. The advent of the &quot;Australian Curriculum&quot; creates an opportunity to meet the important challenge of lifting young people's financial literacy levels and mathematics can play a key role. The &quot;Australian Curriculum: Mathematics&quot; provides a platform to contribute significantly to the improvement of consumer and financial literacy levels among young people through the teaching and learning of mathematics. It will do this in two ways. Firstly, and most critically, it will ensure that key aspects of financial mathematics are taught. Secondly, by using financial contexts, it will enable effective learning of other mathematics in the curriculum. Mathematics embedded in the richness of financial contexts also helps build students' ability to &quot;think and do&quot; mathematically and strengthen their abilities in the broader General Capabilities.

And the teachers in those schools want simple, strategic instructional frameworks for developing their students' basic and digital age skills while meeting diverse learning needs. But as many technology integration specialists know, satisfying all those wants in every lesson is no easy task. The authors partnered with the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center and Apple to develop a toolkit that is simple, scalable, effective, and even portable. They call it the digital backpack. A digital backpack is just what it sounds like: an actual knapsack that contains an array of digital and hardware tools, resources, and instructional materials handpicked to engage learners in project- or problem-based learning (PBL) experiences.

A comparative anatomy lab was implemented over two years at a small, rural, private, liberal arts college. Students dissected their choice of five vertebrate species, mastered the location, function and gross evolution of the digestive and cardiovascular systems, and analyzed intestinal length and heart mass among sets of species. Instructors and students reported significantly more collaboration and reflective learning than in other exercises. The comparative approach highlights several evolutionary trends and created testable data at an equivalent cost to previous fetal pig dissections. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

Immunology lab, a senior level course (60 students/year) was formerly taught in a traditional mode, with exercises aimed at learning lab protocols. To engage students in understanding we connected the protocols to their use as reported in research articles, employing an interrupted case study method called Literature Based Learning (LBL). Our goals were to give a research context to learning basic protocols, engage students in reading scientific literature, and increase students' understanding of how standard techniques are employed to address a research question. An end of semester experimental design project using mock research scenarios culminated the research oriented learning. Pre-course surveys revealed that nearly 25% of students had never been asked in the course setting to read a primary research article. Post-course surveys revealed that 94% of students thought that after the course they knew more about research and over half of the students agreed that the literature-based assignments had raised their confidence in their ability to understand scientific articles. We found that the LBL approach was an effective mechanism to engage our students in research oriented learning. While easy to implement, it had a dramatic outcome. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Most undergraduate physiology texts describe veins simply as reservoirs for blood and conduits for return of blood to the heart. This article describes a laboratory exercise that can be performed by students to demonstrate that veins are much more than reservoirs and conduits for blood flow: they possess a dynamic rhythmic contraction. In this exercise, we recorded the simultaneous beating of the frog postcaval vein (PCV; in mammals this is the inferior vena cava) and atrium by connecting them to separate force displacement transducers. \"in vivo,\" the PCV and atrium both contract approximately 35 beats/min; however, the contractions are not synchronous with each other. We developed a simple scoring method (comparative temporal analysis) to illustrate that the atrium contractions do not drive the contractions of the PCV. Instead the atrium and PCV contract independently of each other. To support our hypothesis that the atrium and PCV contractions were independent we removed the PCV from the frog and suspended it in an organ bath. The PCV rhythmically contracted as \"in vivo.\" The autonomic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine, did not affect the force of contraction and heart rate. In contrast, acetylcholine abolished the contractile activity. This investigation has encouraged discussions about the source and physiological significance of the rhythmic PCV contractions. This article provides some hypotheses about its significance, as well as possible evolutionary origins of the veins' mechanical activity. Overall, the implementation of this exercise into the classic frog heart preparation will deepen the students' understanding about the venous side of the cardiovascular system and give them insight into the integrative nature of physiology.

An important factor in this is how many technical words are used. I developed an index to calculate logodiversity, a term I coined that reflects the number of technical words and the usage frequency of those words. The college-level animal behavior textbooks I examined varied greatly in their logodiversity. A fairly reliable substitute for the more time-consuming calculation of logodiversity is the ratio of pages in the glossary to the number of pages in the text as a whole.

        "description":"The increase in publications presenting molecular evolutionary analyses and the availability of comparative sequence data through resources such as NCBI's GenBank underscore the necessity of providing undergraduates with hands-on sequence analysis skills in an evolutionary context. This need is particularly acute given that students have been shown to bring misconceptions about evolution to the classroom, and these misconceptions can hinder their learning about genetic sequences, mutation, and evolutionary processes. However, undergraduate institutions sometimes lack sophisticated analytical software in student computer laboratories. Here we present a computer laboratory exercise utilizing freely available analysis software, and which is designed to analyze sequences that can be obtained from GenBank or other online sources. The exercise is flexible in its complexity, allowing instructors to modify the lab to suit the needs and skills of their classes, and was significantly helpful to introductory biology students in understanding the basics of sequence variation and analysis.

We sought to create a gene-based teaching project to improve students' understanding of gene structure and to integrate this into a research project that can be implemented by instructors at the secondary level or higher. We modified a previous project performed within a genetics course in which students designed and tested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers based on expressed gene products from specific biochemical pathways. Students used these skills to investigate a gene that they hypothesized would be related to the multiple sclerosis phenotype in humans. They were each required to identify the gene structure (exons and introns) of their selected gene and to design primers around these elements. A total of seven genes hypothesized to interact with the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) phenotype were used to design 154 primers (77 forward and 77 reverse). Based on the structure of each gene, these primers were combined as 83 unique pairs and tested by seven students. A total of 25 pairs were visibly polymorphic and 58 pairs were monomorphic. All materials, including primer design protocols, modifiable gene graphics files, screening preparation documents and assessment information are presented to allow replication of this project.

        "description":"Effectively integrating writing into biology classes gives students the opportunity to develop a better understanding of and engagement with course content. Yet many instructors remain reluctant to emphasize writing. Some are concerned about the time commitment writing assessment requires. Others shy away from emphasizing writing in their classes because they have limited experience doing so and no training in responding to student writing. Here, drawing on both research and direct experience, we address those concerns, providing a justification and concise blueprint for integrating writing into biology classes in such a way as to maximize the benefits to students and minimize faculty effort. As a starting point, we suggest that faculty approach student writing as attempts at communication rather than as texts in need of proofreading. Building on that starting point, we introduce the main classroom practices, assignments, and pedagogical considerations that have yielded benefits, including drafting and revision techniques, rubrics, sample questions, a prioritization scheme for responding to student writing, and time-management tips for faculty. Instructors can use these strategies singly or in combination to add a more significant writing component to their classes. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

This course was part of a longitudinal project (Project Nexus) which prepares, supports and sustains upper elementary and middle level specialist science teachers. We sought to understand the impact of the course in terms of students' content understanding and in terms of students' feedback to the course. To determine students' content understanding we used a pre-post content survey. To document the use of teaching innovative approaches in the class we interviewed all participants, including the lecture and the lab instructors and their students, to get their perspectives. Also, all lecture classes and laboratory sessions were videotaped and observed by three university science educators. Our findings suggested that the instructor taught in the way that he planned. Positively, while the course placed an emphasis on modeling good pedagogy and promoting teaching science as a career option, significant gain in science content was achieved by the students.

The Experimental Design Ability Test (EDAT) measures students' understanding of the criteria for good experimental design through their open-ended response to a prompt grounded in an everyday life science problem. Using a straightforward scoring rubric to analyze student responses, the EDAT provides for consistent and rapid evaluation. Minimal student and classroom time is required to administer the EDAT and it can be used in a pre-/posttest format to measure gains. Significantly, the EDAT is content and terminology independent, and requires minimal quantitative skills. Our findings indicate that the EDAT is sensitive to improvements in experimental design ability, as only students in our sample who participated in a redesigned introductory biology course that included explicit instruction and experiences using the scientific method, made significant gains in their experimental design ability.

Purpose: The purpose of this project was to use a community assessment to establish if there is a need for community partnerships in a rural Northern Colorado county. Methods: A mixed-methods design using an online survey and focus groups was used to collect data. Results: The analysis of the online survey indicated strong support for community partnerships and analysis of focus group transcriptions found both barriers and solutions to human service delivery. Discussion: Survey responses indicated a perception of support, involvement, and interest in community partnerships; however, focus groups revealed that although some partnerships do exist, significant improvement is needed to better serve disparate populations.

Methods: A quasi experimental design examined changes in middle schools students' (N = 1,476) nutrition knowledge, self-efficacy and behaviors, relative to a control group (N = 656), in response to a 6-lesson nutrition education intervention. Results: For dietary knowledge and self-efficacy, there were significant group and time main effects and group x time interactions. In addition, there were significant group and time main effects and a group x time interaction for the dietary behaviors related to consuming fruits, vegetables, meats and \"other\" food groups, but not dairy or grains. Discussion: The constructivist-oriented professional development, curriculum and instruction yielded significant changes in middle schools students' nutrition knowledge, self-efficacy and behaviors.

They will be investors and stakeholders in the quality of public education, and the health and academic success of students. Purpose: In this article we present the process used to develop a theory-based instrument that can help to assess changes in intentions to advocate for school health education after exposure to an advocacy training intervention conducted with college students enrolled in personal health courses. The instrument constructs were developed based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Methods: Researchers used a comprehensive instrument design framework, involving the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing and four stages of pretesting to develop and test the instrument items. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the relationship among ordinal items in the Likert-type instrument and the constructs in TPB, which the items were developed to measure. Results: Fit indices for the structural model indicated that the proposed model provided a satisfactory fit for the data. Therefore, the final instrument consists of 53 items, measuring intentions of students to engage in school health education advocacy, as a result of implementing an advocacy-training lesson. Discussion: This study resulted in an instrument to measure the effectiveness of an advocacy-training lesson for college students that produces valid and reliable scores.

Methods: Michigan and Colorado health workers contacted families with a previous pregnancy or child affected by an NTD, identified through NTD recurrence prevention programs. Families were interviewed to identify the number of second-degree relatives of child-bearing age. Families mailed surveys to these relatives, who returned them to the state health departments. The survey assessed folic acid use, views on having an affected child, and reproductive planning. Folic acid education materials were sent to relatives who provided contact information. Results: Folic acid supplement use among relatives was similar to that of the general population, despite elevated risk perceptions. Discussion: Both state health departments plan to increase efforts to contact affected families and their relatives through partnerships with family support groups.

Among these individuals are children living with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Increasing numbers of children in the United States have been diagnosed with ASDs, a group of developmental disorders for which no specific cause or cure has been conclusively identified. Increasing media exposure as well as legislation addressing ASDs reflects the increasing awareness of ASDs as a significant public health issue. However, whereas ASDs have become an issue of great interest to the general public, the amount of health education literature addressing autism spectrum disorders is extremely limited. This paper provides health educators with a review of literature concerning autism spectrum disorders, specifically its background, prevalence, possible causes, symptoms and diagnostic methods. Furthermore, the potential roles played by health educators in serving individuals (e.g., parents, educators, medical providers) who support children with ASDs is suggested through the application of National Commission for Health Education Credentialing, Inc. responsibilities and competencies for health educators.",

        "description":"For much of our country's history, citizenship has eluded American Indian people. With this in mind, the authors conducted a study to determine the perceptions of eighth and eleventh grade American Indian students regarding citizenship. We wanted to find out what American Indian students believe are the attributes of a good citizen; what activities they are currently participating in that are related to good citizenship; and what citizenship activities they see themselves performing ten years later in life. The results of the research study indicated that American Indian students' views of citizenship were grounded in community service rather than in political engagement. For these students, volunteering in community and tribal activities seemed to be an alternative to political activity. Voting and running for political office and engaging in political activities were many times equated to participating in their local tribal organization. However, the fact that these students do not focus to a great extent on political engagement may not be cause for alarm. Their involvement in civic activities in the community and the tribal organization is providing a strong foundation for future civic and political engagement. (Contains 48 notes and 1 table.)",

        "author":["Lazarakou, Elisabeth D."],
        "description":"The present study examines the ancient Greek history curriculum and the corresponding textbook as they are implemented in the fourth grade of primary school in an aim to determine whether and to what extent empathy is recognized as a fundamental tool for historical understanding. A close examination of the curriculum revealed that empathy is not explicitly included among the skills which are to be taught in the history class. Nevertheless, the special nature of the curriculum under study contributes towards a creation of an educational setting in which it is possible for empathetic procedures to take place. The study supports that the empathetic activities appearing in the history textbook are limited in number. These activities are mostly composed of undisruptive historical events that have no serious consequences and carry no emotional charging. Because of this reason, historical events offering more advantageous opportunities for empathetic processing are not touched upon. Similarly, the historical material that supports the empathetic activities of the textbook is limited. The instructions provided in the teacher's book are also inadequate. In this framework, the empathetic comprehension of history disengages from the historical method and is primarily based upon pupils' imagination and intuition. (Contains 31 notes.)",

From qualitative observations, interviews and written reflections, the data of four education students who traveled to Macedonia from the United States and five education students who traveled to the U.S. from their country of Macedonia, the data demonstrate how perspective consciousness emerged across three themes: &quot;resources&quot;, &quot;religion&quot;, and &quot;political&quot; consciousness. Looking across these themes, the authors present conclusions about the conditions that may foster or hinder perspective consciousness, such as substantive knowledge about a place, seeking common ground (rather than differences), and at times putting one's own deepest beliefs aside. The data hold several implications for fostering a global perspective in colleges of education and especially within their global exchange programs, adding current findings to Hanvey's and Merry Merryfield's claims about attaining a global perspective.

This article argues that media literacy is best conceptualized as a thinking disposition that evaluates the construction of media form, content, and impact over time as both an art form and an industry, as well as a cultural, social, and political force. Utilizing film as an exemplary case study of a medium that fosters historical thinking, this article illustrates a mutually beneficial alignment between the construct of historical understanding and an articulation of media literacy as a dispositional inclination to think critically about media messages and representations. This alignment has the potential to foster critical consumerism and active citizenship, both inside and outside formal educational settings. (Contains 35 notes.)",

        "description":"This study replicates a 2005 study of the status of social studies in the K-5 curriculum in Indiana. The current study reports the results of a comprehensive survey (33 fixed and 2 open-ended) of a stratified (by grade) random sample of K-5 teachers in Indiana (n = 385; response rate = 32%). Results indicated a continued marginalization of social studies relative to other core areas (e.g. mathematics and English/language arts) as found in the previous study. Two of the three factors reported in the previous study still seem to play a role in this marginalization: (1) perceived level of administrative support for implementing social studies standards; and (2) lack of a state-wide high stakes assessment for social studies at the K-5 level. The third factor, teachers' lack of a clear understanding of the goals and mission of social studies may also be a contributing factor, but requires further analysis and will be discussed in another report. The current study provides a second point of reference that may indicate a trend. However, the report indicated that attitudes by teachers toward the social studies may be changing. The current study finds that respondents devoted less time to social studies instruction than they did in the previous study. This occurred despite the fact that more teachers were aware of and used the Indiana Academic Standards for the Social Studies in their planning. As in the previous study, there was an association (albeit slightly weaker) between administrative support for social studies and time devoted to social studies instruction. The report concludes that the status of K-5 social studies education is worse than it was four years ago and that social studies in the Indiana K-5 curriculum is a discipline at risk.

After almost four decades of study abroad (SA) research, the literature offers little insight into teachers' professional development abroad. The following article attempts to situate the recent sojourn of the BC teachers within the field by presenting an overview of some of the major research trends of SA research as well as summarizing how teachers have been acknowledged in the literature to date.

Drawing on considerations of these issues within empirical, theoretical, and popular literature, the authors point out that the current tensions are borne of conflicting ideals about what should comprise the requisite educational experience of students who learn in atypical ways in an age where learner difference is fully expected to be accommodated. Through this analysis, the authors consider how FSL teacher education programs could become sites for reconciling these tensions and potentially enabling greater inclusion within FSL programs, even though their current structures could explain some of the tensions that exist between the fields of special and FSL education.

To this end, the present article draws on the findings of a larger research project which focused on a discussion forum activity carried out with pre-service English second language (ESL) teachers during a practicum in Francophone schools in the province of Quebec. The specific question addressed in this article is: How do pre-service teachers view the discussion forum activity in relation to the practicum experience? Data were gathered using a survey questionnaire adapted from Arnold and Ducate (2006) and semi-structured interviews. Of particular note with respect to the results is that students who participated in the discussion forum perceived the exchanges as useful in terms of their professional development as teachers. As few studies have focused on the use of discussion forums in conjunction with a practicum, areas for future research have been identified. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"This paper draws on data from questionnaires and participant discussion posts on WebCT to show how native and non-native English speaking student teachers explore the topic of peer feedback. Engaging in peer feedback for their own draft papers provides student teachers an opportunity to gain experience, then reflect on their experience and consider it in light of course readings and discussions. The data show that participants' comments revolve primarily around an initial lack of confidence in their own and their peers' ability to offer useful feedback; the difficulties of offering criticism without negatively affecting social relationships; and, knowing what to comment on as well as how to formulate the comments. Findings show that both native and non-native English speaking participants share the same concerns. They also show that connecting experience with development provides valuable learning opportunities for the participants. (Contains 6 tables and 3 footnotes.)",

The pan-Canadian questionnaire results suggest that this short, bilingual volunteer experience enhances participant motivation to learn a second official language and to be part of the target community. Triangulated findings from observations, interviews and journals indicate that participants' willingness to communicate (WTC) in the second language (MacIntyre, Dornyei, Clement, &amp; Noels, 1998) may have been influenced by situational factors inherent to the volunteer experience such as access to native speakers of the target language and opportunities for authentic community participation.

Yes/no tests measure word recognition and have been shown to correlate well with other language proficiency tests. The main advantage of using a yes/no test as a placement tool is its ease of creation and administration. We examined the ability of a yes/no test to discriminate between adjacent placement levels in our program and found that it functions up to the low-intermediate level only. This limitation may be due to the way vocabulary is taught, the stages of development of the lexicon, and the learning plateau that intermediate learners appear to reach. Nonetheless, the yes/no test allows for a quick initial sorting of students into different levels and reduces the need for individual placement by instructors. (Contains 3 tables and 4 footnotes.)",

An area that has attracted considerable attention recently is how students and teachers perceive the usefulness of WCF. Most research in this area, however, has focused on students' perspectives, while many fewer studies comparing students' and teachers' opinions. This study investigated how ESL students and teachers perceive the usefulness of different types and amounts of WCF, and also the reasons they have for their preferences. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 31 ESL teachers and 33 ESL students by means of written questionnaires. The results showed that while there were some areas of agreement between teachers and students, important discrepancies in their opinions did occur, not only in how WCF should be provided but also why.

Twenty-nine children from diverse linguistic backgrounds participated in the study. At-risk readers were identified on the basis of their text reading performance and phonological awareness test scores, and received 20 weeks of phonological awareness training in small groups. The intervention was initially given in English, and switched to French once students had acquired a foundation in the language. Significant gains were found in the phonological awareness skills of the treatment group. Results also indicated that the end-of-year French reading levels of the treatment group were superior to those of the comparison group. These findings suggest that a phonologically-based intervention can effectively address phonological awareness deficits and facilitate French reading acquisition for early immersion students who are considered to be at-risk for later reading difficulties.

Kuwaiti EFL students asked to render a mixture of text messages written by their peers and native English speakers into Standard English produced a large number and variety of basic language errors. However, native English-speaking judges were unsuccessful in discriminating between the native and non-native English messages. In addition, the EFL text messages showed that the students were effectively able to achieve their pragmatic aims. Text messaging may therefore have some pedagogical use in terms of motivating the learner. This idea is supported by referring to studies in the literature on text messaging which suggest that the medium may not be as linguistically damaging as is commonly thought. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"This article investigates a language learner's cognitive ability (i.e., form-orientation) in detecting the corrective nature of non-salient feedback, by reviewing the operationalizations and reported effectiveness of recasts in recent SLA literature. Two directionalities which seem to have resulted in the divergent findings of recast effectiveness will be discussed: (a) operationalized (or intact) explicitness or implicitness of recasts, which designate the level of noticeability (i.e., feedback factors) and (b) contextual variables, including where a study was conducted and participants' learning background, which ultimately influence the effectiveness of recasts on language development (i.e., learner factors). To expose learner factors accordingly, learning contexts and learner's explicit knowledge will be discussed as possible variables in forming cognitive orientation. By taking an interdisciplinary approach to explore the constitution of the orientation, namely, SLA, psycholinguistic, and sociocultural approaches, this article concludes that contexts and explicit knowledge interdependently create the cognitive ability that enhances the noticing of implicit recasts, which then arguably determines subsequent language development.

Drawing on knowledge base frameworks in language teacher education (Freeman and Johnson, 1998; Richards, 1998) I discuss how a variety of factors impact the knowledge for language teacher education programs. These factors include the linguistic and cultural backgrounds of teacher candidates in ESL and FSL programs, the different student populations, and the variety of language teaching contexts. Teacher candidates' English or French language proficiency, their personal experiences and understanding of language development, as well as their understanding of real life experiences of ESL and FSL students, impact the development of their knowledge base. I discuss the implications of such nuances for policy and practice in language teacher education programs across Canada. (Contains 1 table and 5 footnotes.)",

One of the processes involved in this development is languaging, the activity of mediating cognitively complex ideas using language (Swain, 2006). The present study of an older adult with mild cognitive impairment living in a long-term care facility involves Alise (the resident) narrating a fragment of her life history. We investigate the hypothesis that languaging will restore aspects of cognitive functioning through a microgenetic analysis of ten recorded sessions totaling 18 hours of conversation between Alise and the researcher. We demonstrate that languaging mediates Alise's ability to recall details of the life history fragment she is recounting with increasing syntactic and lexical sophistication, thus documenting cognitive change.

        "description":"Despite a strong intuitive sense held by instructors that feedback practices can help scaffold L2 writers' composition processes a number of questions remain concerning the manner best suited to deliver this feedback and its ultimate impact on literacy development. This paper presents findings from on an eight-month longitudinal ethnographic case study of five international Japanese undergraduate students and their efforts to navigate the writing requirements of their content courses at a large Canadian university. While confirming the importance of instructor based feedback practices and their potential as valuable language learning experiences, findings from this research also highlight language learners' perceived importance of &quot;alternative sources of feedback&quot; for their L2 writing development. Friends, roommates, and writing center tutors amongst others, were seen as valuable sources of advice on writing that could compensate for perceived problems with content instructor's feedback while offering feedback opportunities which were more closely associated to students ideal representation of this pedagogic tool. Implications focus on the advantages of widening our focus when understanding of feedback practices to also include paying closer attention to the impact of the &quot;invisible partners&quot; which also help shape students' literacy development and the bridges that might be built between these and more formal modes of instruction.

This, at least, is the case in the English language as it was produced by native speakers. As to what may be the case in French, this study was conducted with a specific focus on the \"que\" particle. The study reports on the audio recordings produced by native speakers of French (NSF), and aims to identify different silent pausing strategies as they were employed by these speakers. The audio recordings were provided in a twofold procedure: while 17 NSF watched the French version of the animated cartoon, \"Scrooge\", and then commented on its various themes, 10 of these participants read a short story, \"Les Jumeaux\" aloud to a digital audio recorder. Considerable attention was given to pausing preceding (PP) and following (PF) the \"que\" particle in \"que\" phrases as well as to the duration of this particle. Obtained results display significant differences between pausing preceding and following \"que\" both in spontaneous and read speech. Pausing preceding \"que\" was observed to be significantly longer than the following position in read speech, in spontaneous speech, however, it was just the opposite.

Looking for what psychoanalysis deems the \"root cause\" of writing problems--intrapsychic conflict--foregrounds that kind of conflict, relegating to the background other kinds of conflict, such as the rhetorical. Even more than relegating, looking psychoanalytically can transform rhetorical conflict from that which initiates and helps develop discourse into that which impairs it. The case this article will make is not that it is impossible to reconcile rhetoric and psychoanalysis, only that because they can (as forms of writing instruction) contradict each other, such reconciliation is not easy.

        "description":"In \"A New World: Redefining the Legacy of Min-Zhan Lu\"(JBW 27.2, Fall 2008), Brian Ray revisits the controversy that emerged in the early 1990s in response to critiques of the iconic Mina Shaughnessy made by Min-Zhan Lu. He offers a reading of the debate that focuses on common ground between the two sides through a metaphor of linguistic charity based on the work of Donald Davidson. While common ground can no doubt be found between these two opposing sides, by focusing exclusively on the similarities between Lu and her critics, Ray runs the risk of diluting Lu's argument and inadvertently reproducing the relations of power that Lu's project is attempting to undermine. This article, therefore, offers a different route to reading the debate between Lu and her critics--a reading that focuses on the real and irreconcilable differences between the two sides. Building on the work of Elizabeth Ellsworth, this article offers a metaphor of partial narratives, in an attempt to expose the power relations embedded in all knowledge production. This metaphor of partial narratives provides not only a way of understanding the substantive difference between Lu and her critics but also raises questions that can help inform an approach to negotiating the different discourses present in composition classrooms, especially those focused on students positioned as basic writers.",

        "description":"In this article, I describe how policy changes instituted by our State Board of Education prompted the composition faculty at Boise State University to develop a Stretch program. Our goal was to support basic writing students by linking two writing courses (one of which is non-credit-bearing) , thus allowing students to remain with the same classmates and professor for a full year instead of just one semester. I discuss the history and challenges of our Stretch program and detail our assessment of it, which reveals a positive impact on student retention, G.P.A, and writing ability. While there are too many variables to claim that the Stretch program alone is responsible for the positive outcomes, research shows that increased student-faculty interaction, a significant feature of the Stretch program, does reinforce student learning. We are using evidence of this research and our assessment to develop the program and advance the argument that students should receive full credit for both semesters of the Stretch sequence.

While there is a good deal of scholarship on student departure by compositions and experts in student retention and persistence, some models of student departure and success offered by these scholars are inadequate; a more comprehensive approach that embraces the intellectual and social elements of student success is needed.

Support for this approach is found both in first and second language literacy development research, yet it has not been widely adopted in ESL developmental writing programs. Although only in the second year of implementation, test scores, grades, and student and teacher interviews indicate the revised curriculum is well-serving the developmental academic literacy needs of these matriculated ESL international students. Students are demonstrating reading and writing with greater ease and speed. They understand and produce texts with greater rhetorical awareness and have developed strategies for talking about and working with a variety of academic text-types. The development of these literacy practices has been well-received by teachers and students, and has prepared the latter to participate successfully in the required first year composition course.

        "description":"Adult students are more anxious about writing for school, less familiar with academic conventions, and more likely to drop out than younger students. For students learning to move between personal, work, and academic discourse communities, the ongoing and explicit writing instruction argued for in the research of Sternglass, Herrington and Curtis, Carroll, and Beaufort is particularly vital. Writing Workshop at DePaul University's School for New Learning is one model for providing this instruction. The course works for students with a broad range of learning styles, prior knowledge, needs, and goals because it is individualized and because it is focused on developing writers rather than on teaching specific kinds of writing. It is open to any student struggling with writing, from incoming basic writers to seniors stuck on final projects. Writing Workshop has improved access for and the retention and success of our adult students. This article shows the need for a class like Writing Workshop, explains how it works, discusses challenges, and describes the experience of the at-risk, nontraditional, adult students in one Writing Workshop class.

I suggest that, due to the double consciousness with which these students often live, they come into classrooms rhetorically adept. By asking student writers to employ braiding (the braiding of subjectivities, genres, or rhetorics in single texts), we enable students to theorize experience, to contest stereotypes of \"student writing,\" to contribute to academia via their own intellectual experimentation, and to consciously position themselves among various discourses as effective rhetorical power players. I offer the experience of one student writer (a lesbian and an Army cadet) as a case study. (Contains 6 notes.)",

        "description":"Through the regular use of what Donald Schon has termed reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action, students can learn to improve their \"reflection-in-presentation,\" in Kathleen Blake Yancey's term. Students are often asked to do this type of reflection-in-presentation as a capstone to first-year or basic writing courses. However, a number of critics have articulated reservations about reflective writing assignments that ask students to assess their progress in writing and, in essence, their cognitive development as they complete a composition or BW course. Laurel Bower (\"JBW\" 22.2, 2003), in particular, notes that such end-of-term written work is frequently superficial. This essay focuses on an alternative approach to reflective writing, one that asks students to examine their own beliefs about writing as well as those of their classmates rather than examining their cognitive development. This shift to reflecting on the epistemological grounding of their experiences as writers, coupled with a semester-long practice in reflection, seems to produce rich, fully developed reflection-in-presentation that offers some anecdotal evidence of knowledge transfer by the students as well as providing an informal outcomes assessment of course objectives for the professor.

Much of this research has examined both \"pull\" factors--those of home and family life, and \"push\" factors--those within the organization which create a competitive environment where women feel they cannot achieve the same measure of success as their male counterparts. Similar forces, which create push in the corporate environment, are also present in academia preventing female academicians from achieving an equal presence in the higher levels of academia as their male counterparts. While the makeup of postsecondary education among students has reached a more balanced ratio in bachelors, masters and doctorial degrees, the gender make up of tenured professors and administrators in the academy still lags behind. The existence of this phenomenon presents similar loses and opportunity costs for universities as experienced by industrial organizations. This leads to the following questions; 1) How wide is the faculty and leadership gender gap in academia, 2) How have these gaps manifested in academia, and 3) What are the direct or indirect costs associated with this employment gap? The answer to these questions may lead to extensive additional research opportunities to discover strategies and guidance in the resolving these problems. (Contains 43 footnotes and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Despite gains overall, women are still under-represented in leadership positions in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Data in the US suggest around one-quarter of deans and department heads are women; in science this drops to nearly 1 in 20. Part of this problem of under-representation stems from the population pool: only 33% of science and engineering doctorate holders employed in academia are women. Other issues include well-known problems of women's participation in STEM fields: lack of role models, unconscious biases, discrimination, and unwelcoming climates. This paper examines the primary barriers to women's participation in (1) STEM areas and (2) arenas. Examination of the two suggests that women in STEM fields are particularly susceptible to the barriers and biases facing women who wish to move into leadership positions. The similarity in the barriers in these two areas could lead to an effective double jeopardy for women entering STEM leadership. A distinct lack of research in the area of women's leadership in STEM fields suggests that this is a major problem that is not currently understood and not being addressed. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"In order to understand and resolve the disproportionate number of women in the sciences it is necessary to look at historical educational trends. Through the ages there is evidence of a \"pendulum effect\" where there have been major shifts focusing science education either on male or females. To be able to realistically establish sustainable equity in the natural and life sciences it is necessary to reexamine not only the curriculum verbiage used in the text but also teaching styles that are used to present the material. One approach is introducing more hands-on learning to supplement the \"banking\" approach traditionally used in introductory science classes. Hands-on learning engages visual, kinesthetic as well as auditory pathways and allows students to move from abstract thinking to dealing with the concrete. While there have been numerous studies done, they have historically focused on the effect of hands-on learning in K-12 schools. There is still much research that needs to be done on all types of science curriculum, especially at the post secondary level. We conducted several studies at Saint Xavier University with students in the Introductory Biology and Women in Science Courses. We examined the effects of various pedagogies on class performance in a non-majors science course. We examined the effects of no labs, a few labs or weekly labs on student performance. Significant improvements were seen within sexes (10%), and with female students (13%), while male students showed modest improvement (2%). While this is not the only way to achieve sustainable equity in natural sciences, this appears to be an effective pedagogical tool in stabilizing the \"pendulum effect\".

        "description":"Women have increasingly moved toward greater gender equality at home and in the workplace. Yet, women are still underrepresented in leadership roles and still considered an anomaly compared to men when in high positions of leadership especially within institutions of higher education. In examining differences between how men and women lead, it is often less what they do than in the different experience they face when they lead. Stereotypic gender role expectations can constrain their leadership behaviors. Perceived incongruity between women and leadership roles pose obstacles to leadership and result in double binds, more negative performance appraisals, and different standards compared to those applied to men. It is increasingly clear that a gender neutral view of leadership is insufficient, and that we need to consider the influence of cultural worldviews and socialization on shaping leadership style. There is much to suggest that feminist leadership styles are intentionally different--more collaborative and transformational compared to men. This becomes more complex when we include dimensions of racial and ethnic diversity. We need to transform our views of leadership to promote more robust theories and diverse models of effective leadership. While current leadership theories favor transformational and collaborative leadership styles, organizational cultures often mirror social constructions of gender and ethnicity norms in society. Within the context of higher education institutions, there is often a tension between hierarchical and collaborative forms of leadership reflected in contradictory sets of practices. While women leaders may have an advantage in such contexts, they also face obstacles in needing to change organizational cultures that mirror social biases against women as leaders.",

Children do not grow up in a vacuum; they are part of a biological, psychological and social system. The interaction of the child and parent within this system must include the development of responsibilities by the parent and the child to further the rights of both. Children do have rights, the right to be nurtured and protected, the right to learn boundaries of behavior and to expand their knowledge. In reviewing the text from The Convention on the Rights of the Child, the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents are addressed in several places. The failure of the United States Senate to ratify this treaty seems to question how much intervention by outside authority is needed to protect children. It is true that many children need the protection of outside parties, but where do we find a balance between the rights and responsibilities of parents, children and society?",

Unfortunately we have seen two divergent paths, the first is a dramatic decline in physical activity time often accompanied by a decline in fitness, and an equally dramatic increase in overweight and obesity. In the mid 1990's educators in Washington State realized there was a significant problem and set about creating change. Standards were set for programs and school districts began redesigning curriculum. Spokane Public Schools completely redesigned their curriculum to address both problems. The result of three years of work was an integrated, articulated, progressive curriculum designed to educate students on both why and how they can be active throughout life and the expected benefit of a healthier, more fit population. Five years of Carol M. White PEP grant funds helped the district implement and evaluate the curricular change. Some may consider the results a &quot;failure&quot; because fitness scores have not changed (including body composition), but to others it may be seen as finally stopping the decline and just maybe we will be able to head our students back on the path to lifelong health and wellness.",

        "author":["Gray, Anthony"],
        "description":"In recent years, the issue of the extent to which an individual has or should have the right to religious freedom, and to manifest that freedom by wearing particular items of clothing, has become very contentious. Some nations have seen fit to ban the wearing of particular items of clothing thought to have religious significance, at least in some contexts. Courts from a range of jurisdictions have sought to grapple with these issues, involving a range of values and sometimes competing interests. In this article, the author considers constitutional (and discrimination) issues that would arise if the Australian Parliament enacted legislation prohibiting the wearing of particular items of clothing often thought to have religious significance, in particular the &quot;hijab&quot;, &quot;burqa&quot; or &quot;niqab&quot;. He draws upon the rich jurisprudence concerning these issues in other jurisdictions, where much more litigation has taken place regarding the question than Australia. The volume of litigation elsewhere means that consideration of the Australian position is enriched by considering some of the specific issues that have been considered by overseas courts, with the likelihood that at some stage similar issues will need to be considered by Australian courts. These overseas developments should inform the consideration of the interpretation of the Australian provisions, and assist in reaching an interpretation of the relevant provisions. As with all comparative analysis, it is necessary to bear in mind the different statutory, constitutional and convention context in which decisions are reached. The author also considers briefly whether a different result would apply if the ban were passed at State level. This is not an abstract argument; a current Senator in the Australian Parliament, has personally called for a burqa ban, and private members' bills have been introduced in New South Wales and South Australia to introduce such a ban, at least in some circumstances. In Part A, the author sets the statutory framework for the discussion. In Part B, the meaning of the wearing of the hijab and burqa is considered. Part C considers how laws banning the wearing of religious dress or symbols have been considered in various courts. In Part D, he considers the validity of a Commonwealth law that banned the wearing of religious dress or symbols. (Contains 155 footnotes.)",

Best known is the colorfully named Old Deluder Satan Law of 1647, famously declaring towns with populations of 50 must hire a reading and writing teacher, and those holding 100 requiring a Latin Grammar School. This law's title was derived from its purpose, as teaching youth to read allowed access to the Christian &quot;Bible,&quot; with their presumably subsequent faith and doctrinal adherence producing virtuous citizens confident of an eventual heavenly home rather than warmer climes. Still, these laws and many afterwards were not strictly enforced until Horace Mann advocated schooling for all, with his Common School Movement leading to free, public, and locally controlled elementary schools, beginning with Massachusetts in 1852. Compulsory education laws were passed in 32 states by 1900 and in all by 1930. (Contains 55 footnotes.)",

The parables of the Bible and the vocalization of articulate animals in Aesop fables continue to be used to teach morals to children. While the majority of existing research investigates the effective use of animals as a tool in character and values education, limited research has been done regarding the benefits of using articulate animals to teach leadership education and to promote the wise selection of leaders. The purpose of this pilot study will be to qualitatively test the theory that students who read and discuss selections from modern fantasy that identify specific articulate animals as role models or bullies will respond differently to questions posed in whole-group discussion. The random selection of middle-school students engaged in followership training will read and discuss the roles of specific animals in selected children's literature. During whole group discussion, responses will be observed and recorded, noting differences to the following two questions: \"Are followers responsible for the actions of a leader?\" and \"Is a bully a leader?\" (Contains 25 footnotes.)",

Accordingly, a conceptual framework and structured self-administered questionnaire were developed. Questionnaires were mailed to 140 female accountants in five states. The result suggests that women favorably perceive their status, investments and returns they get from being practicing accountants. However, their matriculation into the strategic positions of partners and managing partners is severely constrained by family and gender issues, and long standing traditions. Equality of pay, sabbatical and being given special considerations in audit and consultancy assignments are less important issues to them. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Maternal and postpartum obesity is associated with increased risk of developing gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome, prenatal morbidity and increased risk of obesity in the offspring through adolescence which without intervention, leads to adulthood obesity.

CDC data has shown, between 1990-2005, gaining greater than 40# in all Body Mass Index (BMI) categories has increased between 15-20%.

        "description":"This three-year longitudinal study explored the approach to study and academic performance of a group of male psychology undergraduates. In induction week, 112 new psychology students completed the survey. Later in the year, some of the males were interviewed in small groups. Performance was measured from marks at the end of Years 1 and 3. In Year 1, compared with their female contemporaries, male respondents had higher self-esteem (p less than 0.01), expected higher marks (p less than 0.001) and anticipated performing better than their peers (p less than 0.05). In interviews, males described themselves as being less motivated and less organised than females, but did not consider this a problem. The only difference in marks showed males doing worse in coursework at Year 1 (p less than 0.05). However, significantly more males failed to complete the course. These findings are set in the context of concerns about under achievement of males and discussed in relation to research into transition to university. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "description":"The aim of this study was to examine an expanded integrative hierarchical model of test emotions and achievement goal orientations in predicting the examination performance of undergraduate students. Achievement goals were theorised as mediating the relationship between test emotions and performance. 120 undergraduate students completed self-report measures of test emotions and achievement goals and performance data was collected from a research methods and analysis examination. A series of hierarchical regression analyses provided partial support for the expanded hierarchical model. A mastery goal mediated the pride--examination performance relationship, a performance-avoidance goal partially mediated the shame--examination performance relationship, and a performance-avoidance goal mediated the hopelessness--examination performance relationship. These findings have contributed to the understanding of the relationship between test emotions, motivation and achievement in a higher education context by showing how challenge and threat affect differ in their relations with approach and avoidance motivation in predicting achievement.

Validity is primarily assessed through the scale's relationship with other existing scales as well as by looking for predicted differences. The utility of the ABC scale is demonstrated through its ability to discriminate between undergraduate students on different courses; between dyslexic and non dyslexic undergraduate students; undergraduate students in different countries and undergraduate students of different sex. Changes in ABC over time are considered and linked to an over-confidence bias in students in higher education. Finally, it is suggested that the ABC scale and a related measure, the Performance Expectation Ladder can identify and help teachers in higher education understand students with low academic confidence who need supporting.

Lastborns were found to experience more academic sibling rivalry: t=2.33, DF=44; p less than 0.05, whereas firstborns are more likely to be conscientious: F(1,44)=3.58; p less than 0.05, and dutiful: F(1,44)=5.39; p less than 0.05.

The original article prompted a number of replies and a rejoinder from Radford (2008b). In the spirit of carrying on the discussion started by Radford and others, this article offers two personal perspectives on our current state. The first is from a careworn academic who suggests, basically, that psychology at degree level needs to sort out its priorities: the agenda for achieving this should include the identity of psychology within universities, its relationship with A-level psychology, and attention to teaching. The second perspective is from a new psychology graduate who reflects on how his experiences match the situation Radford describes and the consequent lack of intellectual depth in the psychology curriculum. It is suggested that the way out of the state we are in lies in the hands of universities, decidedly not the British Psychological Society.",

Raymie McKerrow (1989, p. 91) states that critical rhetoric serves to \"de-mystify and connect\" individuals with knowledge through a subjective and engaged discourse. Vivan Burr (1998, p.4) suggests that it is through interaction we construct knowledge. It is in this spirit that I offer the idea of sharing activities that have engaged students with psychology and the psychological way of thinking, either as \"starters\" or extension activities. Diverse student populations, classroom limitations and institutional constraints notwithstanding, I believe we have much to present to each other and we may find ideas for activities that suit our pedagogies and allow for the co-construction of knowledge with students through experience.",

        "description":"Background: For healthy development, children need positive relationships with adults. Due to changes in family systems and shifting social norms, many children may be receiving less parental support than in the past and may be discouraged from forming natural mentoring relationships with other adults. Mentoring programs are designed to facilitate appropriate, meaningful relationships between children and adults leading to positive outcomes such as improved social skills and self-esteem. Mentoring programs are being more widely implemented in schools, though additional evaluation of the effects of these programs is needed. Aims: The purpose of this article is to describe and evaluate a school-based mentoring program in which adult volunteers were paired with elementary school students at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders. A secondary question addressed how the school-based mentoring program was perceived by those involved (e.g., students, mentors, teachers, and parents). Sample: Primary participants were 16 students and their adult mentors located in a suburban elementary school in the western United States. Method: Students were selected for the mentoring program using a school-wide screening for emotional and behavior disorders. Evaluation focused on what impact the school-based mentoring program had on ratings of students' social competence, antisocial behaviors, academics, and attendance. Results: Quantitative analysis of data, based on parent and teacher ratings, indicated improvements in students' social competence and decreases in antisocial behaviors, teachers also noted improvements in students' grades. Qualitative analysis revealed that parents, mentors, students, and teachers were all generally pleased with the mentoring experience. Conclusion: Results suggest that participation in the mentoring program was associated with improved social skills, decreased antisocial behaviors, and improved academic behaviors, though teachers noted more of these improvements than did parents. Steps for those wanting to initiate school-based mentoring programs are provided. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Aim: The study aims to critically compare those schools that implemented PBL (experimental) and those that did not (control) in learning-related psychosocial outcomes. Sample: Third and fifth graders from 4 primary schools implementing PBL (experimental group, n=474) and 2 primary schools which would join the intervention in the following year (control group, n=83) were compared. Method: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to validate 9 psychosocial measures: (1) school self-concept (cognitive), (2) school self-concept(affective), (3) English self-concept, (4) mathematics self-concept, (5) parent self-concept, (6) effort goal orientation, (7) planning, (8) study management, and (9) persistence. Then multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) tested between-group differences in the 9 measures. Results: CFA found support for the 9 measures. MANOVA found significant between-group differences in (2), (3), (5), and (7), favouring the experimental group. Conclusion: By extending the strength of a positive behaviour support system to include an emphasis on learning processes and outcomes, PBL has made small but important contributions to some psychosocial determinants of student outcomes that may facilitate long-term learning benefits.

        "description":"Background: In Hong Kong, secondary school students face high levels of stress due to the examination oriented curricula. According to Sun (2006), some secondary school students cannot bear the pressure when facing the examinations, and some of them may exhibit destructive behaviors such as suicide and bullying. Therefore, cases of school bullying break out frequently (Ming Pao, 2003, 2004). Moreover, school alienation contributes to the risk of bullying while support from teachers and peers decreases one's tendency towards bullying (Natvig et al., 2001). Aims: The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between students' stress and bullying. Based on an insight into prevention of bullying in school, some applicable strategies to prevent students' academic and interpersonal stress will be suggested. Sample: Altogether 340 Fung Kai No. 1 Secondary School students, 200 boys and 140 girls, participated in the present study. Methods: Students completed and returned two questionnaires: the Subjective Stress Scale (Li and Ng, 1992) and the Bullying Checklist (Chui, 2001), in class. Results: The results show that girls felt more stressed than boys in the family, and they also exhibited more social bullying than boys did. Both interpersonal and personal stress are factors leading to bullying. Conclusion: In the present study, girls felt more stressed than boys in the family. They were eager to be more independent from the family. This arouses conflict between parents and daughter. It was found that Form 3 perceived higher levels of academic and personal stress than Form 1 students. It is understood that they were experiencing identity formation and making decisions on future study in art or science. Provision of a one-week orientation program for Form 1 students before the commencement of the school term is recommended. Finally, workshops for parents were introduced to enhance parent-child relationships and to help them communicate effectively with their children. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "description":"Background: A federally-funded program at the University of Texas at San Antonio adopted a holistic problem solving mentoring approach for novice teachers participating in an accelerated teacher certification program. Aims/focus of discussion: To investigate a novice teacher's problem-solving activity through self-expression of challenges and management of identified problems. Of interest was the level of novice teacher detail provided to  explore specific problems, goals, and completion of developed resolution plans. The LIBRE Model, developed as a clinical tool, was used to facilitate &quot;self-talk,&quot; and personal self-attention to concerns expressed within the person's &quot;worldview&quot; of social context.  Sample: One novice teacher in her induction year participated in this study. The information collected included her expressed: self-awareness, social expectations, skills, facility in processing identified challenges and willingness to invest in change. Method: Three mentor facilitated novice teacher problem-solving sessions were conducted. With each session,  a problem-solving exercise occured, which included the development of a resolution plan. Only the novice teacher's words and plans were recorded. This holistic approach was designed to capture the individual's tailored, supported, and transitional changes from novice to more experienced teacher. The sustainability of the teacher's self-managed changes  was evident with the fourth problem solving activity which was completed independent of the mentor. Results: Teacher and mentor feedback are presented. The value of monitoring teacher self-awareness and self-managed change are discussed as elements of the structured mentor-mentee communication. Conclusion: Diagnostic/intervention tools such as the LIBRE Model introduced during the beginning teaching experience provide key information about the individual in terms of self-exploration, problem solving, and decision-making. As evidenced in the case study, the novice teacher found an approach based on her self-reflection and personal strengths, which increased her sense of self-efficacy and professional self-confidence.

        "description":"Background: Trigonometry is an area of mathematics that students believe to be particularly difficult and abstract compared with the other subjects of mathematics. Trigonometry is often introduced early in year 8 with most textbooks traditionally starting with naming sides of right-angled triangles. Students need to see and understand why their learning of trigonometry matters. Aims: In this study, particular types of errors, underlying misconceptions, and obstacles that occur in trigonometry lessons are described. Sample: 140 tenth grade high-school students participated in the study. 6 tenth grade mathematics teachers were observed. Method: A diagnostic test that consists of seven trigonometric questions was prepared and carried out. The students' responses to the test were analyzed and categorized. Observations notes were considered. Results: The most common errors that the students made in questions were selected. Several problematic areas have been identified such as improper use of equation, order of operations, and value and place of sin, cosine, misused data, misinterpreted language, logically invalid inference, distorted definition, and technical mechanical errors. This paper gives some valuable suggestion (Possible treatment of students' error obstacles, and misconceptions) in trigonometric teaching for frontline teachers. Conclusion: The study found students have errors, misconceptions, and obstacles in trigonometry lessons. (Contains 2 tables.)",

It has contributed a lot in uplifting the socioeconomic status of the countries. Well reputed International Journals are widely publishing on a variety of entrepreneurial issues. A little research in the area has so far been reported from Pakistan. Aims: This research explored entrepreneurial inclinations of prospective teachers in Pakistan. Sample: Multistage sampling was employed to get the replica of the population. Seven hundred master of education students (prospective teachers) were randomly selected from seven Pakistani public universities. Method: Survey method was used to collect data from the sample. Five hundred and sixteen respondents completed the questionnaire. From factor analysis, three factors emerged: entrepreneurial intent and acceptability, entrepreneurial effort and entrepreneurial motivation. Perceptions on the conceptual variables of locus of control, self-efficacy, subjective norms, instrumental readiness and entrepreneurial intentions were also derived. Results: The majority of prospective teachers were found to be positive towards entrepreneurship at all seven universities. Conclusion: Most of the prospective teachers were positively inclined towards entrepreneurship. There was some impact of demographic variables such as university and course attended, parental level of education and gender. Females exhibited a higher entrepreneurial profile (in terms of working hard and entrepreneurial motivation) at most of the universities. The implications for practice and policy are discussed.

Although some findings are consistent with research in Western settings, interesting differences have emerged. A question that has yet to be examined is the role of teacher and student gender in teachers' perceptions of student behavior problems in China. Aims: To examine the effects of student and teacher gender on Chinese teachers' perceptions of student behavior problems. In the first study teachers rated the frequency of student behavior problems,  while in the second study teachers rated the seriousness of student behavior problems. Sample: In the first study 527 elementary school teachers from five provinces of China participated; 217 elementary school teachers from four provinces participated in the second study. Method: The first study was comprised of two phases: developing student behavior problem categories and questionnaire items via interviews with teachers, and collecting teacher questionnaire responses. In the second study teachers were surveyed about how serious they thought behavior problems would be if displayed by a boy versus a girl. Results: Non-attention was seen as the most frequent behavior problem for girls, while overactive was the most frequent for boys. Interaction effects for teacher and student gender, as well as main effects for teacher gender, were evident on ratings of the seriousness of student behavior problems. Teachers tended to rate less frequent behavior problems as more serious and vice versa. Conclusions: Results suggest that the most frequent type of student behavior problems in China differ from the West, and also differ for boys and girls. Teacher gender and student gender interactions appeared to influence teachers' perceptions of behavior problem seriousness. These findings support the idea that an exploration of gender and culture may be required for a more complete understanding of students' behavior problems. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Background: Because of the educational reform and decreasing birth rate in Taiwan over the past 20 years, higher technological and vocational Education (TVE) in Taiwan faces a severe student recruitment competition. Dailey (2007) indicates the need to develop marketing strategies in higher education is evident. TVE institutes are beginning to recognize the need to become more businesslike and the value of marketing in achieving a competitive advantage (Ewing &amp; Napoli, 2005). Aims: This study, adopts marketing segmentation theory to find the major factors students emphasized when selecting a school or department. Sample: First of all, the researcher divided the country into three major areas: Northern, Central, and Southern. Two TVE schools were chosen randomly per area, with 200 freshman students from each school respectively. One thousand two hundred TVE freshman students in Taiwan were surveyed in this study. Method: The collected data were analyzed using cluster and discriminate analyses. Results: The result indicated that 4 factors, &quot;reputation and quality&quot;, &quot;function and convenience&quot;, &quot;emotion and meaning&quot;, and &quot;scale and structure&quot;, were considered most important by students. The students were categorized into 3 groups: &quot;career oriented&quot; students (50.42%) considered &quot;reputation and quality&quot; as most important factor, &quot;emotion oriented&quot; students (19.71%) concerned most on &quot;emotion and meaning,&quot; and &quot;environment oriented&quot; students (29.87%) concerned most on &quot;function and convenience&quot; and &quot;scale and structure&quot;. Conclusion: Based on the results, the researcher made the following recommendations which may serve as critical references for school administrators and policy makers while making their recruitment strategies: 1. Investigate the evaluation standards of how students choose their schools. 2. Reinforce school's internal marketing. 3. Improve school's image. 4. Establish a specific department responsible for recruiting students. (Contains 8 tables and 2 notes.)",

        "description":"Background: Over the last decade, several factors have placed faculty workloads in higher education under scrutiny. Improvements in technology and increases in the numbers of participants in higher education have lead to increased costs, which have largely been absorbed by the taxpayer. The increase in the diversity among students attending college has brought to the forefront the need for change in instructional methods. Department leaders have made attempts to adapt to these changing conditions. Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine if faculty credit load assignments were an accurate measurement of faculty work loads. The study also identified management techniques of department heads at a private university and determined if these techniques are reflective of leadership used in a learning organization. Sample: The sample consisted of 95 full time faculty and 10 department heads. Method: Faculty work logs were used to collect data on the number of hours full time faculty were working and faculty credit hour assignment cards were collected to determine the load assigned to the faculty member by the University. An interview for each department head was conducted to determine department leadership strategies. Results: While no significant correlations were discovered between the number of faculty credit hours on faculty credit assignment cards and hours logged by faculty members in the area of total time, time spent in teaching related activities, time spent in administrative activities and time spent in advising activities, a weak positive correlation was shown with total time logged and time in teaching related activities. Conclusion: The qualitative data provided insight on the leadership practices of department heads within the University. Department heads described circumstances in which flexibility and experimentation were practiced during the assignment of faculty work (Yukl, 2002). Moreover, department heads described leadership practices that allowed for bringing in outside knowledge (Yukl) and single and double loop learning Morgan (1997). (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Background: In line with the increase of using value-added assessment information to evaluate learning gain made by learners in different parts of the world, the Education Bureau in Hong Kong has recently introduced a system that provides value-added information of secondary school students. However, not many teachers have a clear knowledge and understanding about value-added assessment. Aims: This paper provides a brief review of the meaning and the importance of value-added assessment in education. Then it provides an example of how to find out the academic attainment that one can reasonably expect from individual students and how to produce two types of school-based value-added estimations with reference to their own prior attainment or development ability measures. The paper also evaluates the use of descriptions in the value-added grid for making interpretations of the value-added assessment results. Sample: 60 schoolchildren in a primary school in England. Research method: Linear regression models. Results: The findings indicated that the descriptions in the grid were applicable for interpreting the assessment results, but attention had to be paid when making speculations about the positions of individual schoolchildren's past attainment in reading. Conclusion: This paper functions as a simplified example and a timely resource for teacher learning and development concerning value-added assessment. It also reflects the importance for teachers and school administrators to equip themselves with a good understanding of the nature, potential value and meanings of value-added estimations.

        "author":["Yau, Dick Tak-sang"],
        "description":"Background: During  the period of British colonial rule, the nature of civic education in Hong Kong was characterized as denationalized, depoliticized and decontextualized. The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration substantially altered the nature of civic education. The &quot;China Today&quot; module of Liberal Studies (LS) was one of the results of the re-engineering the civic education. The teachers' paradigms of the &quot;China Today&quot; module were explored because  the module used national themes as materials to inculcate values in students and is directly related to both citizenship education and national education. Aim: The aim of this study is to examine teachers' paradigms of the &quot;China Today&quot; module through their conceptualization of citizenship and their perspective on teaching. Samples: Four secondary teachers of the &quot;China Today&quot; module were invited to participate. Methods: Questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and non-participant observation were used to assess the teachers' perception and practices. Results: Data from the questionnaire and interviews revealed that the four teachers highly valued moral, socially concerned citizens and democratic citizens. In terms of aims and approaches to citizenship education, the four teachers embraced the notion of citizenship as competence as aim and reflective-inquiry approach, but only two teachers were able to carry them out in the classroom setting. Another two teachers used transmission approach. Conclusion: Framed by the notion of citizenship as competence as their aim and equipped in issue-enquiry or reflective-inquiry approach, and experienced in developmental perspective on teaching, the CSS2 and CSS3 teachers were able to cultivate in students' dispositions and skills. Teachers unaware of the citizenship framework and unfamiliar with the developmental perspective on teaching found it difficult to cultivate rational aspects of students. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Background: The quality of the classroom environment, as conceptualised and measured through the construct of classroom climate, focuses on the social and psychological interactions among its members which have been found to be related to students' academic achievement and reduced emotional problems. Aims: With regard to the limited data concerning the relevant Greek literature, the present study examined the possible relations between primary students' perceptions of the quality of their classroom psychosocial environment as measured using My Class Inventory and the evaluation of their &quot;overall&quot; performance by their teachers. Factors such as school district, urban and rural and grade level, fifth and sixth, were also taken into account. Sample: 268 students, 142  in the fifth grade and 126 in the sixth grade,  from 14 classes in 7 primary schools from three primary geographical regions in Greece and their teachers (N = 14), participated in the study. Method: Questionnaires were completed by students in their classrooms during the lesson hour and teachers recorded their evaluation of each student performance on their questionnaire. Analyses of variance (ANOVA), t-test and Pearson r correlations were conducted. Results: Research findings showed that competitiveness is prevalent in Greek classrooms. Especially in metropolitan urban schools, &quot;excellent&quot; students experience high levels of friction as they strive to succeed academically. Students' satisfaction was positively related to cohesion and negatively to friction  and difficulty, in most of the cases. Conclusion: It seems that traditional perspectives in evaluation methods used by teachers and the focus on academic achievement as well as modern life conditions in metropolitan urban settings influence students' sense of competitiveness and friction in the classroom. The application of more refined and systematic evaluation techniques with regard to students' overall performance and the enhancement of cooperative and social learning could boost students' self esteem, cohesion and satisfaction in the classroom.

        "description":"In even the earliest studies of giftedness in young children (Burks, Jensen, &amp; Terman, 1930; Hollingworth, 1926), researchers noted distinct character traits among gifted students, which included global awareness, sensitivity to complex issues, and a tendency to worry about injustice and dangers that often are beyond a child's control. Dabrowski and Piechowski (1977) described what they called emotional overexcitabilities that can be observed among gifted students as great depth and intensity of emotional life expressed through a wide range of &quot;feeling, attachments, compassion, heightened sense of responsibility, and scrupulous self-examination&quot; (p. 287). This sensitivity of students is one of the positive gifts they bring to a classroom and the world. Yet, characteristics of sensitivity in gifted children can sometimes frustrate or annoy classmates and, unfortunately, some teachers who do not have the same sense of global awareness and responsibility. It can be difficult to reassure young gifted students that solutions will be found to complex problems without patronizing them or minimizing their concerns. This article describes ways in which gifted students explored issues of ecological concern through a description of student projects that addressed coastal erosion and habitat reduction in meaningful ways. Trough projects such as these, children who were impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita became empowered to help restore their environment. (Contains 5 figures and 1 table.)",

        "description":"Although most computer users will never need to write a computer program, many students enjoy the challenge of creating one. Computer programming enhances students' problem solving by forcing students to break a problem into its component pieces and reassemble it in a generic format that can be understood by a nonsentient entity. It promotes planning and organization skills, and it requires precision and self-discipline. Computer programming is one of the three proposed types of technological giftedness. In addition to programmers, interfacers (those who excel at using software) and fixers (those who enjoy working with technology equipment) often are classified as technologically gifted. For several years, students have been able to program in Visual Basic through the macro feature that is built into the Microsoft Office Suite. This has been an awkward, albeit free, way to teach Visual Basic programming to students without having the expense of purchasing the programming software. Visual Basic allows students to create actual programs that can be installed and run using the Windows operating system. It also has options for Web development. In this article, the author provides a step-by-step description of how to create a simple program using Visual Basic. Although the Visual Basic options that are featured in this project represent only the tip of the programming \"iceberg,\" the activity shows how easily a simple program can be created and compiled.

This lack of specificity in defining academic rigor often makes it difficult to determine if curriculum for gifted learners met their learning needs. With this need in mind and in response to the challenge of the North Carolina State Board of Education (NCSBoE) Mission Statement goal that every student be provided with rigorous and relevant core curriculum reflecting what students need to know and demonstrate in a global 21st-century environment, the Academically or Intellectually Gifted (AIG) Program at the North Carolina Department for Public Instruction (NCDPI) set out to create a rigor rubric. It was believed that such a rubric should be applied to educational programs and instruction to determine if an appropriate level of challenge is evident. As a result, a rigor rubric was developed. This article provides a description of how the rubric was developed as well as how it has been utilized to analyze the appropriateness of curriculum and instruction for gifted learners.

Specifically, one third of the nation's students drop out of school, even when they are not failing in school. Further, half of Black and Latino students do not graduate from high school (U.S. Department of Education, 2008). A number of studies have been conducted on factors that contribute to students' school disengagement and ultimate withdrawal. In this article, the author briefly examines recent reports on diverse students who dropped out of high school, and then discusses a program (the Scholar Identity Institute) that is designed to promote a scholar identity among Black males.

In turn, clinicians receiving such referrals also may fail to assess the implications of giftedness when exploring potential diagnoses like Asperger's Disorder. Although the literature on Asperger's Disorder is replete with many references to high ability/giftedness and Asperger's Disorder, there is, at this time, only one instrument that delineates giftedness and characteristics of Asperger's Disorder. Burger-Veltmeijer (2008) of the Netherlands created the Dimensional Discrepancy Model GFT + ASD (DD-Checklist) to help psychologists observe the characteristics of gifted-like manifestations versus Asperger's Disorder-like manifestations. This article presents the Giftedness/Asperger's Disorder Checklist (GADC) which was similarly developed to help educators, mental health professionals, and parents during the prereferral process to see if environmental interventions would be beneficial in the process of determining the need for more formal diagnostic evaluation. Like the DD-Checklist, the GADC focuses on the educational and psychological needs of the student who may or may not be gifted and who may or may not have Asperger's Disorder. The author discusses how to use the GADC and describes two principles that should be followed to determine accurate differentiation. (Contains 1 table.)",

Classroom and school composition often are tied to these conceptions of academic talent and giftedness, and magnet and charter schools select certain students who best \"ft\" their particular conception of giftedness. Educators' perceptions and attitudes regarding academic talent and giftedness thus impact what services are delivered to which students. Little is known about educators' beliefs regarding conceptions of academic talent and giftedness. The current national study surveyed 900 public school educators, including regular classroom teachers, administrators, and gifted education specialists, regarding their definitions of academic talent and giftedness. The educators believed that all traditional and popular conceptions of academic talent and giftedness were valid, but they were less likely to support definitions involving talents in less-traditional areas. Educators accepted some of the more recently conceived, and more inclusive, conceptions of academic talent or giftedness. Such results are potentially valuable to school administrators, gifted education specialists, and regular classroom teachers who work with academically talented and gifted students, as well as to those who are concerned with the factors influencing school or classroom composition.

The two groups did not differ significantly on gender, parent education level, or ethnicity. Some positive effects of Duke TIP summer programs were found on later academic achievement and educational choices using both standardized objective measures and self-reports of high school and college academic experiences. We found that students who participated in a Duke TIP math program in middle school did indeed take more AP math courses in high school, but there were no effects for other types of advanced math classes or for any other subjects. Additionally, compared to Search only students, students who took a math/science course at Duke TIP were more likely to major in math/science in college. More Duke TIP students than Search only students aspired to earn a doctorate. Anecdotally, we also have heard from many former Duke TIP participants how much Duke TIP has affected their lives, and it is noteworthy that we are now able to empirically document some of these effects.

For successful adjustment to college, significant adults during high school matter more than they might imagine. Talking to teachers and counselors had strong relationships with social and academic adjustment as well as with positive attitudes for all students. Interestingly, the more participants talked to teachers in high school, the more academically competent they felt in college, and this relationship was especially strong for first-generation students. Such findings suggest that \"getting ready\" experiences may prepare students to more effectively balance the multiple developmental tasks they face as college students on the threshold of adulthood. This preparation may be especially important for persistence among vulnerable populations, including first-generation students, who spend the least time of any group talking to teachers outside class. Students in low-income, urban communities may be in reasonable proximity to a community, vocational, or 4-year college; students in rural schools may more often see relatively few opportunities for higher education. An academically oriented high school peer group also may prepare students to become socially engaged on the college campus. These preliminary findings are a strong argument for policies and practices that bring all new college students together in personalized social interactions as quickly as possible rather than focusing on groups perceived to be \"at risk.\" (Contains 9 tables and 1 figure.)",

One means of addressing this challenge has been through specialty schools devoted to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) training. In 1980, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics pioneered a successful program for high-achieving youth: the state-supported residential math and science school. Almost 30 years later, 15 similar schools have been created, including residential schools in Maine, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Alabama, and Arkansas; and early college entrance academies in Texas, Missouri, and Georgia. Students are appropriately supervised and actively participate in athletics and a wide range of clubs and organizations. Admission is necessarily selective as students negotiate a challenging curriculum of advanced biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, as well as humanities and electives. Laboratory mentors guide students in research, results of which may be published or presented at colloquia. A select few projects are entered into the Intel Science Talent Search, Siemens-Westinghouse Science and Technology competitions, or other competitive programs. Performances are encouraging. Students pursue learning at an accelerated pace, saving considerable time and expenses. Graduates enroll in college, many at selective institutions, ensuring a boost in the number and quality of domestic mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. (Contains 8 tables.)",

        "description":"The Science Learning Assessment (SLA) is an individually administered, instructionally sensitive science assessment for kindergarten students. The SLA is a 24-item objective test, broken down into two subtests. The Scientific Inquiry Processes subtest consists of 9 items designed to measure young children's functional understanding of the nature and processes of scientific inquiry. The Life Science Concepts subtest consists of 15 items designed to measure children's understanding of specific science concepts related to living things and the physical world. Our results on SLA items that assess life science concepts indicate that kindergarten children are able to develop a rich knowledge base about living things. The results of the SLA indicate that even young children can begin to develop an understanding of scientific inquiry with appropriate instructional support. Our findings are consistent with recent work by researchers such as Metz (2004), who argue for a richer conception of children's developmental capacities in the context of science instruction. As educators develop new science curricula and programs to address the lack of rich and challenging science instruction in the early grades, there is a need to document what children learn from such efforts. In order to develop research-based and pedagogically effective science curricula, we need assessments with clearly described theoretical and psychometric characteristics. The SLA is one example of such an assessment that can be used to aggregate and compare learning outcomes, as well as to provide empirical information on kindergarten children's capacities for science learning.

Participants were 141 female and 310 male, 8- to 12-year-olds from low-income neighborhoods; 54% of the sample is Latino. Using items from the four subscales of Harter's (1985) Social Support Scale for Children, factor analysis was used to explore differences in the underlying structure of social support. Analyses were performed separately for boys and girls. Analyses for girls' social support clearly reflected the four support types: close friend, family, classmate, and teacher. Boys did not reflect distinct types of support, indicating more similarity in their perceived social support from different people. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Something remarkable is happening in programs of liberal education all over the country. The longstanding notion that learning should occur almost exclusively in classrooms is being amended to give a much more prominent place to various forms of experiential education. The belief that liberal education should focus on a narrow range of intellectual qualities is being revised to include an emphasis on connecting ideas with action. These developments constitute a profoundly important, indeed revolutionary, challenge to the version of liberal education that has dominated American higher education since the early years of the twentieth century. The trend to connect liberal education with practice takes multiple forms at the campus level and reflects a range of interests among students, faculty, and administrators. The various developments that make up this trend do not yet constitute a coherent movement, nor are they united by shared purposes. They remain on the margins of mainstream thought about the proper characteristics of liberal education. Yet they should command the attention of thoughtful academics for one basic reason: they seek to enact the traditional mission of liberal education to nurture engaged, effective, constructive professionals and citizens, and they implicitly question whether learning experiences that cultivate analytic skills in classroom settings constitute the most effective way to achieve this purpose. The movement to link liberal education more closely to action and practice is not limited to programs that take students out of the classroom. The trend is also reflected in modifications of arts and sciences coursework. Most liberal arts colleges now offer opportunities to study applied and professional subjects, for example, and many universities encourage liberal arts majors to take minors in professional fields. The Carnegie Foundation has sponsored an effort to enrich the \"thinking\" orientation of liberal education with the \"doing\" emphasis of professional studies by incorporating practice-oriented pedagogies, such as simulations and case studies, in liberal arts courses. Many colleges offer interdisciplinary, problem-focused minors like urban studies or international relations through which students learn to think about complex, real-world problems. These programs often provide platforms for community-based research projects, internships and service opportunities, and Model UN-type simulations. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "author":["Humphreys, Debra"],
        "description":"When the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) launched the Liberal Education and America's Promise (LEAP) initiative in 2005, they certainly knew that it would not be easy to achieve the sort of transformation needed to ensure that higher education serves all students--and society--more effectively. The LEAP initiative builds on many years of prior work, including innovative educational reform efforts at colleges and universities of all types across the country. In fact, AAC&U and its member institutions have been hard at work on the educational challenges inherent in the LEAP vision for many years, most recently through the Greater Expectations initiative (2000-2006) and, since 2005, through LEAP itself. As part of the Greater Expectations initiative, AAC&U identified promising reforms at a variety of leading institutions and facilitated multiyear dialogues with faculty members, academic administrators, employers, accreditors, civic leaders, and K-12 educators. These dialogues made it clear that something fundamental is shifting in society, in economy, and in educational institutions. AAC&U learned from these leaders and practitioners that higher education is, indeed, in a period of profound transformation, and the reason is that society itself is setting higher expectations for citizens and workers in the twenty-first century. The research and dialogues conducted as part of the Greater Expectations and LEAP initiatives have also made it clear that some of the core elements of an excellent education endure: (1) the development of intellectual powers and capacities; (2) ethical and civic preparation; (3) personal growth; and (4) self-direction. But the particulars of educational excellence are necessarily always in flux. What counts as powerful knowledge changes periodically as societies, cultures, and economies change. Some might ask whether the LEAP vision is too broad, too idealistic, too ambitious. Others might ask whether AAC&U's claim to discern an emerging consensus on essential learning outcomes is really just a cynical or even disingenuous assertion designed to forestall inappropriate governmental intervention or, in a purely self-interested way, to limit trends toward narrow vocationalism at all levels of education. In this article, the author focuses on two key questions: (1) Is there really a consensus about outcomes across a wide array of stakeholders?; and (2) With a single set of learning outcomes, can several goals really be accomplished at once--preparing students to be critical and informed citizens, while also providing them with skills and knowledge to succeed professionally in a competitive global economy?",

        "description":"In its Liberal Education and America's Promise (LEAP) initiative, the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) outlines four clusters of learning outcomes that are essential for all college students in the twenty-first century and that, taken together, represent a high-quality liberal education. These include: (1) knowledge of human cultures and the physical and natural world; (2) intellectual and practical skills; (3) personal and social responsibility; and (4) integrative and applied learning. Core Commitments, a related AAC&U initiative, focuses specifically on the third of these clusters. This initiative is designed to strengthen the academy's capacity to foster students' personal and social responsibility. In order to clarify what that means, the Core Commitments initiative has outlined five key goals within the broader category of personal and social responsibility. Initial surveys conducted for the Core Commitments initiative have shown strong consensus among faculty, administrators, and students that these five aspects of personal and social responsibility are important goals of a college education. Unfortunately, however, many fewer respondents say that their institution is working toward these goals in an effective way. Why are so few institutions working to achieve these outcomes if so many acknowledge their importance? A likely explanation is that, despite evidence to the contrary, many educators hope and expect that these outcomes will be achieved as by-products of a college education, that they do not require explicit attention. The relative lack of institutional investment in students' personal and social responsibility reflects the widespread assumption that academic content knowledge and the intellectual skill of analytic or critical thinking, quite divorced from either action or responsibility, are the overriding aims of higher education and that the development of personal and social responsibility is only distantly connected with those aims. In this article, the authors take issue with both of these assumptions, arguing that colleges should aim to teach students how to use knowledge and criticism not only as ends in themselves but also as means toward responsible engagement with the life of their times. They also argue that this can be accomplished best by addressing some core developmental dimensions or processes that underlie and tie together the various elements of personal and social responsibility articulated by the Core Commitments initiative.",

        "author":["Nikitina, Svetlana"],
        "description":"Scholarship and teaching in the humanities can sometimes be overly self-referential. Rather than foster citizenship and social engagement, undergraduate literature classes are often limited to exercises in textual interpretation as students learn to compare and contrast formal devices and thematic motifs. The step from analyzing verbal polyphony to fighting poverty is not a short one, and only rarely does teaching and scholarship in the humanities help students make that step. Ultimately, fostering the ability to own (enact and embody) a literary or philosophical insight should be central to humanities learning in college. Withdrawal into information transfer without a view of tangible action or application is a serious failure of education. In this article, the author proposes five strategies for making concepts tangible: (1) through media and the arts; (2) through activism; (3) through cocreation; (4) through contemporizing; and (5) through cross-pollination. Underlying these strategies are three interconnected ideas that have been suggested in the literature on the crisis of the humanities. These ideas are centered on overcoming extreme specialization and formalism, opening a wider frame of reference through interdisciplinary crossover, and reattaching the humanities to the arts. The five strategies derive from the author's own personal teaching experience at two colleges, as well as from the observation of countless classrooms across the country in the course of a nationwide study of interdisciplinary education conducted by the Harvard Graduate School of Education. The course examples discussed in this article are composite portraits of courses either observed or personally delivered. The idea behind proposing specific strategies is not to foreclose further experimentation, but rather to open doors wide for building upon these pedagogies by way of extension, critical development, and adaptation to individual instructional needs.",

        "author":["Stewart, Kenneth D.",
          "Schlegel, Keith W."],
        "description":"If one hangs around public universities that have less than selective admissions policies, one is bound to hear a litany of complaints about today's students. They lack the attitude required for productive and serious academic work, and too many lack disciplined study habits; they have short attention spans and very little patience with academic work. Furthermore, they are too frequently devoid of self-criticism, unable to delay gratification, intellectually incurious, and unwilling to tolerate principled difference. Sadly, some can even wear ignorance as an entitled right. Many, perhaps most, faculty openly applaud high standards and privately disdain colleagues with weak standards and high grades. The academic culture encourages exactly the kind of remedy many faculty publicly advocate: setting high but attainable standards that students must struggle to meet and that result in accomplishments in which they can justly take pride. Many students, after all, desire to possess degrees and grades that testify to their intellectual courage, effort, and accomplishment; they want an education that measures more than mere accumulation of credit hours. Despite acknowledging the need to expect more of students, however, individual faculty may anticipate that implementing stronger academic standards will lead to student backlash and consequent low student evaluations, hostile commentaries on RateMyProfessor.com, embarrassing grade appeals and grievances filed through a process that demeans student and professor alike, and a lower demand for their courses that will be noted disapprovingly by chairs and deans. Insofar as personnel decisions rely upon student approval, faculty, especially those without tenure, fear disadvantage if they raise standards. In broadest terms, the general problem of declining effectiveness and repute is best addressed by institutional self-criticism and the reassertion of core values. These authors assert that it should not be the mission of a university to reassure students so they can merely continue along their comfortable paths. Rather, universities ought to test the limits of students' learning and challenge them with the realities of their academic abilities, degrees of competitiveness, and levels of motivation. Even in nonselective and poorly funded institutions, faculty, individually and collectively, can reassert the value of education by acting to raise academic standards. In this article, the authors offer a list of politically and personally difficult actions that would help accomplish that important goal.",

        "description":"Liberal education and the liberal arts are not synonymous. \"Liberal arts\" refers to certain subjects of study, which may be pursued to many possible ends. \"Liberal education\" may be pursued through any subject matter, but the term implies distinct purposes: (1) breadth of awareness and appreciation; (2) clarity and precision of thought and communication; (3) critical analysis; and (4) honing of moral and ethical sensibilities. Thus an education in the liberal arts and sciences disciplines is not, by definition, a liberal education. Study exclusively in the liberal arts disciplines does not guarantee a liberal education. Indeed, many liberal arts majors are as narrowly specialized as any professional program. Conversely, many career-specific programs are insistent on liberal learning. In this article, the author contends that equating a liberal education with the study of the liberal arts and insisting that such an education is to be found today only in those colleges whose hallmark is a focus on the past does not much help the cause of either the liberal arts or liberal education.",

        "description":"The defining task for undergraduate departments is the design of a major, including the number and content of courses as well as other requirements. Department members must weigh the desire to produce graduates superbly prepared for further study against the charge that the major requires too large a share of an undergraduate's course options. This dilemma is particularly striking for the sciences at undergraduate institutions where faculty are committed to the breadth of the liberal arts but also pride themselves on the number of students going on to graduate school or employment in scientific fields. Biochemistry and molecular biology (BMB) are often among the most demanding majors in terms of course requirements. In addition to the linear nature of all science programs, which hinders the flexibility of a major, BMB are interdisciplinary fields that integrate material from courses in different departments. Tension between contributing departments often leads to an increase in the number of required courses. Since 1992, the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) has supported a recommended curriculum for the bachelor's degree in BMB. In the years since it was developed, this curriculum has been modified to emphasize skills rather than coursework. In addition to defining core content in chemistry, biology, and allied fields, the society has published a list of skills to be achieved. Although expressed in language specific to the sciences, these skills mirror the learning outcomes recommended by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) in its 2007 report, \"College Learning for the New Global Century.\" Mapping the two sets of skills onto one another indicates where the ASBMB guidelines are strongest and where they might be supplemented. Through a survey of department chairs and instructors, the researchers sought to learn how widely the ASBMB-recommended curriculum and skills are understood by departments, at what levels the skills are introduced, what methods of pedagogy are employed, and how often open-ended research problems are presented to students. Broader-ranging questions about the role of BMB in liberal education were explored through interviews and open sessions at the 2007 ASBMB national meeting. This article reports the findings of the survey. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"In order to enhance economic education in ways that are consistent with the liberal education perspective, the catalyst function of education needs to be supported more fully. The content of what is taught will, and should, be determined by individual professors and schools. Ideally, the \"right\" content will be taught passionately. But this is unlikely at present, if the goal is to prepare liberally educated students. The current structure of graduate programs and of colleges and universities themselves ensures that the content taught with passion is driven by narrow research interests rather than by general teaching priorities. Only major institutional change at both the graduate and undergraduate levels can affect that. In the absence of such major institutional change, marginal improvements can be made by modifying incentives and institutions so that more emphasis is placed on pedagogy and teaching. While there is no one set of \"best practices\" in economics pedagogy that are especially suitable for a liberal education, there are better and worse practices. Such practices should be an important part of the regular discussion at any college or university. The authors contend that if the economics major is to make the best possible contribution to the liberal education of undergraduate students, then much more discussion is needed about the content and focus of the economics major as well as how that content is taught. Positive change in any discipline does not come from the top down; it comes from the bottom up, and major change builds on the initiatives of individual schools. This article aims to open up a conversation, rather than to generate a set of specific recommendations. There are many ways in which the economics major can contribute to the liberal education of students. Thus, there are many ways in which the major can be structured to promote this objective. But the best economics major will not develop from bottom-up discussion unless departments are sufficiently concerned about the major and have appropriate incentives to ensure it contributes in the best way possible.",

        "description":"Study in language, literature, and culture has long been a defining feature of education in the liberal arts. Speaking, reading, and writing have traditionally stood at the heart of education because the arts of language and the tools of literacy are key qualifications for full participation in social, political, economic, and cultural life. Today the hallmarks of a liberal education--communication, critical analysis, and creativity--are more important than ever as prerequisites for success in life. A college education should develop students' abilities to think critically and analytically and to communicate knowledge and understanding effectively. While literacy is the foundational core of all educational and scholarly projects, it is the particular focus of study in departments of language and literature, and the twenty-first-century knowledge commons puts specific forms of literacy at a premium: the ability to communicate effectively and persuasively with others through \"cross-cultural literacy,\" to work with new forms of media through \"technological literacy,\" to understand language and culture in context through \"historical literacy,\" and to analyze, organize, and make sense of information through \"information literacy.\" The Modern Language Association recommends an approach to structuring baccalaureate degree programs in English and other languages that combines four constitutional elements: (1) a coherent program of study; (2) teamwork among the instructional staff members; (3) interdepartmental cooperative teaching; and (4) empirical research to assess the successes and shortcomings of the program. At once structured and flexible, the major in language and literature should follow an integrative model that is responsive to the demands of technological innovation and the realities of globalized societies. The major also needs to accommodate the explosion of disciplinary knowledge that, in language and literature as in other fields of study, creates daunting challenges while giving rise to new opportunities. A twenty-first-century liberal education must promote the linguistic powers, humanistic skills of analysis and argument, and cross-cultural awareness required for receiving and articulating ideas on an international stage, where the capacity to work comfortably in more than one language is the expectation and the norm.",

        "description":"At a time when leaders in higher education are increasingly asking students to engage the large issues of life's meaning and to think critically and responsibly about their role in the world, religious studies offers unique opportunities. Other disciplines such as philosophy, literature, and the creative arts doubtlessly engage questions of ultimate meaning. Yet these endeavors are largely the province of the talented few: (1) the philosopher; (2) the novelist; (3) the poet; (4) the painter; and (5) the dancer. The rest are the audience. While, to be sure, people can learn to appreciate the creations of these artists and scholars, they remain observers. Religion, by contrast, is largely created by its adherents. Millions of worshipers and hundreds of thousands of local religious communities--through their prayers, rituals, devotions, and acts of charity; their conversations about scriptures; and their hierarchies and institutions--shape and are shaped by the religious meanings of their traditions. If one truly wishes for students to engage the tremendous variety of human understandings of life, death, suffering, love, and meaning, there is perhaps no more direct path than through the study of religion. Clearly, the field of religious studies now finds itself at a pivotal moment. An unprecedented confluence of world events, public perceptions, and educational insights has created exciting possibilities for the growth and reimagining of the field--possibilities that were unthinkable even a decade ago. The current moment presents important opportunities for the academic study of religion--and poses a series of challenges. How scholars of religion respond to these challenges may well have much to say about the future of the discipline--not to mention the future of American public literacy about a broad range of religious phenomena. The evolving nature of the field--both with regard to global events and to the changing nature of the discussion of values within the modern academy--necessitates a reassessment of the undergraduate religion major and its role in advancing the larger goals of liberal education.

With the rush to profitability, values precious for the future of democracy are in danger of getting lost. The profit motive suggests to most concerned politicians that science and technology are of crucial importance. This author contends that educators should have no objection to good scientific and technical education. But other abilities--abilities crucial both to the health of democracy and to the creation of a decent world culture and a robust type of global citizenship--are at risk of getting lost in the competitive flurry. In this keynote address, Nussbaum focuses on the contrast between an education for profit-making and an education for a more inclusive type of citizenship. This contrast is related to another, familiar in discussions of global justice and global citizenship, between two conceptions of development: (1) the old narrowly economic conception of development; and (2) the richer more inclusive notion of \"human development.\" The analysis of education used even by the best practitioners of the human development approach tends to focus on basic marketable skills. It neglects the humanistic abilities of critical thinking and imagining that are so crucial if education is really to promote human development, rather than merely economic growth and individual acquisition.",

They ask why the cost of college has gotten so out of control compared to the costs of other goods and services, and they sometimes talk about the closely related subject of financial aid. But very rarely do Americans discuss the dramatic changes to the financial aid system that have made college increasingly unaffordable to the very students who need financial aid most. In researching his book \"Tearing Down the Gates: Confronting the Class Divide,\" the author came to the conclusion that, despite the oft-repeated rhetoric to the contrary, the American education system actually helps perpetuate inequality of opportunity. In this article, he explains why the American higher education system has become deeply stratified along class lines, discusses the need to confront the class divide in American education, and argues that Americans must tear down the gates and make higher education more inclusive, rather than exclusive.",

In the current recession, even financially well-positioned independents with substantial numbers of qualified applicants for 2009-10 are canceling searches and freezing budgets out of concern for the potential financial aid cost associated with bringing in a full class next fall. Much more troubling is the plight of the many public institutions that must seriously consider laying off tenured faculty and closing programs due to the financial exigencies resulting from mandated double-digit budget cuts. As bad as this may be, these institutions can still survive if they take swift and strong emergency action. In this article, the author suggests some first principles for approaching budgeting in tough times, and offers a list of suggestions for reducing expenses, expanding revenues, supporting students, and minimizing job losses. These suggestions can help one generate revenue, increase productivity, and cut expenditures. Some are tactical, others are strategic. Some are short term, while others are long term.",

IDAs have the potential both to increase access and retention of low-income students and to fulfill higher education's commitment to offer financial education. This article describes IDA, a financial tool designed to encourage low-income families to save toward and acquire an appreciating asset. IDAs offer not only matched funds, but also the opportunity to foster critical new life skills and behaviors with respect to financial management, credit, and debt. The author discusses how IDAs work for students, and presents a three-year study of education IDAs that aims to examine the potential for increasing IDA use for educational purposes, to explore higher education's involvement with IDAs, and to examine the potential for greater participation. The research suggests that postsecondary institutions can engage in a set of practices that would make them better partners with the community agencies that currently offer IDAs. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"One of the toughest hurdles to overcome in construction education is the varying levels of construction field experience among undergraduate students. Although an internship is a common construction management requirement, it is often completed after students complete classes in planning and scheduling. This poses a challenge for the modern construction educator concerning course design. If the instructor begins discussing activities that the inexperienced student has never been a part of, these students could fall behind their classmates. This article presents a technique for overcoming this challenge. Two-term project assignments required undergraduate planning and scheduling students to view several progress photos using current &quot;Job Camera&quot; technology to identify and sequence activities. A survey was administered to three semesters of students exposed to the teaching technique in order to assess the students' ability to identify and sequence activities before and after being exposed to the teaching technique. Survey results indicated that 88% of the respondents reported an improvement in the ability to both identify and sequence activities. Further analysis included a comparison of program exit assessment scores for students exposed to the technique versus those not exposed. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that those exposed to the technique had significantly higher planning and scheduling scores than those who were not exposed to the Job Camera technology.

Organizational members have uttered concern about students' inability to think critically. Although traditional pedagogical techniques, such as lectures and examinations, center on knowledge acquisition, debates in the technology classroom can effectively facilitate critical thinking. The purpose of this study was to gather via questionnaires the perceptions of technology students on the debate process used in the classroom to increase critical thinking. Overall, the students believed that the debate process was a useful learning activity. The results of the questionnaire revealed that students believed that the debates helped them understand the topic better, learn new knowledge, and gain an understanding of the debate process. In addition, students thought that the debates increased their critical thinking skills. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"When Lars Ulrich, drummer for the rock group Metallica, testified before Congress about his group's lawsuit against Napster in 2000, many people who followed copyright issues in the music industry were not surprised (Ulrich, 2000). Ever since downloading audio files became as easy as clicking a few buttons on a personal computer, charges of copyright infringement have been alleged and played out in the courts. The real surprise came when Indiana University, Yale University, and the University of Southern California also were named in the suit for allowing students to use their university computer networks to illegally downloading music files. The idea that colleges and universities could be held liable for their students' actions in this way was unsettling at the time, and to this day, questions linger about the role higher education should play in this arena from both legal and ethical perspectives. Since Metallica's lawsuit against Napster, including three universities, in 2000, higher education has been reacting to and running from potential legal threats, often regardless of the infringing or noninfringing use of peer-to-peer (P2P) software. In this article, the authors discuss the copyright issues in student peer-to-peer file sharing. While ultimately the issue of intellectual property involves legal issues of copyright, trademark, and patent laws, the authors focus on copyright law and the widening gap between it and advances in information and communication technologies. Rather than taking an either/or position as many extremists have done, the authors urge educators to do what they do best: respond to this societal issue by being true to their beliefs, which includes engaging interested parties in discussions on the protection of intellectual property, how technology has changed, and the way people view it, while maintaining a commitment to educate students along the way.",

        "description":"Distance education and information and communication technologies (ICTs) have been marketed as cost-effective ways to rescue struggling educational institutions in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This study uses classroom video analysis and follow-up interviews with teachers, students, and local tutors to analyse the interaction at a distance between learners in Mali and Burkina Faso and their French and Canadian instructors. Findings reveal multiple obstacles to quality interaction: frequent Internet disconnections, limited student access to computers, lack of instructor presence, ill-prepared local tutors, student unfamiliarity with typing and computer technology, ineffective technical support, poor social dynamics, learner-learner conflict, learner-instructor conflict, and student withdrawal and resignation. In light of the near death of the costly World Bank-initiated African Virtual University (AVU), this paper concludes by re-visiting the educational potential of traditional technologies, such as radio and video, to foster development in poor countries.

The study sought to understand the level of access and the challenges faced by teachers and tutors. Data was collected through in-depth interviews, survey, and document analysis. Findings showed that teachers should be enrolled in the program at a younger age, and issues that lead to delays in completion must be addressed.

The analysis of the implementation environment reveals deficiencies in policy, schools (workplaces), and training providers. The paper concludes with three recommendations: 1) Schools should support ongoing teacher learning in the workplace and should manage ICT resources for use by both teachers and students; 2) Government should support participatory and localised learning and institutionalise ICT access and use; and 3) Training providers should use blended methods and should model good ICT practices. The author also notes that change is needed in the culture of teaching and learning so that ongoing, situated, participatory, and collaborative approaches are accepted. Finally, collaboration between the training providers and the schools is necessary as is a change in beliefs about the use of ICTs in education. (Contains 1 figure and 3 footnotes.)",

The study involved comparing performance data of the program as perceived by students and faculty/administrators to standards prepared from the program's design. Performance data was obtained by administering two survey instruments to a random sample of students and faculty/administrators. Discrepancies between performance and standards were reported. The study concluded that although there were some discrepancies between program standards and performance the program is fulfilling its purpose of upgrading the professional and academic performance of a large number of teachers in the public K-8 schools in Ghana.

        "description":"The challenges to teacher educators in sub-Saharan Africa are acute. This paper describes how the Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (TESSA) consortium is working within institutional and national policy systems to support school-based teacher professional development. The TESSA consortium (13 African institutions and 5 international organisations delivering teacher education across 9 countries) designed and produced a bank of open educational resources (OERs) to guide teachers' classroom practices in school-based teacher education. Drawing on examples from the TESSA consortium and from the University of Fort Hare, South Africa, the authors categorize the forms of TESSA OER integration as highly structured, loosely structured, or guided use. The paper concludes by outlining success factors for the integration of OERs: accessibility, adequate resources, support for teachers, accommodation of local cultural and institutional practices, and sustainable funding.

        "description":"This paper reports on the re-design of the Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) programme, which is offered by the University of Pretoria through distance education (DE) to teachers in rural South Africa. In 2007, a team re-designed the programme with the goal of promoting access, quality, and student support. The team included an independent body, the South African Institute of Distance Education (SAIDE), and various education specialists. Training workshops for academics and a comprehensive internal and external review process contributed to the quality of the re-designed programme. Interactive web-based technologies were not included because of poor Internet connectivity; however, the authors note the use and potential of cell phone technology for DE programmes. Student support was enhanced by an additional short contact session, a capping assignment, a CD-ROM, and decentralised tutoring at contact venues. The programme was re-evaluated and approved in 2008, and the re-design methodology now guides similar projects. (Contains 6 figures and 3 footnotes.)",

        "description":"This paper innovatively extends the application of transactional distance theory (TDT) to evidence-based policy development in Mauritius. In-depth interview data on student persistence from a range of stakeholders is used to understand the implications of distance education (DE) policy deficit. Policy deficit has surfaced as another dimension of transactional distance and student persistence as an appropriate measuring instrument. Transactional distance is salient in the non-alignment of national and institutional DE planning. Associated results are myopic institutional vision, stagnating national plans, poor resource deployment, and ill-understood opportunities for personal development. This research validates TDT as an instrument for policy development and concludes that supporting advocacy plans will help to achieve sustainable distance education in the region. Lessons from the field in Mauritius can be usefully adapted to the sub-Saharan African context (SSA). These preliminary indications require further research and discussion. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Data collection methods included documentary analysis, naturalistic participant observation, and semi-structured interviews. The author identifies and analyses the technical, staffing, and cultural barriers to change when introducing technology-enhanced, flexible delivery methods. The study recommends that strategies to advance flexible learning should focus on the following goals: establish flexible policy and administration systems, change how staff utilization is calculated when flexible learning methodologies are used, embed flexible delivery in individual performance development and department/college strategic plans, ensure managerial leadership, hire and support permanent specialists, identify champions and share success stories, and address issues of inflexible organisational culture. This study may be of value in developing countries where mass-based models are sought to expand access to vocational education and training. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Data were examined from 84 participants enrolled in a weight maintenance study.

The AAQW also changed when targeted by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

Sixty female undergraduate students completed questionnaires and took part in a stressor and taste test. Results indicated that self-esteem was not predictive of eating behavior during the taste test, but was predictive of a chronic pattern of restricted eating and diet-breaking behavior (p less than 0.01). The relationship between self-esteem and restrained eating was fully mediated by a measure of body image dissatisfaction. Social anxiety was also predictive of restrained eating behavior (p less than 0.05), and this relationship was fully mediated by body image dissatisfaction as well. These results support the cognitive-behavioral model of bulimia nervosa in suggesting that low self-esteem is a risk factor for restrained eating behavior. (Contains 1 table.)",

The controversy concerns both the efficacy and the ethics of punishment. Five hundred randomly selected members of the Association for Behavior Analysis were sent a survey concerning their views on the efficacy and ethics of punishment. Respondents were asked to agree or disagree with statements about punishment using a six-point Likert-style scale, and to answer several open-ended questions. Respondents exhibited marked variability in their attitudes toward punishment, but on several points, opinions appeared to converge. Demographic variables were found to relate to attitudes, and views on the efficacy of punishment predicted views on its ethical status.

        "description":"During the last decade, theory and research on human self-regulation has made significant progress. While self-regulation may be understood as a generic term comprising a range of different cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes, most research pertains to a subcomponent of self-regulation, namely emotional self-regulation, or emotional regulation. The focus of published research is usually on the functional role of self-regulation and emotional regulation in normal behavior, and in behaviors that can easily be quantified with experimental methods, such as eating disorders, alcohol consumption, or sexual behavior. Little is known about specific functional components of self-regulation in more complex dysfunctional behaviors such as personality disorders, or, more specifically, offending behavior, which is often associated with antisocial and borderline personality disorder. If self-regulation research is to successfully inform therapeutic intervention on offender groups, two steps are necessary. First, more research must be conducted focussing on the identification of specific self-regulatory patterns or mechanisms of offender groups, and second, the findings must translate into practical suggestions for the modification of known behavioral intervention strategies. Based on the most important contemporary research lines in self- and emotional regulation, suggestions are made on where and how to incorporate existing knowledge into therapeutic action for offender groups.",

        "description":"The Juvenile and Adolescent Substance Abuse Prevention Program (JASAP) is a curriculum-based prevention and health promotion program for youth between the ages of 13 to 18 years in Fulton County, Georgia. The program was established in 2007 to promote healthy decision-making skills that would eventually lead to informed choices and decisions surrounding drug and alcohol use. Program evaluation assessed the cognitive and behavioral impact of the program--how program participation had changed prior knowledge, and the processes and outcomes related to making decisions about drug and alcohol use and how this was reflected in behavioral measures. The following scales were utilized in addition to other survey questions: (a) Stages of Change and Readiness Ruler (Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1982); (b) Decisional Balance Worksheet for Pros and Cons Assessment (Prochaska &amp; DiClemente, 1984); (d) Self-efficacy scale (Bandura, 1977); and (e) An adapted version of Robinson et al.'s (2001) assessment of substance abuse education. Demographics from the database (n=407) indicated an almost even distribution of males (57%) and females (43%). Majority of the students reported being exposed to alcohol and drugs in their homes and/or community. All reported they had learned something about drugs and alcohol at school. And a majority of the students reported that they had at least 2 people who they could talk to about anything. Pre post tests assessed knowledge gain and attitude change (n = 246). Knowledge was tested using the same test as the pretest and another equivalent test. The equivalent test was administered as a post test. Results indicated that the knowledge on the similar pretest increased significantly after the educational program, t (205)= -3.03, p =0.001 (Mean= 11.32) to the post test (Mean= 12.68),. Scores on the equivalent test of knowledge about alcohol and substance abuse revealed that participants scored an average of 9 points out of a total of 12. Also, although non significant, the attitude about alcohol and drugs improved from the pretest (Mean= 3.63) to the post test (Mean= 3.84). Students rated their instructor and course positively, and strongly agreed with the statement that they knew significantly more about substance abuse than they did before they took this course. Students identified the same number of pros and cons (2.0) for changing behaviors and reported their readiness to change their problematic behaviors (6.9 on a 10-point scale). Problematic behaviors identified by most of the children included attitude, anger, and specific behaviors. Participants' decision-making skills regarding alcohol/drug abuse were also evaluated. Results indicated that the majority of the participants (94%) made significantly more healthy decisions (Decision scenario 1, [data omitted] (1, n= 92)=85.172). Furthermore, participants were asked to indicate if they have considered career options and higher education. Participants reported a higher confidence in future decisions: Jobs, [data omitted] (2, n = 102) = 23.011, p less than 0.001; Education, [data omitted] (2, n = 102)=20.176, p less than 0.001. Thus overall the JASAP program was successful in attaining its goals. Continued funding for this intervention is thus deemed crucial!",

Results indicated that positive treatment outcome was associated with fewer coexistent anxiety disorders at pre-treatment and involvement in a marital relationship. Attrition was more likely to occur among cancer patients presenting with higher pre-treatment depression severity and those who were less educated.

The nature of the pediatric behavioral health industry poses a challenge for treatment research--adequate sample sizes are not always available, and the organizations themselves are generally hostile to active research. The requirement for a control group is often viewed as a human rights concern in this population (often mandated to participate in treatment), and the resistance of the clients and families, although normative, demands that the clinician researcher find a strategy to motivate them to work hard to address their problems.

Four vignettes from a case study involving a couple are used as illustrative material. It is argued that the therapist's feelings can serve as clues for identifying functional similarities between the therapist-client relationship and the clients' daily life situation.

The results indicated that social anhedonic participants were less accurate than controls (matched on age, gender and general intellectual competencies) on ToM tasks (P less than 0.001) and on complex deictic relational responding (P=0.05). Accuracy on reversing deictic relations explains 52% of the variance of ToM performance (P=0.000). These findings support the RFT approach to ToM and suggest the critical role of social contact for the remediation of deficits. (Contains 2 figures and 6 footnotes.)",

This article examines childhood trauma and attachment issues from the perspective of behavior analysis, and provides a theoretical basis for two alternative treatment models for previously abused children and their foster or adoptive parents: rational cognitive emotive behavioral therapy and trauma-based psychotherapy. These new treatment approaches are based on the integration of attachment theory and basic concepts and principles of rational thought and behavior analysis. These therapeutic models provide dyadic, cognitive, and emotive interventions that encourage behavior change with foster or adopted children who have been abused or neglected as part of their early experiences. The role of emotion in behavioral causation and the teaching and learning of different behavior are central to the treatment process, just as they are central features in healthy parent child relationships. Conclusions are reached that \"familial and therapeutic environments\" in which perception and previous learning guide parent child interaction are more important than diagnostic orientation, and implications for specific cognitive and behavioral interventions are suggested.",

This article examines social learning theory and the quality of parent-child relationships from the perspective of behavioral analysis, and provides a rationale for a comprehensive behavioral treatment approach for young offenders and their parents. A theoretical model has been developed to provide the social context to examine how abuse and neglect, inconsistent or erratic parenting practices, family structure, and abusive disciplinary methods, can be integrated to predict juvenile delinquency. The purpose of this model is to examine the major environmental determinants that impact the quality of parent-child relationships and associated antisocial behavior in children, and the relevant but implicit behavioral principles operating in the home. Questions are raised which suggest that typical or mainstream juvenile detention programs compete with the acquisition of new functional skills, and provide an environment for learned dysfunctional habits that are then reinforced and maintained in treatment programs that continue to model or promote criminal behavior. Conclusions are reached that learning and reinforcement history have a greater impact on the quality of parent-child relationships than family structure, and provide a theoretical rationale for analyzing and developing effective interventions for a problem of social importance.

The cumulative effect of these changes on the eating and exercise habits adopted by Americans has been disastrous. In order to reverse the obesity trend, physical and social environments that support healthful habits must develop. Behavioral approaches to weight loss have proven to be the most effective at promoting individual health behavior changes; however, these changes will be much more likely to persist if supported by family, school, and work environments, organizations, policies, and communities.

Analyzing each of these factors in the context of the others is important because the court decisions and state-level legislation interact to affect enrollment. We not only present the state of the law, but also examine several outcomes of affirmative action case law and ballot initiatives as well as political implications for the future of affirmative action. From a broad philosophical and legal perspective, then, we ask first, what is the current legal and political status of race-conscious policy in higher education admissions? And second, given that current status, what is the likelihood that by 2028 affirmative action will no longer be needed to further the goals of diversity and equality on college and university campuses? Our methods include analyses of prominent court decisions and state legislation, as well as analyses of enrollment data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System to examine the racial/ethnic diversity of first-time, degree-seeking undergraduates at several state flagship institutions from 1994 to 2005 and compare that to the racial/ethnic diversity of the same undergraduate students attending all 2- and 4-year degree granting public and private institutions in the flagship's state. In states potentially facing anti-affirmative action ballot initiatives, these analyses provide one approach to examining the current need for affirmative action in admissions and the likely consequences if the ballot initiatives pass.

The current study focused on mobility among those enrolled in charter schools in the state of Indiana. A multilevel Cox Proportional Hazards survival analysis model was used to identify significant predictors of student mobility within and from a state charter school system, using factors at both the student and school levels. Results indicated that initial student achievement upon first entering a charter school, student ethnicity, participation in a Title I funded program, and average years of teacher experience at the school were all associated with the decision to leave the charter. Specifically, students with higher initial achievement scores, those eligible for Title 1 services, and non-Caucasian students were more likely to leave charter schools prematurely. In addition, schools with a more experienced faculty had lower early departure rates than did those with less experienced teachers. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Children's movies bear so many significant features that it should be studied from many aspects. In fact, one of the issues very often encountered in researches and analyses done so far, is the element of terror exposed in children's movies. Nevertheless, first how the basic feelings such as fear and anxiety are produced and formed in children's movies should be discussed so that the concept of terror can be fully perceived and evaluated. In this context, the production and formation of terror and anxiety in children's movies cause much more serious, shocking and permanent influences than terror from the aspect of the psychology and education of children. As a matter of fact, the feelings of fear and anxiety are not only the psychical influences caused by the applied violence but also an essential reference nourished and expressed. In this respect, the issue how the feelings of fear and anxiety are produced should be carefully analyzed and evaluated so that the scenes of violence in children's movies can be elaborated upon in depth. For this reason, in this study the concepts of fear and anxiety are defined and again the historical traces of current culture of horror in movies are pursued, first to prepare the platform for discussion. Moreover, the research includes the study of a children's film, Harry Potter, which was chosen as an example in light of the conceptual definitions mentioned here, whereby the techniques of expression used in the production and formation of the feelings of fear and anxiety are revealed and expatiated upon. In the last section of the research, we present suggestions on forming and sharing the conscience of responsibility as well as on the realization of possible measures required for the protection of children against the potential dangers pointed at in the field of movies and media.

The study was conducted on 72 students in the fourth grade of a private school in Istanbul. The data were collected through focus group interviews conducted with teachers and students using &quot;Semi-structured interview forms&quot; and a &quot;reading comprehension scale&quot;. The reading comprehension scale was administered as pre-test and post-test. A dependent group's t test was employed for the analysis of the scale scores, and a structured reporting technique was used for the analysis of interview data. The findings of the study showed that the literature circles method improved the reading comprehension skills of students who had low level reading comprehension. It was also found out that students liked reading books by performing different tasks, discussing and cooperating with their friends over a period of time. Students stated that they remembered the book they had read with all the details even two weeks later.

The qualitative data were collected through unstructured observation and semi-structured interview in 90 class hours in total. The data were analyzed through content analysis. The results show that experienced elementary school teachers perform more activities related to metacognition before, during and after science and technology teaching process and they make use of more metacognitive strategies addressing many components of metacognition such as planning, observation, and organization. These findings revealed that teachers should be trained in in-service programs in a way that they would implement metacognitive strategies into their classes and their skills about metacognitive strategies implementation should be reinforced.",

        "description":"Due to the frequent change in expectations from education/learning, youth, the educational system's most dynamic participants, are experiencing low-level motivation in education and learning, because of growth and psychological characteristics or sociological, economic, and other reasons. This negative process is pushing program-developers, educational administrators and particularly teachers to investigate its reasons. To get such data, &quot;education of youth&quot; associations were investigated among youths (N=283) of different countries (Turkey, America, Russia, Ukraine) and 464 valid associations in 6 categories were obtained. The data analysis determined that Turkish students produced mostly individual (71.84%) and critical/negative (34.16%) associations. Most positive associations had qualities of &quot;expectations, hope, and advantage.&quot; Taking the associations into consideration, regulating educational environments can be used as a strong data in increasing motivation and developing educational policies.",

The study was conducted in Ordu, Giresun, Gumushane, and Sinop provinces of Turkey where school enrollment rates for girls were among the lowest in the Black Sea Region. The results showed that obstacles for female education varied and measures should be taken according to each context. Lack of adequate accommodation facilities for girls was the most iterated factor. Transportation, poverty, concerns for girls' chastity, the need for girls' labor at home, conservatism, preference for Koran schools with boarding facilities, early marriages, and high unemployment rates among educated youth were detected as significant obstacles for female education. Effective strategies addressing to each factor should be adopted.",

Significant group differences were found for total gesture use, communicative functions, and types of gestures. Results revealed significant differences for gestures within the category of behavior regulation between the groups. The typically developing children used gestures more frequently than other groups. The lowest frequency of gesture use have been found for children with autism. It was found that children with autism have more difficulties in gesture use within the category of Social interaction and joint attention than Down syndrome and typically developing groups. Children with Down syndrome have become more successful in the use of these gestures than other two groups. It was found that researcher-child interaction provides more information about the frequency of gestures than parent-child interaction.

As part of the research, 12 supervising teachers were visited at their schools. Seven of them were interviewed individually about their role in developing the knowledge and skills of student teachers during the professional experience. The remaining five teachers were unavailable for interview and responded to the core interview questions in a written survey. The teachers had a range of experience in the classroom (4-30 years) and in supervision (1-20 student teachers). They were asked why they had decided to take on their mentoring role and about the benefits they and their students gained from having a student teacher in the classroom. Their responses are summarised in this article. The article concludes that supporting a student teacher provides supervisors with a unique opportunity to influence the future of the teaching profession in a very practical way that ensures they have a significant role in improving the quality of new graduates.",

Following an article in the &quot;Australian Primary Mathematics Classroom&quot; (APMC) with methods appropriate for primary students (Brown, Watson, Wright, &amp; Skalicky, 2011), this article presents two more methods that are appropriate for middle school students who are beginning to learn about the trigonometric functions. The purpose of this article, in conjunction with the APMC article (Brown et al., 2011), has been to motivate teachers to present their students with meaningful investigations that lead to an appreciation and understanding of a variety of ways to estimate the height of an object that cannot be measured directly. Each of Brown et al.'s primary school investigations, and the middle school investigations presented here, require students to use computational estimation. The activities suggested in this article are intended for use with middle school students and it is important to check that students have the necessary prerequisite skills. As well as being a hands-on activity for students, the methods used in these investigations have real-life relevance and are employed by architects, planners and surveyors who use the same principles to estimate the height of buildings, and/or land formations, often employing the use of a clinometer for accurate measurements.

A qualitative research method was used in order to evaluate the views of prospective teachers about contributions of a social activities course. The students of the 10th academic term at Marmara University Faculty of Ataturk Education Department of Secondary Social Sciences Education Turkish Language and Literature Teaching Undergraduate Program took part in this study. In spring semester of 2007-2008 academic year, the prospective teachers were asked to write their views about contributions provided by applications of social activities lesson. The data were obtained through these documents. The analysis of survey data were carried out by induction analysis which is a method of content analysis. The results were sorted and analyzed according to content analysis. With respect to the findings obtained from the data, the prospective teachers evaluated the applications at two main categories as personal and occupational perspective. The collected data were interpreted by going through also related studies and a proposal made. As a result of the evaluation, the prospective teachers expressed that their skill of declamation in the face of community had developed, their social anxiety had decreased, their skills of cooperation and solidarity had developed, they had gained stronger self-confidence, their social skills had developed, their friends' and their own creativity had emerged, they had learned the situations that they can meet at phases of organization, they had gained experience on behalf of their career, they had got occupational material savings, and they had found the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge. In the view of such information, practically (2-2-3) 4 hour \"Social Activities\" lesson was offered to prospective literature teachers at pre-service period. (Contains 2 tables.)",

In this regard, the correlational research design was used to explain specific research objectives. The study was conducted in Ankara-Sincan during the 2008-2009 academic years. A total of 120 students having middle socioeconomic status participated in this study. The students in this research were in the fifth-grade at a public school. Reading comprehension and vocabulary tests were developed to evaluate the students' reading comprehension and vocabulary levels. Correlation and bivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess the data obtained from the study. The research findings indicated that there was a medium correlation between vocabulary and narrative text comprehension. In addition, there was a large correlation between vocabulary and expository text comprehension. Compared to the narrative text comprehension, vocabulary was also a strong predictor of expository text comprehension. Vocabulary made more contribution to expository text comprehension than narrative text comprehension.",

In the author's own presentation to the conference, he outlined research into an area that he believes is very important to mathematics learning but often overlooked. He outlined a set of competencies that are fundamental to the development of &quot;mathematical literacy,&quot; or a person's ability to apply their mathematical knowledge to practical situations. The competencies are communication, mathematising, representation, reasoning and argument, devising strategies, and using symbolic, formal and technical language and operations. These competencies can be thought of as a set of individual characteristics or qualities possessed to a greater or lesser extent by each person. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Visual culture studies have become the focus of research in recent years mainly due to the frequent use of art applications in Visual Arts courses in primary schools and the inadequate content of discipline based art education for the interpretation of today's multiple stimulants. By interrogating students' semantic stratums related to visuals, visual culture studies carried out in Visual Arts courses can help students gain a different perspective regarding artistic studies. The present study aimed finding out how visual culture studies can be carried out in Visual Arts courses in primary schools. The study had an action research design and was conducted during the 10 hours class-time of a Visual Arts course in a third-grade class of a primary school in Eskisehir in the fall semester of 2007-2008 academic year. The data of the present study, which was conducted on seven focal students, were collected with various data collection tools, such as demographic information scale, video recordings, semi-structured interviews, document analysis, researcher diaries and student diaries. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The present study revealed that the students effectively participated in visual culture studies; that they made critical interrogations by broadening their thoughts based on their previous knowledge; and that they found the course more entertaining thanks to the visual culture studies. In conclusion, findings of the study suggest that visual art applications, which will encourage students to criticize cultural meanings within the Visual Art Curriculum, may be used as a strong instrument to help students interpret the visual world and become more efficient in expressing their ideas in art works.",

The articles obtained as a result of this review process were analyzed by taking the aims, results and the education levels into consideration. As a result of the research, some studies which didn't complement one another both in the world and in Turkey were encountered. However, for the most part the studies conducted had similar purposes and they had the same results. Descriptive studies introduced that similar misconceptions related to global warming existed in all levels of education and the media had negative effects during this process. Experimental studies revealed that the education methods where the students are active, visual materials and social activities outside the school were more effective methods in educating more conscious students about global warming.",

The data in the study were collected through \"The Inventory of Class Activities Done in line with the Intelligence Areas\", and \"the Semi-structured Interview Form\". The quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and one-way analysis of variance. The qualitative data were analysed by content analysis as well. It was found that teachers generally used activities addressing for all intelligence areas, they were aware of the multiple intelligence theory, not the subject teachers but the elementary teachers and the senior teachers use teaching activities for more than one intelligence area in their classes. It was determined from the teachers' responses to the questionnaire that teachers were aware of the activities for intelligence areas. However, the interviews revealed that they could not transfer their knowledge about intelligence areas into their classes. Therefore; it could be observed and investigated why teachers did not implement their knowledge about multiple intelligence theory into their classes and their efforts in the preparation, planning, practice and evaluation phases of teaching.",

The data sources included genetics concept tests (GBT) and semi-structured interviews. Genetics concept tests were administered to all of the participants. Six participants were selected by purposeful sampling for semi-structured interviews. The results of the study showed that prospective biology teachers had incomplete understandings and several alternative conceptions of Mendelian genetics. Although they were able to describe some concepts, they frequently failed to apply them in problem solving situations. In many cases mechanical application of common problem solving strategies were observed without comprehensive conceptual understanding. The participants that demonstrated behaviors which require metacognitive strategies and higher order thinking skills such as constructing hypothesis, data, and end-means analysis were more successful in genetics problem solving. Some of the participants who were successful in cause-effect type problems had difficulties in end-means type of problems. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

The purpose of this study is (a) to explore the effectiveness of the course design, and (b) to reveal the challenges to popularizing these courses in more Chinese universities. The findings from our survey of students in Beijing Language and Culture University show that the multimedia technology combined with appropriate instructional design can create a good learning environment that leads to effective language learning. Meanwhile, challenges have been revealed during the implementation that calls for future study. Other future research issues on learning the Greek language in China are also discussed.

        "author":["Issack, Santally Mohammad"],
        "description":"Over the recent years, there has been a growing interest in Open Educational Resources (OER). A similar trend was observed about a decade ago in the concept of Learning Objects, which inevitably faded without really making an impact in real-world educational contexts. A number of repositories were created that contain thousands of learning objects. However, on the consumption side, very little is known in terms of their implementations and impacts on teaching and learning. The same phenomenon is observed with Open Education Educational resources which are by definition learning objects but they are freely available resources available for educators and practitioners to use, reuse, remix and re-contextualise in local contexts. While the use of OER is widespread among educators (similarly to learning objects), however they often happen in discretion, isolation and not really in well-established frameworks (pedagogical, economical and institutional). This paper presents a case study of how OERs have been included in a sustainable and innovative teaching and learning model in three online courses at Diploma, Bachelor and Masters Level. It shows how the inclusion of OERs helped maintain a good quality level, sustain a viable economic model with reduction of tuition fees for learners, increase access and achieve the intended learning outcomes without any negative impact on the learners' experience.

It aims to apply the principles and possibilities of evolved distance and e-learning in originally traditional course materials and laboratory experiments during all the stages of the learning and assimilating process. One of the challenges for the consortium was the use of a common electronic learning platform. By filling in questionnaires the students at the partner institutions could contribute to the usefulness of the developed outcomes. Some students even volunteered to go abroad to a partner institution for a short time to execute and evaluate some tasks and laboratory experiments, and thus creating added value to the e learning possibilities. The project outcomes are diverse, ranging from physics to electronics. Subsequently, they can be integrated into a broad spectrum of topics. When taking all the developed modules and laboratory experiments the student is awarded a maximum of 20 ECTS credits. On the whole, this Erasmus project was fascinating not in the least because of the possibilities of the blended problem-based learning model and the difficulties raised by the common electronic learning platform--both technically and pedagogically.

        "author":["Al-Khatib, Hayat"],
        "description":"Technology Enhanced Learning is a feature of 21st century education. Innovations in ICT have provided unbound access to information in support of the learning process (APTEL, 2010; Allert et al, 2002; Baldry et al, 2006; Frustenberg et al, 2001; Sarkis, 2010). LMS has been extensively put to use in universities and educational institutions to facilitate the management of learning at more than one frontier (Weber et al, 2001; Kraemer et al, 2001). The second wave of computer mediated communication (CMC) made continuous communication possible and unrestricted to space or time (Simon et al, 2002; Nejdl et al, 2002). With this surge, brought about by advances in technology, concerns relating to &quot;pouring resources into unpredictable venture&quot; (Baldry et al, 2000; Sykes et al, 2008), necessitated a review of the educational experience and outcome (Jonassen et al, 2003; Richards, 2004; Kress, 2003, Barab et al, 2004) to assess the direct impact of technology enhanced learning on learners. The study examines the outcome of pedagogic practices in the digital age, in pre and post technology supported applications (Al-Khatib, 2009). The aim is to identify quantitative and qualitative indicators that relate to applying technology enhanced learning. Participants are senior students of linguistics doing project research and utilizing virtual forums to facilitate dialogue and debate on set tasks. Learners' performance was recorded quantitatively and qualitatively for the period of two consecutive academic semesters The outcome of the study identifies cognitive, reflective, analytic, synthetic, dialogic, technical and sociocultural benefits for the participants using Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) practices.

        "description":"This research investigated Irish Small to Medium Sized Educational Institutions (SMSEs) involved in Higher Education (HE) that adopted Moodle, the OSS (Open Source Software) course management system (CMS). As Moodle has only been adopted in the Irish HE sector in the last 5-7 years, this research crucially studied the attitudes of the SMSEs that have invested in it to uncover the influencing factors (lessons learned, rationale) concerning OSS adoption in HE from the view point of the smaller colleges. A full population of Small and Medium Sized Educational Institutions, large colleges and universities in HE operating in Ireland that utilize Moodle were included in this research. A variety of Open Source Moodle service providers (large and small) operating in Ireland were also included in this research. This research found a high degree of improved confidence in additional Open Source core system adoption and integration in SMSEs resulting from Moodle adoption. This confidence has been a direct result of the Moodle experience and the supportive community that has been found to encapsulate it. The Moodle experience in Ireland has, without doubt, challenged traditional preconceptions and fears concerning core OSS adoption. In addition, proactive SMSEs have benefited greatly in Moodle assistance from other colleges, particularly the universities. Quality external Moodle support service has been viewed very positively. This research also suggests that Moodle has helped to realize long term Managed/Virtual Learning Environment (M/VLE) aspirations of SMSEs as they continuously strive for competitiveness as the most financially vulnerable players in Higher Education. This research adds to the advancement of what is known about OSS expansion in education that importantly extends beyond the Irish HE domain. (Contains 6 figures.)",

The students included in the study are adults with health problems participating in a rehabilitation process to re-enter into working life. As a group the students are characterized by difficulties, problems and diagnoses that for many represent learning disadvantages. The study examines the results of combining individual online distance learning with support organized by a local vocational rehabilitation enterprise. In this article student support refers to all kinds of non-academic services and help to students, and does not include any face-to-face teaching or tutoring. The amount and type of local support given and how it has been experienced by the individual student may vary between the different enterprises, dependent on their budgets, number of students in the learning room, types of programmes studied and individual needs of the local students. The study indicates that online line study with adequate local support may constitute a good solution for this target group. Both case handlers in the Welfare and Labour Administration, local counselors and the students themselves report positive experiences with the learning solution examined. Statistics on completions and withdrawals demonstrate that the group of potentially disadvantaged learners achieve well in online study when they receive sufficient social, technical and practical support.

This study, of a qualitative nature, was conducted at a public university in Brazil. Data were collected by means of unstructured interviews, observations, and a questionnaire with close- and open-ended questions. Since DE is a relatively novel educational modality in Brazilian public higher education, this study asked pathfinder faculty to give advice to upcoming colleagues, most of them experienced in face-to-face higher education, but new to DE. Cooperation, commitment, organization, and above all courage and humility to learn and openness to new experiences, are, according to this research, attitudes essential to novice DE teachers.

        "description":"This paper explores some new challenges facing universities in a global multimediated Internet-based environment, as they seek alternative paradigms and options to remain true to their core business. At a time of rapid technological change, and contested, complex concepts associated with globalisation, knowledge is becoming a primary factor of production in a global economy. Universities face macro challenges of responding to the exponential demand for higher education, decreasing government funding, and  the changing nature of knowledge, student expectations and global competition. While advances in the Internet can support constructivist, self-directed interactive learning, its implications for higher education remains complex and problematic. The paper examines potential challenges of new educational approaches within the framework of more traditional open learning and e-learning environments. The main challenge is to develop a university that shifts the paradigm from the conventional national university to a sustainable global learning system that maintains quality in teaching, learning, processing and applying knowledge to real-life problems in diverse cultural contexts.

        "description":"In recent years there has been growth in online distance learning courses. This has been prompted by; new technology such as the Internet, mobile learning, video and audio conferencing: the explosion in student numbers in Higher Education, and the need for outreach to a world wide market. Web-based distance learning is seen as a solution to problems of outreach and course delivery. This paper considers module costing models to compare the costs of delivery of: (1) A traditionally delivered face-to-face module; (2) A web-based distance learning module delivered by in-house academic staff; and (3) A web-based distance learning module delivered by external contracted staff. The model uses Activity Based Costing (ABC) utilising data from HEFCE and other sources; and with assumptions made from practice at Leeds Metropolitan University from over ten years experience of delivering web-based distance learning courses. Using the models; different scenarios can be run. The paper concludes that there are savings to be achieved by utilising Web-based distance learning. This saving could, in turn, be passed on to students. Furthermore, the student experience, in terms of contact does not have to suffer and may in fact be enhanced by utilising Web-based distance learning. (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "author":["Allen, Heather"],
        "description":"The idea that study abroad (SA) is an ideal context for acquiring language is one largely supported by foreign language (FL) students and their teachers, the latter often recollecting their own successful if not life-transforming sojourns abroad. According to Rivers (1998), SA represents &quot;an environment which most closely resembles the environment of the first language learner: continuously available target language input, in all possible modalities, registers, and domains&quot; (p. 492). Yet despite potential benefits, students often do not take full advantage of learning opportunities during SA, instead spending time outside the classroom socializing with SA peers rather than trying to access social networks in the community that would most enhance FL learning. Given previous research revealing SA participants' limited sustained interactions in the FL during SA, this study investigated interactive contact with French outside the classroom for 18 participants during short-term SA. In particular, this study sought to answer the following question: &quot;How much interactive contact with French did SA participants report and to what degree was each form of contact perceived as a valuable affordance for FL learning?&quot; To investigate participants' experiences and perceptions related to interactive contact with French during SA, a mixed-methods design was used, including quantitative survey data and qualitative interview and learning blog data. Findings illuminate how participants themselves perceive, represent, and interpret a short-term SA experience. Findings related to participants' reported interactive contact in French with host family members, SA peers, and other French speakers in Nantes as well as participants' perceptions of those forms of contact as linguistic affordances are synthesized.

        "author":["Ireland, Colin"],
        "description":"Among the responsibilities of international educators is to help students begin the process of identifying the foreign in their new environments in order to learn from it. The major obstacle for Americans studying abroad in developed economies, especially in English-speaking countries, is to become sensitive to the subtleties of foreignness. The purpose of this essay is to highlight how an English-speaking country with a developed, open, globalized economy in Western Europe--in this case, Ireland--can be used to teach American undergraduates how to identify, appreciate, and learn from the foreignness they inevitably encounter when they travel beyond the boundaries of the United States. American students must leave behind the mindset of a superpower and become sensitive to the strategies that a small, relatively powerless nation must adapt in order to survive and thrive economically, politically, and militarily in the community of nations. They can participate in a society and culture where both the spoken and written word wields real power and where storytellers, writers and poets are venerated. They enter an ancient culture that has maintained a remarkable continuity for millennia despite significant linguistic, political and social disruptions; that has suffered the loss of a language and its literature; that has been subjugated by a powerful neighbor and recovered its independence; that for centuries has had its population dispersed worldwide and yet retained a sense of identity.

        "author":["Woolf, Michael"],
        "description":"The purpose of this essay is to focus on assertions that have accumulated around the work of international education professionals and practitioners: the idea of the global citizen. The propagation of this notion derives from, essentially, two sources: (1) it is a recurrent claim made by study abroad programs; and (2) it is used also as a means of self-description. The objective is to explore some of the assumptions behind the phrase which, ultimately, do a disservice to the credible aspirations embedded in international education. The phrase when used in a personal context usually describes someone who is, or who aspires to be, broad minded, intellectually engaged with other cultures, aware of the interdependence of nations, committed to tolerance and understanding of difference, and so on. That describes, the author argues, a \"good\" citizen. Shared beliefs in international values impose no rights or legal obligations. It is a voluntary, ethical assertion not a form of membership which is one necessary component of citizenship. The global adjective is obfuscation (or, as Leo Rosten might say, a \"mishegas\").

        "author":["Savicki, Victor"],
        "description":"In international education the conventional wisdom, supported by research, is that more contact with a host culture yields better results for study abroad students. Such exposure to a foreign culture is seen as the &quot;raison d'etre&quot; for study abroad: the mechanism provoking students to challenge their ethnocentric notions and move toward a more inclusive worldview. However, the relationship between contact and outcomes is a bit more complicated. Some shorter-term programs seem be able to attain outcomes similar to or identical with longer-term programs. There may be different outcomes depending on both quantity and quality of contact. Many factors may account for this more nuanced connection between foreign culture exposure and positive outcomes, not the least of which are parallel, concurrent contacts with other home culture study abroad students, and continued contact with significant people in the student's home culture. This research attempts to explore the relationships between various types of cultural contact (host culture, American student peers, and home culture) and important aspects of the students' study abroad experience. It relates these various aspects of contact to precursors of, and readiness for, study abroad, to several outcomes of study abroad, and to psychological processes employed by students during their sojourn. The aim is to shed light on the impact of various forms of contact, and to suggest possible processes underlying differential contact. These underlying processes have implications for education abroad program design. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Living and learning in another country, primary conditions of the study abroad experience, are commonly associated with two fundamental outcomes. The first outcome is an increase in &quot;external&quot; connections, manifested through an increased ability to converse in another language and an increased understanding and sensitivity to another culture. The second outcome is an &quot;internal&quot; redirection, a deepening sense of identity and self-awareness. Study abroad experiences and their relationship to external educational goals have been studied extensively in terms of its effects on enhancing foreign language acquisition as well as cultural awareness and intercultural relationships. In contrast, research addressing higher education goals associated with internal effects have not yet been fully explored in terms of their connection to study abroad experiences. This study focuses on several elements of personal growth and internal development that are particularly salient during the college years. The study is a response to the call for greater understanding of the interior aspects of student development, as bound to significant experiences in the life of the college student, particularly the increasingly popular experience of study abroad. The authors' approach to gaining this understanding is to provide empirical evidence of the ways in which an international living and learning experience significantly enhances college student development in the areas of identity, faith, and vocational calling. Accordingly, their research hypothesis is that students who participate in study abroad programs experience significantly greater changes in faith, vocational calling, and identity development than do students who do not participate in such programs. Their findings suggest that many of these changes, in some fashion, do occur. Moreover, the findings suggest that the application of faith to daily living and decision-making increased for students who studied abroad and decreased for those students who did not study abroad. Their research demonstrates some of the potential effects of study abroad on identity development. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Taking Ife, Vives Boix, and Meara's (2000) study as a starting point, this study attempts to determine whether development in both levels of vocabulary acquisition also takes place in classroom settings. The results of this study suggest that classroom instruction does not foster lexicon development neither in size nor in depth of vocabulary knowledge. In relation to this deeper level of lexical knowledge, there is evidence that indicates that analytic and paradigmatic associations are more likely to be acquired in classroom contexts than syntagmatic ones. In contrast, study abroad students experience an increase in both levels, improving at the breadth level to a greater extent than at the associative one. The findings reported in this paper suggest that deeper level of vocabulary knowledge is more likely to be acquired in study abroad contexts since classroom instruction does not seem to offer the appropriate elements to trigger its development.

        "description":"Research shows that study abroad experience affects professional qualifications. It is evident that employers value the skills and knowledge potentially gained from study abroad and that these competencies are transferable on the job. Nearly all known research lacks a longitudinal component. Of the few studies that focus on long-term outcomes, only three address professional development. Each asks two quintessential questions: (1) Do alumni gravitate toward working in an international capacity; and (2) Was career direction influenced by their experience. This study aimed to evaluate if and how study abroad has long-term impact on participants' professional development. It investigates the professional outcomes and benefits of studying abroad as perceived by study abroad alumni ten years following their undergraduate experience. Participants were questioned about the skills, knowledge, and self-awareness they acquired and maintained from their study abroad experience. Inquiries were made into how and if these acquisitions proved professionally applicable, influenced career paths, included work with international dimension, and contributed to success. The results strongly suggest that study abroad has significant long-lasting career impact and professional applicability. Results demonstrate that a majority of study abroad alumni in the sample gravitate toward a line of work with an international or multicultural dimension. Findings also suggest that knowledge, skills, and self-awareness gained by studying abroad are professionally applicable in the form of intercultural competences and personal growth.

The Ohio Alliance reports that only 13% of all U.S. students who studied abroad during the 2004-2005 academic year were from the STEM fields of study. The Institute of International Education Open Doors Report, however, does not provide a breakdown of the number of American students per academic field of study in specific countries or regions. For this reason it is difficult to know how many U.S. students in the STEM fields are actually studying and/or researching in Germany each academic year. This report maps patterns of study abroad in Germany by U.S. students in the Scientific, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields and to learn what, if anything, Germany is doing to attract these students to its universities and research institutions. It also looks at the academic trends in the STEM fields in both the United States and German higher education systems in order to better understand the international educational opportunities for U.S. students to study these disciplines abroad in Germany. Finally, it investigates if there are current developments or policies in Germany to attract U.S. students and in particular students in the STEM fields to study and/or research in German universities and institutes.

The current study delves into sociocultural adaptation in order to clarify that process and provide information useful for educators, trainers, coaches, and others guiding those facing a sojourn in a foreign culture. A question to be examined is how to facilitate study abroad student sociocultural adaptation so that they can reap the benefits associated with the Integration strategy. Fundamental to answering that question is the need to discover what processes might be involved with successful versus unsuccessful sociocultural adaptation. The current study attempts to explore this matter by following students who report easy versus difficult sociocultural adaptation early in their sojourn. It examines the relationship between sociocultural and psychological adaptation. Specifically, it focuses on the impact of the ease of &quot;fitting in&quot; to a new culture with psychological outcomes of satisfaction and reactions to stress. One might predict that lower initial adaptation to living in a foreign culture might result in lower psychological adjustment. The study findings, however, are more complicated, revealing linkages to the quality of the study abroad experience more than to its outcomes. A brief literature review that sets the stage for the study is presented. (Contains 3 figures and 3 tables.)",

This analysis more often than not utilizes methodologies particular to social science research. What has been missing from the profession of education abroad is a parallel development of theory. A discussion of the city's relation to study abroad provides an opportunity to insert a theoretical element into the pedagogy of the profession. Specifically, the author proposes to introduce the Foucauldian concepts of \"genealogy\" and \"heterotopia\" to the idea of the \"city,\" and in turn apply those same terms to the place of the city in the study abroad experience. Then, turning from Michel Foucault as \"philosopher of space\" to Paul Virilio, \"philosopher of time,\" the author demonstrates the interplay between Foucault's heterotopia and Virilio's \"anti-city,\" showing how study abroad in the contemporary, globalized city requires distinct programmatic changes to the (s)pace of education abroad.",

        "description":"London is the paramount example of a city that is not bounded by its geography and cannot be grasped in isolation. The U.K.'s national capital and the prime focus for business, finance and creative industries, London also transcends the U.K.'s borders as a hub of the world economy. This paper argues that London, a city riddled by the socioeconomic contradictions of its success, provides unparalleled opportunities for active experiential and inquiry-based learning which transcend the conventional study abroad agenda. The authors outline some of the ways in which students' conceptions of London as a study abroad destination can be transformed by their active investigation of its global nature. London is shaped in multiple ways by its connections with the wider world, and in turn shapes the world through the decisions which are made there--a &quot;factory&quot; of globalization. London's distinctive global nature can be identified in terms of historicity and spatiality, located in both the legacy of its imperial dynamic and its contemporary place in the networks of the world capitalist economy. The authors discuss principal dimensions of London's &quot;globality,&quot; which provide the contextual framework for its value as a learning laboratory. (Contains 3 notes.)",

        "author":["Blair, Scott"],
        "description":"Study abroad by U.S. students, despite recent growth into non-western and rural destinations, often remains focused on cities, often very large and highly urbanized ones. While the destination cities for study abroad are located across the globe, European cities remain predominant, and thus, this article focuses on study abroad in one city. The very purpose of study abroad is greatly magnified in the city precisely because the city provides so many of those challenges and opportunities required of effective pedagogical strategies in cultural awareness. This article looks at how experiential learning activities can be employed to support greater tolerance for diversity in an era of globalization by using a case study from a study abroad course on the urban landscapes of LGBT communities in Paris. Drawing on National Society for Experiential Education (NSEE) guidelines for experiential learning, this article (1) proposes a theoretical approach to using the city as a laboratory for facilitating intercultural learning, understanding identity formation, and building tolerance of diversity; and (2) shows how mapping can be used to better understand the complexity and specificity of urban landscapes and the identities they generate.

        "description":"Jerusalem is more than an intriguing global historical city; it is a classroom for liberal learning and international understanding. It had never been a city of one language, one religion and one culture. Looking at the origins of Jerusalem's name indicates its international and multicultural nature. While Israelis designate Jerusalem as their political capital, Palestinians recognize it as their traditional capital. This paper intends to introduce the U.S. international educator, faculty, and students to the past 500 years of Jerusalem's social and cultural history by focusing on (1) the geography and physical nature of the Holy City and its quarters (&quot;ahya'&quot;); (2) the social and economic growth up to 1948 of the Old (walled) City and the surrounding neighborhoods (&quot;harat&quot;) of the New (unwalled) City in terms of schools, public services and markets; and (3) the present cultural, social, and political presence of Israelis, and the Jewish colonial settlements, or neighborhoods encircling both the Old City and the new City of the 21st century.

        "description":"The urban scholar Jane Jacobs once described city life as &quot;the ballet of the streets.&quot; In more than a quarter century of joint teaching, the authors have used Jacobs' metaphor to help their students understand that cities are living organisms created and maintained, for good or ill, by the people who live and work in them. At heart their teaching are intense encounters with cities, a &quot;street level&quot; experience designed to give students a chance to walk the city's streets, and to meet its people, prominent and not, so that they can discover for themselves, in living context, the city's culture, varying life-styles, and issues. Given their international importance and astronomical growth over the last half century, cities are arguably the most significant social systems in the world and, as a result, are crucial for students to understand as such. The purpose of this paper is to share, first, the methodology the authors have developed for studying cities &quot;at street level&quot;; and second, to suggest how that methodology might be used in the study of cities anywhere. Starting with a course comparing New York and Toronto, they have used a similar approach to study cities in England, Ireland, Italy, Central Europe, China, and Vietnam.",

        "description":"While urban settlements have been an integral part of human life for millennia, cities today are arguably at the heart of survival on, and of, this planet. More than half of the world's population now lives in cities, and urban centers present some of the greatest social and environmental challenges of their time. Though students may study in or travel through cities while learning abroad, urban settings typically provide the scenery rather than the focus for study abroad programs. The International Honors Program (IHP), in contrast, studies the urban context itself and embraces the consequential role of cities in the world as the thematic heart of the authors' study abroad program, Cities in the 21st Century. In this article, the authors discuss the content and the learning opportunities that are available when the city is the classroom. They describe the current design of the program and methods that they use, and suggest how the intercultural context and interdisciplinary nature of this experience can be adapted to other programs in international education.",

        "description":"As international educators, the overwhelmingly urban context of study abroad requires not only a more intense querying of \"the city\" as a concept, but also more attention to how students could engage with and learn from the urban landscape. In this article, the authors begin with a theoretical flanerie through a range of ideas related to the city in order to frame programmatic strategies for promoting a more critical student engagement with urban spaces and places. They pay particular attention to the fact that students now come into study abroad cities armed with a battery of technological tools, unlike their 19th century counterpart. They question whether students are employing these tools to engage with the spaces and places of locality or simply creating endless images and representations about these abroad cities without any real thought or connection. They aim to provoke thought about how they might profitably harness the possibilities of students' new media use toward their pedagogical ends. They therefore cover both theoretical and practical matters to encourage practitioners to infuse programming with increased local specificity as they welcome the current generation of study abroad participants into what is still a plethora of urban difference.",

        "description":"Greece conjures up images of idyllic island landscapes, turquoise seas and venerable mythic deeds set among majestic monuments. These notions are, moreover, often associated with a history, religious culture and language that are ancient. Tourist posters and national sentiment aside, today the Hellenic Republic is a country that is as much European as it is Mediterranean, Levantine, and Balkan. In other words, it defies categorization. This multiple identity gives educators a remarkable tool when working with study abroad students who find their way to Greece because, no matter what expectations or assumptions a student may travel with, they are rarely met once the student reaches Athens. In fact, these mis-expectations are perfectly situated to act as one half of a double exposure: what do the students expect to see--if they can articulate it at all--and what do they actually encounter? This article uses The Greek Key: Experiencing Athens as a Cultural Landscape, a required course at the Arcadia University College of Global Studies' program in Athens, as an arena in which to address this question and suggest pedagogical strategies for helping students reconcile the expectations about Athens and Athens' realities.
