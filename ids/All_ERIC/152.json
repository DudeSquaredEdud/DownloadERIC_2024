        "author":["Prescott, Elizabeth"],
        "description":"A study was conducted comparing young children's experiences in three types of day care--closed structure, open structure and family--with their experiences in home care supplemented by part-time nursery school. A total of 112 children, aged 2 to 5, were observed, each for 180-200 minutes. Eighty-four were selected from 15 day care centers, half having open and half having closed structures. Fourteen children came from 14 family day care homes. Fourteen were children from intact families who spend half the day in nursery school and half at home. The Day Care Environmental Inventory was designed to permit immediate coding of two levels of behavior--the mode of behavior every 15 seconds and activity segments of which the 15-second codings are a part. Differences between types of  care were found in the availability and usefulness of adults, opportunities for autonomy and initiative, supports for self-esteem, and opportunities for cognitive engagement. Closed structure group day car appears to provide clear limits and adult input to which children must attend, but it appears to be somewhat lacking in opportunities for autonomy and initiative, in positive adult-child interaction, and in supports for self-esteem. Open structure group care offers opportunities for child-child interaction and more autonomy and initiative, but adult input and opportunities for cognitive engagement are low. Family day care and nursery school-home care are similar in that adults are more available to children than in group care and opportunities for autonomy and initiative are higher.  Supports for self-esteem are also high. (KM)",

        "description":"Cooperation among individuals depends upon both the goal structure of the situation and the cooperative skills of the individuals. Since cooperation is probably the most important and basic form of human interaction, the skills of cooperation successfully are some of the most important skills a person needs to master. Cooperative skills include the skills of: (1) self-disclosing to and building trust with others; (2) communicating effectively with others; (3) influencing and supporting others; and (4) managing conflicts constructively. Basic to the establishment and stabilization of cooperation are the skills of communicating cooperative intentions and expectations and building trust. Effective communication depends upon both sending and receiving skills and the building of trust  depends upon the skills of reciprocating a person's disclosure of information, ideas and feelings, and the communication of acceptance of his disclosures.

        "description":"The negative results to an assessment of a Bank Street-sponsored Follow Through program raised questions about conventional ways of assessing the effects of educational programs. Children in a Follow Through program using the developmental-interaction approach and children in conventional classrooms were observed and tested for comparison. The classroom observation data were quite different for the two types of classrooms, but there were no significant testing differences attributable to the program. Test responses are affected by unique factors such as examiner variables. Certain aspects of the test situation receive little attention but are especially relevant to the assessment of educational programs. Test responses also assess an individual's ability to generalize and  transfer from one situation to another. Children in a conventional classroom, with its emphasis on the teacher's dominant role, are better attuned to the testing situation, in which the examiner questions and the child responds. There is, as well, greater uniformity of experience in the conventional classroom. In the child's passive role in the testing situation, demonstration of cognitive ability is quite dependent on language usage. The approach that may be appropriate for assessing some kinds of functions and groups may lead to misevaluation of others. What is needed is a flexible, responsive, diversified use of formative evaluation and a delay in summative evaluation until a program has had a chance to take effect. (KM)",

        "description":"Forty infants, 10 at 4, 6, 8, and 10 months, were confronted by an experimenter who acted out angry, happy, sad, and neutral facial experssions, accompanied with appropriate vocalizations. The infants' responses were recorded on video tape and rated for attention, negative and positive affect, and activity. Results indicate that the 4-month old infants responded indiscriminately to the various expressions, but the 6-month and older infants discriminated between the emotions with attention and negative affect behavior and in many cases responded with the appropriate emotion. These results confirm, in part, earlier observations made by Darwin (1877) and Buhler & Hetzer (1928). The distinctive features of the experimenter's behavior which elicited the appropriate reactions from the  infants were not determined. (Author)",

        "description":"Many investigators have been interested in the development of techniques for remediating undersirable classroom behavior, but far less attention has been paid to physical, spatial and architectural variables which often set the occasion for inappropriate behavior in the classroom. The present study explored the relationships between these ecological variables and kindergarten students' behaviors. One experiment demonstrated that when children's seating arrangements were crowded or when they were required to crowd around a display, their visual attendance to the teacher or to the educational materials was markedly reduced. A second experiment demonstrated that: (1) visual attendance to a teacher reading a story decreases when academic sessions are preceded by active periods and  increases when academic session are preceded by inactive periods; (2) transition time from one activity to another increases when preceded by an active session and decreases when preceded by an inactive session; and (3) disruptive behavior during transition increases when preceded by an active session and decreases when preceded by an inactive session. In each of the experiments described above, simple ecological arrangements of the classroom produced an effect comparable to standard behavior modification procedures. (Author)",

        "description":"Research was conducted to study environmental factors associated with the development of cognitive style in children. The hypothesis was that the parents of field-independent children grant them more autonomy and power than do parents of field-dependent children. The sample consisted of 38 white, middle-class kindergartners, 19 boys and 19 girls, and their parents. Half of each sex were highly FD; half were highly FI. Observations were made of family interaction in the natural setting of the home around dinnertime. Conversation and behavior were analyzed according to content variable, such as kinds of influence and assistance behaviors, and process variables, such as participation rates and interruption rates as indicators of control behavior. Formulas for the measure of  participation, dominance, and interruption were used in analyzing conversation. Results led to the modification of the original hypothesis. On measures of social interaction involving active, assertive kinds of behavior, the FI boys participate more; other data indicate they initiate and terminate more social interaction than the other groups of children. The FI girls are less actively involved in this sort of social participation with their families. On measures of social interaction where sensitivity to the subtleties of the social field are necessary, the FD children, especially the girls, function more effectively.

        "author":["Emmerich, Walter"],
        "description":"Behavioral observations have the advantages of being direct, tangible, and informative as to the contextual determinants of behavior. Considerable evidence exists that a three-dimensional structure gives meaning to many child behaviors in a variety of life settings. Three bipolar dimensions constitute this framework: introversion vs. extroversion, love vs. hostility, and task orientation vs. distractibility. This approach has been used for ordering observational data collected for the ETS-Head Start Longitudinal Study. The emphasis so far has been on the motivational, affective and social aspects of observational data. But relationships between personal-social behaviors and independently measured cognitive processes will be explored in the longitudinal sample. The question of  qualitative shifts in behavior between correlated adjacent constructs within a configuration rather than on orthogonal bipolar dimensions is also being explored. Findings to date suggest that shifts within the structure roughly follow the principle of structural proximity and that such change is directed toward the more desirable locations within the configuration. A more sophisticated system of mapping persons into the configuration within life contexts is needed. This could yield insights into personality development. This discussion applies to observations within a rather narrow age span, since the underlying meanings of observational data become increasingly under the control of deeper cognitive structures.

        "description":"Errorless discrimination training is a technique in which the discriminative stimulus is supplemented with a salient cue which is gradually removed or faded during the course of training. In this study errorless discrimination training was used to teach preschool children the distinctive features of letters of the alphabet that are difficult to discriminate. To test the hypothesis that the success of EDT depends on whether or not stimulus control is transferred from the obvious cue used during training to the relevant dimension of the discriminative stimulus, two EDT groups were used. For group EDT-1, the obvious cue was superimposed over the feature of the letter differentiating it from its paired comparison. For group EDT-II, the obvious cue did not specifically enhance the  distinctiveness of the relevant dimension. A third group, R-E, was taught by the traditional reinforcement-extinction approach. Ss were 108 four- and five-year-olds in pre-kindergarten classes. Six letter combinations, R-P, Y-V, G-C, Q-O, M-N, and K-X, were used in a match-to-sample format, with 10 training trials for each letter combination. Five posttest trials and five delayed posttest trials one week after training were given. The EDT-I group made fewer errors on the two posttests than either of the other groups. The EDT-I group also made significantly fewer errors during training than the R-E group. (KM)",

The test covers skills within four main spheres--cognitively Directed Perception, Concepts and the Process of Verbal Coding, Problem-Solving Skills, and Spatial Representation. Each skill area is assessed by approximately 8 to 10 questions. A basic assumption of the test is that when a child passes or fails a particular question, he does so not because of the specific information involved, but because he has mastered, or failed to master, the skills or ability underlying that question. The test contains 240 items and is given in  four half-hour testing sessions. The items designed to test any one skill are not administered together. The test is given in two forms, identical except for the order of the items. In Cogntiviely Directed Perception, one of the abilities sampled is Visual Search, the ability to scan a complex visual array to locate a particular object. In Concepts and Coding, concepts such as \"not\", \"same\", and \"different\" are tested. The range of skills in Problem Solving focus on why, how, anf if. For Spatial Representation, spatial patterns must be reproduced. For scoring and interpretation, correctness of the response, form of the incorrect response, and reaction time will be considered.

Reliable operant acquisition was observed in the case of the nine-month-old infants, but not in the case of the six-month-old infants whose performance was similar to that of non-contingent controls. Examination of visual fixations of the feedback source coincidental with touching the manipulandum revealed the emergence of a strategy in the older infants which appeared to be critical for response acquisition. The emergence of this strategy is interpreted in terms of the older infants' increased capacity to remain oriented to task-relevant stimuli which are no longer immediately visually available and to  regulate behavior on the basis of information derived from these stimuli.

The hearings represent an attempt to determine how many youths out of school due to truancy, expulsion or suspension are provided with an alternative education program by their schools and whether the out-of-school youth is engaging in delinquent acts. Twenty-six people testified; all but one (a parent) were professional people working directly or indirectly with out-of-school juveniles--authorities from social and law enforcement agencies, school administrators, principals, deans, attendance officers and juvenile court representatives.

        "description":"This study uses a habituation paradigm to systematically investigate the discrepancy hypothesis with male and female new borns. In addition, multiple visual response measures are used in monitoring the habituation process and the infant's response to various degrees of novelty. Ss were 36 apparently normal newborns (half of each sex) ranging in age from 28 to 82 hours. A target was placed against the inside of the infant's crib, and two observers stood behind it, facing the infant. Total looking time and number of looks were recorded. Non-glossy, black and white checkerboard targets in three sizes were used as visual stimuli. Each trial consisted of a 60-second exposure, and presentations continued until evidence of response decrement in looking time occurred. Each infant  received one 60-second trial 5-10 seconds after the last decrement criterion trial. The hypothesis that infants are capable of demonstrating habituation to visual stimuli was supported. The findings also demonstrate that the visual response of female newborns is compatible with the discrepancy hypothesis. The response of females in this study is consistent with reports of sex differences indicating that the female newborn is generally more responsive and receptive to sensory stimulation than is the male. It is clear that effects attributable to sex cannot be explained effectively without reference to the context of stimulation. [Filmed from best available copy.] (KM)",

Two age groups were tested: third- and fourth-grade and sixth-grade. Conservation of weight and transitivity of weight were the concepts examined; the discrepant feedback consisted of three trials with either nonconservation or nontransitivity outcomes. Resistance or extinction was inferred from the subject's explanations for the outcomes, his responses on subsequent trials, and his performance on a one-month delayed posttest. Conservation subjects showed only moderate resistance by any of these measures; furthermore, there was no evidence of a developmental increase in resistance. Transitivity subjects, in contrast, were much less  likely than conservers to change their judgments on either the initial or the delayed test; they also showed the expected developmental increase in resistance to extinction. The results are interpreted as indicating that Piagetian concepts may vary in the extent to which they entail feelings of logical necessity. (Author)",

The SDCP has developed and is using a series of rating forms to assess the development of each child in the program in cognitive, social, motor, and self-help skills. Approximately 256 children in SDCP centers have been rated on the forms. The items on the forms represent translation of the objectives into observable, specific outcomes. The items on the various scales were combined and modified into rating forms for infants, two-year-olds, three-year olds, and four- and five-year-olds. Rating procedures, and reliability and validity of the ratings are described, and the analysis of results for each age group is provided. The performance of the children was generally  better than had been anticipated, but a few items in the cognitive area--printing, drawing human figures, and knowing addresses and seasons--continue to present difficulty to at least one third of the children. The SDCP rating forms provide a gross assessment of whether a child is generally performing according to the expectations for normal development at his age. Other instruments may provide a better analysis of child development, but they are more difficult to use with preschool children. The SDCP rating forms have another advantage for staff members; the items constitute a day-to-day program guide to aid in planning activities and curriculum. (KM)",

Identification of disabled children is made by the two project diagnosticians in nursery schools and Head Start classes and through referrals from physicians, psychologists, parents, social workers, and community agencies involved with preschool children. Sixty-five children were in the special treatment programs this year. Forty of the more severely disabled were enrolled in one of four special daily classes and received prescribed instruction from two teachers assisted by two aides. The other 25 received training at home from their parents  under the supervision of the diagnosticians. Diagnosis involves attention to four syndromes which provide a broad base for interpreting a child's deficit behavior. The syndromes include the visual perception functions, the visual motor functions, and all aspects of auditory function which primarily affect speech and language capabilities. The data indicate that the program has had beneficial effects. Children have gained in IQ scores and show good progress in readiness scores at the end of kindergarten. First-grade achievement scores were lower than readiness prediction, indicating that the children are losing ground once intensive treatment has ceased. Teachers' reports show gains in performance on tasks associated with learning disabilities, and parent questionnaires showed highly  favorable opinions of the program. (Author/KM)",

        "author":["Burnham, Brian"],
        "description":"York County (Canada) rolled back the age requirement for kindergarten admission so as to permit the enrollment of four-year-olds wherever space was available. This was done because kindergarten enrollment in many communities were declining and if junior kindergartens were established in all community schools, many would have very small enrollments. Early admission was intended as a right wherever less than 25 \"regular age\" students were enrolled, and no screening, other than for seniority and special home situations, was intended. Two studies have been undertaken to assess the progress of the early admission child. A longitudinal study of the academic progress of the early admission students of 1969 and their peers is in its third year. Students have been tested in grades 1 and 2  with the Canadian Cognitive Abilities Tests and the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. The groups performed comparable on the grade 2 tests. The second study was concerned with the early admission population during 1971-72. It was discovered that only 29 of 56 elementary schools with kindergartens had enrolled younger students. Of those who were enrolled, 20% were kept in kindergarten for another year, 9% were advanced to a kindergarten-primary mixed class or promoted conditionally to grade 1. A followup study of those retained revealed no apparent indication of increased mobility due to nonpromotion. Questions remaining include: (1) whether early admissions have really eased pressures for a junior kindergarten program; (2) whether a junior kindergarten would better serve the younger  students; and (3) whether screening prospective early admissions is pedagogically or politically feasible.

In particular, the study was concerned with the potentially harmful effects of prolonged program attendance itself as a form of maternal separation rather than with speed and efficiency of development as a result of some curriculum. Children who had attended state-operated day-care programs in Czechoslovakia were chosen as the study population. Sixty children from four first grade classrooms (30 males and 30 females) were administered six tests. In addition, each child's report card total grade was recorded, and an indirect measure of the teacher-child relationship was obtained. Seven dependent variables  (IQ, picture vocabulary, social information, reading, arithmetic, report card game, and teacher perceived attitudes) and seven predictors (sex, birth order, mid-parent education, maternal separation, years of attendance in day care, and teacher differences) were used in the statistical analysis. The results of the study showed that the type of day-care program experienced by these children lies below the threshhold of harmful effects on first grade general ability and achievement measures. Certain of the child's own characteristics, as well as parents' education and first-grade teacher influences, appeared to be relatively more effective in predicting the outcome measures than were maternal separation and day-care attendance as characterized in this study.

As the light draws closer, in typical cases, one eye will cease to converge, or frequently, it will break from convergence suddenly. The eye which ceases converging or breaks away from convergence is scored as the non-dominant eye. To determine if the test would be applicable to infants, a group of 68 ten-month old were tested. All children converged on the approaching light, and a scoreable uniocular cessation of convergence or sudden divergence were found in all cases. For comparison purposes, 62 nine-year-old children and 86 twenty-five year old adults were tested. Data from these tests appear to indicate that the  convergence test does provide a useable index of ocular dominance in infants. (DB)",

Research has shown that a training procedure designed to elicit uncommon responses will facilitate original responses on subsequent tasks. Ss were 96 fifth- and sixth-graders. Half were randomly assigned to a group given originality training (OT), while the other half received repetition training (RT) as a control procedure. Each group was comprised of 24 males and 24 females. Each S was tested individually with pretests, training tests, and post tests. The Similarities, Instances, and Pattern Meanings tests were used as pre- and post-originality measures, while the Alternate Uses and Line Meanings tests were used for training. OT Ss were instructed to make different responses  each time the test was presented, while RT Ss were instructed to repeat the same response. The only significant finding from the pretraining data was that females emit a greater number of responses to similar stimuli than do males. Post-training results support the hypothesis that originality training facilitates the production of original responses. It was also found that the frequency of responses increases following originality training. (KM)",

Twenty-four girls and 24 boys, half from middle class families and half from disadvantaged families, were tested at six-month intervals between 3 and 6 years of age. Children from both cultural groups exhibited similar overall trends in their ability to recognize other people's emotional responses. By 3 years of age, the majority of American and Chinese children could differentiate between happy and unhappy reactions in other people. Perception of afraid, sad and angry feelings developed somewhat later, and appeared to be influenced by social learning. This cross-cultural study confirms the results of a  previous investigation that very young children are capable of empathic responses. The awareness of other people's feelings by young children from very different cultural backgrounds suggests that empathy may be a basic human characteristic related to social adaptation. (Author)",

The survey was not an evaluation of current day care arrangements. Major findings of the study showed that 55% of all children in day care full-day are cared for in family day care homes; less than 2% of the estimated 450,000 homes are licensed as compared  with 90% of day care centers; an estimated 17,500 centers provide full-day care; most directors and teachers in the centers do not have college degrees and few have had special training; the largest age group in centers is the 4-year-old group; the types of day care centers are custodial, educational, and developmental; and estimated 63,000 unfilled day care slots existed; median family income was $7,500; median cost per month in centers runs from $27 to $114; and most working mothers in the population were satisfied with present child care arrangements.

The 21 findings of the study are grouped under Regulation, Procedures, and Points of Delay. It was concluded that: there is a tendency for states to include too much detail in statutes authorizing regulation of day care facilities; a standardized method of classification of day care homes and centers is needed; there is  a need for a standard format for presentation of requirements to potential applicants; state and local agency standards for day care licensing often have parallel or conflicting requirements making it inefficient and costly; some requirements are unrealistically stringent; several aspects of day care licensing administrative procedures will inhibit rapid expansion of national programs; different evaluation criteria are sometimes applied for white minority day care centers; statements of licensing agencies in six states show that a major concern of all licensing agencies is the lack of strong legal teeth needed to revoke the license and keep closed a \"bad\" day care facility; and types of day care now excluded in state day care statutes and regulations range from care by a relative to  government facilities.

Inhibiting factors were that there was no income maintenance pretest, no one in charge, funding insecurity, economic enphasis, unrealistic eligibility requirements and reimbursement rates, separation of planning and operations, the plan was not a plan,  inexperience with Federal ralations, no information system, and top-down decisions. Broad problem areas of the operating system were related to the absence of reliable, timely, useful information about almost every subject, as well as dissatisfaction with the decision-making process, and finally to the smoldering issue of developmental versus custodial care.

The number of employed mothers in the U.S. exceeds 12 million. The goal of the Day Care and Child Development Council of America is to promote the development of a locally controlled, publicly sponsored, universally available child care system through public education, social action, and assistance to local communities. Special consideration must be given the situations which involve employed women and their children, particularly as this relates to day care, for the most rapid increase in labor force participation in the past decade has occurred among mothers of children under six. If the number of working mothers of  children under the age of six increases at the same rate between 1970 and 1975 as between 1965 and 1970, about a million additional working mothers will be struggling to arrange for adequate child care. Child care can become the institution for the re-education of men, women and children, and it is the women primarily who must undertake the work of building these new institutions. It is proposed that a system of child care is only possible to the extent that constituencies are organized from the grassroots to the top and a coalition is developed in the next four years that transcends class, race, and sex. The plan involves the centers and their staff, coordinating bodies, women's organizations, unions, and industry. (DB)",

The first five chapters of the report discuss these activities. In Chapter 6, Summary of Work Accomplished, the supports that the project utilized to  enhance and extend programs for the children, their families, and the Family Day Care Mothers are discussed. Services considered successful in relation to Family Day Care Mothers were center meetings, the provision of Field Demonstration Assistants as back-up for Family Day Care Mothers, enhancing the knowledge and utilization of existing community resources, the Monthly Bulletin, college classes, WATCH, the Mothers' Club Cooperative Nursery School, and information service, the &quot;Fix-it&quot; person, and a no-interest loan fund. Conclusions and recommendations are found in Chapter 7. The over-all recommendation is that FDC should be supported and improved, not changed.

The parameters of preschool reading programs are described in relation to the characteristics of the preschool population, characteristics of teachers and staff,  organization of the preschool reading program, philosophy underlying the program, community involvement, length of the program, physical facilities, and cost. Guidelines in the form of a checklist are provided to aid the administrator with a framework against which the components of the various programs may be evaluated and compared and to assist him in identifying the basic components and considerations involved in establishing his own early reading program. The evaluation of the program is described as to criteria, implementation, sources on evaluation, and tests for measuring readiness and early reading skills. Seventeen promising preschool programs that offer reading instruction are described. Steps the administrator should take in, implementing change through preschool reading  instruction are given. A list of test publishers is provided as are references. (DB)",

The first section of the guide provides information on the following questions: When should formal reading instruction begin? How does traditional kindergarten experience affect readiness for reading? Do perceptual programs affect reading readiness and reading achievement? Is formal reading readiness instruction more effective than informal reading readiness instruction? How effective is formal reading instruction at the preschool level? Does formal reading instruction at the preschool level result in children experiencing emotional problems or adversely affect their attitudes toward reading? To what extent is there evidence that formal  preschool reading instruction is sufficiently effective that its practice should be widespread at the preschool level? How effective is preschool reading instruction through educational television? Should teacher aides and parents be used in preschool reading programs? The next section of the guide discusses informal reading readiness, the language experience method, and formal reading readiness and instruction. Grouping for preschool reading instruction is then described, and ways of motivating children to read are discussed. Instructional materials for use in preschool reading instruction are listed, together with their publishers. A list of over 900 books for preschool children is then provided. Publishers who specialize in reading materials for all grade levels are listed. The guide  concludes with references. (DB)",

A total of 32 second grade children completed long-easy, long-difficult, short-easy, and short-difficult versions of three tasks and set their own amount of reward following each. Long tasks were judged to merit greater amounts of reward than shorter ones, but the effect of difficulty varied across tasks. It is proposed that an additional factor, namely the quality or accuracy of performance, was also governing level of self-reward. Individual differences in amount of self-reward were consistent across tasks. (Author/ST)",

Resistance to deviation was used as the measure of punishment effectiveness. Sex of child, use of praise, and type of punisher were combined in a 2 x 2 x 5 factorial design, with a female as the punitive agent. The most stable response pattern resulted from the use of an aversive stimulus. Neither use of praise nor sex of child significantly influenced punisher effectiveness. The practice of grouping various punishment measures under the categories of sensitization and induction measures was discussed.  (Author/ST)",

An original questionnaire was developed and administered by mail to school districts participating in the MSRTS and to those school districts identified as potentially eligible and not participating in the MSRTS. Responses to questionnaire items were analyzed using chi-square and analysis of variance. Descriptive data were also presented. The school districts were divided into 3 groups: Group I--using MSRTS and having a terminal physically located in the district; Group II--using MSRTS but not  having a terminal; and Group III--potentially eligible for participation and lacking terminals. Findings concluded that there were significant differences in high, medium, and low usage among the groups and that the size of the school district was not a factor. (Author/PS)",

The sample consisted of 339 junior and senior girls (177 Anglos and 162 Mexican Americans) from 11 high schools in Colorado. All the participating schools were located in socially and economically depressed areas, with a seasonal agricultural base,chronic out-migration, and poverty. Data were collected by a 26-page questionnaire administered under the supervision of trained graduate students. The students were given an hour to complete the questionnaire, but they were  permitted additional time if needed since the emphasis was on completeness of response instead of speed. The findings showed the 2 groups to be almost identical for levels of occupational aspiration; middle status Mexican Americans to be \"less active\" in their world view; lower status Mexican Americans to be oriented towards outside employment while lower status Anglos preferred homemaking; and socio-economic status to be the only major distinction between the groups.

Three categories of relocatees were identified: stayers, returnees, and terminals or those who had quit but had not been interviewed  after their termination. Results indicated that there may be a unique set of values associating certain classes of jobs and that these led to successful worker adjustment into similar situations, that anticipatory socialization was important in the adjustment process, and that educational orientations were important in placement while social orientations seemed vital to relocation.

Opening remarks by NIMH staff detailed the conference purpose and expectations; the conference as a step toward program planning for the Spanish speaking; DHEW health  initiatives; present and future status of the minority center; and NIMH priorities. Reports discussed mental health services, manpower and training, special mental health programs, alcoholism and drug abuse, and mental health research. The divisions of mental health service, manpower and training, extramural research, special mental health, and the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism made responses. (NQ)",

        "description":"Analyzing the reasons that Mexican Americans drop out of school, this thesis also examined the educational and occupational status projections of these dropouts, compared to their peers still in school. Data from 4 Texas counties--Dimmit, Maverick, Starr, and Zapata--were gathered on 596 Mexican American students in 1967 and on 74 Mexican American dropouts in 1968. The study determined that a majority of the dropouts desired and expected to complete high school and go on to higher education, although none of the males expected to graduate from college, while 20% of the females did. Almost three-fourths of the dropouts desired intermediate jobs, with almost one-third of the females, compared to 5% of the males, desiring high level jobs. There were substantial differences between  the dropouts' and their in-school peers' status projections. Students had higher projections than dropouts, although both groups expressed lower expectations than aspirations. The results of this research supported Merton's contention that high success goals are a universal pattern in all cultures in American society. References, appendices, and tables closed the document.

A structured interview was administered to 52 reservation families in Summer, 1972 and an opinionnaire to single youths between the ages of 13 and 18. Findings yielded data on number and ages, educational level, child rearing practices, language, willingness to participate, perception of educational needs, identification of leadership, and rank order of values. The Ak Chin desired education on their reservation where the family can participate as a unit. They wanted vocational training and  recreation for all ages, as well as adult education. A community school concept with the Ak Chin involved in planning was recommended with diversified education for all ages. Vocational training, particularly vocational agriculture, was suggested for youth. Involvement of Ak Chin in teaching, insofar as possible, in the community school and parent education in intellectual and motivational stimulation of children was recommended, as well as preschool education for young children.

Comparisons were made by race and sex only to illuminate historical changes. Surveys of approximately 966 sophomores from 3 East Texas counties comprised the data base for surveys conducted in 1966 and 1972. Census data (1960-70) were examined to determine whether or not any significant historical changes had occurred in the socioeconomic makeup of the study counties. No significant historical change was observed in intensity of occupational aspiration among the respondents. Occupation remained in 1972, as in 1966, among the top 3 goals  relative to the respondents, and was generally second after education, and followed by income. At both time periods occupation was evaluted only slightly higher by whites than blacks. Among black males the difference in magnitude between education and income narrowed as education decreased as the primary goal. (FF)",

        "description":"In Fall 1971, this exploratory study investigated the association between socioeconomic characteristics of participants in selected manpower programs and the training outcomes for those participants. The 2 manpower training programs were the Job Opportunities in the Business Sector (JOBS) and a Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) program. Data were obtained from the application and termination forms completed for the 202 MDTA trainees and 157 trainees in the JOBS program during 1970-71. More socioeconomic attributes were associated with training outcomes for the MDTA than the JOBS program participants. The MDTA participant least likely to complete the program was a non-white male with 7-9 years of formal education, unemployed 25 weeks or less within the past year and  classified as disadvantaged. Since the majority of American Indian participants weren't completing the MDTA programs, the importance of racial and cultural factors for such programs was suggested. Findings were listed for both programs. (FF)",

Data were obtained in 1963 for 1,200 seniors and in 1970 for 3,100. Both samples were from North Carolina high schools, although the 1970 sample had a much larger urban component and included non-public school students. The measurement techniques included an arbitrary dichotomization based on a modification of the North-Hatt scale and the ability to name the college which the student planned to attend in the fall. Analysis of data was limited to percentages of students with high expectations. The major findings were: (1) the proportion of males with high occupational expectation increased from rural, through village, to urban residence in 1970; (2) expectation  was slightly greater for females from village than urban residence in 1970; (3) there was greater increase for males than for females in 1970; and (4) educational expectations followed the same trends as occupational expectations. Data were presented in tabular form. Comparisons with other studies were given in narrative form. (NQ)",

Data were obtained from 4 rural high schools in Lawrence County, Ohio. The sample consisted of 500 Protestant, white single students. Dependent variables were youth attitudes toward abortion and Ohio's abortion law. Independent variables were value orientations and social class. It was found that youths with modern value orientations had more liberal attitudes toward abortion, that youths from a high socioeconomic status expressed more liberal attitudes than youths from a low socioeconomic status, and that value orientations affect attitudes toward abortion apart from socioeconomic status. The major conclusion was that there existed a  significant and positive correlation between modern value orientation and attitudes of rural youth toward abortion and Ohio's abortion law. (PS)",

The Lumbees and their relationship to these other groups were examined. Data were gleaned from 2 regional studies--a survey of 3 North Carolina counties (Ashe, Anson, and Robeson), and a resurvey thereof. These counties were drawn according to an area probability sampling design. Data from 69 households in Robeson County were analyzed using chi-square test of significance. Results indicated that in most instances the Lumbee Indians' family adjustment resembles that of the Negroes or the dominant  whites. American Indians in Robeson County seemed to be worse off economically than whites. The traditional bi-racial (white-nonwhite) caste system was evidently more adequate in explaining the living adjustment patterns of these groups than the previous tri-ethnic group caste system, which does not allow for the attitude differences indicated by this study.

Data were taken from school records for senior males and from a self-reference test administered during September and early October of 1970. Scored and usable test results were obtained for 194 senior males. Results indicated there was a positive and significant correlation between a student's self-definition and his grade point average. The same results occurred between teacher evaluations and self-definition. Results from the General Aptitude Test Battery for finger dexterity and the student's orientation in school  were found to be positively and significantly correlated to the student's self-definition. Orientation for a business or academic program had a higher correlation than for vocational programs.

A basic responsibility is surveying conditions and determining problem areas related to migrants. In 1971, the 62nd Legislature gave the Commission the responsibility for developing, in coordination with state agencies, specific programs to meet the needs of agricultural workers and their families. The Commission's efforts are the basis for this 1972 annual report. An overview of Texas migrant labor describes the emergence and final domination of the seasonal agricultural labor force by Spanish speaking people. The  following are discussed: Texas agriculture and migrant labor, alien labor and immigration, technical-vocational education in Texas, and consumer state concerns. Current developments in education, housing, health, jobs, and economics are also presented. The trends in farm labor and what has been happening to the local domestic, migratory, and foreign worker in the past decade summarize the data. (NQ)",

The study found that recent Chicano graduates were earning less than Anglo graduates, although the difference disappeared in less than 10 years. It also concluded that less than a 4-year college education provided the Chicano with only marginal economic benefits, since those with 1 to 3 years of college earned only 10% more than high school  graduates. Much of this might be explained by a dual labor market and low salary expectations, although evidence suggested that the financial ill effects of discrimination disappear with job experience. (KM)",

An additional function of ESTPP is to provide communication among Consortium schools to let each know what the other are doing and what results are being achieved. The project feels that the kinds of innovations that will &quot;humanize&quot; education include eliminating the threat of grades, trusting students to make significant  decisions about topics and methods of study, and encouraging teachers to drop the role of a teacher in order to become to the students a flesh and blood human being with strengths and weaknesses.

The instructional material was related to science concepts organized around an environmental problem. Pictorial communications were inserted in association with single concepts or to illustrate interrelationships among key concepts. Subjects were asked to read the material. Reactions to each segment, concepts with learning difficulties, usability of pictures in learning, and quality of the  material were identified by each subject. Pre- and posttests were used to gather attainment data. Analyses showed the presence of substantial numbers of significant differences between two groups. Child reaction to the organization and assembly of instructional material might influence learning capacity.

Macroanalysis is the computerized analysis of interaction data into units of three or more tallies with the number of unit occurrences determinable. The sample groups had a mean IQ difference of 25 points. All class dialogues were coded according to Form Z of the Campbell-Rose Interaction System. Following an example of a 38-tally matrix in the Flanders Interaction Analysis Category System, macroanalyses of coded dialogues were compared with patterns determined by the Anidon and the Hall method. Results obtained showed that macropatterns corresponded more closely to the kind of observed teaching behavior. Macroanalysis  proved simpler to understand and could readily be used as a feedback mechanism to neophyte teachers. Implications of macroanalysis for educational research, teacher preparation, and continuing education are given. (CC)",

Hunch activities were not carried out among the control group. All subjects were required to classify a set of procedures as \"useful\" or \"not-useful,\" relative to the contradictory event. Each student was given the materials and procedures described as useful in his own classification. A posttest was given to measure the quality of the solution formulated. The overall time for completing search activities was recorded. Analyses of findings showed  the presence of direct influences of generating hunches on search behavior and quality of solutions. The first group classified significantly fewer procedures as useful, spent significantly more time in search, and demonstrated a significantly higher quality. No significant differences were found between the control and the second experimental groups. Implications of the present research for curriculum design and teacher training were recommended. (CC)",

A pilot program was carried out among fifth and sixth grade students of 30 schools in the 1967-68 school year. During the study period, these classes of the paired schools were bused to the Franklin Institute for integrated physical-biological science instruction one day a week for seven weeks. Students ate lunch together and then left for their respective schools. The program was extended to a whole day experience beginning in 1970, and a workshop for teachers and principals was added during the last school year. Museum resources and examination of urban environmental problems were emphasized. The student interaction category system, cultural  awareness questionnaires, achievement tests, semantic differentials, sociometric studies, and interview techniques were used in evaluation. A parent questionnaire was used in the 1970-71 school year. Analyses showed that significant gain differences existed between the PSSP and the control groups. Parent participation was fairly successful. Sensitivity to environmental problems was enhanced, and student interactions occurred mostly between paired schools from similar geographic locations. Six days of social interaction had little effect on student attitude changes. (CC)",

An eight-page questionnaire was mailed to the students. The questionnaire included one section on students' biographical information, two sections of items identical to those of 1967-68 devices, and one section on science and society. The 1967-68 devices were composed of one semantic differential on physics and the universe and one inventory of participant activity. Teachers responsible for teaching physics four years earlier to the students surveyed were classified into the PP trial, control, and PP experienced groups. From data previously recorded, the replies of 1,603 respondents were analyzed in terms of sex, career interests,  physics course taken, teacher, academic activity, and geographical region. Results obtained showed the responses were not biased by sex or particular course taken. The respondents were a bit brighter in comparison with non-respondents and made a clear distinction between physics and science. No relationships were found between respondents' attitudes and physics course previously taken. The attitudes had shifted toward physics as more orderly and understandable, but the universe was now only seen as more understandable. Further investigations were recommended on the basis of the data obtained in the study. (CC)",

The teacher sample was a group participating in a Cooperative College-School Science Teacher Improvement Project. Each teacher was required to randomly identify four students in one of his classes to form the experimental group and select a non-project fellow teacher who also identified four students for a control group. Using the one-group pretest-posttest design, teacher self-assessment was made with the Science Classroom Activities Checklist (Teacher's Perception). In a pretest-posttest control design, data relative to students' views were gathered by the student perception form of the Checklist. Results  obtained showed the presence of a significant change in teacher's perception of science instruction. Student mean gains were found to be greater for project teachers, and their observations were in agreement with perceptions held by their teachers. Teacher perceptual changes had carryover value into classroom strategies. (CC)",

Krathwohl's taxonomy of educational objectives is incorporated along the behavioral objective dimension, and the second dimension is composed of a set of phenomena. The phenomena are grouped into four divisions: events in the natural world, activities, science, and inquiry. Each division is further grouped into subdivisions with some divided into still smaller categories. Sample statements along with the applicable  cells of the phenomena-behaviors grid are given as examples. Applications of the present structure to science teaching and educational research are provided.

Designed for groups already organized and active in pursuit of cleaner air, the booklet assumes that a citizen group or coalition already has some experience and sophistication in air pollution control. Knowing what to do is the main topic of discussion. This includes becoming informed, fighting for funds, knowing the law, using the state plan for air pollution control, checking source compliance schedules, understanding transportation controls, and utilizing other available  tools. Knowing the deadlines and exceptions as well as legal rights are also considered. The final segment relates techniques which may be used to spur enforcement of state implementation plans, in particular, radio and television broadcasts and testifying at public hearings. Appended material compiles National Air Quality Standards, a sample Source Compliance Schedule, rules pertinent to public information and prior notice of citizen suits, a list of state air pollution control agencies and EPA Regional Offices, and a bibliography.

A questionnaire was used to analyze such aspects as reliability of future estimates, employment trends, personnel movement patterns for 1971, degree of success in personnel movements, availability and qualification of applicants, employee transfer, executive development, fringe benefits, and conditions of employment. Data analyses of 86 replies showed the evidence of personnel movements into areas of rapid payoff. Personnel reductions were not large, and, by 1973, most industry groups expected to expand again. A shift of emphasis back toward longer-range  research activities and a stable working situation in laboratories were marked. Continuing liberalization of benefits was anticipated for the future, but at a gradual pace. Project leadership ability was needed, and managerial skill was likely to be found among experienced personnel.

The science program at Model Laboratory School, Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond, Kentucky, is discussed as an example of independent study being an integral part of the science curriculum. In each of the science courses offered in grades 7-12 students have an opportunity to work independently on research projects. This form of instruction achieves its greatest emphasis in the second-level biology course, in which students may elect to take independent research for the entire year if they so desire. Some of the major problems encountered by the student as he develops his project include: difficulty in  identifying a reasonable topic; obtaining equipment, chemicals, and other supplies; researching the topic in the library; adequately controlling variables; and persisting with the project through to completion. Despite these difficulties, students involved in this form of independent study usually become highly motivated and enjoy the variety of work and freedom to make their own choices. Literature is cited which indicates increased academic achievement among students involved in research projects as part of the course requirement. (JR)",

The history of British narcotics treatment policies may be divided into three periods: The Rolleston Committee (1924), Convening of the First Brain Committee (1958), and Convening of the Second Brain Committee (1964). Operation of a new &quot;system&quot; following the 1964 conference is described and evaluated, one which utilizes only specially designated doctors in clinics to treat addicts by  employing heroin, methadone or encouraging withdrawal.

Classified alphabetically by country, each institution (210 total) lists its name, address, person in charge and official title, first year of research/teaching in demography, professional staff, research projects, curricula, and publications. Entries for professional staff include the person's sex, year of birth, subject profession, main courses  taught, mother tongue, and other languages known. Research projects define project title, director(s), date of completion, aim and area of research. Works published as direct products of the research follow each project. Notes for curricula indicate the existence of an international exchange program or desire to establish one, language(s) used for teaching demography, entrance requirements, diploma offered, and courses of demographic interest together with their estimated number of hours. Appended material compiles sample questionnaires and indexes to institutions, areas of research, and people covered. (BL)",

        "description":"New social studies materials are based on inquiry modes of learning and teaching; however, little is known as to what students actually learn from an inquiry model (except for cognitive knowledge). An inquiry model and test to measure the &quot;unmeasurable&quot; in the social studies--namely, a student's ability to use the scientific process, attitudes toward knowledge, and willingness to analyze personal and social values--are presented in this paper. Inquiry as a method of learning includes four types of thinking: 1) social sciencing; 2) critical; 3) intuitive; and 4) creative. In addition, inquiry learning hinges on the attitudinal factor of the student's degree of open- or closed-mindedness. As a teaching paradigm, an inquiry approach can play on the internal or external motivation of  the learner. The genuine inquiry approach (open-beginning and open-ended) enhances internal motivation. Inquiry in this model is composed of three higher order factors: 1) source of motivation, 2) type of thinking, and 3) mind set--a degree of open mindedness. A continuum for reflective inquiry extends from cognition to affect, emphasizing its holistic or organismic nature. This model served as the basis for devising an instrument which measured the four types of inquiry thinking. Determination of external and internal motivation, however, still remains &quot;unmeasurable.&quot; (Author/SJM)",

Three secondary objectives set in the development of this environment were to create the means for: 1) entering, storing, and replaying complex music; 2) viewing the time-space relationships inherent in music; 3) controlling and manipulating music. A computer-controlled electronic concert organ was programmed to enable a wide variety of musical composition manipulation from changing key to synthesizing musical parts. Line drawings on a graphics scope displayed music information that could be redrawn at will. Music manipulation was accomplished with keyboard, computer terminal, and lightpen buttons. Response from 13 children ages  4-12 and a few adults was very favorable--the graphics scope being especially successful for grasping correlation of parts of a score. The developmental basis of the system shows great potential for generating data to compare with data gathered from traditional teaching methods. (JH)",

Forty subjects enrolled for social studies methods courses were blocked on pre-test scores and randomly assigned to treatment groups. The experimental group treatment consisted of using only four SIMs for six weeks. Three control group instructors employed conventional classroom instructional techniques. The data indicate that the experimental group achieved significantly higher achievement test scores and student teaching performance ratings. Additionally, the experimental group expressed favorable attitudes toward the use of the SIMs. Based on this data, the use of  SIMs appears to be superior to more conventional instructional methods for developing concepts and skills essential to instruction for higher cognitive processes.

This paper reports findings from six years of repeated testing of children from Texas and Mexico, who were selected to represent a broad range of working-class, business, and professional families. A complex analysis-of-variance design was constructed with five main factors: 1) socioeconomic status; 2) sex; 3) age group when tested initially; and 5) year of repeated  testing or trial. The main effects for culture proved highly significant, revealing important differences in developmental trends for the entire age span of 6-17 years in Mexican and American children. This study reports only highlights of a much larger research program involving hundreds of children and their families. Additional studies are aimed at gaining greater insight into the complex relationships between cognitive, perceptual and personality measures on the one hand and family life-style, home environment and school performance variables as these aspects of personality development change over time in the two cultures.

Phase I (fall) dealt with developing, organizing, and evaluating a lab team method and sought to have students actively participate in discussion of study questions and in team research by combining a small interaction group approach one day a week with the traditional large lecture twice a week. Based on the results of the fall semester, Phase II (spring) incorporated several stated changes in the course and emphasized an improved lab team method. Phase II data offered the opportunity to explore the kind of students elected as team leaders and the relationship of team and leader variables to the students' final rating of their  laboratory team experience. Course achievement, leader power, group cohesion, individual team members' contributions, course ratings, and lab team aspects were measured by various quizzes; exams; sociograms; and rating scales. Findings indicate that lab teams tend to elect female leaders who are relatively high achievers in psychology. School level or previous high school psychology had no effect on the selection of leaders. Three variables seemed to be positively correlated with group ratings of their team experience: the leader's final exam score, the team cohesion ratio, and the final evaluation of the whole course.

It is suggested that, regardless of the intent on the part of authors of social research, their findings have been used as justification for cutbacks. The problem is approached from three angles: 1) the impact of the still prevalent idea of &quot;neutral&quot; or value free social science research might have in leading to the abuse of such research; 2) that there does exist an ever increasing body of research rationalization for specific policy decisions in Washington; and 3) that such policy formation is likely to have a deleterious effect on those who most urgently need  increasing amounts of social policy assistance rather than less. It is stated that social researchers have a responsibility to explore all the policy implications of their research, as well as the assumptions, suppositions, and context in which it took place and then, with the appropriate cautionary statements written into it as prominently as possible, and only then, release the findings. Studies are discussed and analyzed to determine to what uses the findings were put and policies subsequently formulated. (JMB)",

Two broad objectives of the Columbia Program are defined: (1) to bring sociological perspectives to bear on educational theory and problems, with emphasis on discovering and codifying the methodological approaches most suitable for investigating educational systems from a sociological viewpoint; and (2) to prepare researchers who are qualified to undertake major administrative responsibilities as directors of large-scale research projects, research programs and research institutes that focus on education. Focus of the paper is on description of the program which was designed to attain these objectives and on determination of the effectiveness of the program. The following  aspects are examined: (1) recruitment and selection of trainees, (2) structure of the program, (3) content of the program, (4) personnel, and (5) evaluation and implications.

Positive aspects and limitations of two educational approaches, Black Studies and the Bilingual Program, aimed at the amelioration of social needs caused by poverty, discrimination or cultural disadvantages are detailed. It is suggested that, while focus on racial minority groups and Mexican Americans is fully justified, there is a similar great need for extending these programs to white ethnic groups. (Author/SHM)",

This paper presents as a case study the relationships between a community action agency (CAA), on the one hand, and the local school districts (LEAs) and state education department (SEA), on the other, in Nawwau County, New York, during 1968-1970. The dichotomy illustrates how two kinds of agencies interact with each other--expanding, contracting, and resolving jurisdictional disputes. Several theoretical orientations which aid in the explanation and interpretation of the circumstances, activities, and perspectives associated with the relationships that developed between the CAA and  the educational authorities are presented.

Attendees of the one-day conference consisted of university, college, and public school faculty members, students, and community representatives in Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Also a number of individuals representing other countries were present. Specific objectives of the conference were to: 1) examine the value of our changing world; 2) recognize the growing need for a world culture; 3) see how our changing values help or hinder a world culture; and 4) try to find new directions for existing educational programs. In achieving its objectives, the conference concluded that there are many indications of a world culture; a world educational program can affect the entire  value system of mankind; and there is a need for a world culture and an urgency of finding solutions to pressing problems. In addition to preliminaries and overview, the keynote address and five panel presentations on the major theme of changing values and a world culture are followed by five suggested workshop presentations on new directions and emphases for educational programs. A section on conference activity highlights and a miscellany section conclude the volume. (SJM)",

It is not intended to serve as an operational briefing nor to take its place. The goal is the facilitation of operations, which gives it a slightly different focus from strictly academic study programs, where the ends of pure scholarship and research are primarily served. It deals with the historical roots of problems, issues and attitudes, but with a view of their relevance to current processes and events. Each section of the syllabus is divided into three parts. The first, an introduction, is intended only to serve as a framework for the  readings, and to point up a few of the highlights of the subject treated. This is followed by a set of questions to directively stimulate reading and analysis, and to facilitate self-evaluation of progress. The third part is an annotated reading list. The leading entries have been selected from the current literature for their relative brevity as well as for their quality in covering the themes and questions advanced in the text. With this design, the syllabus is intended for use both by beginning area students and those with prior experience. It can be used for tutorials or self-instruction.

Scarcity of resources in contrast to a man's unlimited wants requires that individuals make intelligent decisions and choices which will be reflected in the marketplace, voting booth, and at work. Economics is a natural for teaching because economic principles, curriculum, and skills are relevant and applicable to the person, family, classroom, community, and social concerns of youngsters. Schools have an obligation to offer economic programs since this institution reaches children who can be equipped to be economically responsible citizens. Essential responsibilities for economic education in the 1970s are to make  economic education more relevant, responsible, exciting, and systematic. To meet these responsibilities current programs are emerging that: 1) Stress relevant, vital issues of concern to society, and manpower and personal economics; 2) Analyze and evaluate economic education materials; 3) Emphasize exciting teaching techniques; and 4) Focus on the development of a master plan using a systematic approach for the improvement of economic education. The organizational machinery for economic education is being strengthened by having an affiliated Council functioning effectively in each state and at least two Centers for economic education functioning effectively in each state.

        "description":"Within the last decade research and development activity in the social studies has ranged from curriculum development projects to innovations in instructional strategies. Little effort has been expended, however, to justify these changes in curriculum and instructional strategies. The author suggests in this essay some purposes for social education and explores implications of these purposes in terms of curriculum and instruction. A normative theory is outlined based on the assumptions that 1) social education should increase the ability of students to make socially effective choices; 2) enhance the ability of students to assess systematically alternative social futures; and 3) equip the student to be a continuous social learner. Such aspects of social studies education as  different approaches to the structure of the social sciences, the use of a largely unarticulated decision-making model as the \"heart\" of the social studies, and citizenship education as the goal of social studies education are critiqued in terms of the traditional social studies literature as well as in terms of the rationale set forth in the paper.

The book is arranged into three major parts. In Part One, the authors provide perceptive analyses of institutional racism, social justice and power relationships in America, and also suggest ways in which the teacher can deal with both individual and institutional racism. In addition, one author describes how ethnic content can be used to spearhead instructional reform. The next five chapters in Part Two focus on the historical and sociological problems of ethnic minority groups, and describe ways in which the teacher can incorporate their experiences into the social studies curriculum.  Authors are various members of ethnic groups and speak from their perspective. The final part of this book explores the problems of two groups victimized by stereotypes and cultural assaults -- white ethnics and women. Strategy exercises are appended to several chapters.

A number of educators and social scientists contributed to a series of chapters comprised in four sections of the volume. Each of the major sections deals with a different but related area of international affairs education. Section I suggests ways of organizing materials around the emerging international society and indicates complexities of the contemporary world that students need to be acquainted with in order to live intelligently in a changing world. Offering some reflections about the field of international studies in general and world law and area  studies in particular, Part II is designed to assist the teacher in the job of selecting and evaluating new areas of study in international affairs. Four innovative approaches in the social studies that are receiving increasing attention in many elementary and secondary school classrooms--simulation, decision-making, case studies, and comparative studies--are described in Part III. Part IV reports information about a wide variety of materials, resources, and programs available to teachers who seek to improve instruction in international affairs. (Author/SJM)",

Twenty-one American history topics are presented in chronological order from the 17th century to the present with a brief account of events of the period which had important economic aspects. Key economic terms are identified in bold faced type. Discussion questions which vary in difficulty and a number of suggested activities (such as interviews, role-playing, films,  filmstrips, talks, field trips, community resources, and visits to local museums and places of historic interest) follow the introduction of each topic.

The basic underlying assumption of the book is that the institution of war represents a problem to be studied and is amenable to human intervention and resolution. Teachers are encouraged to employ inquiry and discussion techniques which force youth to raise and analyze values and issues dealing with conflict. The book is arranged into six chapters. Chapter one, offering a few theories on the sources of attitudes toward war, reviews historical, philosophical, sociological, economic, biological, philosophical, moral, and ethical factors involved in war. Aspects of conflict and its control -- particularly the nature of group conflict  -- are dealt with in chapter two. In chapter three an actual experiment of inter-group conflict which can serve as a model of the dynamics of conflict is described. Chapter four provides suggestions for a number of topics and sources of materials for building a classroom unit. A classroom game of conflict and cooperation is presented in chapter five. The final chapter, sources and resources, contains annotated bibliographies of: background books, classroom materials, and miscellaneous materials. (Author/SJM)",

This publication is an attempt to define a more specific core of competence that is needed beyond the broad roles and functions of the social worker. Included are guidelines concerning conceptual issues, knowledge, skills, values and attitudes. Additional chapters describe curricular implications of this core of competence. Some of the issues  involved in implementing an undergraduate social welfare program that has a generalist orientation and a goal of producing professional practitioners are explored. (SHM)",

These objectives are implemented through university course work, seminars, a 4-hour  per week practicum at RHAM High School (which is lengthened to a full-time field experience) and independent study.

Gifted candidates' positive attitudes towards teaching indicate they will probably have harmonious interpersonal relationships with their students, which should enhance the possibility of student identification and may help improve society's attitude towards intellectual excellence. Gifted teacher candidates are not utilitarian in their values and express a strong desire to know and understand the meaning of  life. An important finding is the dichotomy between scientific and artistic interests of the gifted candidates who are decidely scientific in their interests with a lack of artistic affairs. These findings suggest students might identify more closely with the gifted teachers rather than with the unselected group. (Author/JA)",

Largely the problem of combined programs lies in scheduling: evening sessions must be scheduled in order that the graduate students may attend. Preservice students, however, could begin classes in midafternoon; then the graduate students and teachers enrolled in reading programs could join together for a combined session.

A review of the research and theoretical literature between 1960 and 1972 about video playback and other kinds of self-confrontation in education and psychology suggests an eclectic dynamic view. Video playback seems a powerful placebo with potential for harm as well as help. The change process includes stress; intense focus of self; identification of discrepancies among experience, observation, and goal; general activation of the system; increased realism; disruption of behavior; reassembly of behavior; and changes in discrepancies. Interacting upon outcomes are  characteristics of the subject, the performance, the feedback, the focus, the focuser, the feedback situation, the subsequent real-life situation; and opportunities for elicitation, assembly, and continued use of behaviors. Application requires a systems approach including various subject, treatment, and context combinations for various outcomes. This system is called Personalized Teacher Education. (Author)",

For the purposes of this present investigation, it was assumed that criteria of effective communication are highly dependent on the phenomena of redundancy and consistency, which are both of major importance in any discussion of communication. Consistency is related to the behavior of the communicator, while redundancy pertains to the informational contents of the message itself. Redundancy is both necessary and sufficient for the existence of effective communication because its existence implies both the presence of excess information and a shored communication system build up over a period of time. Primary subjects of the observation were three  kindergarten teachers. The teachers were given feedback on the first period and were asked to follow these instructions to become more redundant communicators. Results indicated that on a theoretical level communication theory does provide a valuable alternative paradigm to the operant model used in behavior modification studies. On a pragmatic level results indicated that A/O (attending and orientation) behaviors may be somewhat less important than was previously considered. (Tables are appended.) (JA)",

Until the present time, the middle school teacher has received in-service training at the elementary and secondary levels. This method has proved to be inadequate and a preservice education program that is neither elementary nor secondary has been proposed. With the initiation of this program, an investigation was begun of the characteristics of the middle school teacher. This new kind of teacher should not only like working with 10-14-year-olds, but should also be sensitive to their emerging independence, heightened insecurity, and divergent interests. An internship period for the preservice participant would strengthen the student/teacher relationship. The ability of the  middle school teacher to cooperate with other teachers was deemed necessary because of the extended use of team teaching. Because problems in reading and communication skills are prevalent in the middle school, the teacher should know how to prescribe for these problems individually. The preservice education program should then include courses and experiences which would aid in dealing with these problems. The program should also include flexible scheduling because of the various courses offered to the middle school student. A list of activities and a model schedule from the Desoto Middle School, Arcadia, Florida were included. (BRB)",

The benefits and drawbacks of volunteerism are presented, with stress on the indication that problems incurred by the school districts can be solved. The planning, coordination, supervision, direction, and usage of volunteer programs are emphasized; examples of specific school volunteer programs across the United States are given. Explained are the use of students as tutors in these programs, the importance of recruiting and placing volunteers, and approaches toward evaluation. Five sample volunteer programs are presented, exemplifying a) a large, urban program (Los Angeles); b) an urban program which combines individual and organizational resources (Denver); c) a  program jointly sponsored by a school district and a service organization (Boise, Idaho) d) a comprehensive statewide program (New Hampshire); and e) a cross-age teaching program (Ontario-Montclair, California).

The present study discusses a methodological problem area of very narrow scope within the IPA project. The general aim of the study is to examine the factor-analytical method of sequence analysis and to produce variables that measure the appearance of sequential tendencies. Also, the study will measure the process from the starting point of transition probabilities between the elements. The specific aims fall within three main areas: a) the reliability of measures of classroom behavior and their practical utility, b) the inverse factor analysis of sequences of interaction that may occur within the framework of lessons and that characterize only the lessons of a certain  type, and c) the factor analysis of sequences of interaction that occur within the framework of lessons and whose basic form remains the same but whose relative frequency varies from lesson to lesson.

An attempt was made to determine if teachers from different grade levels used different question-and-answer techniques during daily classroom interaction. Two hypotheses were investigated: a) no significant differences were found between second- and fifth-grade teacher groups in oral interrogatory soliciting techniques and b) no significant differences were found between second- and fifth-grade teacher groups in oral interrogatory responding techniques. Thirty minutes of verbal interaction between 10 second-grade and 10 fifth-grade teachers and their students were analyzed by five readers. The soliciting techniques were categorized  according to memory; associative, ratiocinative, evaluative, and clarifying behavior; skill demonstration, rhetorical behavior, managing the classroom, and controlling behavior. The responding techniques were grouped under accepts or praises, clarifies, corrects, criticizes, asks a question, directs, and lectures. Analysis yielded acceptance of both hypotheses. Some conclusions of the investigation are a) classroom interaction emphasizes clarification of ideas, memory, and ratiocination and b) similarity between the two teacher groups was most pronounced in the responding technique.

For teacher education, the author lists set, pacing, and closure as components comparable to the components of an atom for integral structure. A model is given, performance based, in which a highly effective orchestration of set, pacing, and closure will increase the probability of a greater number of positive teachable moments. Again, as with the atom, the author finds dynamic yet orderly and disciplined activity  in performance-based teacher education, which moves in some direction and serves a generative function. Included is a description of the generation of performance-based teacher education from the early 1960s.

Content and process are carefully articulated so that the students who are enrolled in the program know what they are attempting to do and why they are doing it. Field experiences are provided to prospective teachers over an extended  period of time so that they may have appropriate apprentice and intern level experiences. Evaluation to date has indicated that students and instructors approve of the program and that state universities may develop their own programs. Nevertheless, implementing such a program totally would require fiscal support beyond normal budgetary authorization. (Author/JA)",

Three of the four indices (excluding the contingency coefficient) are compared by computing each for four sets of observational data. It was found that Bernstein's coefficient had the highest median and the smallest range, percent agreement the second highest median and the second smallest range, and Scott's pi the lowest median and the largest range. It is hoped that authors will employ this information in their practical application and interpretation of these indices. (Author)",

Significant deficiencies exist in the means of lower-class and certain racial groups for many measures of ability, motivation, and performance. Composite attempts to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance in IQ which is genetic approximate 80%. These heritability indices have been interpreted to mean that most of the observed deficiencies in the mean IQ's for classes and races is biologically inevitable. However, evidences of plasticity suggest that the range of reaction in the IQ must be of the order of 75 points. Such evidence of plasticity becomes less puzzling when one recognizes that estimates of heritability indicate the loss of  deviation from the mean of the population to be expected from parents to off-spring in experiments on selective breeding, that indices of heritability are relevant only to the status quo within a given population so long as environment remains constant, and that these indices say nothing about how much the mean of a phenotypic measure of intelligence or scholastic achievement will change with development in new environments. Such information demands knowledge of the norm of reaction which comes only from the difference between the means of measures of achievement and intelligence for groups of children from a given population of genotypes who have been reared under differing environmental conditions or differing educational programs. Evidence from two sources indicates that this range is  of the order of 75 points and that special child rearing can boost the mean achievement for disadvantaged children. (DB)",

A study of over 400 faculty members in which half were assigned to an experimental group and half were controls, showed that as a result of student ratings on an instructor's practices, changes in instruction occurred after only a half semester for instructors who were \"unrealistic\" in how they viewed their teaching, and a wider variety of instructors changed if given more than a half semester and if they were given minimal information to help them interpret their scores. Some adverse effects of student ratings are that the ratings do not allow for individual styles of teaching, and they encourage  traditional modes of teaching. Flexibility in the employment of student ratings is extremely critical. Student ratings influence college administrators in that these evaluations make the administrator's job easier and more effective. Student evaluations may be contributing to the current interest in administrator evaluations by faculty members. Where student ratings have been incorporated into faculty evaluation procedures, the impact on students is likely to be positive. Probably the major impact of student ratings on students is provided by published course and teacher critiques. A worthwhile use of student ratings is that of providing departments with information about the effectiveness of their offerings as seen by students. Focusing on weaknesses highlighted by student evaluations  could be applied at the college level. (DB)",

A test's function, i.e., how the test results are used, appears to be the most logical method of discriminating between the types of tests. In educational testing, if the purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching or training, and the test is designed to measure what has been specifically taught, it is an achievement test. The same holds true if the intent is to grade students on the basis of what they have learned in a course. If the interest is only in predicting grades, a numerical aptitude test is perhaps best. If it is desired to predict success in several subjects at the same time, achievement tests can be used. This approach is most effective where  past and future courses are most alike. Achievement tests can function as aptitude measures best in the early school years, less well at the junior and senior high school levels where courses became increasingly differentiated. Another possible choice for predicting success in various courses is the scholastic aptitude or so-called group intelligence test. To the extent that various courses demand verbal and/or numerical facility for successful learning, a test that measures those aptitudes will probably prove useful. A third alternative is the use of differential aptitude test batteries, which provide broader coverage of mental functioning than the scholastic aptitude test. In the business world, multi-score employment tests are often more useful than single-score tests in employee  selection. (For related document, see TM 002 944.) (DB)",

The true score measures the performance that is characteristic of the person tested; the variations, plus and minus, around the true score describe a characteristic of the test. When the standard deviation is used as a measure of the variation of observed scores around the true score, the result is called the standard error of measurement. The standard error of measurement can be used in defining limits around the observed score within which one would be reasonably sure to find the true score. Since, in practice, it is not possible to give a large number of equivalent forms of a test in order to find the characteristic standard error of  measurement, it is determined by the reliability coefficient. As measured by the reliability coefficient, reliability means consistency of measurement. It is unfortunately true that a test will have different reliability coefficients depending on the groups of people tested. The standard error of measurement is less subject to this variation. The formula for computing it, which is given, takes into account both the reliability coefficient and the standard deviation for each group. A table is provided of Standard Errors of Measurement for Given Values of Reliability Coefficient and Standard Deviation. (For related document, see TM 002 943, 946.) (DB)",

Cross-validation demonstrated whether a decision derived from one set of data is truly effective when this decision is applied to another independent, but relevant, sample of people. Cross-validation is particularly important after statistical data have been used to choose the best tests to make up a battery for use with the next group of people. A cross-validation experiment on a new group will tell how good the choice of test really is. Item analysis is a means of improving tests. The data from the analysis are used to eliminate doubtful items and to determine the best scoring weights. By applying the revised test to a new independent group, the inventory is refined. When  the test is, without change, administered to an entirely new and independent set of criterion groups, cross validation data are obtained. (For related document, see TM 002 947.) (DB)",

A derivative of the general standard score system is the stanine plan, which divides the norm population into nine groups and nine percentages which indicates the percent of the total population in each of the stanines. Interpretation of the Wechsler scales depends on a knowledge of standard scores. A subject's raw score on each of the subtests in these scales is converted, by appropriate norm tables, to a standard score, based on a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. The sums of standard scores on  the Verbal Scale, the Performance Scale, and the Full Scale are then converted into IQ's. These IQ's based on a standard score mean of 100; the standard deviatn of the IQ's set at 15 points. IQ's of the type used in the Wechsler scales are known as \"deviation IQ's\" as contrasted with the IQ's developed from scales in which a derived mental age is divided by chronological age.

Verbal communication probed for information on equipment problems, procedural problems, delays, and potential hazards. The concept of using radio equipment to collect human factors data was tested, using technicians performaing flight-line maintenance. Data collected by radio were compared with data collected by questionnaire.

The need for educational performance indicators is that indicators would provide a series of measures to show how well educational systems are performing, that indicators would identify specific areas in which specific school systems need specific help, and that indicators could clarify what school are actually doing for and to different kinds of children. Four factors in measuring the performance of an educational system are input, educational process, surrounding conditions, and output. These factors constitute what is called the \"student-change model\" of an educational system. To reduce  the number of indices, a factor analysis of the measures of student output characteristics should be carried out. Factor analyses would also be employed to reduce the number of measures of educational process, the measures of \"hard-to-change\" surrounding conditions, and the measures of \"modifiable\" surrounding conditions. The procedure proposed for deriving performance indicators for a given set of schools begins with a series of regression analyses involving as large a sample of school systems as appears feasible. A proposed pilot study to provide information crucial to the evaluation of underlying assumptions is discussed, and long-range plans are described. Appendix A to the report discusses factor analyses, and Appendix B concerns regression analyses and conversion of deviations to  performance indices. (DB)",

It is shown that, with the enlarged theory and some elementary geometry, one may use a few ideas to explain many qualitative results, to give a credible and precise account of quantitative properties of data, and to design experiments which seem worth doing whether the theory is valid or not. In developing the new theory, the major criticisms of the classical theory are answered. This paper is limited to one of three aspects of the typical psychophysical measurement  experiment--the relation between perceptions and attributes. Although the theory has been extended to category and rating scales, only magnitude estimation and related measurement procedures are discussed here. The scope of this paper is further limited to phenomena which have analogues in several sense modalities. (Author/KM)",

A posttest, measuring the children's recall for information about each component separately, was assumed to reflect the degree of attention directed to each component during learning. Attention to the nondominant component was found to increase with age when this feature was redundant with the dominant component and could thus serve as a second functional cue (component selection task), but not when it was incidental.

The present study examined children's incidental learning with compound pictorial stimuli under conditions in which the relevant and incidental features were: (a) depicted together in an action relation; (b) depicted together in a static relation; or (c) represented as independent entities. These materials were compared in two experiments, one involving 8-, 11- and 14-year-old children and the other involving 8- and 14-year-olds (the static condition was excluded in the second experiment). Following a learning task requiring attention to a single element in each stimulus, incidental learning was  measured by having the Ss, in effect, reconstruct the compounds. While incidental learning was found to be higher with the action materials than in the standard condition, the developmental trend in incidental learning scores was little affected by the pictorial integration. On one hand, these results extend the generality of the finding that children's incidental learning undergoes little change with age. On the other hand, the results contrast with evidence obtained from two sources--one showing that stimulus integration of another type can influence the developmental trend in incidental learning and the other showing an increase with age in the effects of action portrayal on international (paired associate) learning of pictorial associations.

        "description":"Out of the tradition of behavior analysis has come a system of behavioral measurement which is both sufficiently exact and sufficiently general to be used effectively in meeting the problems of educational accountability. The Standard Behavior Chart is a measurement tool that meets the specifications of frequency, celeration, sensitivity (in order to measure changes in the behavior of an individual child and all the behaviors of which individuals or groups are capable), and standardization (to permit direct comparison among the variables differentiating a number of situations. Four measures--frequency, accuracy, celeration and improvement index (a combination of accuracy and celeration)--are easily obtained from this chart and provide direct measures of both the quantity and  quality of behavior and behavior change. The Standard Behavior Chart is most effective when it is made an integral part of the teaching process; teachers and students should be trained in its use so that it can aid in individualized evaluation, decision-making and planning. A high speed computer can be used in collating and analyzing the masses of data resulting from the use of the chart by teachers and students. Measures of benefit and efficiency can be obtained through analysis of the data. The Learning Abilities Development Program in North Carolina, which sought to screen first graders for potential learning deficiencies and give individualized service to each one targeted, utilized the Standard Behavior Chart successfully.

        "description":"Companies have been accused of using tests as a means of maintaining unfair discrimination against groups which have already suffered from many forms of discrimination. It does not follow, however, that tests themselves merit condemnation. Employers who use tests do so because the information furnished by tests is valuable to them in making hiring decisions. Although testing is not free from defect or beyond criticism, appropriately chosen and properly administered ability tests are superior to most available alternatives. Some of the problems stemming from the testing of disadvantaged groups, such as reduced reliability due to the compression of score distributions, are of a technical nature and are unrelated to discrimination. Many of the issues have both psychometric and  social aspects. Some current testing procedures should be changed to reduce the fear and hostility that may be engendered by materials felt to be biased or unfair. More attention must be devoted to research with actual score and performance data in order to improve the predictive efficiency of tests. But discrimination in the world of work will not be resolved by improved psychometrics alone. The use of tests in employee selection is inherently a friendly rather than a hostile act to those who come to the job market from backgrounds of limited opportunity. The rejection of measuring instruments which register the consequence of cultural deprivation is merely a modern version of killing the messenger who brings bad news. (Author/KM)",

A major roadblock to reform has been conservatism both in the profession and among the public. The emerging role of the principal saddles him with the responsibility for bringing about change in institutions that do not want to change. Some of the concepts involved in an understanding of change are: individualization, decision-making, strategy and staging, long-range planning, conflict, opinion leaders, pressure points, values, costs, communication, consultants, self-motivation, emotions, and the leader's motives. The creative use of the North Central Association accreditation and evaluation process can allow the principal  to utilize the pressures of the outside accrediting agency and the visiting team, along with the school staff and administration, in pointing out needed change within the educational program. The following kinds of action are helpful in enabling the principal to use school evaluation as a base for change: (1) make the conscious decision to use this method to initiate change; (2) generate as much support as possible from those above you; (3) communicate your intentions to the staff; (4) pay especial attention to the makeup of the visiting team; (5) plan for student participation; (6) set the tone for the staff by dealing objectively with the final report of the visiting team; (7) set a standard of openness in order to encourage change; and (8) be sure to act on the report rather than  filing it away.

Such data may ultimately be used in decision-making regarding the appropriation of public and private resources. Comparisons of costs and other measures among institutions will be the byword. Thus it is important that potential areas of misunderstanding and misuse of information be fully understood both by those who provide the data and those who receive it. It is not implied that such requests for data are necessarily inappropriate; in fact, if used responsibily, data comparison can also be a valuable internal decision-making tool for the institution. This paper, then, is designed for both the potential requestors of data and the members of the  higher education community who will be responding to such requests. The difficulties in routine data comparisons, some of which were experienced by a six-member data exchange group, are explained. Suggestions are made concerning ways in which data comparison can be handled meaningfully.

They become the end of the educational endeavor instead of an evaluation procedure. They are psychologically damaging to two-thirds of the students because of their inability to get the only two good grades (A & B) and they interfere with a good relationship between teacher and student. Concord High School in Wilmington, Delaware has initiated a criterion-referenced system which eliminates grades, grade point averages, class rank, valedictorian/saluatorian distinctions. This system is based on carefully written performance objectives which allow students to progress at their own rate of speed and completing the  course when they have achieved the objectives. There are two basic levels in which a student may choose to operate, sufficiency and proficiency. The former designation is for those meeting basic requirements and the latter is designed for those who have unusual motivation, interest and skills and wish to distinguish themselves. Colleges will accept transcripts devoid of grades, grade point averages and class rankings, if the schools can provide adequate information on what the student knows. Surveys of 180 colleges support this premise. Only 10% report that this kind of transcript might interfere with the student's admission. The only thing preventing change in the grading system is developing a strategy for the change process. (Author)",

The emphasis is on processes used to reach a conclusion rather than on the accuracy of the conclusion itself. Information based on a real clinical case is written on removable cards placed in overlapping flat pockets. The questions that may be asked are written on the top edges of the cards. The information pertinent to a question is contained on the reverse side of the card. After reading preliminary information about the case, the subject is requested to reach a diagnosis by asking as many questions as he wishes, in any order, from the questions presented to him. The subject is instructed  to read the information contained on the reverse side of the chosen card before asking the next question. The questions asked, and those not asked, are recorded. The test usually consists of 50 to 80 cards. Several scoring methods have been developed to study the performance of junior and senior medical students and physicians; the results reported were obtained with a sample of approximately 90 juniors, 130 seniors, and 40 physicians. The mean number of questions asked by each group for the three parts of the test, clinical interview, physical examination and laboratory data, was caluclated; it was found that juniors and physicians vary more than seniors in the number of questions asked. Also computed were utility indexes for each question, the performance curve of each subject, and  values used to score students in terms of the physicians' performance.

The simples kind of total, obtained by adding raw scores on the tests, automatically assigns weights to the tests which are proportional to their standard deviation. When desired or appropriate, tests can be weighted equally in a total by transforming the raw scores on each test so that standard deviations will be the same. This procedures, usually done by converting the scores on each test to scaled scores, does not of itself provide a better measuring instrument. Validation studies must still be conducted. For a particular criterion, the most predictive type of total score is one based on optimum weights for the tests. In some instances, test authors have so constructed their tests that a simple summation  of scores is also the best-weighted total for a specific type of criterion.

The research leading to the development of the Cultural Indicators (of trends in television dramatic content and their effects) began with the analysis of the most pervasive and comprehensive images of everyday culture found in television drama. The symbolic structures and functions of the message systems in television drama provided the basis of the pilot project, which gave striking evidence of the cultivation of certain assumptions and conceptions among heavy viewers. The pilot project involved: (1) a study in which children were asked to  rate specially prepared pictures according to who would be the aggressor/victim or hero/villain; answers revealed race, age and sex biases; and (2) a survey of adult viewers through telephone interviews involving the use of a semi-projective questionnaire with forced error choice items and opinion items. The next and final phase of research should establish the theoretical and practical usefulness of cultural indicators as guides to scientific understanding, citizen and consumer behavior, and public policy in communications and culture.

Records at four high schools in the Santa Barbara area were examined to develop statistical, demographic profiles of two populations, the 1970 and 1971 graduates. A questionnaire was sent to each graduate. Three weeks later a second questionnaire was sent to non-respondents, and three weeks after that non-respondents were interviewed by telephone. Data from 78% of the 1970 and 82% of the 1971 graduates were thus obtained. Examination of the statistical profiles of respondents revealed the questionnaire data to be representative of the entire population. Differences in response  rates and in responses to questionnaire items were analyzed and found to be related to sex, ethnic background, and grade point average. Subsequently, random and stratified-random samples of different sizes were drawn from the respondent pools. Samples of the latter type were stratified on combinations of sex, ethnic background, and GPA. Several behavioral and attitudinal questionnaire items were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the sampling models. It was found that the stratified-random sample models provided more accurate results than the random sample models. Several criteria for selecting the proper sample size are discussed. (Author/KM)",

If the n estimates are to be combined into a single number, we compare the obvious rule, that of averaging the n values and taking the positive part of the result, with that of averaging the positive parts. Although the estimator generated by the second rule is not consistent, it is shown by numerical calculation that for small n it has a smaller mean square error than the first over a considerable region of the parameter space, and that for n = 2 or 3 the second is minimax relative to the first over a region consisting of almost the whole parameter space. The distribution of each of the n estimates is  assumed to be either Gaussian or the distribution of a weighted difference of two independent chi-squares with known degrees of freedom, as in one-way components of variance. Some other simply calculated estimators, including the positive part of the median, are studied for the chi-square difference case with (2,2) degrees of freedom and n = 3. (Author)",

However, both variables in the calculation of a validity coefficient should be examined to determine where the bias lies. A study was conducted to investigate the construct validity of a set of predictors and a set of criterion scales separately for blacks and whites. Data were collected during a project to validate a test battery and a followup study of the effectiveness of the resultant selection procedures. Ss totaled 70 blacks and 104 whites. Tests used were the Adaptability Test, the Spelling scale, word meaning scale, checking scale and copying scale of the Purdue Clerical Adaptability Test and  the ten scales of the Guilford-Zimmerman Temperament Survey. The criterion scales consisted of 5 specially constructed, behaviorally anchored rating scales measuring accuracy, information, attitude, initiative, and knowledge of procedures. Eleven cases of differential validity occurred. The pattern of test-criterion relationships was obviously different for the two groups. The factor patterns for the 15 predictors were for the most part similar for blacks and whites. The analysis of the factor structure of the predictors suggested that they measure the same or similar constructs within the two groups. Results indicate that the criterion scales, more than the predictors, contributed to the differential validity and single-group validity. (KM)",

A plot of factor loadings for the various courses made for the two- and three-factor systems indicated that a few courses were somewhat different than the rest, but the reason was not clearly identifiable. The two-factor system was decomposed into two uncorrelated components, one which correlated .96 with the single factor scores and the other which correlated zero with the single factor scores. The latter component had a multiple correlation of .03 with LSAT, Writing Ability and  Background scores. These analyses produced no persuasive evidence for more than one factor. The results agree with those of a similar study on the business school context. The residuals produced were used to study the possible existence of instructor bias. Two instructors were found with residuals significantly different from zero. One was found to be a slightly easy grader, and the other was found to be a hard grader. (Author)",

        "description":"The logic of set theory is applied to the problem of infrastructure and transition in developmental analysis. The analysis necessitates the decomposition of stages into components. The decomposition generates sets within sets and, from a sequential perspective, progressions within progressions. The relation of lower to higher and precursor to successor items varies from the trivial to the rigorous. In a trivial analysis, a precursor is neither necessary nor sufficient for a successor; in a rigorous analysis, a precursor is necessary and sufficient. Infrastructure and transition are interdependent. When components are common to successive stages, stages are transformed or correlatively transformed; when components are discrete, stages are substituted, added or deleted; and when  some components are common and some discrete, stages are hybrid. Any transformation or correlative transformation implies a correspondence, integration, or differentiation with parallelism, subordination, or emergence. Any substitution, addition, or deletion implies a coincidence, augmentation, or reduction with coplanarity, expansion, or contraction. The implications of this analysis are discussed in relation to developmental theory and theory evaluation. (Author)",

In the diagnostic phase a systematic study of process variables is initiated to identify those process variables that should become the focus of corrective action plans. Corrective action must then be taken. Suggestions for implementing the accountability system are also presented. (Author)",

The purpose was to discover, given the behaviors measured, whether there is convergent and discriminant validity for the existence of one or more dimensions of self requlatory behaviors during this period. Two cognitively-based measures of self regulatory behavior, the Matching Familiar Figures Test and the Motor Inhibition Test, were administered. Results are given in terms of levels of performance on the self-regulatory measures, internal characteristics of the scores from the MFF and MIT, interrelations among the self-regulatory behaviors, and their discriminant validity with respect to general ability and response tempo  dimensions. Results indicate a change with age in the preschool years in the meaning of the self-regulatory behaviors. MFF latencies develop significant correlations with other scores as age increases. MFF errors showed a significant sex difference, with males making more errors than females each year. (KM)",

        "description":"The pattern of responses to the Enhancement of Learning Inventory (ELI), designed to assess a teacher's belief about the effectiveness of methods for teaching each pupil, is expected to: (1) reliably describe characteristics on which teachers differ; (2) relate to individual differences in pupil background and behavioral characteristics; and (3) provide a mediating structure guiding the teacher's role performances and their impact upon pupil psycho-educational development. A study was conducted to examine these issues using the ELI judgments of 35 teachers of economically disadvantaged preschool children, most of whom were enrolled in Head Start. Individual differences among teachers were found to have satisfactory reliabilities on a variety of ELI measures. Teacher belief  patterns clearly were functionally related to pupil characteristics. Most striking was the extent to which pupil cognitive skills and response tempo at the time of preschool entry influenced the teachers' beliefs about effective teaching methods. While there was evidence that teacher belief patterns influence aspects of pupil psycho-educational development, the present findings indicated that pupil behavioral characteristics may have a greater impact upon teacher behavior than vice-versa. It is clear that the teacher's manner of coping with individual differences in children's intital receptivity to classroom learning is a critical factor in subsequent relationships between teacher and child.

These results are compared with those obtained in Year 1, the year prior to the students' attendance in a group program. The tests tapped cognitive skills (e.g., general knowledge, verbal and perceptual-motor abilities, reasoning skills, Piagetian-based conservation development), cognitive styles (e.g., analytic abilities, reflection-impulsivity), and a variety of personal and social behaviors (e.g., risk-taking, cooperation, self-concept, and play preference). In both years, analyses of the test data yielded two main dimensions: (1) a general ability dimension, and (2) a  response tempo dimension. Some task-specific styles and behaviors were also defined. Year 2 analyses also revealed a spontaneous verbalization factor unrelated to the major verbal competency measure. In addition, there was some evidence in Year 2 for generalization of specific personal and social behaviors (compliance and the desire to please) across tasks. Both economic eligibility and later selection for Head Start were associated with cognitive performance differences in Year 1, and significant differences remained in Year 2. High similarity in the factor structure across years was shown. (Author/KM)",

Outcomes of the Three Phase System suggest it is well received by local education agencies and by the team members who have contributed to it. However, it has numerous deficiencies most of which arise from the fact that it does not emphasize or produce product information. Among the favorable features of the System is its self-reactance.

The first consists of insuring that the measurements and assessments obtained reflect what they are intended to reflect. The problem of scope consists of insuring that all the varied components of foreign language competence and skill are measured. The problem of efficiency encompasses the obtaining of the best assessments possible within the limits of time and resources available for the construction and administration of the assessments. An example of how tests relate to the wider context of instruction is the degree to which testing either enhances instruction or distorts it  through undesirable feedback effects from the tests. It is concluded that, with continual attention to the criteria for good test construction and to the need for new research on testing procedures, it should be possible to effect a gradual net improvement in the quality and effectiveness of foreign language tests.

        "description":"As children grow older they show an increasing preference for classifying objects on the basis of shape rather than color. To clarify the nature of this \"dimension preference,\" children of ages 3 1/2 to 6 1/2 years were given a method of triads test of dimension preferences, followed (after a week's delay) by a component selection task. The most notable results were these: (1) Children below and above the median age differed in frequency of shape preference; (2) For children below the median age, higher component selection test scores were observed for the preferred dimension; and (3) No age difference was found in the relative magnitudes of the component selection scores. The results suggest that a \"preference\" for a particular dimension does not necessarily indicate a high  degree of selective attention to that dimension. Also, the age difference in children's dimension preferences may be attributable to factors unrelated to selective attention. (Author)",

The course consisted of four-hour weekly sessions, in which the students attended two-hour lecture sessions and taught eight to ten micro-lessons. In the microteaching laboratory, the student-teachers were arranged into groups of six to eight students. All lessons were videotaped; and immediately following the lesson, the student, supervisor and peers viewed the tape. The tapes were critically discussed, and alternative courses of action were outlined for the next lesson. The computer analysis of the data provided a diagnostic card for each student and served as a basis for laboratory supervision. Results are given. Since all the students achieved similar  levels of performance towards the end of the treatment, it is concluded that the treatment is effective for student-teachers with low-entry behavior as well as for those who begin the training program with some teaching experience.

In Experiment I, the group's instruction following behavior remained low regardless of whether (1) the teacher provided either modeling or verbal cues or a combination of these two and (2) another adult did or did not comply with the teacher's requests. Neither the adult model nor any of the children ever received explicit reinforcement in Experiment I. In Experiment II, reinforcement was first delivered to the adult demonstrator model for compliance but was never given to any of the child observers. Despite this vicarious reinforcement procedure, the group's behavior was not elevated. When explicit reinforcement was then directly delivered  continuously and exclusively during selected sessions to four of the group's members, instruction following by three of these target children was elevated (and later lowered in two cases where extinction procedures pertain). However, the behavior of the remaining nontarget children in the audience remained low. Substantial improvement and maintenance of instruction following obtained in the entire group when each of the members was provided direct but intermittent reinforcement during each session.

The proposal contained a design for an action research program to be conducted among black teen-age males of the South Park Area in Tucson, Arizona. The purpose of the project was to gather data from the area which would enable the Extension Service to design programs which would: (1) create a positive image of University of Arizona 4-H Clubs among minority groups; (2) identify and develop indigenous leadership to serve minority neighborhoods; and, (3) assimilate cultural variance into the larger 4-H membership. Two general goals were established for the research project itself: (1) to discover the reasons for past successes or  failures of youth programs designed for black teen-age males in greatly depressed urban areas, specifically the South Park Area of Tucson, and (2) after identification of the reasons for past successes or failures, to evaluate the possibility of a viable program which would appeal to and atract the target population. As a result of the findings of the Pilot Project, several recommendations are made for introducing a program for the poor. (Author)",

A majority of schools assume that intelligence, and therefore academic success, can be measured. Accordingly, standardized tests are used to determine intellectual capacity and level, and test results are employed as a basis for classifying and tracking students into various groups. This issue of \"Inequality in Education\" is designed to analyze the underlying concepts of testing and tracking, and to explore the particular educational inequities which these practices foist upon minority group children. Articles deal with: (1) an examination of the prevailing concept of intelligence and IQ in relation to varied perspectives and  cultures; (2) cultural, socioeconomic and racial bias in testing and tracking; (3) a review of some legal cases involving classification in schools; (4) an examination of the history of ability groups, studies about them, and possible ways to restructure classroom grouping to have less detrimental effects on students; (5) the small educational goals of many tracked classrooms and how they relate to the success of a non-tracked special school in Massachusetts; and, (6) the flexible and individualized use of testing and grouping in a program in South Carolina.

        "description":"Two articles on the urbanization of Kenya are presented in this survey. The first one, &quot;Urbanization Trends and Prospects,&quot; by Luigi Laurenti, states that urbanization has only recently been recognized as a problem of some importance in Kenya, and this recognition is far from comprehensive. Consequently, public policy--and especially planning for economic and social development--has not yet faced up to dealing with urbanization at any level, be it diagnosing problems, planning solutions, providing legislative and administrative mechanisms adequate for the programs and projects needed, or making appropriate allocations of resources. Topics dealt with here are migration, urban squatters, the role of urban centers, urban development committees, the Nairobi Urban Study, urban  development, growth centers, dispersal of industry, differential service needs, urban infrastructure, pollution control, the scale and pace of urbanization, and alternatives for Kenya. The second article, &quot;Rural Development and Urban Growth,&quot; by John Gerhart, discusses the importance of rural development programs as a part of urban growth strategy. Recent evidence suggests that rural development programs represent an efficient way to create employment and build a base of purchasing power on which future growth of the modern sector depends.

The Seers Report found that Zambia was the most urbanized country in Africa south of the Sahara (excluding South Africa). This report finds that since Independence, this country has witnessed a high rate of rural/urban drift, which has been caused by two factors: the relative stagnation of the rural areas, coupled with an unprecedented and unanticipated rise in both real and money incomes in the towns. In connection with these findings, the following topics are discussed here: (1) The Planning Background; (2) The Future Strategy for Rural Development in Zambia; (3) Rural/Urban Migration and  Employment; (4) Settlement and Housing; (5) Alternative Approaches to Rural Development; (6) The Second National Development Plan 1972-1976.

It is structured around four central questions about Morocco's urban policy. (1) What exactly did the &quot;French tradition&quot; and the &quot;French influence&quot; entail in regard to urbanization? (2) How did the new Moroccan government approach the problem of the cities, in its general policy and in its development plans? (3) What is the current policy towards urban development, and how has it evolved? (4) What means has the Moroccan government at its disosal to plan for urban development and to implement its policies? The paper also explores briefly the activities of international agencies in the field of urbanization, and the potential  for new initiatives and new programs in the future. This paper draws on the author's personal research in Morocco in 1968 and 1970, which involved extensive interviews with government officials at the central and local levels, and with private individuals. It also involved an exploration of archives of the central government and of the city of Casablanca.

This demographic approach seems to neglect two other important aspects of urbanization: namely, economic and social. The economic dimension consists of structural change in the productive forces, which include specialization and the division of labor; and the social aspect entails modernization and noneconomic transformations. A suitable definition of urbanization must take all these processes into account. In this report, all aspects will be considered, with an emphasis on objectivity.

It covers the major activities of the last decade or so, and assesses the posture of the agencies at the start of the Second Development Decade in relation to urbanization in the less developed countries. The report draws on information gathered during discussions with agency staff members at headquarter points and country missions, as well as on the literature in the field. The primary focus is on the work of the United Nations Center for Housing, Building and Planning; the Public Administration Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, and the World Health Organization. It will, in addition, consider the activities of the  Organization of American States' Division of Urban Development, which has been especially active in the areas of research and training. Also reported here are the activities of USAID, The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Inter-American Development Bank. This survey does not attempt to be exhaustive, either in terms of the agencies covered and discussed or with regard to the full range of projects now in operation or recently completed.

        "description":"This survey paper attempts to demonstrate that there is a functional interaction between race and the city. Given the basic features of slums, squatter colonies, rapid immigration, patchy industrialization and chronic unemployment, together with political instability (induced both internally and externally), the author attempts to show that race is the intervening variable in the evolution of the Third World urban plural society and the perpetuation of the ghetto and exclusivism. The following topics are discussed: (1) the evolution of the city; (2) race relations within the city; (3) the colonial legacy; (4) race in the city today; (5) the implications of race for city management; (6) town-planning and race; (7) the future of race in the city; (8) some research suggestions:'tribalism' in the city; consequences of public policy on patterns of settlement; employment and ethnicity; political ideologies and movements.

Data collection procedures included analyses of commissioned papers, ERIC documents, and reports of diffusion research. A group of innovative project directors were interviewed, and a committee of consultants reviewed and revised the framework. Target audiences for this conceptual framework are diffusion researchers, change agents at the state or local level who need information on available tactics for  innovation diffusion, consumers of innovations, and university faculties preparing education extension or other change agents. The framework presented in this document represents the first of a planned 3-year activity. Appendixes contain the preliminary framework subdimensions, consulting committee group reports, list of innovative project directors interviewed, and an outline of a handbook of diffusion techniques.

The information obtained was intended to be utilized by educators in upgrading vocational school automotive programs and curriculums. Findings indicate that, in general, employers were satisfied with the training the graduates received. The graduates also rated their training good, but called for more hours of training in general and specialty areas and courses more relevant to auto mechanics. The study reveals that the greatest problems involve the weak placement programs of vocational schools and the substandard wages reported by many of the graduates. Recommendations relate  to such items as: (1) better communications between industry and automotive training programs, (2) licensing programs and other programs to help raise wage rates for graduates, (3) emphasis on making related subjects relevant to automotive subjects, and (4) review of the number of hours of actual automotive training.

The techniques and procedures presented in this paper need to be modified and adapted by an administrator to conform with local school conditions and priorities. Renewed interest in career education underscores the following general societal needs that educational planning must consider: (1) the need to adapt easily to socioeconomic changes, (2) the need to plan for individual geographic mobility, (3) the need to provide individuals with occupational versatility, and (4) the need to provide students with greater flexibility in occupational choice patterns. Studies  which identify various types of occupational clusters and curriculum development efforts are reviewed to provide a rationale for the career cluster concept.

Specifically, the investigation was directed at surveying migrant workers in and around the Michigan area. Interviews with a random sample of household heads provided the data. Variables studied were: (1) social characteristics, including household composition and educational level, (2) backgrounds of migratory workers and characteristics of community stabilization, (3) occupational opportunities, (4) employment and income patterns, and (5) occupational and income mobility. Detailed findings of the study are included and tables provide statistical data of  the variables studied. Of the sampled population, only 12 percent were born in Michigan or migrated there before age 16. A total of nine percent came before 1919, and 32 percent arrived in the early 1940's. Migration increased immensely in the 1950's, but declined in the late 1950's with the onset of the economic recession. Mostly born in Texas, recent migrants are somewhat younger than the resident Mexican Americans, have higher educational levels, and reside mainly in rural areas. (SN)",

Government is a major employer, especially during economic depressions when market forces have caused high unemployment in the private sector. Governments may be particularly important sources of jobs for Negroes and other minorities in equal employment opportunity implementation. Data are presented for racial patterns of employment by agency category and labor type in 13 Southern states. It was found that geographic location alone cannot explain the racial employment patterns. Leadership by State and local officials and pressure from the community, black and white, are also very important, and the community organization is as important as  legislation in causing any changes in the patterns. The study also indicated the need for better data on Negro employment in State and local governments. The data are especially limited at the municipal level. Conclusions and recommendations offer guides for the administration and enforcement of equal employment opportunities.

One of the first comprehensive programs in the field, the Careers Oriented Relevant Education program had as its objectives to: (1) plan a program for the public schools based on life career roles, (2) establish effective communication between the educational institutions and the community, (3) provide an experimental program involving a project region, (4) provide inservice and preservice teacher education to assist teachers in becoming careers oriented in their teaching approach, and (5) develop curriculum materials and resources based on the careers approach which could be used to establish other programs. A&quot;four-I&quot; configuration of interests, information, involvement,  and implementation was followed in developing, planning, and operating the project. Components included the process dimension, whose concern was modifying the existing curriculum to fit career education objectives, and the planning dimension, concerned with developing a system of participatory management. The staffs of four junior high schools were involved in the project as were top level school administrators, parents, students, and persons from the business and industrial community.

During the first two weeks, the teams were exposed to group experiences in six discipline areas, which were designed to demonstrate techniques suitable for use in the school setting, while the final weeks were devoted to extended periods of team planning and writing. Results from administration of a pre- and post-evaluation  instrument directed toward attitudes and professional concerns revealed that: (1) Home economics teachers were the most similar in perception to the test builder and/or more receptive to attitude change, (2) The counselor group maintained high key selection behavior but showed less change in post response than did mathematics teachers and teachers of other content areas, and (3) All groups re-ordered their professional concerns between pre- and post-tests. Workshop evaluation by the participants revealed a wide variance within the five discipline areas, with industrial arts teachers showing the least disparity within their group. (SB)",

Chapter III analyzes the possible need for Federal subsidies, pointing out the short-term nature of the problem and the long-term effects of Federal solutions. It also discusses the maldistribution in the supply of medical manpower by geographical area and among specialties. Ways of increasing the productivity of present supply through more efficient utilization are outlined in  Chapter IV, while Chapter V questions the priority placed on manpower supply in the struggle to upgrade the level of national health and suggests alternative courses of action.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine if the fiscal year 1972 funding of vocational and technical education by the Illinois Division of Vocational and Technical Education had changed from the inefficient funding patterns previously investigated for fiscal year 1971. The conclusions of the 1971 study were that the funding was not economically efficient and that it tended to place little emphasis on the needs variables such as assessed valuation, school dropouts rates, unemployment rates, aid to dependent children payments, and income levels. Further, the funding formula seemed to discriminate in favor of Chicago suburban schools with higher income levels and against schools in lower income districts throughout the State. The findings of the 1972 fiscal year study were that  the funding formula was still economically inefficient in that, given a choice between two programs promising the same manpower benefits, it would fund the more expensive program thereby spending more money than needed. The 1972 funding patterns was slightly more attentive to need factors but still funded disproportionately those districts with high income levels. It was recommended that consideration be given to alternative funding methods such as performance contracting, discretionary contracting, the use of private proprietary schools, and funding on a regional or area basis.

To obtain an accurate description of the home economics program, questionnaires were developed which sought information concerning the professional preparation and experiences of the teachers, the principal's views of the program, and the consumer and homemaking projects, occupational education projects, and programs for special learners. Findings from the survey revealed that: (1) The Wisconsin home economics program consists of 11 identifiable content areas, (2) Teachers tended to rely on commercial and non-commercial pamphlets  and brochures, filmstrips, periodicals, films, and transparencies as main resources for the department, (3) The consumer concept whether taught as a separate unit or integrated was receiving attention at beginning, intermediate, and advanced course levels, (4) No specific home economics programs were identified as being specifically for economically disadvantaged students, and (5) According to the principals, the direction for home economics over the next three years should be in the areas of consumer education, career opportunities, and family living.

This is, in part, secondary to the dearth and maldistribution of primary care physicians and the ineffective utilization of existing health manpower to deliver primary care. Physician's assistants and the expanded role of nurses in patient care as nurse associates are two answers to this dilemma. There are now over 82 programs at various stages of development which involve these manpower categories, with 70 percent of these programs designed to train primary care personnel. Five national professional organizations have established guidelines for the training of physician's assistants or nurse associates, and efforts are under way on a national scale to standardize programs by  accreditation and to certify graduates. The Federal expenditure for physicians assistant and nurse associate programs is large in relation to all categories of allied health personnel, and it is increasing. Several medical-legal problems are under study and are being resolved. There is much positive data about the acceptance of physician's assistants and nurse associates by physicians and patients and about the effect assistants and associates have on productivity of health systems and quality of health services.

Composing the sample for this part of the longitudinal study were 362 girls enrolled in one of Altoona Senior High School's five curriculums. Data were collected when the students were enrolled in the ninth grade and again at the end of the tenth grade. Nine ability measures and seven occupational values which were selected by Kapes in a study carried out as an earlier part of the longitudinal were used as the variables in this study. Verbal and numerical aptitudes, attitudes toward salary, vocational maturity, and father's education were found to be significant  predictors of grade point averages in the academic curriculum while verbal and numerical aptitudes, interest and satisfaction, and vocational maturity were predictors of the vocational grade point average. A review of related literature focused on career development theory as well as on the previous eight studies in this ongoing research, the Vocational Development Study, a 10-year project from three Pennsylvania school systems.

Approximately 5,000 persons in Minnesota who had some professional responsibility for vocational and practical arts education were surveyed as potential resource personnel. Findings indicated that 894 persons of various competency levels were interested in ongoing in research activities. The other two studies were designed to identify research priorities in Minnesota through two statewide surveys. The first  attempted to classify and rank order problem areas. The second was conducted one year later to determine whether various groups of practitioners differed with respect to their research priorities. It was found that respondents classified by educational employment and responsibility did not differ significantly but that those interested in research did have different priorities than persons without previous expressed research interests. It was concluded that a composite list of research priorities based on a large number of practitioner responses may be developed for a State. (MF)",

The document includes a summary of the group sessions reports and participants' evaluation of the  conference. The evaluation forms, conference participants and consultants, daily agenda, and supportive materials are appended. It was recommended that a series of workshops be held on curriculum modifications and that a center be established for the collection and dissemination of materials related to a sequential curriculum in allied health occupations. The conference proceedings and presentations will be issued separately. (MF)",

Contained in this report are brief summaries of Federal programs that provide different kinds of work experience in two basic settings (school-based and non-school based environments) and a review of research found to be most frequently funded by  agencies in the area of work. Some research areas identified as a result of the review and analysis include: (1) studying local and national job needs and developing a job creation strategy to meet these needs, (2) determining the effects and efficiency of changing some of the present legislation which restrict the employment of youth under age 18, (3) developing appropriate models for communication and cooperation between schools, employers, unions, and community agencies, and (4) developing effective techniques for career guidance counselors.

        "description":"Manpower training and upgrading programs have negative secondary effects upon regular employees. A review of the literature and empirical research on these negative effects indicated that no model has yet been devised and tested to measure these negative effects. This paper suggests a preliminary model for the evaluation of the disruptive effects of occupational upgrading programs on occupational mobility patterns in a trade union environment. From the proposed model, it was hypothesized that initiation, implementation, and successful administration of occupational upgrading systems: (1) are facilitated by a nonunion environment, (2) require a negotiated approach in a union environment, (3) are better received by a union in both rapidly expanding and rapidly declining industries,  (4) are not affected by the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the mobility clusters in the internal labor market but rather by the size regardless of distribution, and (5) require application to all workers in a union environment, not just selected groups. A simple empirical testing of several of the hypotheses proved inconclusive, but results from earlier studies and past experiences are used to suggest policies, policy perspectives, and avenues for further research.

        "description":"We cannot afford to continue letting 2.5 million young people leave formal education each year without a marketable skill or a career goal. Career education will take time and money, talent and commitment. While the Federal government can provide seed money for innovation and reform, the real thrust and the real money to implement career education must come from State and local commitment and resources. Education's success or failure in making career education an integral and worthwhile part of the learning process is some years away. The true test will come when the 62 million students in our elementary and secondary schools complete their formal education and start looking for jobs. By the end of the 1970's only one-fifth of the jobs will require a 4-year college degree. But  most of these jobs will require training beyond high school. Blue collar jobs as we have known them are fast disappearing. Expanded instructional programs for career clusters are now being developed. More than 750,000 children are now participating in more than 100 career education pilot projects. Many State and local school districts are funding career education projects on their own initiatives. So it is clear that career education is indeed alive and well, both in the Office of Education and in the State and local communities. A related document is available as ED 073 307. (Author/MF)",

        "description":"This report describes a program of extension classes which enrolled 164 teachers, administrators, and counselors from Wisconsin schools for a University of Wisconsin graduate extension course. Professional advancement and assistance in developing career educational programs were the primary objectives of most of the enrollees. During the fall semester the course was taught using the Educational Telephone Network (ETN) statewide facilities with interface sessions which brought several local ETN groups together for the ETN class presentation and discussion throughout the semester. In rating the course, nearly half the students evaluated it as equal to or better than the traditionally taught extension courses. The quality of work the students accomplished appeared to be excellent  and objective examinations indicated a good overall level of achievement. The career education opinionnaire, administered twice to all enrollees, indicated significant favorable shifts of attitudes toward, and knowledge of career education as well as better understanding of their roles in its programs. Recommendations based on these data were made that the ETN facilities be used throughout the State and be improved qualitatively and quantitatively for that purpose, and that local group leaders be provided with special training to enhance their effectiveness.

        "description":"The paper discusses various models and theories of personal income distribution inequality. The first section presents the logic for adopting one conceptual and statistical approach in measuring and analyzing income inequality and the second presents empirical evidence on income inequality from 1939 to 1970. A brief survey of the human capital literature and a resume of long-term trends in personal income distribution round out the paper. Although cyclical behavior of income inequality has been linked to aggregate indices of demand, economic explanations of this change are unsatisfactory. The most promising theoretical start is the human capital earnings distribution model, but it does not cope adequately with the complexity of the process underlying observed time allocation and  annual income inequality. A reappraisal of our progress toward equalizing economic opportunities may be warranted. Variation in annual earnings inequality arises from the interaction of supply and demand factors that affect both the personal allocation of time to market activity and wage rates as influenced by life cycle human capital investments. An integrated explanation of this process does not now exist, although the conceptual and econometric framework for it is beginning to emerge. (MF)",

Data on total employees in twelve job categories are presented according to service, ownership, size, and location of the nursing home. Availability and quality of care in the nursing homes were assessed by examining: (1) the ratio of full-time equivalent employees per 100 residents, (2) the ratio of full-time equivalent nurses per 100 residents, and (3) the skill level of the charge nurse on duty for each shift. The survey revealed that 553,879 persons were employed in 1968 and that 75 percent were employed full time. For every 10 employees, six were members of the nursing staff, three were members of the  nonprofessional staff, and one was a member of the other professional and technical staff. An average of 68 employees provided services for every 100 residents. Other findings indicated that: (1) The nursing staff comprised the largest portion of employees, (2) As the level of education and training of the nursing staff increased from nurse's aide to licensed practical nurse to registered nurse, the percent of each group employed decreased, and (3) As the level of service increased, the percent of nursing staff increased while the percent of nonprofessional staff decreased.

Almost one-third of the master barbers are more than 60 years of age. A desire for  cosmetology training, in addition to barbering, was expressed by 83.5 percent of the respondents. Need for specialized training to update skills was strongly emphasized to improve barber status.

Through the Consortium of States, the network of area test centers will provide evaluative services essential to the selection of competent teachers and thus improve vocational  education and manpower training programs. Phase I of the project resulted in the organization of a Consortium of States, the preparation of a handbook for developing occupational competency tests, and pilot testing of 24 areas. Phase II developed additional tests and set up scoring techniques and training programs. In Phase III more tests in additional occupational areas were developed, field testing was expanded, and the National Occupational Competency Institute was established.

        "description":"To determine changes in the perceptions of associate degree students in regard to their chosen occupational programs both upon their entrance into the technology programs and at the time of their graduation, questionnaires were administered in September 1970 to the 99 male freshmen in the 2-year engineering technology program. In April, 1972, the same questionnaire was readministered to the 27 of the original class who were still in school. Perceptions held by students at the beginning of their study were: (1) They were preparing to become engineering technicians, (2) The most creative occupations were product design and science occupations, (3) Occupations providing the most tangible results were building contractor, physician, and lawyer, (4) Jobs seen as negative were  bartending, plumbing, army officers of corporal rank, service stations attending, and police duty, and (5) The most structured jobs were either military or law enforcement oriented. Although the high non-program completion rate complicated the examination to some degree, it was clear that differences considered in this study were found to be insignificant for most of the 35 occupations studied. Many charts and tables depict the findings. (Author/SN)",

Data were collected using two questionnaires. One questionnaire, which was completed by each school's vocational education director, sought information about certification, length of tenure, teaching, counseling, administrative, and service responsibilities, while the second questionnaire, which was completed by teachers, counselors, and directors, yielded information on educational  background, occupational experience, education and guidance courses, and needs and difficulties encountered in acquiring additional credit in occupational experience. Usable return from 339 of the 359 respondents revealed that (1) Traditional salary schedules were not constructed to reward productivity, (2) Occupational experience was viewed by administrators as being extremely important for an occupational teacher, (3) There was a trend for the high school to look to the area vocational center to assume much of the responsibility of providing occupational training, and (4) The vocational education personnel were mainly interested in vocational guidance, curriculum building, and technical courses.

Results of the study indicate courses with a low manpower priority will be  curtailed or de-emphasized. The courses expanded by the State priorities are those with some manpower need and relatively high cost. The funding for high-cost courses will cause these courses to proliferate, and as they do, the funding available to lower costing, equal manpower need, and more efficient courses will decline. The course areas with high manpower need should be expanded, with lower cost courses receiving the greater level of funding. Utilization of the alternative priorities would achieve the same goals as the state priorities at a considerably lower cost. (SB)",

Both the view of the private individual and the view of society are taken. The results indicate that occupational-vocational training is: (1) a profitable investment for the typical student, given his or her usual alternatives, (2) a profitable investment for society, particularly when compared to conventional college transfer programs in community colleges, and (3) apparently less profitable an investment in Illinois than nationwide. The term &quot;profitable&quot; investment as used here means that the rate of return on whatever money and resources  that have been invested is greater than the rate of return that is realized on typical investments elsewhere in education and in society, e.g., the rate of return on college education or the rate of return on a corporate bond.

Forty percent of the group surveyed indicated that they spent 25 percent or more of their time on RDDE activities.

The objectives of law education, described in Section I, include developing analytical skills, moral and ethical values, and an appreciation of the legal process; teaching information about law; and encouraging responsible political participation. YEFC, as described in Section II, facilitates and encourages programs and projects, generates materials, and supports research. Current YEFC projects and publications noted in this section are the results of these objectives and policies. Twelve representative law-oriented  projects of the 200 throughout the country are described in Section III. Section IV lists teacher training programs for law education. Section V updates information (Working Notes, #1) to Bar Associations on the role they can play to support law education programs. ED 073 978 is a related document. (JH)",

A second objective is to find out what patterns of behavior make a difference in the performance of others and under what circumstances such connections between leader behavior and the behavior of others occurs. The literature is reviewed in terms of a network of forces, or of independent conditioning and dependent variables, with student learning considered as the major output or dependent variable. A heuristic model of this network is diagrammed and discussed in the  introduction. The literature review is organized into sections on the role of the leader, leader behaviors and characteristics which have impact on others, and conditions affecting leader behavior and its consequences.

The three reliability coefficients refer to differences among students, classrooms, and tests. The SLC model is based on social environment levels (the Self, the Home and Family, the Neighborhood, and the Community). The SLC Survey Test is an experimental set of test items developed in an effort to tap samples of the conceptual skills contained in each of the 11 phases of the Self level. For this study, five phase tests were randomly  selected and administered to ten randomly selected students from two samples of EMR primary classrooms and, in the analysis of data provided, three reliability coefficients derived. A discussion of the over-all findings suggests that the test measures are not adequate for their purposes at their present level of development. References and tables are included.

        "description":"Hypothesizing that the dimensions of developmental problems faced by the moderately retarded will be analogous to those faced by the mildly retarded, this study considers the appropriateness of the structure of the Social Learning Curriculum (SLC), originally developed for the mildly retarded, for the moderately retarded. The SLC framework identifies twelve needs areas, and provides each with a pedagogical counterpart in the curriculum. The procedure for this study consisted of three steps: compiling a mailing list; designing a questionnaire; and sorting responses. The open-ended questionnaire probed five general areas: psychological and emotional behavior; social and interpersonal relations; motor skills; personal maintenance; and work, academic, and home skills. Copies were  sent to individuals directly involved in programming for moderately retarded adults in each state. A summary of the findings concludes that the major hypothesis of the study is upheld and points out four new areas of need. Information from questionnaire returns is presented in tabular form.

In light of this philosophy, the development of the Social Learning Curriculum for the educable mentally retarded was approached by drawing upon the knowledge of a sociologist. The purpose of this paper is to acquaint teachers with the types, numbers, customs, and patterns of families found in America, providing a basic orientation to the family situations which influence children. The first and lengthiest section of this literature and research review concerns the social  factors in the family life and exceptional children. Factors discussed include the extent and identification of retardation, family reaction to the retarded child, effects of family attitudes and reactions, extended family contacts and sibling relationships, and community reactions. Other sections elaborate the topics of the family as process and community; the family and social class, economy, social role, socialization process, and education; and alternative family structures and processes.

The enigma facing man, that man must study man, is related in an introduction. Freud's, Adler's, and Jung's developments in the study of the nature of man are examined. Their studies, it is concluded, cumulatively describe three dimensions of man, the biologic-psychologic, the sociologic, and the earthologic. A fourth dimension, the universologic, is noted as yet undeveloped. In a final three page section, the application of these dimensions of the study of man to education is considered. A general overemphasis in education on technology, science, materialsm, and empirism, to the debt of the  humanities, arts, philosophy, and religion, is noted. To study man and his nature in an infinite and eternal context, an emphasis on ideas is suggested. These ideas, or key concepts, it is proposed, must be analyzed, synthesized, examined, and integrated to reveal the microscopic, macroscopic, cosmic, and universologic dimensions of all of man's history.

The task proposes to demonstrate that the presence of psychological assistants, in this case seven female college graduates, increases the effectiveness and productivity of the clinical psychologists to whom they are assigned in varying positions in clinical service and research. Background information on manpower status in psychology and allied professions introduces the report. Requirement and selection of participants are described. The assistants are trained by a combination of methods, described and evaluated in Part IV, the most important appearing to be the apprenticeship on the setting. Contributions of the assistant in each setting are  presented with a composite description of an assistant's duties. Placement of the assistants at the end of the project is dealt with in relation to initial expectations and changing attitudes as the program progresses. Alternate models deriving from the experiences of the project suggest improvement for the future. It is felt that the assistants become an integral part of the clinical operation and that the project had meaning for other mental health professions. (KSM)",

        "description":"The focus of this paper is on curriculum praxis, or the reflective transaction of curriculum decisions one makes and acts upon, and from which value judgements may be located, clarified, and inferred. The major topic is how values and value judgements relate to curriculum praxis and how they relate to other curriculum decision-making systems. A first model demonstrates that reflective transaction is made in terms of a set of ideas, beliefs, and concepts which are part of our explicit knowledge framework. This is contrasted to two other models which see values as rationally known entities which can be utilized as a part of an overall decision-making process. The author proposes that value jdugements may be rationally known but that the underlying values can only be known through  reflective transaction. It is suggested that one way of locating areas within which decisions are made that reflect the values we hold is to look at fundamental human interests and basic curriculum referents. A grid created for this purpose locates value positions and serves as a basis for clarifying values. A final comment proposes to think of values that are attached to planning outcomes in order to clarify value judgments and to reach the value base which underlies and pervades praxis. (Author/KSM)",

The study, conducted by the Center for Economic Education, Purdue University, was part of a kindergarten through grade twelve assessment of the treatment of economics in social studies textual materials made under the direction of the Joint Council on Economic Education. The primary purpose of the project was to provide information that might lead to an improvement in social studies texts. A committee of economists and economic professors selected and analyzed a sampling of textbooks published after 1967 in the following categories: government (including civics), problems of democracy, geography, anthropology, and sociology. High school  economics and history textbooks were not examined by this center. Content criteria used were those recommended by the Task Force Report. Major findings indicated that the ability to both identify an economic problem and to analyze economic issues will not be instilled by the materials. Economics was not treated systematically; errors of fact, out-of date information, and misapplication of economic concepts were found. Related documents are SO 006 759, SO 006 760, SO 006 762.

        "description":"By addressing the areas of feelings and value judgements the goals of a relationship between behaviorists and teachers can be clarified. The term \"behavior modification\" elicits negative emotional responses. Perhaps behaviorists should accept responsibility for the negativism and use a term such as Ogden Lindsley's \"precision teaching.\" The term \"self image\" also elicits prejudicial responses; yet its aptness for explaining behavioral phenomenon, as in the instance where children improved their spelling ability during a treatment period and continued to improve after treatment ceased, predicates its existence in behavioral vocabulary. Value judgments are inherent in establishing behavioral targets and in identifying techniques to attain them. It is possible to choose the  teacher's values, not the behaviorist's, and still apply behavior analysis in assessing goal attainment. A teacher applied our technique to his goal, but since values differed, attainment of the goal was not satisfying for the teacher because the technique was not acceptable to his value system. Values are the basic qualifiers of techniques and goals, but emotional response is a shaper of those values. (JH)",

The course, part of an articulated curriculum for grades K-12, is analytical in nature, and designed to teach attitudes and skills as well as generalizations and concepts. Emphasizing the inquiry approach to teaching, the course is divided into the following six parts: 1) the Colonial Age, 1630-1760; 2) the Republican Age, 1760-1820; 3) the Democratic Age, 1820-1840; 4) Civil War and Reconstruction, 1840-1870; 5) Industrialization of America, 1840-1914; and 6) the Consumption Economy, 1920 to present. No attempt is made to develop a complete set of materials for students. The resource units use as  many materials from other sources as possible, supplementing these materials with a few developed by the Center. Goals, teaching strategies, and a general outline of the course are provided in the first section of the guide. The second section, which comprises the major portion of the guide, consists of charts showing the sequential development of skills, attitudes, and generalizations in each of the units.

Assuming that secondary schools isolate and compartmentalize knowledge, that history dominates the social studies/social sciences to the detriment of the field, that anthropology incorporates specialists from many disciplines to solve specialized problems, then, anthropology appears as a natural &quot;core&quot; and opportunity for reorganization of the social studies curriculum. During the 60's many anthropologists became concerned about education and worked to develop curriculum materials. Anthropology answers the felt need for interdisciplinary education; moreover, the anthropologist's approach to studying cultural systems might be usefully applied to pedagogical  problems. Anthropology, open to numerous levels of intellectual attack, is not a panecea for curriculum problems; it is a controversial discipline for which qualified teachers and adequate instructional materials are still lacking. Nevertheless, as a core for social studies curriculum it can facilitate activity learning, allow for instruction of social sciences methodology within its specific framework, and integrate the social sciences.

One hundred and four school children from inner city, urban fringe, and suburban schools, grades K-6, were administered a Test of Coordination of Perspectives and a Test of Map Conceptualization. The first employed a three-dimensional model of buildings, trees, and streets with a doll as a movable, outside point of perspective; the second required a child to draw a map of a model village similar to that in the first test. Findings on the Perspectives Test follow those of Piaget and Inhelder, 1963, in which three developmental stages are evident. The Map Conceptualization Test indicates that there are three stages of  development with distinct subgroups of progress. Analysis indicates that performance on the two tests was related and that socioeconomic status and race are variables that coordinate significantly with test results. Prior experience and training appear to have effected conceptualization, suggesting the usefulness of curricular sequences based on developmental stages to build map skills. (JH)",

Jean Piaget's stages of development and studies conducted by other investigators (Jahoda, 1964; Stoltman, 1971; Rand and Towler, 1973; Flavell, 1963; Asher, et al, 1971; Kofsky, 1966) on geographic relationships and classification provide a comparative framework. One hundred and twenty students from two Indiana schools were administered a Geographical Stages Test and a Logical Thinking Test. Analysis of the test results indicate that Piaget's spatial stages do not adequately describe the sample of children, although the correlation between the tests is significant, as Piaget postulates, and that age is the  only significant variable among the possibilities of age, sex, socioeconomic status and residence. By implication teachers should make allowances for the varying competence of students, provide practice in classification and inclusion, and provide verbal and spatial experiences in the classroom to reinforce understanding.

The purpose of the guide is to provide a strong, varied, sequential program that meets student needs. Through a variety of suggested activities such as creating certain art forms, using colors, taking field trips, comparing artists, examining art works, and conducting class discussion the student learns about art concepts. He demonstrates that he has acquired the concepts by performing to meet objectives stated in the guide. Levels K through seven, and eight through twelve constitute the two major divisions of the guide. The concepts, performance objectives, and suggested activities for levels K through seven  are organized in terms of art elements (line, shape, color, texture, and form), each of which is treated separately. The organization for levels eight through twelve is established by different art areas (drawing, painting, sculpture, graphics, and crafts). A bibliography of recommended books, films, and filmstrips is provided. (Author/RM)",

Over a four month period, a glass workshop was planned to emphasize the creative possibilities of glass and information packets were developed to train teachers to conduct classroom art projects using glass. The evaluation report presents statistical information, a project description, project activities, a narrative report and written evaluations. The information packet explains the use of the kiln in firing the glass and describes fifteen projects or techniques using glass or plexiglass. The materials needed, procedures, and suggested grade level are indicated for each technique. Some of the projects include glass  collage; fusing glass into glass blanks; fracturing; frosting; glass staining; stained glasswindow; polymosaic tile; and broken glass mosaic. Evaluations of the project are favorable. Most participating teachers indicate plans to include glass in their future art programs. (Author/KSM)",

At the same time national interest in precollege psychology was evident in the activities of the American Psychological Association and other groups. In spring, 1973, an Ohio survey of teacher training in psychology elicited thirty-one responses from fifty-eight likely institutions, sixteen of which indicated active training programs. The data profile included the following facts. Though small, the majority of programs were preparing both majors and minors in psychology. Of the required subjects, the majority included statistics and testing, reinforcing a scientific orientation to psychology. Difficulty in student teaching arrangements  did arise from scarcity of full-time psychology teachers, but teacher placement was no more difficult than normal. The only disconcerting data collected was that the number of hours required for a major in psychology was marginal, considering the accumulated implications of upgraded standards. (JH)",

Project objectives were to suggest parameters for consumer education programs, to illustrate effective teaching techniques, to identify other resources, and to demonstrate techniques for incorporating materials into existing programs. Two kinds of procedures were followed simultaneously, one field-oriented and the other, the more successful, based at CEMP headquarters, using conferences, questionnaires, and telephone interviews to identify programs. The results of the project were six case studies of consumer education at different levels: early childhood; elementary;  secondary; junior and community colleges; teacher education; and adult consumer education. Concluding remarks noted four common problems. The greatest shortcoming was found to be the absence of classroom-tested materials for student use. The CEMP staff recommended promotional efforts, workshops for educators, and development of student materials. Appendices contain the case study forms, questions on teacher education programs, evaluation sheets, and extracts from the interim report. Related documents are SO 006 860-865. (Author/KSM)",

Two units from this project on India and on changing neighborhoods were observed in two different settings in fourth and fifth grade classrooms. In the settings, an initial set of questions guided the collection and analysis of data. Common characteristics of lessons in both settings helped to suggest categories for reporting the results of the study. Some examples of the data analysis include concepts and  hypotheses relating instructional strategies and the reviewing, clarifying, and justifying of arguments. Implications of the study include further development of instructional theory, aiding the teacher in making judgements about teaching behaviors, and recognizing the importance of naturalistic field observation as a methodological tool for theory building.

The method used is called Partnership in Research. It breaks with the traditional research model by involving the subjects as partners and participant researchers in an attempt at self study. The students studied drug use at their school, utilizing research methods to objectively appraise the problems which drugs pose to them and their peers. This paper discusses the role of science in the struggle for social survival, noting that traditional scientific models are inadequate for social science research, that much research is irrelevant and lacks utility, is narrow and simplistic in focus, and has  little practical effect on social problem solving. The student's efforts as described demonstrate that high school students can develop and apply highly relevant questions and issues regarding their own interests and development. Findings from the student's study are listed and possibilities for further use of this model are examined. An appendix contains a drug group questionnaire. (Author/KSM)",

The first plan consists of a three-credit course in school and parent-community involvement for teachers and administrators. Overall course requirements for participants and topics covered in the course are detailed. The second plan is for a workshop over two or three in-service days and the third  for a one-day in-service workshop. The document concludes with a list of their available publications. (DDO)",

Elementary schools provided learning centers (resource rooms) and a teacher-training room, in rooms previously designed as self-contained special education units. Temple prepared special education personnel in these innovative resource rooms, while the children become eligible for pinpointed educational intervention in regular classes. Evaluation of the resource room program indicated increased student achievement in reading and  arithmetic. The students expressed favorable attitudes towards the program in interviews. The primary means of evaluating the teacher training program involved obtaining the judgments and reactions of students concerning their experiences and activities. (Author/JA)",

Administrators, principals, and school officials are all experiencing this need for improving teacher evaluation. Because of collective bargaining, the teachers themselves are voicing their opinions on the need for change. The replacement of the existing subjective evaluation methods for both probationary and tenured teachers is the only recourse left for the improvement of our school systems. Some suggestions for revision of these evaluation methods include a) improvement of preservice teacher preparation programs with the emphasis on performance rating and field  experience, b) greater involvement of experienced teachers in teacher education programs, c) refinement of teacher selection procedures through follow-up studies prepared by the school systems, and d) revision of certification and licensing exams to provide more objective tests for selection.

The primary purpose of the projects is to train youth and adult leaders, or those with the potential to be leaders, to improve the quality of relationships between people, expand the tolerance for racial and cultural differences, and provide new approaches for anticipating, preventing, and solving problems of desegregation. The secondary purpose is the structuring of a laboratory-type experience for selected masters--level graduate students on leave from their  public school posts. As Project Coordinators, they interpret theory, enhance and apply leadership skills in planning, programming, directing, coordinating, evaluating and reporting. This is accomplished under direct professional university supervision. The campus-based, laboratory-type seminars provide for 250 youth (grades 7-12) and 100 adult participants from the school system, selected community agencies and civic groups. Sixteen graduate students participate in this practice-centered, performance-based approach to multicultural learning. (Author/JA)",

Teachers demonstrate their competencies with specific skills, which include the following: motivating and reinforcing students, producing instructional materials, and personalizing instruction. All  competencies are completed on-site with the assistance of clinical professors. Two supportive elements of this pilot program are a) using volunteers to tutor children in math and reading skills and to produce instructional materials for individualizing instruction and b) providing effective in-service training for other teachers interested in individualizing instruction, with emphasis on demonstrations and instructional material production.

In reference to the student teacher/supervising teacher relationship, research indicates that the development of communication skills, cultural value systems, professional attitudes and self concept are significant elements in its success or failure. By integrating these factors into a developmental sequence, a three dimensional model for determining the various behavioral competencies needed for supervising teachers evolves. This model indicates that it is essential for the beginning student teacher/supervising teacher relationship for the supervisor to indicate through attitude and verbal commitment to the students in the class and the  student teacher that the status of the latter is as a partner in the classroom instructional process. Having decided that this behavior is essential to the success of the student teaching experience, one must construct within the simulation the strategies to achieve it and the means to assess behavior at the program's exit point. Upon completion of simulation inservice training, supervising teachers will be able to perform various essential competencies with proficiency but not in an isolated environment. (JA)",

Seven instruments were developed by the evaluation team, and seven were standardized tests. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed no significant changes in the three dependent variables: knowledge, attitude, and personality. The  independent variables were workshop participants vs. nonworkshop participants, urban vs. rural and elementary vs. secondary school participants, and level of sex education of the students. Analysis revealed no significant differences between urban and rural teachers and no differences between elementary and secondary school teachers. However, trained teachers perceived changes in themselves, their schools, their colleagues, and their students, which were attributable to participation in the workshops.

Phase I discovered an indication of different personality traits in elementary and secondary teachers. Phase II redesigned the original questionnaire and supported the findings with additional research. This third phase continued the research and again redesigned the questionnaire. Results indicate that the typical elementary school teacher is female, older than the secondary school teacher, likely to feel that academic logic and emotion are equally important in teaching, is more child oriented, gets more satisfaction from the job itself rather than from extrinsics, feels that the physical aspects of the classroom are as important as the curriculu, and is  less likely to favor professional unions. It is probable, however, that with the dawn of teacher militancy, more males entering the elementary school, better salaries, and women's liberation, the profile of the elementary teacher will change. Results of Phase III also indicate that the middle school teacher does not fit into the pattern set by either the elementary or secondary teacher.

Although in its purest concept informal education rejects the use of tests in the classroom, some informal educators justify the use of tests for judging the achievement of program objectives. Tests, however,  should never go against one of the primary attributes of informal education, which is its humaneness: tests should not inspire fear or teacher tyranny or be used for educational politics. Teachers must avoid misinterpreting, misusing, and misunderstanding testing procedures.

The author feels that although childhood is a critical time for the development of leadership qualities, the developmental process is lifelong and does not end with adolescence. Therefore, to raise the leadership potential in society we must work toward enhancing the context in which a child becomes of age and also look to the conditions under which the adult life proceeds. Education for leadership at any level means an education in which life is not just learned about but is fully experienced, closely examined, and deeply felt. The author makes several suggestions for accomplishing this education for leadership. (DDO)",

Part I deals with fundamental priorities, type, size, and site. The quality of water, installation specifications, and facility supervision are covered as minimum health requirements. The minimum safety requirements for the facilities are presented in relation to design, construction, staffing, lifesaving, and available first aid. Part II comprises three specific studies on outdoor, indoor, and combined pools. Some general aspects of the problem of providing low-cost outdoor swimming pools and specific  cost reduction measures are highlighted in the first article from the Netherlands. The second article on indoor swimming pools presents a definition and breakdown of building costs, an analysis of trade branches, and six photographs showing low-cost indoor pools. The third article explains the uses of a combined pool and the general principles for planning and building one. The appendixes include a list of participants, the program outline for CCC, and the coefficients expressing the recommended ratio between the size of population and the water surface area of swimming pools.

The training program consisted of workshops and conferences with an emphasis on organizing and administering a continuous individual progress curriculum. Following the second year of the project, the PTE and the Purdue  Teacher Opinionnaire (PTO) were administered to the 22 participants. Results showed that teacher morale, as measured by the PTO, improved for 11 teachers, remained unchanged for 8, and dropped for three. The PTE results showed an improvement in ratings for 6 teachers and a drop in rating for 15. Data from the 104 students who were given the Iowa Tests in the sixth and eighth grades showed that 36 gained less than the norm group, 7 gained at the same rate, and 61 gained more than the norm.

This failure is due in part to the academic reward structure and in part to a general disdain for the pedagogical concerns of the schools of education. The impression held by graduate schools that there is nothing to learn about college-level teaching needs to be replaced by an apprentice teaching program. A credit course on teaching methods requisite to the completion of any Ph.D. should be made a part of the graduate curriculum. This would be coordinated with the appointment of graduate teaching assistants and fellows, so that the theoretical phase is encountered prior to assuming teaching duties and the applied phase is concurrent with those  duties. Systematic evaluation of the applied phase should be provided. The success of such a proposal, however, depends primarily on the faculty's commitment to it. (Author/CCM)",

However, the teacher center, as it focuses on methods and resource organization, is found to be a useful renewal tool. The authors critique four alternative models of the teacher center: the British model; a centralized bureaucratic model, like the one in Japan; a decentralized model, run by an official board of education agency; and an autonomous model, run by teachers. The latter is found to be the most satisfactory. Basically, it is described as being governed by teachers (with an advisory board from outside the teacher ranks) for teachers and other nonsupervisory  instructional personnel. Operated as a nonprofit corporation, it looks to federal and state funds for permanancy. (LP/JA)",

        "description":"This study a) compared the anxiety levels of three groups of student teachers just prior to and immediately following the student teacher experience and b) ascertained whether or not the concept of student teaching changed in pleasantness during the teaching experience. Two groups of students (N=36, N=15) were instructed through traditional teacher education methods courses while one group (N=11) was taught by performance-oriented methods courses. All groups were administered a semantic differential test having \"pleasant\" at one end and \"unpleasant\" at the other end. Results show that a) prior to student teaching, the performance-oriented group viewed the concept with less pleasantness than the other two groups, although not significantly; b) all groups were equally relieved to  have completed student teaching; c) the feeling toward the completed student teaching experience was uniform for all groups; and d) the performance-oriented group showed a large gain on the mean score of pleasantness during the student teaching experience.

The innovative practices are in three categories: a) differentiated staffing--horizontal and vertical; b) technology-dependent innovations; and c) open learning plans. Among the conclusions drawn by the author are that a) reducing teacher/pupil ratio is neither the most effective nor the most economic method of increasing productivity; b) the incorporation of innovations into schools often causes unexpected changes in the goals of the innovator; c) many programmatic innovations are the first steps toward more effective staff utilization; d) when innovations are introduced, there is a tendency to hire new personnel rather than retrain  the existing staff; and e) innovations tend to increase the number and complexity of instructional decisions on the part of teachers. The report suggests some implications for staff utilization policy and maintains that the most expeditious way of increasing productivity is to increase teacher effectiveness through the use of noncertified staff, improved middle-management concepts, and the use of instructional technology.

Through a review of the literature and interviews with circle leaders, Phase I investigates what knowledge exists on study circles. Phase II presents information on the educational psychology of the study circle gathered through questionnaires, interviews, and participant observations. Phase III analyzes how the study circle differs from group work in adult education. This analysis is achieved through evaluation of studies in progress. Phases IV and V deal with impediments to study circles and the role of course material in implementing these circles. Follow-up studies, analysis, and evaluation of course material are methodologies used in these phases. To ascertain what training  information a circle leader needs, phase VI uses questionnaires and interviews and experiments with different forms of guidance. Through summaries of experience gained in study circles, phase VII investigates how the study circle activities are to be evaluated. Interim reports will be issued as the project proceeds. (BRB)",

        "description":"This paper analyzes the writings and character of Confucius from the perspective of his title of the &quot;First Teacher.&quot; Confucius functioned as a scholar who, in a time of political chaos, attempted to glean from the past those principles and attitudes capable both of serving the social order well and of enduring. To achieve peaceful reform, Confucius designated as the specific objective of education &quot;Chun Tzu&quot; or the Superior Man who, with the effectiveness of his moral example, would cause the people to be good. Two aspects of Confucius's thought that should be understood are that a) nature is basically good but unguided human nature has lost the way, and it is therefore necessary to restore the original condition by finding the Path of Duty and the System of Instruction of the  past and to teach and apply them to the present; and b) human society is hierarchically constructed into classes of mental and menial workers and it is to the former that education is brought. Confucius's curriculum was constructed around the principle of &quot;Li&quot; or &quot;the spirit of living&quot; which must be adhered to in internal as well as external action. The curriculum was informal (with textbooks playing a minor role), liberal, and pragmatic in that it prepared a man for a position in government. His methods were informal, involving questions and discussions, learning at one's own pace, and self-evaluation or evaluation by oral questioning. (JA)",

The laboratories were to translate the research results of the R&amp;D centers into products such as books, audiovisual materials, procedures, and organizational structures. After testing and refining the products, they were to make them available to local school systems, generally through commercial publishers. GAO found that a) there was little evidence that products had  significant impact on classrooms; b) completed or substantially developed products generated little publisher interest; and c) management problems, such as frequent changes in Office of Education leadership, have hindered the program. The report recommends that NIE a) require the contractor to state clearly the objective of the product in terms of anticipated, specific educational changes; b) establish evaluation requirements for contractors; c) set standards for follow-up evaluations; d) monitor contractors' evaluation processes; and e) demonstrate the marketability of a proposed product.

Competence in these conceptual and technological skills was assumed to be an integral part in the development of the R&D program. The process phase ensured the application and refinement of the content phase for the public school  setting by implementing three stages: a) inputs or resources, b) activities, and c) outputs or products. A detailed description of the pilot test for the model is included in the report along with data for the model's evaluation and suggestions for refinement.

The goals of the meeting were to a) bring together outstanding educators from all levels of the educational system and b) promote collaboration among persons actively involved in teacher education and those involved in changing the social  system. The appendixes to the conference proceedings present information on the Individually Guided Education Project League, microteaching, ERIC documents on competency-based teacher education and the Multiunit/IGE school, and a clinical workshop in Individually Guided Education.

        "description":"This study of a random national sample of 3,248 teachers in the continental United States and 304 teachers from Hawaii was conducted to find similarities and differences among groups of in-service teachers who were classified according to their self-reported childhood financial status and cultural background. A secondary goal of the study was the comparison of a national sample of teachers with a smaller special sample from Hawaii. The measurement instrument employed in the study was the G-70/2 Teacher Characteristics Schedule, which provides 19 scales regarding teaching behaviors, attitudes, educational viewpoints, cognitive responses, personal and social adjustment, life views, and values. Results show that teachers from an above-average financial and cultural background scored  higher than other groups with regard to imagination, originality, verbal/semantic facility, logic, and insightful judgment. Teachers from below-average financial and cultural backgrounds showed the lowest mean on scales that measured the value of religion, work, and conformance, while teachers from average childhood backgrounds yielded the highest mean on the work and conformance scale. The above-average financial group and the below-average cultural group showed the highest tendency toward innovation, change, and liberalism. (Tables of results with their variances are included.)

Five basic terminal goals are stated: a) the student will develop the necessary motor skills for successful participation in a variety of physical activities; b) 100% of the students in a regular physical education class will achieve over the 30th percentile in all aspects of fitness and 80% will achieve over the 50th percentile in all aspects of fitness based on the national norms; c) the student will gain knowledge and understanding about the fundamental principles and rules of physical activities; d) the student will develop and display self-discipline, responsibility, personal control, and  leadership; and e) the student will acquire the skill and a desire to participate in physical activities. Specific program goals were established for each terminal goal, and these program goals were attained through behavioral objectives at the primary, intermediate, junior, and high school levels. The report emphasizes that the successful implementation of these goals depends upon budget priorities, district personnel support force, and available facilities. (BRB)",

        "description":"This study was conducted at the California State University to determine if the utilization of a carefully planned and systematically applied course of instruction could change the attitudes of graduate special education students toward handicapped persons. The focus of the 16-session course was on the handicapped individual as a person and on the manifestations of disability which could impede learning and social disability. Special education was treated as a science rather than an art. The 3-hour instruction period was divided into a) a one-hour lecture presentation; b) a 30-minute group discussion; and c) a 90-minute small (4 member) group discussion. The attitude measurement instruments used in the study were the Attitude Toward Disabled Persons Scale (ATDP) and the Preferred  Student Characteristic Scale (PSCS), both of which were taken by the students before and after the course. Both male and female students showed improvement on the ATDP scale, but only males showed improvement on PSCS. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that an instructor can effect a positive change in the attitude of his students toward disabled persons through the use of a well-planned, consistently applied program.

As part of a larger project to study teacher needs, an investigation was conducted into teacher attitudes towards their pupils. The area of the investigation contained a number of schools which could be identified as predominantly black, Cuban, or native white and where the teaching staffs had been integrated. A semantic differential scale was constructed in accordance with the work of Osgood, Suci, and Tannenbaum. The scale was administered to a sample of teachers from six schools approximately two years after the desegregation order was carried out. Results  indicated that there was no significant difference in the attitude of teachers toward the three groups of children at either primary or intermediate level. Teachers apparently were able to maintain reasonable objectivity towards the children themselves. (JA)",

Audiovisual-supported modules and project learning experiences in the local community are the principal teaching methods employed. In addition, students participate in a summer Environmental National Encounter Workshop in which they travel from coast to coast as they learn about the total environment. Upon return to campus, students present programs based on their trip experience with community and academic groups and public school  students.

The program provided a Spanish/English bilingual/bicultural curriculum taught by a bilingual staff of Spanish-American heritage. Both Spanish and English were used for instruction in order that pupils might demonstrate grade-level academic achievement in both languages by the end of the sixth grade. In the secondary program, English reading was emphasized as an aid to school achievement; courses were developed which emphasized the Latin-American experience in United States history and contemporary national and community life. From K-12, students learned about the holidays, food, literature, music, and expressions of Spanish-America and the United States.  (Author/NE)",

Students enrolled in these courses provided the ratings. A standard format is used to present item by item responses of the students to the 43 questions in the survey form for each course. The first six questions provide a profile of the class in terms of such student data as years in college, cumulative grade point average, sex, class attendance, major reason for taking the course and age. Responses to the remaining items are given in terms of the number of students selecting each of five positions on a scale: strongly agree, agree, not sure, disagree, strongly disagree. Finally, mean scales scores for each of nine categories derived  by pooling selected items (7 - 43) are given: profitable use of class time, supportive of students, course organization, grading and evaluation, ability to interact with class, oral presentation and mannerisms, knowledge of subject, availability of instructor, and overall student recommendation. The survey form used to collect the data presented in this report is included in the appendix. (RF)",

An additional benefit of this study was the collection of data at the school district level which provided local decision-makers with needs assessment input for program planning. The study was conducted in two stages: (1) an extensive self-administered questionnaire; and (2) a review of the standardized achievement testing program in each of Maryland's local education agencies in order to derive a statewide achievement score for the average student. Over 11,000 respondents from ten  groups--students, school staff, central staff, parents, boards of education, general public, business/industry, elected and appointed officials, state department staff, and postsecondary educators--were involved in the study. The respondent groups were asked questions on goals, processes, and issues, while educators were asked additional questions on educational program needs.

This study was designed to identify the issues and potential measures for assessing the overall impact of the CTW, by determining whether CTW's impact can be caputured within a comprehensive framework despite the diversity of the workshop's activities; the usefulness of existing data for such an assessment was examined. The study found that although each impact may be measurable, no acceptable method currently exists for uniting these separate impacts and thereby reaching  a single statement of CTW's total impact. Thus, the study concluded that a comprehensive assessment of CTW would probably be a fruitless endeavor. The study recommended several independent analyses, including a national survey, a multi-year field study, a special investigation of the effects of Sesame street and other CTW productions, an institutional study, a school-based field study, and a comparative study. Although the information obtained from such studies would not be agreeable into a single statement of CTW's effect, such a new array of evidence would substantially broaden the present understanding of CTW's accomplishments.

In order to do this the empirical implications of axiom systems for measurement are discussed first, relying primarily on Krantz's work, with special emphasis, however, on some similarities and differences between psychological and physical variables. The psychological variable of uncertainty is then examined in this light, and it is concluded that few, if any, current theories are satisfactory when viewed from this perspective, particularly those deriving from the mathematical work in the axiomatic foundations  of probability. This might appear to pose difficulties for applications to real problems of normative decision theory when those applications require numerical probability judgments from individuals. Two possible solutions are discussed briefly. (Author)",

In this research the authors assumed that reliable and valid measurement of consumers' attitudes and beliefs about various aspects of medical care is possible and that more valid evaluation systems could be achieved if consumer perceptions are carefully considered during instrument development. The development and validation of seven experimental scales containing 134 variables (items) was described. The scales were administered to a representative sample of 903 heads of households in southernmost Illinois. These data were factor analyzed. Careful review of orthogonal and oblique rotations resulted in development of 20 perceptual constructs in sex areas (availability-accessibility, convenience, continuite,  financial, humanness, quality). Reliabilities were computed and were high enough to warrant further study of nearly all of the constructs. Definitions of these constructs were offered. Multiple regression analyses predicting to behavioral criteria were used to obtain preliminary estimates of the validity of the constructs. The authors concluded that preliminary findings offer justification for the continued study and usage of the measurements in the evaluation of medical care facilities as well as in the evaluation of medical students and physicians at all levels of training.

As a result, the Interaction-Network instrument was developed. Three elementary schools were used in the study. Two of the schools contained open-area classrooms and these constituted the experimental schools. The third school, which acted as the 'control' situation, employed a more traditional form of classroom instruction. Pupils from Grades 5, 6, and 7 participated. Samples of approximately 20% of the pupils in each grade at all three schools were observed. A  descriptive analysis showed that there were major differences in both pupil-interaction and pupil-movement between the experimental schools and the control school. The role of the teacher was more pronounced in the traditional type school while in the open-area schools there was much more pupil-movement and pupil-interaction. Recommendations were made for the use of the instrument in future research. (Author)",

One junior high school had made major modifications in its environment, the other maintained a more standard approach to education. A second focus was to investigate the relationship between these student's achievement in mathematics and their attitude toward school. At four time periods a multiple time sequence design was employed to investigate the attitudes of students toward the school. Two school attitude scales and a test of mathematics were used. While most correlations between attitudes and math achievement were not significant, the value of using a multiple time sequence was most apparent. Had data been collected at only  two points in time the \"cultural shock\" effect of the Open Flexible school environment would not have been evident. Neither would the continuously divergent perception of students being encouraged to participate in deciding how classes were conducted have been as evident. (Author/MP)",

The Series Test was administered to students in 79 classrooms in five Connecticut towns which differed in racial and socioeconomic composition. The test was shown to be highly reliable, and the two forms were found to be statistically equivalent. Difficulty levels of several items indicated a ceiling effect reflected in total scores. Training was found to be effective with second and third graders from lower class towns and first and second graders in middle class towns. Series scores were positively related to IQ and reading  scores, and students who were white or middle class attained higher Series scores.

The law mandated built-in evaluation measures. The flood of new programs provided fertile grounds for doctoral dissertation research on the education of the disadvantaged. The ERIC/IRCD staff, believing that much could be learned about doctoral research itself, about children, and about educational programs, decided to attempt to provide comprehensive collections of abstracts of those areas of special interest to the  Center. This document is one of several being prepared for the new series entitled ERIC/IRCD Doctoral Research Series. Each collection is organized in the following way. Documents are first grouped under main titles. Under the main headings, abstracts are presented in order of year of completion. Where a number of abstracts appear under a topic and in the same year, they are then arranged in alphabetical order by name of author.

In March, when two more staff members were employed by Title I, an additional 19 pupils were selected for participation during the remainder of the school year.

The Comprehensive Instructional Program is a locally conceived and funded project designed to improve instruction in the elementary grades. Pupils in grades one through three were diagnostically tested three times during the year in reading skills.

Among the legislative recommendations are: (1) the concept of forward funding be applied to all compensatory education programs; (2) any Federal approach to compensatory education should contain a mandated parent advisory council of parents of affected children; (3) funds be made available to develop: models, materials, and curricula appropriate to bilingual-bicultural programs; ways of implementing competency-based evaluations; and, teacher training  in this area; (4) a comprehensive migrant program be mandated national priority; and, (5) a Presidentially-appointed, statutory council is essential to insure candid independent judgments. Among the administrative recommendations are: (1) Federal funds be used to develop culturally sensitive books and instructional materials for classroom use; (2) the National Institute of Education should have as its research priority the accumulation and evaluation of data necessary to establish which programs are successful and replicable, for their optimal use in the education programs for disadvantaged children; and, (3) the SEA approve and direct implementation of projects and State priorities, and channel expertise into the needed area.

Government policies relevant to family structure make up one set of topics. Irene Cox describes how public income transfer benefits and eligibility conditions vary for different family types and household units. Lee Rainwater, and Carol Stack and Herbert Semmel, recommend changes aimed at improving these Government policies. Harry Kause and Stack and Semmel discuss the Government role in determining paternity and in obtaining child support payments from absent fathers of children on welfare. Krause argues for increased vigor by Government in these two areas while Stack and  Semmel content that such stricter enforcement would be self-defeating. The other major topics concern how low-income persons combine to form households and to share income. Marc Fried and Ellen Fitzgerald, Andrew Billingsley, Rainwater, and Stack and Semmel report findings on these patterns based on participant-observer studies of low-income families. They describe actual patterns of illegitimacy, marital instability, and household formation and dissolution. Billingsley also discusses some evidence from case studies dealing with the effects of family breakdown on the behavior and development of children. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"These hearings are with the broadcasting industry on television advertising of food to children. The committee had heard testimony previously from nutritionists, dentists and consumers that there is incessant advertising of sugared and snack foods on television to children, which adversely affects their dental and physical health. The Code Authority of the National Association of Broadcasters commissioned a study by Dr. Charles Winick, City College of the City of New Yrok, of the actual content of television aimed at children. The hearings explored the implications of the Winick Study and the Code Authority's new statement of principles. The witnesses were: Stockton Helffrich, director, National Association of Broadcasters, and vice presidents responsible for program standards  with the three major networks: Herminio Traviesas, National Broadcasting Company; Alfred Schneider, American Broadcasting Company; and Thomas Swafford, Columbia Broadcasting Company.

        "description":"The United Parents Association (UPS) developed Self Help Clinics (SHC) in schools in low income areas in New York City. These Clinics consisted of groups of parents meeting regularly to discuss problems centering around their children and the schools. In the course of these discussions, questions of parent-child relationships were frequently raised. The objective was to intervene in the SHCs in a manner that would modify the authoritarian relationship between parent and child, in order to promote more self-reliance, self-motivation and self-control in the children. The Psychological Service Center was asked by the UPA to design and carry out the intervention. Fifty-four parents from seven schools were trained as leaders for the SHCs. Three of these schools were assigned to the  control group, the other four to the experimental group. The experimental procedure included a T-Group for SHC leaders at which problems in parent-child relationships were dealt with. All leaders received training in recruitment of parents for the SHCs and in conducting the SHCs. The SHCs met weekly, and were attended by 961 parents, averaging about 14 per session. There were two T-Groups for the experimental group, a pair of schools participating in each. One group met for 54 sessions, the other for 36. Differences between experimental and control groups were assessed through pre and post-project interviews. [Reproduced from best available copy.] (Author/JM)",

The ORB Program was designed to provide small group remedial reading instruction to students in the target area schools of Worcester. Evaluation of the program focused on the assessment of program objectives, including student reading achievement, attitude toward school and self as learner, and socio-emotional behavior. In addition, the operation and implementation of the program, as specified in the project proposal, were assessed. The ORB Program provided small group instruction for students requiring remedial assistance in reading. Students attended daily classes, 30 to 45 minutes in  length, conducted by a compensatory reading teacher. The teachers provided a variety of instructional situations designed to build students' basic reading skills and to reinforce the instruction of the regular class. The program operated at 21 schools; depending on the number of eligible students, between one and three teachers were assigned to a school. Participants were educationally disadvantaged students in Grades One through Six of Title I designated target area schools. Students were identified as educationally disadvantaged by achievement tests and by the evaluations of classroom teachers and school principals. (Author/JM)",

In response to concerns regarding the impact of these increases on the School Lunch Programs, particularly, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of this Select Committee instructed the staff to survey the situation. The committee staff sent a questionnaire to State Food Service Directors requesting current information on this year's school food costs, as compared with previous costs, and the effect of these increases on the quality of and participation in the program. There are indications that more recent cost increases will result in somewhat higher estimates than those contained in the responses  received by the committee. This working paper contains the individual responses by the State directors; a summary of them; letters from concerned citizens; as well as sample newspaper articles on this problem. Also there is a brief projection, based on studies collected by the Department of Agriculture, of the possible impact with increased lunch prices on student participation. Forty States reported. Findings include the following: the average cost of producing a lunch (in 37 States) was 61.7 cents, with a range of 50 to 85 cents. The cost of producing a breakfast (in 33 States) averaged 30.6 cents, with a range from 10 to 45 cents. (Author/JM)",

The major portion of this report is divided into two sections according to the type of data which are analyzed: longitudinal or cross-sectional. First, longitudinal data trace the achievement of a cohort of students from kindergarten during the first year of desegregation through the sixth grade. A second group of students, who started to kindergarten three years after desegregation began, is followed through the third grade. The achievement of these students is compared each year to the achievement of all students in the district in an attempt to determine whether or not there are changes in the difference, or \"gap\", between the achievement of minority bused  students and all district students in general. The data are analyzed by ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status. A second part of this report examines the achievement test scores of students in the fifth, sixth, eighth and ninth grades. Because of time limitations, changes in the testing schedule since desegregation began, the missing information, the test scores represent only 1972-1973 rather than the entire period since desegregation began. The data included in this report must be interpreted very cautiously because of high rates of attrition of pupils in the longitudinal samples and missing data for eighth and ninth grade students.

This number, 14 percent of the 2.8 million students enrolled in public schools in Texas, represented a concentrated effort to serve pupils with the greatest needs on identified campuses which received a total of 60.2 million dollars from this funding source. According to a random sampling of school districts which received E.S.E.A., Title I funds, test data to provide evidence of the effect of these funds in the areas of reading and mathematics were received from 79 percent of these districts and represented 14 percent of the estimated 285,000 students served in  reading and mathematics programs. Test data available revealed that the combined strategies in reading yielded, on the average, 0.8 of one month's gain per each month of instruction and in mathematics, 0.7 of one month's gain per month of instruction. More than 80 percent of all E.S.E.A., Title I funds were expended for instruction. Reading received the largest proportion of these instructional fund (61.7 percent). In nonpublic schools, approximately 90 percent of all funds expended were for instruction. Approximately 36,500 students were served in summer school operations. (Author/JM)",

The data were obtained from interviewing a sample of Asian  families in the Sacramento area. In Sacramento, the three main groups of Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Filipinos. These are the only Asian groups included in the sample. A total of 302 families was interviewed: 148 were Chinese, 102 were Japanese, and 52 were Filipino. Two Chinese, one male and one female, and two Japanese, one male and one female, and one male Filipino were selected as interviewers. In all cases, these interviewers were bilingual.

        "description":"In this study, focus is upon the question of the standard for educational expenditure rather than on the alternative taxing methods for securing school district funding equalization. Chapter I begins by examining the major issues vital to urban education which the \"Serrano\" principle leaves unresolved. Then in Chapter II, particular elements of the greater education costs experienced by urban school systems are scrutinized. The purchasing power of a dollar in an average district may buy only fifty cents worth of educational resources in an inner-city school system. In Chapter III, the critical urban problem of underprivileged pupil populations requiring special and expensive compensatory education services is looked into. It is the authors' view that the responsibility which the  Congress has assumed for the amelioration of that special problem must be greatly expanded and improved in coming years as the states undertake more general equilization of funding among their school districts. Finally, in Chapter IV, the constitutional argument for an \"equal educational offering\" standard in public education finance is set forth. While considerations of common sense and educational fairness are sufficient, in the authors' view, to commend that standard in any event to state legislatures all apart from the constitutional requirement, the authors also believe that in the last analysis courts can enforce that standard directly under the Constitution where state legislatures have failed to respond to rationality in public education funding.

        "description":"In the State of Washington, 297 of 316 local school districts operated Title I, Elementary Secondary Education Act projects during Fiscal Year 1972 with approximately 12,272,000 dollars appropriated. The bulk of Title I funds (85 percent) supported project activities in the 25 largest school districts where most of the target populations are clustered. More than 56,000 public school children and 1,000 non-public school youngsters participated directly in Title I projects, and an estimated 380,000 public and 7,000 non-public students benefitted indirectly because of materials, support services, or instructional strategies that paced improvements in the general program within target area schools, even as the special needs of Title I children were being served. Nearly 1,000 dropouts  also participated in special projects, and 1,000 other students were served through institutions for the neglected and delinquent. Ninety-eight percent of the elementary schools eligible to participate did so, and 211 of 216 (97 percent) eligible secondary schools actually served students. All of the 38 elementary non-public schools within eligible districts had students involved directly in Title I projects. None of three eligible non-public secondary schools participated. Only about one-half of the 127,234 low income eligible children are actually being served by Title I. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The East Cleveland &quot;Enriched and Extended School Year&quot; program, funded by Title III of the 1965 Elementary Education Act, is an attempt to organize the educational activities of a school around the needs and learning patterns of its pupils. The major premise of the program states that children possess different rates and styles of learning, and respond to instruction more in accordance to its interest value than to its intrinsic cognitive value. The objectives of the program are to: (1) motivate the child to learn; (2) assist the pupil with hisidentification with his school; (3) change his patterns of learning; and (4) achieve one full year of academic achievement for each year of chronological development. Two major changes in the school process have been developed to attain  those objectives. Firstly, six one-week segments of enriching school educational activities were interspersed throughout the year. These activities consisted of five days in instruction conducted by and in local cultural institutions. The instructional programs were highly ego-involving, requiring considerable active participation; included experiences ordinarily not capable of duplication on the school level; and were also designed to be highly educational. The second change was a revision of the traditional school calendar. [Parts of this document are not clearly legible due to the print quality of the original.] (Author/JM)",

Although the project was directly administered through the Toledo Public Schools, it was designed to service all public, private and parochial school systems in the metropolitan area. A staff of seven people was hired to operate the project: a project director, three teachers, a certified librarian, a secretary, and a library aide. The project operated specifically in the Ninth Congressional District which includes approximately 432,619 people. There are about 54,710 blacks within  this area, most of whom life in well-defined areas within the city limits of Toledo. The project was designed to reach not only this core area of blacks but also the suburban areas of whites. A central resource center was established for the Toledo area schools, with a current holding of 1640 book titles and 650 audio-visual titles. Each piece of instructional material was evaluated before purchase according to carefully prepared criteria. Curriculum materials have been developed and distributed to teachers on all grade levels throughout the metropolitan area. In order to provide teachers and other interested personnel with the background to handle the instructional materials a series of inservice methods have been employed, including presentations, demonstrations, speakers, and long-term  institutes.

It was also hoped the project would assist them in securing the necessary background for their future occupational choices. The elementary grades program was directed toward showing the inter-dependence of people in their occupational roles. The middle school and early high school level of the program exposed the students to an experiential study of industry based on the Industriology Concept developed at the University of Wisconsin. It was designed to associate the student's interests and  aptitudes with selected people or product oriented occupations, noting skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary for the student to make his occupational choice. The final high school years were directed toward skill training for job entry through a work plan. The project was implemented at the various levels with an emphasis on the middle school and early high school levels. Evaluation is an on-going process. (AG)",

Curriculum and instructional materials used in educational programs for the disadvantaged will be sucessful only if they are specifically selected or prepared to meet the needs of those who are to be served, and then only if the learners perceive these materials as meeting their needs. Materials should be in keeping with the reading and interest levels of students, and the materials need to be adapted to the culture of the student by reflecting the language, environment, and experiences  of the student. The instructional program should be functionally rooted in the community, which necessitates consultations regarding curriculum needs with community representatives from business, industry, health services, crafts and trades, other labor groups, and public agencies. Teachers of the disadvantaged must communicate an honest and sincere expectation that their students will succeed. It is also essential for instruction to be practical and basic in nature.

The realization that unbridled scientific growth and technological innovation are no longer self-evident goals opens the way for young people starting their careers to decide the future form of their social lives. It is only through controlled change and inventive technology that man can cope with the problems of the future. The effects of technological advance are not inherent in technology itself but depend on what man will do with technology. There is ample evidence of the need for the individual to possess the capacity to adapt quickly to a changing world and it is here that the impact of education must be felt. In our changing society, it is highly unlikely that education will  ever again be considered terminal at any given point or level. Skills that are learned today will, too soon, become obsolete in the rapidly changing future. Lifelong learning appears to be the only hope we have of mastering our advancing technology.

Two questionnaires were used, one for local project directors and assistant project directors, and other for members of the student committee. Size of committees, member selection criteria, structure of organization, length and frequency of meetings, major activities, problems encountered, and a general evaluation of student committees  were assessed. Opinions of directors were compared with opinions of student committee members; data on 21 statements were tabulated and individually analyzed. Recommendations include (1) school systems using student committees should continue to do so, (2) school systems without student committees should organize them, (3) student committees can be used for areas other than evaluation, (4) further experimentation is needed, (5) additional research should be conducted, and (6) the use of student committees should be taught in preservice and inservice teacher education programs.

New roles for these areas must emerge as career education comes of age. The National Advisory Council on Vocational Education (NACVE) sees a need for counseling and guidance to set new goals and objectives. NACVE's sixth report, &quot;Counseling and Guidance: A Call for Change,&quot; is in great demand and apparently controversial. To explain the report, it is first necessary to understand the organization of the National Advisory Council on Vocational Education and its relationship to the State Advisory Councils on Vocational Education. NACVE's sixth report was based on reports from the State Advisory Councils. Since the States demonstrated such interest, the National Council  held public hearings to gather information from a wide spectrum of public representation. The report was written after completion of testimony and reexamination of the State Reports. The conclusion that guidance and counseling has not met the needs of the current rapidity of societal change is based on a thorough study, and the report should be viewed as a strong statement of support for guidance and counseling voiced by an organization outside the guidance field itself.

The Iowa Test of Basic Skills and the Stanford Achievement Test provided reading achievement data. A Knowledge of Occupations test, the Thomas Self Concept Scale,  Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, and the Level of Aspiration Scale pre- and posttests showed no significant differences between the two groups. Only in the Level of Training Scale was there a significant difference--Grades 3 and 5 of the experimental group had significantly higher means.

Ninety control subjects, also elementary education majors, received less concentrated instruction. The Patient Hygiene Performance and the Dental Health Center Index were used to detect oral health changes, and thus, the effectiveness of the model. Results of  baseline, after instruction, and follow-up examinations showed a temporary improvement in both groups after instruction, the experimental group recording more improvement: but follow-up examinations showed regression toward baseline levels and no significant difference between the two groups.

        "description":"This article presents a rationale for the initiation of the career education movement in discussing the increasing emergence within the last few years of technological advances in America. Comprehensive and vocationally oriented, career education is designed to provide students with opportunities and experiences which will prepare them to become economically self-sufficient and worthwhile citizens. Because of its structure, career education is particularly tailored to meet the needs of the disadvantaged youth. His participation in its programs at the various grade levels will provide for him the experiences he needs to develop vocational skills, social interaction skills, personal independence, and self dignity. Specifically, career education would build basic subjects in Grades  1 through 12 around career opportunities and labor market requirements. Included in its scope are provisions for: (1) career orientation at the elementary level, (2) job exploration at the junior high level, and (3) job preparation or post-secondary study at the senior high level.

A two-way communication program between the school and the community is vital if career education is to gain the necessary acceptance to be effective. This paper calls for a district-wide decentralized community relations and communications program to provide the public with more accurate information on schools in general and on career education in particular. Aspects of a constructive community relations program are outlined, with staffing requirements, the organizational structure, and developmental steps suggested as a guide for program planners. Predetermined objectives and careful planning are emphasized for the diffusion of the career education concept,  and major planning requirements are detailed in the paper. Support of these key publics is essential for success: the internal public (administrator and teachers), the influential publics in the community, and the news media. Each of these publics is described, along with the ways in which the school system may move to achieve its objectives. The schools must take the initiative to insure that the public gets the information it requires to understand the program and to cooperate with those effecting changes in school curricula.

The strategy is that a community council has been established within the community of &quot;Microville&quot; and participants assume the various roles of the council members who represent a variety of community agencies. The simulation-gaming device is designed as a model for securing substantial changes in management behavior of community leaders and in their inter-personal perceptions of their professional roles as change agents, facilitators, coordinators and energizers. Participants of the simulation-game experience are exposed to the identification and utilization of concepts most relevant to  program development as well as the social processes involved in decision-making and problem-solving. The instructional model consists of five key components: philosophy; needs and wants (strategy, kinds of data, analyses, priorities); objectives; implementation (human, physical and financial resources); and evaluation.

The results, which are discussed in detail, indicated that: 1) The learning time necessary to acquire and demonstrate competency and capability requirements for selected tasks per machine is shorter than that recommended by present National Tool, Die and Precision Machining Association/Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (NTDPMA/BAT) standards and, 2) Total machine-time allocations as now specified are not true indicators of learning time.

The questionnaire returns indicated that: servicemen took the GED before, during, or after their first duty assignment; they did not perceive any encouragement to take the  test; those who were self-motivated to participate in the program did better than those whose unit participated as a group; there are four common sources of GED information; and about 48 percent of the responding participants took a preparatory course. In spite of being notified of their successful participation, there was considerable confusion as to the serviceman's knowledge of his success.

A study was instituted to determine essential competencies that employees should possess for entry into this area. The competencies that management feels are important will serve as a basis for the revision of existing  curricula or develop new courses of study. It was found that personal qualities and attitudes were more important than specific skills and that competency in dealing with business was more important than farm experience.

Some data are included on the 19,500 vocational rehabilitation trainees and the 45,800 dependents who were receiving benefits as of April 1973. Much of the data on benefit programs is non-comparable. Most of the data analyzed came from V.A. files. Since the V.A. has no means of evaluating State Approving Agencies, it cannot judge their effectiveness. The rate of participation in educational benefits is substantially lower for black veterans. Special education programs for all educationally  disadvantaged groups were better developed during the Vietnam Era than previously. In general, the &quot;real value&quot; of the educational allowance available to veterans of World War II was greater than the current allowance being paid to veterans of the Vietnam conflict when adjustments are made for the payment of tuition, fees, books, and supplies. The effectiveness of these benefits is directly related to the availability of low-cost readily accessible public institutions, which varies considerably between States. Coordination of services with other Federal agencies by the V.A. has been limited. (A 46-page bibliography is included.) (MS)",

Participant data showed participants were more likely to be high school teachers than post-high school educators and more likely to be from non-metropolitan areas. Women were less likely to enroll than men but more likely to complete the course after enrolling. Trade and industrial educators were less likely to enroll in and complete the course than personnel from other subject areas. Most participants felt the course  was equal to or better than on-campus courses, met a participant need, was appropriate to correspondence study, and recommended similar courses be developed. The fact that the type of credit granted for the course was not determined at the beginning and the demands of other activities influenced non-respondents and non-completers. Accuracy of the study's generalizations was limited since grant monies were available for materials. The revised course syllabus is included in the nine appendixes. (AG)",

It is part of a complete teacher training program to be used with supplementary instructional materials and filmstrips. There is a need for in-service training since teaching is not a static profession. In planning a workshop, it is necessary to determine its goals, state its objectives in clearly defined terms, obtain agreement from the participants on the objectives, contact workshop participants to gather personal data, and selected the learning activities. Planners should also select and develop workshop materials,  organize the staff, check facilities, and make all necessary arrangements for smooth functioning. Planning may be shared with the instructional staff to benefit from different points of view. A variety of activities (films, \"hands-on\" laboratories, etc.) will maintain a high level of interest. Participants should be welcomed in some way upon their arrival and provisions made for introducing members of the workshop to each other. A printed program is essential for announcing groupings and optional activities. Evaluation should take place during and after the workshop. (AG)",

An administrative staff from the Region Five Educational Services Center in Lancaster supervised the project currently operational in Chesterfield, Fairfield, and Kershaw Counties. Lancaster County dropped out the second year. Feeder systems were used in each of the counties. There were five components to the program (elementary career orientation, work experience, interdisciplinary program, intensive training, and placement and followup) which provided the framework for the K-12 career  education program, each with its own goals. Two of the components were implemented in each district the first year; all five were implemented the second year. During this time, extensive inservice training (workshops, orientation conferences, and visitations) was conducted for teachers, administrators, and members of the community. Continuous evaluation was conducted by third parties. The project was judged to be successful in meeting its objectives, with each county program evaluated in a 40-page report included as one of four appendixes. (AG)",

Focus is on techniques for improving the completeness and relevance of the instructional objectives with respect to future job requirements. The job description procedures specified in CONARC, Regulation 350-100-1, &quot;Systems Engineering of Training&quot;, February 1968, were evaluated as to adequacy for describing officer jobs, and to develop alternative or supplementary procedures, if necessary. It was proposed that major deficiencies could be avoided by beginning the job description process with the development of a job model to guide the rest of the descriptive process; consequently, a sample job model was  developed to deal with common, non-trivial officer jobs. The partial job model for army officers includes coverage of systems assumptions underlying the identification of broad job functions; analysis and description of officer decision; behavior management (behavior analysis, group interactions, student concepts, functional model, information collection); goal-setting functions.

Together they organized and conducted a guidance and counseling program in which career awareness was an integral part. Trainees assisted teachers in integrating occupational information/career awareness as part of their regular classes, with considerable thrust  given to the concept of community involvement. Preliminary data were collected on students in grades four through six regarding their knowledge about careers.

They also reported the extent to which their personal objectives were met in the course. The readability of the text books and other resources used was determined. Among the recommendations were that a \"circuit rider\" approach be used to accommodate students in rural areas unable to travel a great deal, that high school reading levels be included in new text books  and course materials, and that there is need for continued emphasis on early childhood education and behavior management. Findings specifically related to the pilot courses indicate that the students were satisfied in accomplishing their personal objectives with the course content but that too much material was included.

The main need for students appeared to be learning how to reach career goals and accompanying life styles. The tasks of an  occupational education center were determined to be: assess continuing needs; utilize information retrieval and research; diffuse and disseminate information; provide individual attention to the students; initiate and implement a program of career education; and see that the program is properly administered, researched, evaluated, and developed.

        "description":"An occupational education and career education program was planned for the new Milford, Mass. high school in which \"occupational education\" was defined as stressing training and guidance for occupations requiring no more training than up through the fourteenth year. The program provides for the half-day student and for the 5- or 10-period per week student. Accommodation could be made for the associated student who needs the facilities but is not enrolled in an occupational education course for grading purposes. Half-day students would take a concentration in a cluster of specialized programs or in one specialized course. The shorter-time students would take exploratory or acquaintance specialized programs. Both would select programs from the instructional programs specified in  the document. The programs include: child care; geriatric care and domestic service; housekeeping, attendant work, and food serving; drafting and design; occupational graphic arts; cabinetmaking, furniture repair and fabrication, and upholstery; electrical skills and electronics; small motor, appliance, machine, and instrument repair; building and grounds maintenance; automotive services and small engines; air conditioning and refrigeration; distributive education; bookkeeping/record keeping; office occupations; data processing; and entrepreneurship and managerial work.

        "description":"The document describes a sub-proposal which became a part of the Fox Valley Technical Institute's attempt to identify learning styles and their relationship to learning experiences in vocational-technical education. The sub-proposal consisted of the identification of a sub-set of learning styles and a determination of their relationship with the acquisition of technical skills and knowledges. It was initiated at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. Two learning style continuums were identified: concrete/symbolic and structured/unstructured. They were measured using a semantic differential and a Likert type scale (Learning Activities Questionnaire). After refinement, the use of the semantic differential was discontinued, and the scale was readministered to a group of 140 students  from both the Institute and the Stout campus. The data gathered from that administration indicated all eleven vocational and technical education groups of students measured viewed themselves as emphasizing a concrete strategy which allows the learner to become personally and actively involved with an object. The two art groups preferred an unstructured learning style, while the other nine groups preferred a more structured style. It was concluded that the instruments could detect and measure differences in learning styles. (The questionnaire and tables of supportive data are included.) (AG)",

At Fox Valley, it was attempted to identify learning styles relevant to vocational-technical education, survey students and faculty concerning individualized instruction and learning, develop an individualized learning model, and construct alternative learning experiences for meeting a given objective. At Stout, the task was to identify a sub-set of learning styles and determine their relationship to the acquisition of technical skills and knowledges (CE 000 867). Two learning style continuums were identified: concrete/symbolic and structured/unstructured. A semantic differential and a  revised Likert scale (Learning Activities Questionnaire) were used to measure the continuums. The instruments were successful in determining individual learning styles and can be used by teachers for that purpose or for individualizing a program, course, or activity. Composite implications for teachers, students, and administrators in charge of curriculum were drawn. A 25-page literature review, a ten-page bibliography, and the Learning Activities Qpinionnaire are included. (AG)",

Students also were taught skills of other disciplines such as math, geography, cartography, and science under real job-training conditions. The entire three-year program in aerospace education included three year-long courses, totaling three units of high school credit and was made available to all interested tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students. The program was supplemented with speakers, audio-visuals, and field trips; students in each course were  required to do an independent study project. An evaluation of the project reflects aviation student profiles, class attendance, course interest, future vocational goals of students, and interest-aptitude survey. Other aspects covered are the impact of Title III, cooperating agencies, information dissemination, and costs. More than half of this document is devoted to appendixes describing student aviation projects and reports, curriculum guides of courses, students survey, photographs, evaluation samples (OVIS, Strong, and GATB), and phase-in report.

A cooperative effort between Ventura County Superintendent of Schools Office and the Community College District, the project was designed to identify and develop a short-term manpower projection system for the Ventura County SMSA and its adjacent labor-market areas. Six steps were followed in the development of the MPM system: (1) familiarization with national publications and National Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Methodology, (2) development of active support from local planners, (3) description of budget structure, (4) contact made with  Department of Human Resources and Development and Data Research Section, (5) determination of responsibilities of MPM staff, and (6) incorporation of MPM information into local planning. Linking the local MPM system to the BLS National Industrial-Occupational (I-Q) Matrix enables the national industry and occupational trends to be superimposed on the local SMSA, thus relating job market shifts to the local area. The &quot;Early Warning&quot; I-Q Matrix provides an early look at changes in the local labor market. The employer validation process and extrapolation technique were also used in determining projections. Ten appendixes of related materials are included. (AG)",

Vocational trade teachers were selected and employed as consultants for development of the examinations. The validation procedure consisted of tradesmen from each of the seven areas completing the examination for their area, then a statistical analysis of the results to produce normative tables in percentile form and to produce instrument reliability data. It was concluded that the method for developing the occupational competency examinations was valid since three of  the examinations (carpentry, chef, and electrician) were fully completed, and the remaining four can be completed with further development. (Although, in the interest of preserving their security, the instruments are not contained in the report, the procedure used in their development is outlined, the scope of the written examination for each area is itemized, sample items are provided, and the statistical tables of results are made available.)

The project was designed to: (1) make career development learning activities an integral part of the school curriculum from pre-kindergarten through adult education, (2) provide a setting in which experimentation with and evaluation of such activities may be carried on, and (3) offer students and graduates assistance in finding desired and/or suitable employment. Aspects of the career development concept which involves related,  sequential, nursery-to-adult experiences were implemented through continuing and intra-curricular projects. Such programs were still being implemented in the third year of the project. Evaluation, another major third-year effort, was aimed at documenting student behavioral changes related to \"career experiences\" and to assess the process (activity) objectives of the program.

The clusters are further refined in outline form, including jobs at all levels. In studying the clusters, students will  become able to: identify various occupations, identify skills and talents of workers, observe how occupations affect life style, relate products and services with worker interaction, recognize that environments affect job location, and ascertain how a worker gains dignity and satisfaction from a job well done. Suggestions for roles of school personnel and the use of field trips, guest speakers, and media are included.

A personal interview was developed and administered to a random sample of 429 pupils and 144 parents. Findings from the interviews include: (1) more and better information about vocations and programs is needed and should be offered early and not isolated from the major disciplines; (2) parents react negatively toward vocational-technical training, and vocational-technical pupils feel that academic teachers  consider them less important; (3) the vocational-technical classes give pupils great satisfaction; (4) parents see college-preparatory training as the choice path to the good life; (5) parents desire more counseling and career information programs and more exploratory training and work experience programs; (6) parents favor integration of vocational-technical pupils with academic pupils in classes; and (7) parents desire more career information themselves and more knowledge about developing school programs.

Behavioral and attitudinal findings of this study revealed rural low income adults experience numerous social and economic handicaps with respect to participation in employment. Despite the presence of these handicaps, they remain committed to work as a means of attaining extrinsic and intrinsic satisfactions. (Author/EA)",

Program emphases at elementary, junior and senior high levels were occupational guidance, work experience, bilingual-bicultural students, and handicapped students. The centers, which had direct contact with 769 students, showed considerable holding power, with only 6.7 percent of students leaving the program without plans. Comparisons between pre- and post-test data yielded fifteen significant changes: six changes were from a more to a less favorable score, and nine were in the positive  direction. Nine of these were on the achievement measures, with seven positive and two negative changes. Two positive and two negative changes were measured regarding attitude toward school. Differences between centers were also measured. A third party evaluator concluded that the centers were successful in achieving the objective of increasing non-white enrollment.

The questionnaire/interview method was employed, utilizing 50 questionnaires and ten interviews in each of the three secretarial areas, and distributing them to imployers and employees according to a radial density corresponding to the employment density of graduates of Western Wisconsin Technical Institute. The respondents and interviewees overwhelmingly ascribed primary importance to knowledge of fundamentals of English, and further indicated that these competencies were the responsibility of the educator, not the employer. The study concludes that while the tendency in English education is toward making it fun and  eliminating the stresses inherent in the more traditional approaches, it is 180 degrees off from what the employer wants. It is suggested that the long-term happiness and satisfaction derived from successful competition in the world of work is more desirable than the short-term happiness of non-competitive educational interlude.

Project accomplishments and results were: a K-9 model of career education was designed; interdisciplinary curriculum guides were developed; a teacher training model for orientation to the  career development concept was formulated and implemented; cooperation with the community and within the district was attained; and data gathering forms were developed and revised. Teachers and counselors were found to be the single most valuable resource, while lack of meaningful parental involvement continued to be a problem as do the dropout, unemployment, and under-employment rates. Recommendations are included. Appendixes contain forms and materials used in the project and a Teacher Beliefs Survey (on career education). (SC)",

The program as a whole and the development of a career education assessment battery using the information based evaluation (IBE) approach is described in detail in this independent evaluation. The instruments used were: (1) for students: Self Observation Scale, School Sentiment Index, Work Attitude Survey, Occupational Preference Inventory, Occupational Values Inventory, and Career Awareness Development Inventory, (2) for teachers: Classroom Observation Scale, Instructional Strategies Log, Career Education Teacher Practices Survey, and Evaluation of Career Education Curriculum Guides, and (3) for  others: Education Decision Makers Scale. Findings for these scales are presented and discussed. They included improved personal and work oriented attitudes among the CDEP students. However, at the teacher and administrator level, the CDEP resources were not used to the full extent possible and the level of community involvement was not high in spite of high level of community support for the program. On the basis of the evaluation recommendations are made concerning inservice programs, evaluation design, reduction of costs, community involvement, and project expansion. (SA)",

The questionnaire and interview results show: computerization has reduced the need to understanding bookkeeping concepts, prior school training is infrequently a requirement for securing an entry-level position, and on-the-job training of a few days to a few months is prevalent. It was also found that: the Recordkeeping curriculum appears to be nonfunctional; the terminology of school instruction is often at variance with job terminology; the job duties  and job responsibility levels of those with no school training in bookkeeping are indistinguishable from those with only high school training; job responsibility and advancement depend heavily on work experience; journal and ledger work is predominantly carried out by experienced employees, and high school instruction beyond the trial balance is totally unjustifiable. Recommendations for curricular revision are made in accordance with the findings, explicity distinguishing between instruction for small-firm and large-firm employment. (Author/AG)",

At school leaving, students were asked for name, address, parents' address and phone, special  needs, and their educational program during high school. At the time of assessment they were asked for an employment and educational activities history since leaving high school and a description of their present educational and employment status. Mailed questionnaires yielded three types of responses: non-respondent, incomplete, and complete. The procedure was evaluated by conducting a pilot test in six Minnesota school districts. In general, the assessment procedure was found to have met each of the criteria. Suggestions for revising the procedure and its administration are proposed in conclusion. (AG)",

        "description":"Continuing education is not only an extension of the K-12 continuum but also the foundation for ensuring that childhood education is fully effective since children spend most of their first eighteen years under parental influence. Lifelong learning is necessary as new facts are discovered, society's needs and individual needs change, and some kinds of education can be taught more effectively to adults than to children. The New York State Department of Education funds continuing education because locally available revenues are insufficient to meet adult educational needs. In the 70's, four technologies (management technology, cybernation, social engineering, and biological engineering) will produce vast changes, making demands upon continuous education as the greatest single  resource for meeting the challenge. Education may be expected to become a social condition while the system of education will be more flexible and open with increased opportunity for adults. As a group, adult educators possess characteristics and virtues enabling them to adapt to change and accomplish goals in unfavorable climates. The role of continuing education director encompasses ever widening areas of knowledge and expertise. Among the goals envisioned are a regionalization of continuing education services and a Statewide planning system. (AG)",

        "description":"Career Education poses a challenge for in-service education and requires management decision making from all the discipline areas and teaching levels. The major theme of this paper is that sound planning and management of a systematic in-service delivery system is basic to implementing career education. A planning format is presented for use in determining the strategy of the in-service effort, the structure of the program to be presented, and the instructional system which supports the effort. The second theme of the paper is that any in-service program dealing with a major change must consider that each school system generally has a large turnover of personnel, who may have little or no knowledge of career education or insight into its operational meaning. A third theme  concerns the need to create an indepth understanding of the nature of career education and how it can add meaning and relevance to instruction. Steps in the strategy for in-service education are outlined, with a strong recommendation that the school district assume the cost of the professional retraining for the major policy change inherent in the career education concept. A case study of a preservice career education module is presented as a model for the design of an in-service program. Appended are instruments to assist district personnel in evaluating materials for career education and an attitudes survey to assess beliefs toward career education. (Author/VT)",

        "description":"In adult education, there are seven essential activities if evaluation is to have maximum use: understanding, specifying, describing, comparing, judging, valuing, and influencing. It is also necessary to understand the objectives being evaluated--their level (agency, program, project or course, and/or instructional) and kind (output objectives or objectives which help secure output); their characteristics (results of decisions, discriminatory, predictive, pluralistic, realistic, etc.). Objectives must also be understood as a system or parts of a system (content, behavior, and experience) and as having a role and function in programing (relationship to program purpose, source of the objectives and degree of commitment, meaning of objectives to those involved, guide or contract,  etc.). The main problem in evaluation is getting good objectives written and used effectively in programing because of failure to deal with objectives as decision-making or failure to adjust concepts to overcome erroneous assumptions. The prospects for evaluating the attainment of objectives as a tool in programing depend upon adult educators building a concept of objectives and their use which is adjustable in adult education situations.

        "description":"The selected literature review in this booklet reflects the continuing controversy in the field of adult education over the place that should be accorded by adult educators to noncommercial cultural-informational television (Public Television or PTV). The writer contends that educators' views and definitions of the field of adult education are crucial to the position they support in the PTV controversy. This study views some of the notions in adult education which discourage acceptance of PTV as a unique broadcast form of education and analyzes the concerns arising from these notions; based on this analysis, \"the review will argue that if the values of adult education, writ small, were to achieve dominance in Public Television, independent-minded Americans would be much the worse  off for such 'progress'.\" More than half of the booklet is devoted to an annotated bibliography, which is divided into two parts: The Conflicting Hopes and The Reality.

The Centers served 103 families, including more than fifty pre-schoolers, with six paraprofessionals, at a cost per family of approximately $394. The report outlines development of a county-side learning center facility, recruitment and training of indigenous paraprofessional teachers, coordinating the learning center-home study model with a developing public community school, reading-readiness instruction for parents of  pre-schoolers, and an evaluation of the effectiveness of adult basic education home study as a route in recruiting adults to recurring education in the community school.

Thirty-eight carefully selected volunteers attended twelve training sessions before their door-to-door recruitment of non-readers; this personal approach brought students into the programs's lower levels and held the withdrawals to 24 percent, compared  to a 43 percent rate in the control group.

The Appalachian Adult Education Center's model involves four elements: Awareness, Interest, Trial, and Adoption. The generation of knowledge and even training of practitioners are not by themselves sufficient to cause change; the use of findings is crucial. A Center for Resource Utilization in Adult Education (CRU) should be Federally  funded, centrally located, and in addition to acquisition and dissemination of printed materials (through combination with existing services) and preparation of audio-visual presentations, the CRU should be responsible for making personal contacts to ensure adoption of improved practices.

Sources of information were varied and included school corporations records, State agencies, and surveys of secondary teachers, a sampling of high school students, parents, chamber of commerce representatives, and the graduates of the class of 1965. The information from the surveys is self-report data and is presented in a large number of tables, charts, and maps. Examples of all surveys and questionnaires are given and the responses are discussed in detail. Results are presented in the form of a generalized summary of the responses from parents, teachers, graduates and students. Trends and  generalizations are indicated, and detailed analyses of the reports from each of the seventeen school corporations are presented. Seven basic areas of need were identified and eleven recommendations made covering the establishment and functioning of an area Board of Vocational-Technical Educational Services (BOVES). Community-based, school-based and other roadblocks to the development of the BOVES are briefly discussed. (DS)",

The career exploration model described in the document was produced to unite a variety of programs, activities, and procedures which have been used to facilitate career education primarily in Baltimore City and in Maryland. Intended for junior high school students, the program requires a planning committee composed of representatives from each subject area, the guidance staff, and the administrative staff. The program goals for the student are the development of self-awareness, of knowledge of job skills and level of competence, of social and communication skills, of decision making skills, and of awareness of his own role in the world of work. The  students will benefit from vicarious, simulated and hands-on experiences. They should first learn that many occupations are contained in occupational clusters, then explore several clusters. Teacher Guides in Physical Education, Science, Art, and Music contain suggestions of activities to emphasizes a certain career or job family in relation to the subject studied. Cooperative work experience programs, as well as descriptions of related portions of the career development program, are documented in the appendixes. (AG)",

Three program objectives were examined: industriology, work study/work experience, and vocational guidance. Materials related to the program and to the evaluation are included in eight appendixes. The overall intent of  the evaluation was to identify the successful elements of the program as well as the unsuccessful elements. The external evaluation strategy consisted of external monitoring of project activities, multiple on-site visits requiring files audit, classroom visits, and interviews classed into four phases.

The review reveals that the two school settings are more similar than different in terms of practice, that implementation of the middle school concept exists more in ideal than in reality in either type of grade organization, and that research in physiological and sociological  areas cannot be used to support either grade organization upon rational, empirical grounds without quoting conflicting evidence.

Sixteen of these students were also rated on their use of understanding responses in an actual patient interview. A comparison of the pre- and post-measurement showed that students could identify an understanding response on a paper-and-pencil-test as well as make understanding responses in an actual interview situation to a significantly greater degree after having taken the course on the physician-patient relationship. This response type was compared to evaluative, reassuring, hostile and probing responses. All of these decreased  as a function of the course, except the probing response which showed an increase in quality level.

The Hidden Figures Test (Jackson, Messick and Myers, 1964) and the Dogmatism Scale (Rokeach, 1960) were administered to 50 master degree candidates for an intern training program for teachers of emotionally disturbed children. After one semester, sociometric data was collected. Results show that field-independence and dogmatism, when considered in concert, provide useful information concerning those teachers who are viewed positively by their peers. Interns  with the particular combination of high dogmatism-field dependent scores were chosen less frequently by their peers, while those who scored low dogmatism-field dependent were chosen more often.

In an evaluation of nonassertive students' reactions to an assertive training program, the authors used video feedback and the College Self Expression Scale to conclude that nonassertive students who have not sought counseling and who expressed no need for behavior change reacted favorably to an assertive training outreach program.

Variables such as subjects' age category (children vs. youth), extent of worker training (trained vs. untrained), treatment method (social learning, traditional group work, or group-centered), and the mode of group composition (anti-social children only, pro-social children only, or pro-social children plus an anti-social child) were evaluated in terms of their effects on the choice of activities by workers  and the behavior of the children.

This approach reflects the Statement of Educational Principles and the Management and Operations Principles of the District which emphasize results--from which reasonable student progress can be demonstrated. The District's Pupil Personnel Services programs, made up of counselors, psychologists, and managers, work toward these results by the use of both interventive methods--helping young people with special problems--and preventive methods--helping to prevent students from developing problems that could interfere with their ability to make reasonable progress. The results management approach to Pupil Personnel Services places emphasis  on the school setting priorities regarding the school needs to which pupil personnel resources should be allocated. This priority setting process may indicate, in some situations, that certain results to which the school is not now allocating resources are of high priority and should have resources allocated to them. This, in turn, may require that pupil personnel specialists develop new skills and knowledge in order to contribute these new results. Inservice training is being provided both at the District and at the school level to help staff develop these new skills. (Author)",

The goal is to determine the types of social behavior which will differentiate between a group of anxious, non-dating, or low social-competence, college men (LSC), and a group of non-anxious, socially active, or high social-competence college men (HSC). The first study examined behaviors associated with social delivery such as eye contact, pauses, and amount of talking. The second study looked at stylistic behaviors associated with social manner such as self-disclosure, use of verbal reinforcements, and the type of content used within a social interaction. The studies  employed several levels of assessment in the definition of social competence, ranging from self-report to peer rating to direct observation of behavior. The subjects were 35 unmarried male undergraduates. Group differences on the behavioral measures of social competence suggest that the latency or timing and length of social responses tend to discriminate between HSC and LSC subjects. None of the stylistic or content measures coded on the male subjects' behavior are able to discriminate significantly between LSC and HSC groups. (Author)",

The sample consists of educable mentally retarded special class and institutionalized students ranging from 7 to 15 years of age. These studies attempted to determine demographic and psychometric factors that account for significant portions of variance in scores on the Kohs and Raven problems before and after training, and to compare these factors with those related to scores on the Stanford-Binet IQ Test. With all variables partialled out, verbal and nonverbal IQs and demographic factors reflective of higher socioeconomic  status predicted pretraining scores. Race, social class variables, and verbal IQ did not relate to post-training scores. (Author/LAA)",

The author believes that the understanding of careers requires both organizational and developmental strategies and models as bases for intervention. He employs student assessment, environmental assessment, and environmental redesign to formulate a high school vocational program with the following  components: (1) placement and work experience service; (2) translation service; (3) environmental design service; (4) trouble-shooters; and (5) staff relationships.

We constructed an index that reflected the student's attitude toward life. A High score on this index demoted in the importance of hard work rather than luck as an ingredient in success, and in the availability of education as a means to a better life. It also measured the student's belief that people like himself had a chance to get ahead without sacrificing their personal identity or integrity. The principal finding was that the highest scores on this index were obtained  by students who were white. Next highest were Oriental-American students, followed by Negroes, Indians, and Mexican-Americans in a tie for third place. Puerto Ricans last. In studying differences among individual students, we found that the family background, achievement, and school factors played a greater role in the attitude toward life of minority group students than in that of white students. The student body's attitude toward life was more important than any school characteristic. (Author)",

Psychologists' inferences may be least vulnerable to observer attributional bias when the actor's behavior is rather unobtrusive or the actor's environment is particularly salient to the observer psychologist.

Each individual continued to record frequency of feelings, both during and following the treatment period.

Fisher's t test on life change totals revealed that low GPA subjects in each group had experienced significantly greater amounts of change. Significance levels were .05 for the low risk group and .01 for the medium and high risk groups.

        "description":"This paper develops the thesis that high morale among older people; i.e., a state of cheerfulness, confidence, and zeal; is achieved through intellectual, social and physical involvement in experiences which are meaningful because they are personally satisfying and socially relevant. It is assumed without further elaboration that high morale is the major goal all gerontologists seek to achieve. The major premise upon which the thesis rests is that the criteria for evaluating the personal and societal consequences of involvement are rooted in the value system of prevailing culture. A corollary to this premise postulated that such value systems are capable of modification in the presence of identifiable, manipulatable forces. Except for a brief preview of major value determinants  affecting older people in our contemporary culture, the major thrust of this paper is devoted to the formulation of operational concepts which, hopefully, will prove useful to \"geronto-minsters\" and \"geronto-leaders\" in the formulation of strategies necessary to achieve high morale among the people they serve.

The teachers of grades K-5 in the project school, the principal, and the staff development  teacher received inservice training in procedures for developing children's thinking skills. The procedures included: the Hilda Taba Teaching Strategies program, the Building and Applying Strategies for Initial Cognitive Skills program, the teaching of critical reading skills, analyzing levels of thinking, and organizing for instruction. An analysis of evaluation data indicated that the children in the project school tended to make greater gains than the children in the comparison school. The teachers also asked more open questions and there was more classroom interaction exhibited. (WR)",

Sentences were constructed along the lines of subject-verb-object and were presented in three experiments: free recall of isolated sentences, prompted recall of isolated sentences, and prompted recall of sentences from paragraphs. The experiments were: (1) Free Recall, No Context; (2) Prompted Recall, No Context; and (3) Prompted Recall, Paragraph Context. University of Pittsburgh undergraduates served as subjects for all three experiments. The results indicated that the effectiveness of words from sentences as retrieval prompts for sentence meaning is dependent upon thematization.  When a sentence was presented in isolation, without context, and when the imagery and concreteness of the subject-noun and object-noun were high and equal, there was no difference between the two nouns in prompt effectiveness. However, when the subject was the theme of the paragraph, the subject was a much better prompt than the object. When the object was the theme, subject and object were equal. (WR)",

Diagnostic tools are described in part 2 so that the teacher can identify the language base on which to build individual programs. Articles in part 3 suggest classroom strategies for teaching oral standard English to nonstandard speakers. Part 4 provides  materials which guide teachers in assisting dialect speakers in their special problems with correspondence between spoken forms and written symbols in beginning reading.

        "description":"If in reading a sentence a reader finds something unfamiliar in lexical meaning or grammatical structures, the meaning of the written material may be ambiguous to him. Sometimes the context will help to clarify the meaning of an unfamiliar element, but often it won't. Understanding what is read involves not only the process of reasoning, but also the process of eliminating ambiguity. In this study of students' comprehension of sentence structure, it was found that many intermediate grade students (grades 5-8) had difficulty recognizing sentence transformations with equivalent meanings. They also had difficulty recognizing the kernel sentences of larger sentences. The study indicated that there was a wide range in the abilities of the students to recognize sentence transformation  with equivalent meanings and kernel sentences of larger sentences. A teacher can help students increase their understanding of sentence structures by exploring with them the various ways in which the same concept can be stated. Teaching the equivalency of one structure to another can be used as a basic method of expanding students' understanding of the literal meaning of various types of sentence structures--whether the structures are infrequently used, highly complicated, nonstandard, or ambiguous standard English sentences.

To examine the IN, AR, DS, and CO characteristics of LLD students, the eleven subtest scaled scores were totaled for each  subject, and each subject's deviation from his own mean was computed. The WISC mean deviations by group were also computed from the deviations from the students' own means. Some of the results indicated that the LLD students showed a group pattern of low IN, AR, DS, and CO; but the pattern did not hold for individual cases; the WISC subtest pattern did not vary with degree of underachievement; and WISC full scale IQ correlated negatively with reading deficit and was apparently a poor measure of reading success.

The Reading Miscue Inventory (RMI) was used to analyze and compare the miscues they generated while reading two selections varying in difficulty. The study addressed itself to two main questions: Do these readers use a process consistent with the Goodman model of reading? Does the process differ in any way from that used by eighth and tenth graders reading the same selection? The results indicated that: in general the predictive and explanatory powers of the model were confirmed; the operations of the grapho-phonemic, syntactic, and semantic language cueing systems were apparent; during more difficult reading, grapho-phonemic cues were more closely attended to by  all subjects and syntactics cues continued to function strongly, while semantic cues became so weak that many miscues, though grammatically correct, failed to reproduce the intended meaning of the text; and a comparison of selected results with eighth and tenth graders suggests that junior college students manipulated the text more freely. Further research using the RMI with older readers of varying proficiency was suggested. (WR)",

        "description":"Reading instruction should be modified to make it compatible with students' perceptual skills. Assessing the adequacy of a student's perception is pertinent to planning his reading instructional program--not because the teacher can then teach to a preferred modality but, rather, because it can help the teacher determine whether the student has acquired the basic skills that are assumed by the particular instruction program that is to be used in the classroom. Some suggestions that teachers should follow for teaching reading to children with substandard perceptual skills include: only capital letters should be used until the student has acquired some degree of reading fluency; modify the text by adding a distinctive cue to potentially confusing letters; \"b\" and \"d\" should not be  taught in juxtaposition; instruct the student to use his finger as a pointer, pointing to each word as he reads; teach the student that the start of a new sentence is signaled by a capital letter and the end by a period; introduce only a few sentences at first; for students who exhibit a deficit in auditory perception, phonics based instruction is needed; and teach the student to repeat what he has heard and wants to remember.

Eighty children from first and fifth grades served as subjects. The subjects were presented with four tasks: (1) a discrimination task of their ability to hear minimal differences in paired sentences, one having Standard English features, the other Black English features; (2) an identification task as to whether a sentence in Black English or Standard English had been stated properly or improperly from a teacher's point of view; (3) an identification task indicating the race of the speaker of Standard English or Black English; and (4) an identification task that required  the subjects to identify a speaker according to social class. An analysis of variance was performed for each task. The results indicated that awareness of the social and racial significance of dialect does increase from first to fifth grade, the differences between black students and white students in the identification of Standard English forms was not significant, and no social or sex differences were found for any of the four tasks.

Over 50 percent of the high school students were bilingual or bi-cultural. In order to remedy reading retardation, teachers were asked to identify and define difficult vocabulary items and idiomatic phrases and to make copies available to the students. The idea was to bring students up to the level of material rather than to bring the material down to the students' level. The results of this program indicate an average gain in reading comprehension of 3.2 for the freshman class. Teachers felt that the most important result of the program was an improvement  in the students' self-image. A copy of the student questionnaire and responses by students as indicated in a preliminary report are included. (LL)",

Respondents for the study consisted of news staff and management who work in the St. Petersburg offices. Some of the findings were that: employees of a newspaper where there is an ombudsman are generally more supportive of the concept than employees of a newspaper where there is no ombudsman; employees on both newspapers were very close in describing the ideal ombudsman; longer term employees displayed greater company loyalty  and greater support for the ombudsman concept; the role of the ombudsman gains in respect and support from staff members after the function is fulfilled and the ombudsman proves himself; management and nonmanagement employees agreed on the value and effectiveness of the ombudsman; and more women than men indicated that the access editor has greater importance to the newspaper's image, but they accorded him less authority than did the men.

His strength lies in the creative tension between the particularity of his Caribbean setting and the universalities of his theme and style. His stylistic influences and allusions resemble those of Donne, Marvell, Yeats, Hopkins, Pound, Ransom, Spender, Lowell, and Graves. Passages of his poetry resemble Eliot's &quot;Prufrock&quot; in parody, Thomas in tone, and Auden in satire. The constellation of thematic polarities is responsible for much of the creative power in the poems of Walcott. Fundamental to all of them is Walcott's understanding of the difference between the poles of the New World and the Old. Isolation is the most prominent of Walcott's themes, the isolation of the individual in the modern world, the isolation of  the Caribbean from the world's centers of culture and power, and finally the isolation from history that is inherent in the New World poet and his bitter optimism.

Tasks were administered to one pair of children at a time. The children were randomly paired within each classroom of a given grade level, and each pair of children worked on both sets of tasks in two separate sessions, so that each child had a turn to play the receiver and presenter role. Results indicated that: the LCST is a reliable and valid technique for assessing particular characteristics of language  communication skills of young children; an increase in the communication proficiency and the linguistic proficiencies was observed with age; outcomes of the criterion scores obtained from children of similar age range and social background depend on the quality of verbal messages transmitted by the presenter; subscores that contributed to the success of the criterion task were related to the position and location of the object and to the receiver's ability to ask questions and the presenter's ability to answer those questions.

The second section discusses the definition of standard English, and the third section focuses on special considerations concerning the learning situation of the pupil, that is, integrative versus instrumental motivation and differences between the theories of cultural deprivation and cultural  differences. Teaching methodology, especially foreign language teaching, is discussed in section four. Finally, teacher training recommendations stressing the need for teachers to possess an attitude which recognizes that substandard dialects are regular systems of communication in their own right are discussed in the last section.

The first area discussed is the educational implications of the human capacity for acquiring language. Studies cited cover topics related to the universality of language acquisition, children's mastery of basic grammatical devices, neurophysiological states of readiness, psychological processing of the environment, psycholinguistics and reading, and structure words. The second area discussed is the implications of language usage. Research discussed in this area relates primarily to social and environmental variables which may provide a key to understanding individual and group differences in language behavior. Particular areas of research discussed include: dialect instruction, verbal interaction  in families, code selection, and language styles. Several conclusions are presented: the preschool years are the most critical for language acquisition; all languages share the same potential for expression; the implicit knowledge of the linguistic system acquired as the child learns to speak the language can facilitate his acquisition of other language skills; and a restricted communication code may be impeded in some aspects of school learning.

The courses most taught in junior colleges were: (1) survey of mass communication, taught by 312 schools, the majority of which indicated that the publication of the school newspaper was an adjunct to the course; (2) reporting, news-writing, or journalistic writing, taught in 281 schools; (3) editing or editing and layout, taught in 137 schools; (4) reporting II, taught in 101 schools; (5) photojournalism, taught in 69 schools; and (6) advertising, taught in 30 schools. The author concluded  from this survey that most junior colleges have at least described a commendable journalism curriculum, and it seemed apparent that the potential for junior college instruction in the first two years of a journalism degree program is promising.

        "description":"In a survey of the nation's nearly 1100 junior colleges, and with a response of nearly 90 percent, the following statistical evidence was derived concerning journalism programs: of the 936 junior colleges responding to the survey, 553 (59%) reported offering some journalism instruction; 207 of these 553 schools (37%) employ a journalism teacher with the equivalent of a college major in journalism; and of the personnel reported as teaching journalism, at least 112 have no academic training in journalism. These findings indicate that an acceptable standard of journalism education is not being met. The ideal junior college journalism program must be based on the following assumptions: (1) that the junior college journalism teacher is professionally competent and will teach courses  that are academically respectable; (2) that junior college administrations will support journalism instruction on a par with other academic disciplines, and not as a \"production unit\" or \"extracurricular\" activity; and (3) that budget facilities will be adequate, and teacher loads will be reasonable.

The population for the study included all the editorial employees of the ten daily newspapers in Colorado with circulations over 10,000. The newspapers were measured for significance, accuracy, diversity, and comprehensiveness, and the newsmen were measured by a 21-item professional-orientation scale. From the results it was concluded that young journalists in the beginning of their careers have much more professional orientation than their elders in supervisory positions, and that  these young journalists want a flexibility to cover the local scene which they believe is within their domain and are resentful of controls put upon them by the close supervision of the men in decision-making positions.

Two existing scales, one dealing with self-perceived professionalism and the other a self-report of bureaucratic features at one's work-site, were modified for a mail survey of television journalists. Some of the findings are: on the hierarchy of authority, division of labor and rules scales, the sample ranked at the median; on the procedures scale, newsmen had relatively low bureaucracy scores, suggesting that television journalists are allowed much latitude in their day-to-day activities; on the impersonality scale, newsmen had the highest bureaucracy scores,  possibly because of the required impartiality in news gathering; the most bureaucratized group in the sample were cameramen; news directors had the most autonomy; technical competence scores revealed that television news departments appear to have little in the way of rigid rules for recruitment and promotion; and most news departments are relatively small.

Each editorial was coded according to its contextual, societal, socio-concept, and evaluative orientation. Most of the editorials treated national/regional issues, politics, and individual persons and groups, and reflected an &quot;official&quot; version of political and social conditions.

Experimental materials developed in this study had four constraints: (1) use of multi-object, multi-attribute situations (2) use of situations in which equal amounts of information were known about all of the objects; (3) use of situations in which objects could be chosen on a rational basis; and (4) use of situations in which both  hypotheses could be tested simultaneously. Results suggest that increased salience leads to greater positive evaluations and that attribute salience is a function of the attribute's discriminatory power not included in Carter's model (but easily incorporated). In terms of learning theories, an exclusive discrimination becomes associated with a reward for making a good decision. (DS)",

The teacher then proceeds one by one through the gods of the heavens, the Twelve Olympians, and goes from there beneath the earth to explore the topography of the Underworld and the lore of the gods of death. Like the gods, the heroes should be treated genealogically, house-by-house or family-by-family. Back-up texts for the teacher include: H. J.

Too often portrayed as inaccurate are such subjects as tribal entities and cultures, listings of current tribes and reservations, descriptions of languages and areas of occupation, foods, attire, and dates of historical importance. The problem is that the novels of the past as well as the history books have made use of erroneous stereotypes of the Indian. The Indian in most of the literature even to the present time is shown not so much as he is in reality, but as he is in the minds of his white conquerors, who read into him the character traits they wish to find. In a study of the American Indian in adolescent literature since 1930, it was determined that  the novels for the most part continued the traditional dual and contradictory image of the Indian: the dirty, drunken, cruel, and warring savage and the glorified, noble, but naive native--both of which are stereotypes. The time has come for writers and publishers to work to dispel the stereotypes and generalizations about the American Indian and accurately describe their cultures. (HOD)",

Likewise, literature in performance involves verbal images from which emerge suggestions which produce the literary images in the auditor's consciousness, and the experience is completed in his mind. The power of suggestion is the interpreter's primary aid for indirect communication of literary meaning and feeling, just as it aids the mime in his evocation of physical objects. The creative oral performance of literature consists of a combination of facial, bodily, and vocal actions,  with the addition of the &quot;dynamic characteristics&quot; of suggestion which are all translated by the auditor in terms of his own experience and imagination.

Meaning includes both intellectual and emotional responses to a piece of literature. A theory based on meaning can establish other theories unique both to the experience and performance of literature, including explanations of the general principles of advanced interpretive reading. This suggests analytical studies on the phenomenon of  interpretation as related to both literary subjects and their development in performance.

A questionnaire consisting of a list of captions from cartoons in the \"New Yorker\" was also distributed to 50 men and women in speech classes at the University of Illinois, with directions to indicate whether the statements were spoken by a male or female and why. To determine whether the treatment of women's rhetoric in the \"New Yorker\" cartoons  was representative of mass circulation magazines, 56 syndicated cartoons from the Sunday comics section of the Chicago \"Daily News\" were analyzed for the same three-month period. Data resulting from the study of the cartoons suggested that women use a more restricted, weaker language than men.

Results revealed the typical Kentucky speech coach did not compare favorably with his counterparts throughout the country.

Furthermore, the coach was usually reared in Kentucky educational system and had deep roots and family ties in the state. The average coach seemed dedicated yet hampered by  relative lack of recognition by state and local administrators of the importance of speech to their school program.

Studies of textual properties in real discourses have been carried out at the paragraph level. The theoretical concepts of representing paragraph content in terms of (1) the factual data expressed by the grammatical units in a paragraph, (2) the development types and their structural relationships and (3) the cohesive principles used in the sentences of the paragraph is presented. The theoretical investigation of discourse properties is aided by a paragraph generation system constructed to synthesize paragraphs and to test out the linguistic assumptions made in the study. The theoretical concept and the computational tool  constructed are used in the development of an integrated computer-assisted system designed to synthesize and analyze news stories at the paragraph level and to provide preprogrammed critiques to students learning journalistic writing.

        "description":"Canon 35, concerning improper publicizing of court proceedings, is one of the professional codes of the American Bar Association. First adopted in 1937, it has twice been amended and is widely observed by most courts throughout the United States. Reasons for barring radio or television coverage of trials are based on concerns that broadcasting would detract from courtroom dignity, distract participants and witnesses, and create misconceptions about the true nature of trials in the minds of viewers. Opponents of Canon 35 claim that broadcasting of trial proceedings would make them truly public. They also feel that this broadcast ban infringes on the public's right to know about administration of justice and thus denies freedom of the press and freedom of information. Broadcasting  in the courtroom can also serve to educate the public in judicial matters. The worth of Canon 35 could be determined by setting it aside for an experimental period, allowing trials to be broadcast on a selective basis. This procedure could then be evaluated by independent observers to determine the actual effects of this type of publicity on court proceedings. (RN)",

A new conceptualization of trust is offered, drawing from game theory, credibility research, sensitivity/encounter groups, and studies of generalized expectations of trustworthiness, which makes an important distinction between the cognitive state of trust and trusting behaviors. Trusting behavior occurs only in situations in which the trusting person perceives his outcomes to be contingent upon the behavior of the other person, has some confidence in his expectations for the other's behavior, and has available options of increasing or decreasing his vulnerability to the other. The cognitive state of trust involves perceiving the other as knowing the nature of the contingency in their  relationship, capable of performing the behavior he chooses, and motivated to prevent unacceptably negative outcomes being conferred upon the truster. Trusting behavior consists of increasing one's vulnerability to the other and may take many forms. Some empirical support for this conceptualization is reported, and the implications of this concept for communication research are discussed. (Author)",

The concept of &quot;Gestus&quot; as espoused in the dramatic theory of Bertolt Brecht offers an approach to the performance of imaginative literature singularly structured to solve these three performance problems. Crucial to Brecht's gestic approach to performance is his belief that an understanding of the story as a whole must precede specific character analysis, that an intelligent, critically involved audience is indispensable to good performance, and that literal representations of action are not the only means, or even the best means, of communicating the gestic  impulse to the audience.

In its second stage, during the sixties, Readers Theatre became a directors' art; it was the director who adapted and arranged the literature and whose creativity and insight gave Readers Theatre its continuing growth and energy. The third stage, now in process, is a performer-centered period in which the readers themselves become the artistic impetus for the Readers Theatre presentational form. Interpretation and Readers Theatre have for too long been defined, and their perspectives, horizons, and future have far too long been seen, only in terms of their educational setting. Complete  identification with the book leads to a flat interpretation. However, with the interpreter as artistic source and with the extended dimensions of chance composition, the text again exists--presumed, subsumed, and celebrated within and through the presentational form of the readers of Readers Theatre.

On the basis of research three fundamental registers can be defined and described: pulse, a low range of phonation; modal, a middle or &quot;normal&quot; range; and loft, a high range, described by some as falsetto. These three principal vocal registers are defined on the basis of four operational criteria. The acoustic characteristics of the registers are that each one occupies different ranges of fundamental frequencies, reveals different magnitudes of vocal intensity, and has a different frequency composition. Perceptually, the three registers can be differentiated and identified on the basis of voice quality. Physiologcally, they differ because of vocal length or  thickness and vibratory patterns. Aerodynamic characteristics relate to subglottic pressure, air flow, glottal resistance, and voice intensity. (A list of 55 references is attached to this report.) (RN)",

There are five distinct facets in the personality of the central character, Miss Bellamy: a lonely, fearful old lady; a shrewd, hospitable mistress of her household; a dour, tyrannical woman; a bitter old-maid of thirty-five; and a happy young girl. The reader-narrator must reveal differing attitudes about Miss Bellamy--sympathetic at some points, cold and critical at others. Finally, the &quot;implied&quot; point of view of the author, Miss Stafford, causes the reader-interpreter to feel sympathy for a character whose attitudes and behavior would normally be socially unacceptable. A successful performance  of this story depends on the interpreter's abilities to portray the five aspects of Miss Bellamy's character, to express the differing relationships of the narrator to her, and to suggest the values and attitudes of the author.

At no time has there been an attempt to establish a state prescribed syllabus or curriculum, although the program has operated under the supervision of the state's Department of Public Instruction. The second program developed from a Title III grant funded in 1968 with the objective of developing speech education programs that are adaptable to a variety of school situations, depending on population, schedules, and educational  philosophies. The curricula are formulated in terms of behavioral objectives and thus can be used in programs ranging from mini-courses to two-semester courses. One result of these programs is that the Pennsylvania Department of Education now employs a full-time speech advisor. (RN)",

Over 120 undergraduate students at Ohio University listened to a test speech. Listener achievement was measured by a twenty-item recognition test. A mean of 11.77 and a standard deviation of 3.46, with scores ranging from 4 to 20, were obtained. A coefficient of internal consistency of 0.67 was obtained by the KR-20 formula. Results suggested that \"interestingness\" of orienting instructions and monetary incentives had no significant effect on the scores, but that  males did score significantly higher than females. When subjects were told the speech would be boring or interesting, they evaluated the \"interestingness\" of the speech in accordance with the orienting instructions.

Two dominant social exigencies were observed as challenges to communication talents: the increasing complexity of society and growing social upheaval. In response, speech educators should lead students toward communicative reapproachement, should apply rhetorical insight into interpersonal conflicts, and should discover communicative means of bridging the gaps in society. Specifically, speech communication scholars  can teach the art of influencing public policy through effective speech and can demonstrate to individuals how to increase their rhetorical individuality and ability in order to enjoy more fully the mass communication experiences in their daily lives.

Rhetorical discourse treats the world pragmatically, whereas poetic discourse contains an aspect of decoration. Murray Krieger, as a representative of the New Criticism, claims that rhetorical discourse dualizes and alienates man from his world but that poetic discourse provides a monistic experience because of its contemplative nature. However, this position is in error if Western rhetoric and logic (as pragmatic instruments of a world view) evolved from ancient mythologies and religions; that is, it is erroneous to view thought and speech as universals and to assume they have the same identity in all cultures. A more accurate intercultural view would leave rhetoric in its own cultural  setting until the way it functions for a given people in a given culture is known. When fully analyzed, for example, the philosophies of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Tao Teh King, the Upanishands and Mao would show how the Orientals maintain the doctrine of \"not-self,\" reject duality, and treat speech and thought as intellectual additions to experience.

Children's speaking turns are not accompanied regularly by nonverbal signals; the speaker role does not require a listener role. Monologue speech elements may occur within the child's turn taking system or outside of it as simultaneous talk. In encounters between child and adult speaking systems the teacher regularly attempts to impose his own dialogue and topic continuation constraints upon the child's more flexible speaking system. Also, the teacher regularly picks up an utterance of the child's monolgue and paraphrases it into a question to  which the child again is forced to answer. Presumably through time such systematic adult monitoring will result in the child coming to accept such constraints as part of his own speaking turn system.

        "description":"Several factors support the new concept of open campus schools. Traditional high school study halls have outlived their usefulness as more and more teachers have found it appropriate to make nontextbook assignments to students. Youth's resistance to the arbitrary restrictions of school, the greater informality and freedom available in post-school and adult life, and the fact that many students have developed important educational activities outside the physical confines of the school provide additional reasons that support the open campus concept. Open education also promotes more individualized instruction, opportunities for independent study, and students' acceptance of responsibility for their own educational development. Open campus plans are also a way for high schools to  develop a workable alternative to traditional high school programs and to break down the artificial barriers between the school and the community. This document provides suggested steps to be followed in planning, implementing, and evaluating an open campus program and some descriptions of successful open campus models. (Author/WM)",

The authors examine determinants of school climate, the principal's role in creating and maintaining a more positive environment, implementation strategies for a principal to begin improving his own skills toward fulfilling such a leadership role, and techniques for assessing the effectiveness of the approach.

        "description":"The usual approach to improving discipline in the schools is the repressive approach -- more rules, stricter enforcement, more efficient pupil surveillance, suspensions of privileges, or additional rules imposed by the board of education. School administrators, faced with increased public concern and lacking well-defined alternatives to such repressive measures, tend to accede to public pressure, thereby making matters worse. This paper is designed to serve the educator who wants to take positive rather than negative steps towards improving school discipline. The projects suggested here, taken together, should add up to a comprehensive effort to modify the learning environment. Three major pieces of this environment are considered here -- the belief and value system of the  school, the school's communications system, and the manner in which decisions are made within the institution. Significant changes in these important components of the institution should do much to remedy the causes of discipline problems. (Author)",

After brief treatments of the socioeconomic environment and the political culture within which education takes place, the document considers the specific policymaking institutions (the commissioner of education, the governor, the legislature, the State department of education, and special interest groups) and their relationships, with emphasis on the structure and the process of the educational governance system. Major decisions previously made in the policy areas of school finance, desegregation, educational planning, and certification are described as actual  examples of how educational policy decisions are made. A summary and an interpretation offer some concluding observations on Florida's educational governance system.

Studies were selected that are relatively thorough in both scope and evaluative procedures and representative in terms of the type of program evaluated and geographic location of the program. Program evaluations are reviewed separately because of the variability in type of  program, school characteristics, implementation procedures, measurement tools, and other factors. Most of the evaluations analyze costs; student achievement; and the attitudes of the community, parents, students, and teachers toward the program. Several of the evaluations also discuss administrator attitudes and duties, and one program evaluation considers the effect of their school's year-round program on extracurricular activities.

The report indicates that during the first summer quarter of operation, approximately 39 percent of Atlanta's high school students enrolled in one or more courses. Main sections provide background information on (1) Atlanta and the needs of Atlanta students, (2) educational planning in Atlanta, (3) the development of the quarter plan and the process of informing the community, and (4) implementation of the plan. One section offers answers to frequently asked questions about the plan.  Nine appendixes comprise guides for two courses, one in mathematics and the other in English; flow charts for science and mathematics; procedures for revising course offerings; a complete list of English courses; a conversion table for changing Carnegie units into quarter hours; requirements for high school graduation; the calendar for school years 1968-69 and 1969-70; courses offered in two different high schools; and some special learning opportunities available under the quarter plan.

The authors contend that the paradigm of R&amp;D previously used has been too narrow, and that it is based on restrictive assumptions about how to help schools solve problems. They feel that any revised concept of &quot;the R&amp;D system&quot; should include (1) how and by whom problems are formulated, (2) a range of likely resources for solving them, and (3) the organizational life of operating systems which will affect the possibility of implanting a solution. The document first presents some history of the R&amp;D system, from the Cooperative Research Act through recent construction of new facilities and the letting of multi-year contracts to regional educational laboratories. An  overall framework is presented to make the case for stimulating the &quot;R&amp;D way of thinking&quot; and refreshing the &quot;user way of thinking&quot; within the system. The authors opt for reinforcing the existing research, development, and information system to make its problemsolving less dependent on federal whim; and its solutions more possible, economical, valid, and communicated rapidly to those in need. They describe the needs of an make specific recommendations for operating agencies to strengthen their ability to set goals, identify achievement barriers, call on resources for solutions, and directionalize analysis results and creative thinking. No substantive agency for research and development or school improvement is presented, and the policy and program recommendations with respect to  implementation apply only to the improved performance of K-12 schools.

In the first paper, the author contends that school officials should develop and implement comprehensive public land use policies applicable to the enhancement of the public school site, public policies that could insure the environmental quality of community-owned school sites and a land resource rightfully belonging to future generations. In the second paper, the author states that solutions to environmental problems of land development and utilization could and should be  formulated by elected public officials such as school board members, with the land size of the public school site, its degree of development, and the natural and man made amenities contributing significantly to the formation of citizen attitudes. In the third paper, the author argues that learning opportunities for K-12 pupils could best be accomplished through the design, development, and implementation of an outdoor classroom on the school site. He offers an outdoor classroom public site policy to school officials as a model for implementation, in part, of a State masterplan for environmental education for elementary and secondary education.

The author agrees that class size does affect educational quality, but he suggests that other factors greatly influence quality as well. He suggests that the tendency to sacrifice nonteaching personnel in order to keep class size down may hurt rather than help the cause of quality education. The author contends that, for successful teaching and learning, the major issue is not class size but rather how to manipulate the resources available to the schools so that the minimum needs of every teacher and child are satisfied. Several tables show the average class size for various elementary grades in Ontario in 1972 and 1973 and the variations  in class size in the province. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"This paper presents some suggestions about and evidence on how research theories from social psychology can be used to improve the operation and effects of short term educational programs whose objectives include the education or reeducation of individuals. The document is intended for people connected with the kindergarten through college educational system who are responsible for producing changes geared to improving the functioning of educational programs. The authors demonstrate that the use of temporary systems concepts in managing short term conferences, institutes, workshops, and meetings of from three days to eight weeks' duration can significantly improve the effectiveness of these events. The document differentiates between temporary and permanent systems, presents a  conceptual model of a temporary system, explains terminology, cites relevant literature, and gives specific examples taken from different programs to illustrate how systems concepts can be applied. The paper concludes with a checklist that summarizes the kinds of actions that might be made by a manager or a director of a temporary system. (Author/DN)",

It examines major extended school year programs in theory and in practice, as well as the probable educational, social, and fiscal impact in the District should an extended school year program be implemented. Programs considered include the 45-15 plan, the mandatory staggered attendance quarter concept, and the voluntary quarter and quinmester programs. The author considers the educational, social, and fiscal ramifications of an extended school year program as well as the possible procedures for implementation of term-length courses, instructional objectives, expanded day and summer programs, and self-selected vacation periods.

While the publication was designed primarily as a research tool for lawyers and legislators already familiar with school finance issues, it can be used by laymen as well to obtain a general understanding of the kinds of requirements demanded by State constitutions. The first part of the document is composed of four summary tables that analyze, classify, and compare the major categories of constitutional provisions more fully detailed in the second part. The second part offers a  State-by-State compendium of those constitutional provisions most likely to be important in determining educational requirements, selected statutory material signifying the importance attached to the education function by eact State, and interpretative case law indicating the particular constitutional gloss given those provisions by the State courts.

A study to determine what designers and owners can do to prevent or dimish damage to schools through more careful planning and design reveals five major design issues pertinent to the problem of property damage in schools. The first three, access to roofs, entrances, and predictable rough play spaces, relate to the question of access and the proximity of rough activities to unprotected windows and fragile hardware. The other two design issues relate to the damage-ability of walls and ground materials. This report deals with one aspect of the solution--what to watch for when designing new schools. (Author/MLF)",

The particular approach will be guided by the size and problems being experienced by the individual school system.

        "description":"While Colorado politics is in a state of flux, education has consistently maintained a position of prime importance and concern in the State. Public elementary and second education in Colorado is the most expensive governmental service provided by State and local government. This report examines Colorado's socioeconomic and political conditions and focuses in particular on organizations, governmental agencies, and persons affecting educational policymaking. The author looks first at the structure for education policymaking in the State. This structure includes the Colorado General Assembly, the Governor, and the State Education Agency. In the next section, she discusses the issues facing policymakers. Such issues as school finance, educational accountability, and school  desegregation are discussed. The author then looks at the policymaking roles assumed by such participants as educational interest groups, the State education agency, the Governor, and the State legislature. A final section discusses the importance in policymaking of the Council on Educational Development, a coalition of 16 education and noneducation interest groups. (JF)",

The first section describes the general setting in which the total program operates, such as locale, school system, special factors affecting the project, the overall instructional programs, and the results obtained. The second section contains a detailed description of  one or more successful educational practices with data to show that they were successful. The descriptions are in sufficient detail to provide educators at all levels with enough information to initiate programs in local schools with similar problems. The descriptions cover such topics as needs assessment, rationale, objectives, criteria for selecting the target population, personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, operational problems, valid evaluation data, cost analysis, and suggestions for replication.

Findings indicate that 39 percent of the 28 districts surveyed fail to invest funds above those required to meet immediate operating expenses and that one-third of the investments made earn interest rates below the current competitive rates. The report estimates that poor investment practices cost New York State taxpayers a total of 1.3 million dollars in 1973. The report recommends that school boards review their investment practices and adopt formal  investment policies and procedures, estimate cash flow for the full school year to enable surplus funds to be invested for the longest time possible, determine on a continuing basis how much money is needed for operating expenses and how much can be put into short-term investments, use published quotations to check investment rates, solicit competing bids before investments are made, and invest at the highest rates available. The appendix contains an analysis of some of the poor investments being made by school districts. (Author/DN)",

A review was made of detailed proposals for 1967 and 1968 submitted to the building commettee to guide them in reaching a decision about selecting a hydronic system fueled with gas and oil or an all electric system at Mansfield Middle School in Spring Hill, Connecticut. The report explains how, in calculating the expected usage of fuel, certain inaccuracies crept into the equations and points up the value of making an economic comparison of alternate heating systems by estimating both the initial construction costs and the annual operating costs. Had  the error in calculations been discovered earlier, the estimated costs between electric and hydronic systems would have reflected a $6,000 greater cost factor for the electic than for the hydronic system. It is hoped that the facts reported about this school will serve as a guide for school boards and building committees in their efforts to evaluate proposals for competing school comfort systems.

Ss (identified from a low income Milwaukee area) all have mothers with IQs below 75 and are of Negro extraction. The experimental intervention is composed of two components: a maternal rehabilitation program and an infant intervention program. Mothers are provided with adult education classes in basic academic subjects after which an occupational training program to teach specific vocational skills is offered. The infant program commences at 3-months of age and continues at a 5 day a week, year round program until the child enters school. Program characteristics include pairing of each infant  with one consistent mothering figure and emphases on perceptual motor and cognitive areas. Children 3, 4, and 5-years-old receive instruction in language, reading, math/problem solving, as well as free choice activities. Preliminary findings indicate mean IQ scores of 127 for experimental Ss versus 92 for controls, better language abilities by experimental Ss, more mother-child verbal interactions by experimental Ss, and improved attitudes of experimental mothers. The final report of the program's effectiveness is to be published after the children have reached 7 years of age and spent some time in public school. (DB)",

Phase I of the program involved group instruction within treatment approaches, while phase II involved individualized instruction within the same treatment approaches. Major findings of the study were that low but statistically significant correlations between treatment method and posttest achievement existed (the indirect and combined groups showed better achievement than the direct and control  groups); and that number tests and teacher ratings had the greatest predictive power. Results may have been affected by age limitation of Ss, limited amount of time spent on experimental methods (1/2 hour per day) and treatment by a perceptual-motor specialist of Ss in the indirect method during phase I.

The Ss were recommended by nursing personnel on the basis of greatest self destructive behavior, degree of emotional disturbance, and severity of behavioral problems. The Ss were evaluated at 3-month intervals through 12 10-minute observation sessions on the Scales of Social Adaptation (BSAB-II) and Scales of Functional Independence (BSAB-I). Data were developed for unadaptive self-directed behaviors (such as failure to respond and stereotype), unadaptive interpersonal  behaviors (agression, withdrawal), adaptive interpersonal behaviors (such as non-communicative social behaviors), play activities (inappropriate and appropriate use of objects and playful contact), and response to instructions. Information was obtained on medications which the Ss were receiving at time of evaluation. Results indicated that passive and informal programing in residential settings with reliance upon tender loving care and acceptance to achieve goals such as emotional wellbeing and behavioral development did not increase change in the Ss's social coping behavior, and that the hypothesis of improvement as a result of spontaneous maturation was not supported (through a longer time period might have some effect on gains).

Results of ratings  showed that no significant changes in socially adaptive behaviors occured to support the hypothesis of time and maturation being the determining factors. The results implied that passive and unsophisticated programing is ineffective for achieving behavioral development. Results also implied that the BSAB scales could be used as a paradigm for development and evaluation of a training program with specific behavioral goals. (MC)",

        "description":"A 3-year Title III project in Union, New Jersey involved screening of 869 incoming kindergarten children in 1967 and 840 children in 1968, subsequent identification of children's perceptual difficulties, and remediation. The children were screened in areas of perceptual-motor match, auditory dynamics, associative processes, and gross-motor coordination. Data on socioeconomic background, birth, and developmental history were collected through parent interviews and a questionnaire. Children who received scores in the lowest 5% of one or more developmental areas or whose total score was in the lowest 10% bracket were selected for intensive training from the 1967 class. The same selection procedure was used for the 1968 class; through children in the lowest 20% level were included.  First year children received training through diagnostic teaching for 1/2 hour of perceptual activities four days per week. Also, the perception teachers worked with each kindergarten class 1 day per week and were observed by kindergarten teachers. During the second year only experimental groups were given intensive training. Four research studies were conducted during each year. First year project results indicated that a significant mean difference existed between pretest and posttest results for the 172 experimental children receiving intensive training as compared with 500 children receiving an enrichment program only. Comparison of pretest and posttest results for both the 1967 and 1968 classes indicated that the intensive training was most effective in areas of visual-motor  integration, and in certain aspects of gross-motor development.

Given is background information such as the relative effectiveness of reading and listening during study, and factors that affect listening comprehension such as learner characteristics. The program's purpose is described to include study and identification of behavioral and procedural factors related to efficient study through listening, and development of a study system using recorded texts and a playback recording device. Summarized are studies on effects of motivation and word rate on aural comprehension, parameters of learning and listening (five studies), low ability blind children's learning, effect of  message length and reference frame on learning, and effects of a prior reference frame on aural learning (four studies). Development of the aural study system is seen in summaries of studies on task analysis, preference of users for written (braille, large type) or recorded texts, a description of the aural study system (special record, record player, and written supplements), and field trials. Some of the major results reported show that a positive correlation existed between IQ and listening comprehension, that listening comprehension increased with grade level, that 83% of 18 college students preferred text materials in recorded form, that students concentrated on one subject at a time, and that 85% of the test group students in grades 5 through 12 successfully accomplished 26 of 30  operational tasks.

Presentation is in the following sequence: attending to sound through awareness of silence versus sound, awareness of surrounding sounds, and concept building; localizing sound in all geometric coordinates and through interrelationships of distance and direction; identifying and discriminating nonspeech sounds through increased attention span and more complex receptions; increasing auditory memory through  temporal order sequencing, increased processing of an oral message, and development of figure-ground skills; and focusing on sound as a response through development of correct and spontaneous language flow, internalization of sentence plans (through play experiences and pictures), and organization and formalization. Given for kindergarten through grade 3 are auditory discrimination, auditory memory, and auditory figure-ground screening procedures. An example of a game used in identification of nonspeech sounds is the progressive moving of a toy animal on a board (like a checkerboard) each time the child imitates the animal's sound correctly.

Among skills evaluated by the screening battery were picture memory, digit memory, sentence memory, letter naming, and intelligence. Also stressed in the experimental treatment were a warm emotional classroom climate, use of teacher strategies specifically for children with learning problems, continual evaluation and planning, and parent involvement. Unexpected findings included the identification of an equal number of girls and boys as potential academic risks, a  high correlation between the Slingerland Test and the Primary Mental Abilities Test, and the apparent greater importance of auditory distraction than visual distraction in decreasing performance of LD children. Differences between experimental and control groups on posttests were not statistically significant but were higher for the experimental group in all but one case.

(from 90% of schools enrolling blind students to 29% of schools enrolling crippled students); What proportion of handicapped pupils received special instruction? (from 88% of schools providing aid to all blind pupils to 22% of schools providing aid to all crippled pupils); In what ways was specialized  instruction provided? (more elementary than secondary schools provided special classes for most handicaps); How many schools provided only one of the modes of special instruction? (many schools provided only special classes for mentally retarded pupils); What proportion of handicapped pupils received instruction by each of the different modes of instruction? (53% of all mentally retarded pupils and 63% of all deaf pupils were in special classes). Tables present the complete statistics for each question by handicapping condition. Appended are information on general methodology, the questionnaire, and statistics on sampling reliability. (DB)",

It is explained that the evaluation design included the construction and implementation of criterion measures, statistical analysis of resulting data, development of a management information system, and development of a suitable cost-benefit model. It is reported that tests (administered three times during the school year) dealt with 398 formulated objectives in three areas (social adequacy, language, vocational readiness) at six levels (from Primary I to pre occupational). Provided are statistics on percentages of pupils by sex and race, IQ levels of pupils,  and attendance of pupils. Findings indicate that language objectives were generally the most difficult for pupils to master; that Primary I objectives had the highest achievement rates; that low correlations were found with pupil achievement of objectives and school, sex, race, physical disabilities, enrollment, attendance, and teacher; and that strong correlations existed between total score and year within level, and between total score and most recent IQ. Overall results of the cost-effectiveness analysis are said to have shown an average cost of $96 per objective achieved per student. Recommendations included the continued development of the accountability model and its application to other TMR programs. (DB)",

The following is an example of a vignette: &quot;Jane can read material which is about five grade levels above her class, however, her handwriting is poor and she is about average-to-above in most other subjects&quot;. Results of field testing in five midwestern states are  given to show that 6,448 children had one or more areas of special need, that there were a total of 10,351 combined special needs (9% were severe), and that 993 teachers spent a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 55 minutes per class checking vignettes against observed student behaviors. School personnel requests for confidentiality are said to have been honored in computer assisted development of a student profile, building profile, and a master list of students for local school use. Discussed are results of validation procedures such as studies involving 24 special school children and 2,151 regular class children which show that the FKSN accurately identifies school children with learning problems. The FKSN is recommended to fill the gap between children already referred and children in  need of special services, and to free special education staff from psychometric duties for more support to regular class teachers.

The children were asked to identify and manipulate toy objects such as a car, to identify a group of familiar objects such as a key or scissors, and to respond to questions concerning body parts, food, family, pets, and daily activities. A total of 1.509 questions were asked, with an average of 69 questions per child. Eighty-two percent of the questions asked fell into yes/no, nominal, and locative categories. Results showed that the pooled echo rate for locative probes was nearly twice as great (57.9%) as the performance on the yes/no (32.4%) and the nominal (31.1%) probes. The findings indicated that a  verbally handicapped child would be more likely to echo as response demands increased, that the children might not have the developmental ability to deal with Wh word forms, and that the presence of an object might be associated with increased echo output in the locative and nominal categories. Posttesting with the same protocol 1 year later showed an echoic rate of 6.1% for the 22 children. (Author/MC)",

Results from a questionnaire sent to high schools revealed data such as the following for the independent variables: 53% of the classes were from rural areas, 53% of the students were black, 68% of the students were male, and 70% of the incoming teachers (1971 through 1973) held only the bachelor degree. Data for 258 students from 19 classes on independent variables (such as academic achievement) and dependent variables (such as age, sex, and race) indicated the following results: females scored significantly higher  than males in spelling and reading, males scored significantly higher than females in self concept and social adjustment, white students were significantly higher than black in reading (no other significant differences on race were found), and age was not a significant factor. Some of the results from interviews with 23 male and seven female former students (FS) indicated that 15 FS were successes (based on criteria for employment, owning or renting a home, and no arrests), that 20 FS were employed, that eight FS were renting or buying a home, that six FS were married, and that few FS had received vocational training. The study had implications for local school administrators and teacher training programs that resulted in 16 recommendations such as providing on-the-job training programs  with the vocational rehabilitation counselor playing a larger role than in the past, and evaluating reasons such as conflict with authority figures and racial strife for student withdrawal before graduation.

        "description":"Presented is the curriculum theory designed for 400 gifted boys and girls, from rising junior and senior classes in high school, who attend the 8-week summer Governor's School (GS) of North Carolina. The main aim of the GS is given to be inspiring and guiding future leaders by providing opportunities for special aptitude, general conceptual, and personal/social development. The curriculum theory is said to challenge gifted students' theoretical ability with up-to-date theories in various fields of arts and sciences. It is maintained that theory rather than facts helps students cope with world views on the new physical universe of space-time and fluent process, new depth psychology concerning human behavior, and new moral and theological doctrines concerning man in the universe.  Differential and learning characteristics of the gifted are reviewed to indicate the GS's rationale for centering on &quot;conceptual intelligence&quot;. Examined in detail is an abstractive model of the mind which requires progressive inward movement from the concrete through stages of inspection (sensory), perception, imagination, and intellection to the undifferentiated continuum (unconscious or preconscious level) where the creative process occurs, and return to the concrete armed with interpretative theory. Reference is made to the concept of withdrawal and return of A. Toynbee. Area II for general conceptual development is seen to include reorganization of the logical structure of thought and avoidance of old types of language for interpreting reality. Area III is said to focus on teaching  students the mechanisms of creativity and anxiety through use of the model. (Included is a streamlined illustration of a lesson in 20th century music showing in dialog form how the teacher leads students through deeper levels of thought to the abstract.) (MC)",

Proposed for federal effort to move successful program components into service is the system for educational research futures (SERF), a mechanism which combines a public-private partnership approach to product export, an incentive plan for federal agencies to identify promising programs, and a systematic surveillance and technical assistance activity to assure export and to assist potential consumers in export strategies. Included in appendixes are tables giving project information such as target population, program and evaluation characteristics, and dissemination readiness: a review of the Milwaukee Project (R. Heber), said to be well designed and innovative; and a list of over 400  publications on research projects or areas pertaining to early childhood. (MC)",

        "description":"The first in a series of evaluation reports gives characteristics of sites and approximately 500 students in field tests of Me and My Environment, a 3-year life science curriculum for 13- to 16-year-old educable mentally handicapped (EMH) adolescents. Described are the field test design, which involves 14 data gathering approaches, and the timetable (1971 through 1975) for development, revision, and commercial publication of the six units. The purposes of the initial field trials are given to be (1) testing to ascertain student success on each activity, (2) observing implementation problems and/or teacher approaches that enhance program effectiveness, (3) obtaining data on students' abilities and progress, and (4) serving as a laboratory for later curriculum development. Major  questions examined are whether students can perform the cognitive tasks, how the activities work, how materials are used by teachers and students, and what student changes occur in areas such as task attention. Discussed are the selection of 10 state sites and criteria for selection of 14 teachers for field test 1 (near end of year 2); and selection of 21 teachers for 14 state sites for field test 2. Given for field test 1 are student characteristics: three of every five students is male; 75% of the sample is in the 12- to 14-year-old range; and one third of the sample consists of black or chicano students. There were more students in all age ranges and more representative minorities in field test 2. Major findings discussed are that outdated tests are the basis for placement of EMH  students, and that 46 of 50 students aspire to finish high school. Included are 22 teacher-written vignettes of students. (MC)",

Discussed are the purpose and interpretation of student data for judging a curriculum. Described in relation to development of test items for the first field test year are aspects such as item format analysis. Functional abilities of students are considered in relation to intelligence and achievement tests, teacher rating of students, problem solving, cognitive development, grouping, and prerequisite knowledge. Explained are differences in performance seen in results of regression analysis and differences in performance  among classes. Student performance is analyzed for the directionality and map reading, measurement and scale, temperature, and environmental subtests in Unit I; and for the energy, food chains and webs, food energy, weight and temperature, graphing, and categorizing subtests in unit II. Results are given which show that performance on 25 items in Unit I was not as high as expected, that students in one fourth of the classes showed marked gains on posttests, that one third of students in nine classes were successful on at least one subtest, and that performance on 19 items in Unit II was moderate (one third of students in six classes performed successfully on at least one subtest). Considerable revision of both units is foreseen. Also, findings are given to indicate that individual  intelligence tests explain little of the variance in student performance, whereas problem solving and teacher rating do explain the variance.

The experience would include small classes, a student-oriented staff, career workshops and an innovative curriculum. This document describes and reports the findings of a survey of student experiences emphasizing five areas: class-related, involvement, sources of difficulty and help, alienation, and student perceptions of change. The MAP sample consisted of 120 students representing 65 percent of the MAP population. Two non-MAP populations totaling 150 students were also included in the survey. Results indicated that students in MAP did have an experience in the expected direction given the goals and emphasis in the MAP project.  MAP students reported that the classes they experienced stimulated discussion, exploration, and continued learning outside of the classroom scene. The quality and amount of help MAP students felt they received from faculty and residence hall people and counselors was greater than other groups received.

The number and salaries of male and female instructional staff by rank are of particular interest. Table 1 shows mean salaries of instructional staff employed in the traditional four faculty ranks of professor through instructor, with data distributed by rank and sex and by level of institution. The tabulations do not include all the categories of teaching staff in institutions of higher education. Other tables highlight the employment of women faculty in proportion to the total. By rank, the highest proportion of  women are found in the instructor category; while there has been little overall change since 1963 in proportions of women, the increase in proportion of female instructors is noteworthy. By level of institution, women are employed more frequently in 2-year colleges, and tend to have higher ranks in these colleges than in the universities and other 4-year institutions. (Author/PG)",

Those interested in external degree programs have a mean age of 33, are predominantly male, married, and employed full-time in professional or mangerial positions. It is evident that external degree programs attract a more mature, better-educated, self-reliant, and professionally more responsible student body than typical on-campus day programs. Convenience of time is the major reason for wanting to study in an external degree program. Second was the belief that family or personal needs would be met better, and third, the perceived relevance of external programs to job  or work situations. Some of the major personal reasons for returning to an external degree program was the development of new skills and knowledges. The second most important reason was to prepare for a new vocation or job, and third, self-enrichment. Practical considerations weigh heavily in the choice of external degree programs as well as in the kinds of programs or majors one might anticipate selecting under this model of instruction.

The interim procedures are intended to develop a national data base on the average annual cost per-student by level of instruction and field of study. The proposed procedures classify students by level-lower division, upper division, and graduate, and by field of study, according to the four digit discipline code of the HEGIS Taxonomy of Instruction Programs. Direct costs are aggregated by department and distributed to level of instruction on the basis of faculty assignment. Indirect costs are allocated to the departments by a specified allocation procedure. The resulting instructional unit costs are related to student majors by the  induced course load matrix, which yields the average annual full cost per student by level of student and field of study. Once each participating institution determines its average annual full cost-per-student data, such data could be contributed to a national data base, along with explanatory materials that briefly characterize the students and the institutions.

It was of interest to determine if this examination could be used as a calculus placement and proficiency examination for new students who have a background of at least one semester of calculus, and who received high scores on the College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) Advanced Mathematics Placement Test. CLEP Calculus scores did differentiate between students who performed at different grade levels within both Math 120 and Math 135. Validity and KR-21 reliability coefficients were quite high. A cutoff score based on the score at which no student received a D or E  grade was recommended for granting proficiency for Math 120. Although a cutoff score was suggested for Math 135 proficiency, validity data for higher level calculus courses was recommended. (Author)",

To this end, the academic achievements of the class of 1964 are traced term by term over a period of 6 years. The following areas are examined in this study: (1) A quantitative general description of relative proportions of students who graduate, those who withdraw voluntarily, and those who are asked to withdraw due to poor academic performance. (2) An examination and identification of correlates of student's staying vs. dropping out. (3) Detection and isolation of primary predictors of the criterion variable, graduation vs. dropping out. The study demonstrates that: (1) Dropping out of a university is a very complex phenomenon and  a better and firmer understanding of this phenomenon would require a deeper investigation. (2) Diversity within the dropout group is a reality, and to combine all dropouts into a single category is an oversimplification of the problem. (Author/PG)",

Recruitment areas for campus programs have traditionally been local, state, and national for staff and students, and state, national, and international for faculty. Although efforts have been made over the years to attract more minorities and women into the campus organization, the results were clear that UCSF had had little success in attracting, promoting, or upgrading minorities and women. In 1968, as a direct result of Black Caucus and Black Student Union involvement, two significant changes in campus policy were made: (1) each school and program in health sciences committed itself to a minority student goal of 25% of its entering freshman class,  and (2) all hiring activities were centralized in the Personnel Office and its responsibilities in this area were increased. The Campus formally initiated its Affirmative Action program by a policy statement accompanied by guidelines to assist campus departments in setting goals. Included in this document is the Affirmative Action program for UCSF, including sections covering responsibility for implementation, underutilization, goals, program progress, and definitions. Ethnic and sex summary tables are included. The appendices include grievance procedures for discrimination, guide to minority-owned businesses in the San Francisco bay area, summary of ethnic and sex employment, and search process report.

The largest changes occurred on the Goal Direction and Breadth of Interest scales. Considerable changes appeared on the Intellectual Maturity, Student Interaction, Evaluative and Academic Enthusiasm scales. The smallest change was associated with the Authoritarianism scale. All changes were in a negative or undesirable direction and were statistically significant. It was proposed that certain specific features of the first term's program might in part explain the results. In addition it was suggested that in part the results could be  attributable to a general loss of enthusiasm and interest that occurs once the excitement associated with the study of a new discipline wanes.

The number of D.O.'s in the U.S. totals about 14,000 of whom some 13,000 are estimated to be active. Over 2,600 D. O.'s hold a current practice license in Florida but only about one quarter of these are presently living in the state. Osteopathic physicians tend to cluster around osteopathic hospitals, of which there are 17 in the state. The separate status of osteopathic and allopathic physicians shows many signs of disappearing. The cost of educating an osteopathic physician is quite similar to that for the M.D. since educational requirements are hardly distinguishable. The actual costs will vary somewhat with location and availability of existing resources, physical  and professional. One point of unresolved difference between the two medical organizations involves the length of preparation for general/family practice. M.D.'s need 3 years of post-degree residency for certification; D.O.'s now require only 1 year of post-degree training. A lapse of some 7 to 10 years must be expected between authorization of any new school and the beginning of practice by its first graduates. (Author/PG)",

A wide variety of learning experiences are recommended for the ELP. Flexible modules of study encompassing independent study, correspondence courses, televised materials, internships, field experience, seminars and workshops, credits by examination, regular classroom study, and credit for demonstrated learning through past  experience are proposed. Some traditional programs of study will be encouraged and new units of study will be designed as the need arises. Student evaluation procedures will utilize conventional methods presently in existence including examinations, testing programs, and comprehensive oral examinations. Other nontraditional evaluation methods, such as criterion referenced evaluation, will be developed. This document contains a review of the need and purpose of the ELP at Ohio University, a review of existing models (including the open university, the university without walls, and credit through examination), media systems, admission and counseling, organization and financing of the ELP, and the pilot study for the ELP.

The first paper indicates that approximately 76% of the mid-1973 pool of licensed physicians living in Florida could be considered in active practice providing care to the civilian population of the state. Hospital based anesthesiologists, pathologists, radiologists and certain others were included. In order to meet the needs anticipated for 1980, a net increase in his active practice group of 4,494 physicians is needed, 3,136 of whom should be in specialties providing primary care. To increase this select pool of physicians by 4,500 in 7 years will require the addition of over 6,700 new license holders, or approximately  960 per year. There is evidence that this large total of new licensees may be realized by 1980. Grounds for optimism may be found in the records covering the last 4 years in the expanding pool of physicians in the U.S. Prospects for meeting the goal of over 3,100 additional active, practicing, primary-care physicians by 1980 are dim.

It is apparent that, as costs rise, projected operating budgets of independent colleges must take account of them. One solution is to look for more income, the other is to seek ways of reducing the impact of the rising costs. The latter attack can be launched on two fronts: (1) making fuller use of capacity and (2) increasing the productivity of all staff, especially faculty. The two approaches are related and interdependent. Whatever the size of the institution, it should set for itself certain targets in terms of total enrollment, enrollment by divisions and departments, faculty teaching loads and, derivatively, student-faculty ratios, for  the total institution and for the major sectors of it. The single most important source of economies in the instructional budget is the faculty teaching load and the student-faculty ratio, which finds its expression in class size. A way to increase income with little or no increase in expenditures is through the recruitment, admission, and enrollment of students who wish to pursue major fields in divisions or departments that are currently underenrolled.

The author is pessimistic about the future of private higher education in New York as it now stands. First, colleges under religious auspices, particularly those under Catholic sponsorship, are moving toward more secular norms. Second, there are several colleges that are too small in size to be efficient and lack the diversity of other institutions, public and private. Third, some institutions in the urban areas are finding it hard to relate to the social issues and problems which surround them. Fourth, inflation and the costs of instruction have led to a cost-price squeeze for the private institutions. Fifth, some private institutions are  mismanaged or are the victims of visionary planning. Sixth, the position of the administration in Washington toward financing higher education is less than adequate. Seventh, community colleges and other types of postsecondary institutions are creating more diversified educational programs that attract more students than the traditional programs. (Author/PG)",

Two professional groups, optometrists and ophthalmologists share in providing this total care. Each must hold a valid current license to practice his or her profession and the extent of prerogative and limitations is spelled out in practice acts recorded in the Florida Statutes. Optometrists must complete a minimum of 2 years of college level instruction in a community college or university before enrolling in professional school. The duration of professional school for optometrists is 4 years, including clinical experience, which leads to the degree of Doctor of Optometry (O.D.). Ophthalmologists are basically doctors of medicine or osteopathic medicine. Although most  practicing optometrists use some assisting personnel, the potential or more extensive use of technically trained assistants has been little exploited to date. Firm data on which to establish an acceptable order of priority among the several health professions' educational programs do not exist at this time. Continuing, intensive planning will be necessary.

        "description":"This report represents a natural aftermath to the National Labor Relations Board's 1970 assertion of jurisdiction over private universities and colleges. For the first time, the Board decided that employees of private higher educational institutions had the right to unionize and to bargain collectively with their employer. The so-protected educational institution employee may be a member of the faculty or nonacademic staff. Of paramount importance, the Labor Act grants to employees \"the right to self-organization, to form, join or assist labor organization, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining.\" Highlighted in this document are some of the major problems  confronting an educational employer faced with the prospect of a union organizational effort. These comments also contain an explanation of some of the pitfalls that appear in many union organizational settings, and which, if the leap into the pit follows, may constitute an unfair labor practice, or perhaps more importantly, a ground for setting aside a union election on the campus.

Eight background propositions are suggested; (1) Universities are a special kind of public political institution. (2) Universities will increasingly be subject to political pressures, crosscurrents, and conflict. (3) There are those in the university and outside who say the university should not be concerned with social change or playing a positive role in this change. (4) As a public political institution, universities must increasingly be responsive to social and economic change. (5) These and other characteristics of a university provide a backdrop for consideration of how universities are, should be, or should not be administered. (6) Within the United  States the early political science doctrine of the separation of powers based on federalism has done irreparable damage to common perceptions about the role of professors, administrative officers, trustees, students, and other groups at the university, (7) Political science doctrine about elections, representation, and voting have also had a deleterious effect on university administrative processes. (8) The dual character of organization is a distinctive characteristic of most universities. A model for comparative analysis and a discussion of the necessity of modernization are included. (MJM)",

Many of the faculty believed that the administration should be more responsive to the recommendations of the faculty committees.

These included 38 community colleges, 14 four-year institutions and six agricultural and technical schools throughout New York State. The study focused upon (1) whether the position of affirmative action officers is considered a fulltime appointment, (2) the extent to which affirmative action responsibilities are viewed as collateral duties, and (3) the range of job titles held by those delegated additional responsibilities as affirmative action officers. The findings indicate that most institutions view affirmative action responsibilities as collateral duties. Only three community colleges located in New York City and one four-year college  have fulltime affirmative action officers; seven community colleges had not yet identified individuals to function in this role. Those serving as affirmative action officers have a variety of job titles, including president, academic dean, and personnel director. Very few institutions have members of their faculty functioning in this position. (Author)",

        "description":"To aid the faculty of the City University of New York (CUNY) in determining if they wish to be represented by either of two exclusive collective bargaining agencies or to maintain professional self-representation is the purpose of this report. Unionization and collective bargaining are relatively new concepts in American education, but being one of the largest state university systems in the country, the results of the City University election are of critical importance. This review covers the significance of the election, the Taylor Law (Public Employees Fair Employment Act), the importance of determining bargaining agents, the possibility of a run-off election, a description of dual voting and collective bargaining, the scope of the bargaining issues, and finally, the  importance of every faculty member voting.

One hundred and eighteen graduate students were administered an attitude scale with five positions of equal value used to determine the degree of fear. Results indicated: (1) males and females showed little difference in fear expressed toward the course; (2) no significant differences were found between the older and younger students; (3) elementary and secondary teachers expressed no mean fear differences of significance; (4) the  significance in differences between those in education and others may be related to the &quot;person-oriented, thing-oriented concepts&quot;; (5) the difference in fear expressed was not significant between those who had many graduate hours and those who had few; and (6) there was no significant difference shown between teachers who had little or a great deal of experience.

The economic boom over the last two years has substantially removed the need for many states to consider new revenue measures. In fact, several states have reduced taxes. However, the economic book period is generally thought to be coming to an end in early 1974. The authors venture to predict a return to a period of revenue shortages that will last at least for the remainder of the 1970s. This report is intended for those who are responsible for maintaining an adequate flow of revenue at the state and local level. In their search for new revenue, states may  simultaneously pursue objectives of developing more progressive tax systems in the interest of greater equity and adequacy in the financing of education and other public services. Statistical tables are presented. (Author/PG)",

The department chairman's primary duties should be: (1) representation of the department to the college or university; (2) representation of the administration of the college or university to the department; (3) exercise of leadership to provide analysis, options, and alternatives in the most important decisionmaking of the institution, that is, the selection and advancement of personnel; and (4) the persistent and careful sifting of departmental agenda, particularly items concerning program planning and  effective performance. The author then presents some items for departmental agenda, including: (1) The department should clearly formulate its purpose as related to those of the institution; (2) Has the department considered its part in a 3-year degree program? (3) Is the department in a position to consider the advantages and possibilities of cooperative education? and (4) Is the department concerned about the literacy of its students? (Author/PG)",

        "description":"Urban problems are enormously varied and they are related to every field of teaching and research in universities. There are few areas of liberal and professional training where the interests of the university and the needs of the city do not interrelate. It was to help answer these problems that the Urban Involvement of Higher Education Conference was held on March 1, 1974. This address from the conference is divided into 2 areas: the need for a new theoretical base for colleges and universities; and the relationship of the human make-up of education institutions to urban development. There are no institutions in the U. S. today that are closer to the total range of delivery systems--medicine, technology, associated health fields, law, communications, social work, education,  recreation and culture--than the urban universities. For the university to be involved in the urban community, the institution must recognize the multifaceted character of the community and the types of training and education that it is capable of offering. In order to interface successfully with the urban community, the institution will need to strengthen relationships with city government. (Author/PG)",

Respondents were seniors expecting to graduate in spring 1972 (N=240) or spring 1973 (N=209); men outnumbered women, 263 to 186. With the exception of one page, the 1972 and 1973, 14-page questionnaires were identical. The data from the two years are combined in the report; statistical analyses revealed few differences between the responses of sex or year groups. Topics were: an assessment of their college experiences--courses, faculty, and various activities; problem areas; the ideal university; educational, curricular, and career plans; expected future activities; and expectations and preferences regarding some aspects of their life style. Conclusions included: (a) attending college was a generally positive  experience for these respondents. They experienced both intellectual and personal growth, and they would have the ideal university continue to help students to grow in similar ways; (b) SUNY/B clearly had an impact on these seniors. Academic activities were among the most important contributors to their personal interpersonal, and intellectual growth. The four other contributors of major importance (personal reading, friendships, meeting people, and informal, impromptu discussions) were no doubt facilitated by the social environment of the university, although the extent of the university's initiative in facilitating nonacademic experiences remains nuclear.

The four broad questions posed to committee were: (1) Is there a need for more opportunities for legal education? (2) Does the State of Texas have need for more practicing attorneys and/or legally-trained persons? (3) What are the employment opportunities for persons with legal education; and (4) What is the present cost of legal education and what would be the projected costs to the  State for the expansion of legal education? To answer the broad questions the Coordinating Board had asked, the committee embarked on two major independent studies: (1) to determine how many qualified Texas residents are seeking admission to Texas law schools only to be denied, and (2) to determine the employment opportunities for graduates of Texas law schools, as perceived by members of Texas law firms. The committee also studies: costs of setting up law libraries, costs of law school facilities, status of parttime legal education, law courses offered outside law schools, and accessibility of legal assistance to the poor and the middle class.

Yet, little is known of the particular needs of married students and changes in this segment of the University population. This paper is concerned with measuring the changing married student population at the University of California, changes resulting from both enrollment growth and alternative life styles. This study is intended to provide some benchmarks for measuring and forecasting the population impact of married students and their families on University communities. As noted in the report, in the past seven years there has been a gradual decrease in the percentages of students who are married and a sharp  decrease in the family size of these students. This knowledge should serve as an early warning system for those concerned with developing housing, and with planning for community facilities such as schools and child-care centers. Knowing more about married students and their changing family sizes will help decisionmakers to be more responsibe to meeting their needs in campus/community planning. (Author/PG)",

Two analyses were conducted. The first was a three-factor MANOVA with school, sex, and congruency level as the independent variables.

        "description":"This study is a secondary analysis of data from recent surveys of faculty and students in 89 American colleges and universities. It explores undergraduate socialization in academic departments, focusing on the impacts of student and faculty norms concerning the desirability of liberal vs. vocational education as outcomes of college, and primary social interaction among faculty and students. Covariance analysis is used to investigate five values similar to those in the Cornell Values Study. The findings indicate that departmental faculty contact is more consistently influential than peer ties, having similar, positive effects for both sexes on three of the five values- helping others, creativity, career eminence. This suggests lower salience of peer influences in departments  relative to other college settings. Educational norms, while not as important as primary interaction, are more influential for men than women. When the joint effects of norms and social relationships are examined, faculty contact continues to be the most influential variable, regardless of norms. Only for women's creativity orientations is the strong influence of faculty contact reduced by peer ties, regardless of those peers' norms. Findings are interpreted with respect to differential styles by sex of organizational behavior and their implications for undergraduate socialization. (Author)",

To solve the practical problems thereof, the Division of Educational Research Services at the University of Alberta attempted to use a universal dot dictionary, but this solution was not feasible for two reasons: Coursewriter input cannot exceed 250 characters per statement and a dot dictionary is a combersome solution for authors. An emphasis therefore was put on developing the Macro-Graphic System. This system has two most important features. They are: 1) any graphic display can be set up on the CRT without the need for dictionary core-areas as set up in the 1500 System; 2) it is easier for an author to learn to use this system than it is for him to master the existing 1500 dictionary graphic  system. In addition, more courses can be supported simultaneously on this system. A Coursewriter course, called DRAW, along with two special purpose functions DRAWX and DRAWY have been developed to prepare macro-graphics. (CH)",

        "description":"The purpose of the study described here was to 1) investigate teacher attitude toward the present state of closed circuit instructional television as revealed through a questionnaire administered in the Fremont Union High School District; and 2) to make recommendations that would encourage greater utilization of this medium. Responses to the 23-item questionnaire were obtained from 79 percent of the 150 teachers sampled. Highly favorable statements were: 1) a function of TV in the classroom is the improvement of instruction; 2) there are some courses being taught that would be more effective if some units were supplemented by TV; 3) TV teaching guides explaining content, suggested uses, etc., should be available on all video taped programs and telelessons. Highly unfavorable  statements were: 1) TV utilization limits and reduces the curriculum; 2) we should have one TV studio at the district rather than one at each school; 3) TV in our school impairs the normal teacher-student relationship. Most other statements fell into an &quot;uncertain&quot; category. Significant differences between sexes, ages, schools, and teaching experiences were observed for some statements. On the basis of the results, 11 specific recommendations were made. (CH)",

The feasibility of using these Telex systems for on-line accession of computer based information systems was investigated in this report. Comparisons between the Telex system and the Teletypewriter or Teleprinter system now in use reveal that the costs of the Telex system are less than the Teleprinter system. However, the Telex system is one third slower and more errors result. Other features such as computing costs, data retrieved and types of messages are comparable. An examination of technical aspects show that the difficulties are not unsurmountable. Appropriate hardware is available, but existing software would need to be modified. It is recommended that the feasibility of  using the Telex system be further investigated in a real experiment.

During the period, the Network has experienced an excellent growth of membership, currently having 34 industry and four educational organizations affiliated. Each quarter some 40-45 graduate engineering and science courses are offered by Stanford faculty and many guests. Some videotaped courses are also available for use by auditors at distant locations. Member organizations have been finding this plan valuable as a  source of technical updating, crosstraining, or retraining for their professional staff. While doing fulltime work at network member organizations, the Television students can take the program for credit or non-credit. Originally the ratio was 85 percent credit seeking to 15 percent non-credit students; now 28 percent of the students are seeking credit with 72 percent participating in the non-credit categories.

There is strong evidence that the budgeting technique used can affect management potential. About 80% of total libraries use traditional line item or lump sum techniques, in which the library budget is an integral part of the university budget and must reflect the library as only one of many cost centers of the parent organization. Some universities are experimenting with performance budgeting, basing their expenditures primarily on measurable units of performance. Some are moving toward either program budgeting, based on service provided or what is called the Planning, Programming, Budgeting  System (PPBS), which applies the concepts of both the program and performance budget methods. Others are using formula budgeting--a line-item technique based on quantitative models for fund allocation. For the most part, formula budgeting is being imposed on libraries from the outside, usually by state legislatures. Many parent institutions prefer formula over other budget techniques. (CH)",

The library staff members who prepare deposit collections must know the needs and interests of the people they are serving. Each collection should be tailored to the location in which it is placed, suiting the needs of those who will encounter it there. Steps in creating deposit collections include determining appropriate locations within the community, obtaining the proprietors' cooperation, compiling and  displaying the collection, and collection maintenance. Depending on the type of deposit collection and its location, costs can vary from about $5 to $50 per collection.

Gaining the support of local decision-makers was also considered to be basic to the success of the project. To achieve the objectives, an average of 50 teachers of the Adult Basic Education participated either directly or indirectly in a part of the year's program.

        "description":"Two agencies of the Columbia, South Carolina community, the Richland County Public Library and the Adult Education office of Richland County School District One, merged their efforts to better serve clients and potential clients of the Adult Basic Education (ABE) program of District One in 1972-73 with the support of a grant channeled through Morehead State University, Morehead, Kentucky. The grant was made so that the project could show how undereducated adults could become greater users of library facilities. Specific objectives included the coordination of library services during ABE class time; needs assessment of ABE students; coordination of ongoing library and ABE services at the two state mental hospitals, recruitment of undereducated adults to ABE and to public library  services and the establishment of the library habit in ABE students. Appended are case studies, circulation records, plans for library service, a list of books checked out, tabulation of student interest, and responses of ABE teachers to a questionnaire. (Author/CH)",

        "description":"The West Virginia project has, in the past year, tried to establish definitive areas of mutual responsibility and to develop specific objectives towards coordinating public libraries and Adult Basic Education (ABE). Specific objectives designed to coordinate services included community agency referral, selection of materials, identification of the information material needs of ABE students and teachers, recruitment, inter-agency cooperation, library orientation transportation for ABE students. Gaining the support of local decision-makers was also considered basic to the success of the project. Five ABE classes and four learning centers with a total of approximately 200 adults in designated areas of Cabell, Wayne and Putnam counties participated in the project. An average of 35  ABE teachers were either directly or indirectly a part of the year's program. The Western Counties Library, six branches and two bookmobiles, cooperated with the model center to make service more effective. The project services to ABE centers were provided on a continual basis since West Virginia ABE classes and learning centers operate on a year-round basis. (This report describes activities, analyzes the data, and explains what happened as a result of coordination and expansion of services. All evidential materials are included in the latter half of the report.) (Author)",

        "description":"This document is a supplement to the first edition of the Long-Range Program for Library Development in Mississippi (ED 070 483) which was issued in June 1972. The original document outlined a comprehensive program covering the five fiscal years 1973 through 1977, for step-by-step development of library service adequate to meet the needs of the people of the state. As the first fiscal year of the plan approached its end on June 30, 1973, a review was made. It was concluded that the four main goals and most of the balance of the Program were valid as originally written, but that the time table for implementation should be extended over the next five years instead of four. A supplement to be used together with the original document rather than a new edition superseding it would be  appropriate for showing the needed changes and adding the limited amount of new material. Most of the changes concern target dates which are shifted ahead in the supplement. For convenience in referral to the original plan while reading the supplement, page references to the 1972 document are shown in the left hand margin of the supplement. (Author/SL)",

        "description":"The past few decades have been an era of rapid growth and expansion for university and research libraries, yet their standards of library services have declined. Specifically, more people more often cannot get the information they seek from the library. The main factors in this decline in service are the rapidly increasing numbers both of volumes and of patrons and the changing nature of demand. Libraries still conduct their operations as if their strategy were to store and provide access to books, periodicals, papers and other materials. Their current strategy should be to supply information. This change in goals has implications for the library's acquisition, shelving and retention policies. The library's resources may be thought of as Information Message Units (IMU). The value  of each IMU can be defined only in terms of its worth to its potential users, the members of the university community. A Bayesian approach can be used to calculate the information value of the IMU, thus affecting decisions on both the acquisition of volumes and the maintenance of collections. Although developed in the context of an individual library system, this approach can also be applied to networks of library systems. (Author/SL)",

It assessed their educational and career plans, examined the Reform's influence on them, and measured their attitudes toward their experience. Results showed that 90 percent were continuing their education; younger, urban, and middle or upper class students were more likely to continue their studies, but whether one came from a traditional school, a Reform institution with television (TV) or a non-TV Reform program made little difference. Students had positive attitudes toward their Third Cycle education, citing favorably their relationships with teachers and peers, the acquisition of knowledge and cognitive abilities and  the development of increased aspirations. They noted, however, the poor quality of televised instruction, instructional materials and facilities and expressed a desire for more job skills. The Reform program seemed to be working since most of the graduates were pursuing further education. Nevertheless, steps needed to be taken to improve instruction, to guide more students into middle level technical and managerial careers, and to prevent the large-scale migration of educated persons away from rural areas.

The final portion of the presentation offers a series of hints for  implementing change. Among these are: 1) the alignment of the goals of instructional technology with those of the entire school system; 2) the continuous communication of progress to administrators, via reports and demonstration site visits; 3) the involvement of students, parents and other citizens; and 4) the generation of sufficient data to validate the need for change.

The project, Southeast Alternatives (SEA), is designed to test the notion that comprehensive educational change is superior to piecemeal change; it consists of five educational programs-a contemporary school, a continuous progress school, a free school, an open school, and a comprehensive high school. Some general descriptive material on the overall project is provided, followed by more specific and detailed discussions of the two major components of the evaluation--the Anthropological Study, a case studies approach designed to describe the evolution of SEA as comprehensively as possible, and the Impact Study, devised to assess  the effect of SEA upon the schools, the students and their parents, and the community. For each of the components discussions are presented dealing with the assessment strategy, the data to be collected, methodological considerations, dependability of the data, and the analyses to be performed. Some major limitations of the evaluative strategies are also discussed. (PB)",

Educators can achieve a high level of awareness of CAI's complexity, and thereby promote its success if they take the following steps: 1) carefully assess needs and document objectives; 2) establish priorities for CAI use; 3) commit resources to CAI on a long-term basis; 4) study the appropriateness of any existing system before adopting it; 5) release  faculty for program planning and development; 6) train cores of CAI specialists; 7) adjust faculty load formulas according to new needs; 8) review the impact of CAI on other aspects of the school system; 9) integrate all CAI into the total school program; 10) provide the necessary facilities to house the system; 11) offer school-wide orientation programs; 12) plan so as to avoid wasting students' time; and 13) use a team approach in implementing CAI.

CMI, however, is not yet successful and part of the reason for the failure is that the human aspects of the programs have been poorly managed. This situation can be remedied if the systems designers can learn to apply their approach not only to hardware and software, but also to the preparation of the personnel involved in CMI. In the case of teachers, this means that those responsible for instructional design should: 1) analyze the teacher's present actual role; 2) determine the teacher's new role; 3) compare the features of the two roles; 4) wherever possible restructure the emerging role to minimize the amount of change required; 5) develop  detailed implementation and training plans; and 6) construct evaluation plans to monitor training materials and the actual working environment. Once followed, this approach will greatly enhance CMI's chances for success. (PB)",

The model uses a systems approach to organize the human, curricular and environmental variables of instruction; in addition, students participate in decision-making, instruction is modular, mastery criteria are used, the affective side of learning is attended to, and an enhanced self-concept for the student is sought. Students join small groups, interact with an academic counselor, and have access to a Learning Center with varied resource personnel. They select educational experiences according to their interests and employ  the computer to help put themselves through instructional modules whose components include the statement of objectives, pre-testing, the presentation of instructional material, reference to resources, and post-testing.

The CAI was provided by the Los Angeles County Superintendent to 14 districts as a means of improving students' math abilities and to help teachers manage diagnostic and prescriptive information. The California Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) and the California Arithmetic Test (CAT) were administered before and after instruction to both experimental (i.e., CAI) and control groups. In general, the results indicated that: 1) the mean post-test scores for the experimental groups exceeded those of the control groups; 2) a higher percentage of experimental than of control students exceeded their expected growth rates for the period; and 3) the students receiving CAI experienced  growth rates substantially beyond normal expectations. Control group students performed better on tests of reasoning ability, perhaps because the CAI did not stress this skill. Since the program was of moderate cost, promoted student learning, reduced the teacher's remedial work and aided in diagnosis and prescription of student academic needs, it was recommended that it be expanded.

Results of the project after the first year showed it to have been highly successful. Individualized instruction was provided, and teachers were freed from drill activities for more creative work. Most importantly, students showed gains to nearly one month for each month in the  program, a figure substantially better than the national average for compensatory education students, which stood at 5.6 months for every 8 months of instruction. As a consequence, further expansion of the program to 11 new schools was planned for the following year. (PB)",

In addition to motivating students and helping them to diagnose their own needs, this last function also makes it possible for the instructor to modify his instructional plans in accordance with the progress to date of his students.

Following this, the appropriateness of each of the three languages for authoing purposes is examined, and the main general design features and functions of a CAI authoring language are outlined. Economic and other considerations involved in the selection and implementation of a lexicon of operations are scrutinized. The conclusion is reached that it would seem fruitful to design a meta-language based on APL which would embody functions for the necessary  instructional strategies and response analyses. It is stated that such a language would greatly facilitate the use of CAI by the non-sophisticated teacher-author by allowing him to confine his activities to stating the content of his lesson and the strategy of his presentation.

        "description":"The community colleges in the state of Washington are committed to a Six Year Plan to provide computing and information systems support to all students. The system is intended to make available a broad range of career placement information to assist decision-making, thereby humanizing education by insuring fewer misguided students, counselors and teachers. The pilot phase of a program, known as the Integrated Career Education and Placement Program (ICEPP), seeks to implement these goals. It rests on four linear segments of career development: exploration, preparation, specialization, and continuing education/employment. The system uses the IBM 360 Model 30 DOS System with ten files containing data on students, institutions, employment forecasts, training programs, financial aids,  jobs available, job descriptions, job titles, community resources and follow-up material. The second phase of the ICEPP will expand the pilot version statewide; regional networks of four to six institutions will be formed and the batch processing mode of the first phase will be replaced by an interactive information processing system environment allowing the standard terminal applications of message switching, broadcasting, inquiry, data collection, conversational data entry, and order entry.",

Results showed that projection techniques were the most widely used, averaging three applications per district, followed by management information systems and cost-benefit analysis (each more than two  applications per district), PPBS and simulation (two applications each per district) and linear programing and PERT (one per district). While the number of applications was higher than expected, it was still evident that successful methods were not being employed to an optimum extent. Since school administrators realize their needs in these areas, it is incumbent upon training programs to provide educators with the skills required to utilize these techniques. (PB)",

This is partly due to the five following widely held misconceptions about PPBS: 1) that PPBS is primarily concerned with budgeting; 2) that PPBS should displace instructional goals; 3) that it is not necessary to attend to all elements of PPBS; 4) that existing school programs can easily be converted to PPBS; and 5) that PPBS can be implemented in a brief period. PPBS can be successful only if school systems make operational all five critical PPBS elements by articulating program goals, specifying content, acquiring and implementing program software, assessing program effectiveness, and preparing program budgets. Only then will it be possible to test the ability of PPBS to  produce cost/effectiveness data to aid in decision-making concerning the allocation of scarce educational resources. PPBS will produce cost/effectiveness data, but it will require that educators recognize the inadequacies of their planning, programing, evaluation, and budgeting systems and redevelop these elements in a manner which will permit PPBS to become a functional and operational management tool.

The author first reviews ERIC's history, its products, and its thesaurus. Following this, the binary tree and index sequential file approaches to data structuring are discussed, and their disadvantages brought to light. Next, the hash coding method of data base entry is described, the conclusion is reached that it provides the best approach to the  data base. Finally, the use of Boolean Operators is discussed and means of updating files are considered. (PB)",

A control group conducted mediated searches of the Educational Resources Information Center's (ERIC) files by consulting with an information specialist. Members of the experimental group directly conducted their own searches, after undergoing training with the ERIC/QUERY Interface Program (EQUIP), a computer-assisted instructional training package. Results showed that: 1) the choice of interface methodology (mediated or direct) did not influence the user's satisfaction with the search; 2) there was no relation between the user's knowledge of the system and his satisfaction with it; 3) those trained  by EQUIP showed significant increases in their ability to conduct computer searches of ERIC; and 4) there was no predictive relationship between the user's knowledge of the system and the precision of the resulting search, thus indicating that the system was less than ideal.

The overall conclusion drawn from the study was a positive one. It was felt that, despite some lack of information  about specific innovative projects and about research and development activities, the participants revealed a general awareness of innovations, a moderate to strong interest in learning more about educational discoveries, and a clear disposition to support educational innovations and to cooperate in research and development activities.

For this to occur, cable systems will have to be designed in accordance with the defined needs of communities.

The main objective was the provision of audio tapes to meet the individualized needs of pupils, as well as to provide enrichment and remedial assistance. Nine hundred students and 44 teachers participated. Inservice training and workshops ensured at least a trial exposure to the system. Program counts indicated that DARS made an impact in each area of the curriculum, the greatest usage being in social studies, foreign language, and language arts. Evaluation activities were largely confined to attitude change regarding the acceptance  of audio media. In all cases, significant change occurred in the viewing of audio learning as an essential ingredient in increased student learning. No measure of the impact upon the student's learning and teacher effectiveness was attempted. It was recommended that DARS be expanded by the addition of a video component and by its extension to other schools in the district. Appendixes present attitude questionnaires and statistical data.

Lists of critical tasks for two Air Force specialties were compiled and multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis employed to derive their respective job dimensions. A series of advanced measurement techniques was constructed on the basis of the job dimensions and then administered to groups of students. Results showed that: 1) multidimensional scaling analysis provided a useful framework for ISD models; 2) several of the advanced testing techniques were more useful predictors of student success than were the available multiple choice tests; and 3) student and  instructor attitudes were positive. It was concluded that the scaling method should be used to order job analytic data and to provide coherency in ISD applications. In addition, the following new testing procedures were recommended as alternatives or adjuncts to the multiple choice format: sequential testing, figural systems, confidence testing, technical words, absurdity recognition, partial knowledge, and signal detection.

Section I presents a brief introduction to the system and Section II a series of tutorial questions, the answers to which clarify the need to work with action verbs. These verbs are then classified and a taxonomy of questions constructed, providing the basis for the next phase of the discussion. Section III describes the method used to encode the meaning of operations, procedures, etc., while Section IV presents a predecessor of  NET-SCHOLAR used temporarily while NET-SCHOLAR was being built. Section V describes NET-SCHOLAR itself, with emphasis upon the system's English comprehension capabilities.

Phase I collated 17 task indexes and applied them to sonar training devices, while in Phase II the 17 index battery was validated, using skill acquisition measures as criteria. Training of procedural skill was carried out in a modularized, synthetic sonar trainer. Significant multiple correlation coefficients were obtained for performance time and errors during skill acquisition. Phase III validated the index battery against transfer of training criteria, for the results demonstrated that quantitative variations in task designed related to variations in transfer of training measures. A set of predictive equations was  constructed, and it was concluded that these equations could be used to compare trainer prototypes, although additional field validation was recommended. It was also concluded that the battery could be used in research on the interaction of task and other variables. Training method as a function of task complexity was studied, with the results indicating that the effectiveness of dynamic versus static procedural training varied with a change in task parameters.

On making a tentative forecast of these needs, there can be delineated several fundamental improvements needed in library education, including the strengthening of continuing education, the adoption of newer instructional strategies, and the recognition that a single unified program of study is no longer adequate for a  profession with such varied concerns. But the single most vital task involves the positing of goals responsive to changing societal needs and the formulation of clearly stated learning objectives which will identify specific competencies to be acquired.

Part I of this paper presents the question of whether oral history is credible historical evidence. The rules of evaluating historical evidence are presented, as well as the methodology of collecting, editing, and preserving oral history testimonies and recollections. The oral history methodology is described, and it is concluded that oral history must be judged by the same standards of criticism which historians would apply to any document. Part II discusses the current oral history project at Brigham Young University and the relevant need for an  expanded project. A proposal is outlined for such an expanded project, based on utilizing graduate students in history as interviewers and processors, thereby drastically cutting the cost of this otherwise expensive procedure. The appendixes of this document include a select bibliography on oral history and the processing and agreement forms needed for oral history interviews. (Author/SL)",

To do this effectively, various levels of institution staff had to be involved simultaneously and on a regular basis. Furthermore, it became necessary to accept older patients as individuals with specific interests, responses, and attention needs. The books selected for this age group consisted mostly of illustrated non-fiction. In addition, fiction, large type, paperbacks, magazines and newspapers were used. Non-print materials included filmstrips, kits, records, film loops, 8mm and 16mm film, as well as simple games and puzzles. The library became an active place patronized by many older people from the open and closed areas, with most of the materials, print and non-print, in some way utilized by them. A program of library service evolved which offered a variety of activities and choices, thereby appealing to the wide range of individual differences among elderly patients. (Author)",

Most inquiries were for &quot;any information&quot; on a topic, though requests for references, statistics and addresses were also common. Students formed by far the largest body of inquirers, followed by various professional bodies, other groups and local authorities. Half the replies given consisted solely of references; addresses accounted for over a quarter of all replies. In 12 percent of the cases, no direct help could be given. Replies  were nearly always given in a personal letter. In 1972 the average delay in replying was 7 days. Suggestions were made for rationalization of the service, by greater formalization of replies, increased use of handouts, pre-packaging of information where appropriate. Any such rationalization should be accompanied by an assessment of its effects, particularly the effects of reducing the personal elements of the reply. (Author)",

The library collection must also be considered within its framework. Integrated management of the collection implies that all aspects of library management impinge on the development of the collection and cannot be divorced from them. Collection development, in this sense, leads to a systems approach in which emphasis is placed on the information transmitted rather than the physical form of the information. The library budget is one of the factors which influence collection development; it should not be the beginning of library planning but rather the end-product of the  planning process. The book budget as well as the total budget should be based on the goals of the library. The structure of the library determines to a large extent the way in which its objectives are attained. The traditional departmentalized structure based on function and not objective can still be viable if staff participation can weld it into a coherent whole and if professionals are relieved of clerical work and freed to do planning and research.

The attempt to solve this problem by a numerological or Farmington Plan approach is wrong both in theory and practice. This method emphasizes size and discounts selectivity. Library collections should not be evaluated by the quantity of material in a subject field, but rather by the quality of the material. Much published material is simply a restatement of facts or theories already known; therefore, the use potential of material should be considered rather than straight quantity. Several government reports have tried to evaluate Canadian resources but have failed because a more sophisticated breakdown of  information is needed. Massive deficiencies and massive unnecessary duplication still exist in Canada partly because of irresponsible use of standing orders and approval plans. Academic libraries cannot be self-sufficient. With federal assistance, collecting responsibilities based on subject breakdowns should be rationally assigned on a regional basis, taking into account the individual strengths of the libraries.

Cooperative networks should be considered as a method of augmenting the information capacity of an individual library to meet the needs of users which are outside the traditional scope of the library's service. A university library should provide service to those formally associated with the institution and those citizens who are not connected with the university.

        "description":"The objective of this study was to identify specific characteristics of students who avail themselves of the counseling services offered by the college psychological counseling clinic. The study was designed to provide relevant data concerning two important questions. First, is a specific psychological counseling service needed as part of the college program, i.e. does contact with the service indicate alleviation of behavioral symptoms which would impede a student's school performance? Secondly, are counselors in the psychological clinic dealing with different student problems than counselors in the counseling office? Analysis of a random sample of clinic records, including stated reason for coming and outcome of counseling, indicates that the service has been effective for  alleviating symptoms which could interfere with successful adjustment, including school performance. Results also provide evidence to support the theory that students coming to the psychological clinic for assistance have stated problems different from those requesting assistance from the counseling office.

Authorization was given in that year for the creation of multi-county two-year institutions to meet area occupational needs; the bill provided for districts to be formed by a vote of electors. A great deal of resistance to the area system within the State slowed down implementation of the plan. In 1969, a bill passed by the legislature containing a statewide system incorporating all two-year institutions into one comprehensive system was vetoed by the governor because of questions concerning area boundaries and the constitutionality of the plan. Studies were then conducted of the definition of comprehensive community  colleges and the development of a statewide community college system. Another bill was passed successfully in the 1971 session. Details concerning area boundaries and funding were then ironed out, and the total system was fully implemented on July 1, 1973. A schedule and general outline for a State master plan has been set up, and work on the plan has begun. (KM)",

Primary emphasis is given to the program phase known as &quot;Employment Preparation&quot; which provided senior job seekers with specific job-search preparation prior to the Spring 1972 On-Campus Recruitment program in which 49 companies were represented. Employment preparation involved students in seminars covering mock interviews with industrial personnel representatives, instructions and guidance in preparing a &quot;personal inventory&quot; and an employment objective, development of a well-written resume, and other job search techniques. Alumni of each terminal curriculum, except health technologies, took part in one seminar session. An evaluation of the &quot;Employment  Preparation&quot; phase was sought through a questionnaire designed by the author, and the results are reported in this study. Conclusions are that the community college graduate who is seeking full-time employment needs assistance in preparing for a successful job search. This assistance is best provided by the Placement Office staff, with the cooperation and assistance of the faculty. Seniors participating in the &quot;Employment Preparation&quot; phase were more successful in gaining employment commensurate with their preparation than were the students who chose to by-pass the opportunity. Where seniors had strong faculty support through the placement preparation process, they tended to be among the most successful in gaining adequate employment. The study attributes the high level of placement  success to the &quot;Employment Preparation&quot; phase. (Author/DB)",

Results of the survey showed that during that year, 732 new full-time faculty were hired in the colleges; there was a 97.86% retention rate of the old faculty. Of the new faculty, 55% were men and 45% were women. As to racial groupings, 78% were caucasians, 7% were blacks, 8% were Chicanos, and 3% were Asians. The age of the new faculty, as compared with that of the previous year, did not peak as high in the age group of 24-35. The age group 35-43 dropped lower in numbers, and a few more people 50-63 were hired, but their  total numbers remain small. Recruitment of new faculty outside the state remained at 9%. Data relating to the highest degree held by the new faculty showed that 10% of the new faculty had less than a B.A. degree, and 18% had less than an M.A. degree. New faculty with an M.A. granted in 1973 was 17%, and those with M.A. degrees awarded prior to 1973 was 48%. Seven percent of the new instructors held doctorate degrees. The number of new faculty with non-teaching experience was 18%; new faculty with research assistant experience was 1%; 3% had community college intern or practice teaching experience; and 3% had experience in tutoring or private teaching. Former teaching assistants hired was 4%. More former elementary teachers were hired, whereas secondary school faculty dropped to 16%.  Thirty-one percent of the faculty came from other community colleges. The principal subject field of the new faculty was Health Services. (DB)",

A college-wide committee was formed to develop criteria to be used in the staff reduction program for the 1973-74 year. It was decided that, when it was determined that a department was overstaffed, the following approach would be used: (1) faculty and staff would be viewed as two groups, annual contract personnel and continuing contract personnel; (2) in general, annual contract personnel would be dismissed before continuing contract personnel; and (3) within each group, time of service would be immaterial. The following criteria would be used to select individuals to be dismissed: educational qualifications,  efficiency in performance, compatibility, character, and capacity to meet the needs of the community. Although it was first anticipated that 84 professional staff would be released, normal attrition, retirements, etc. reduced the number to 56. Thirty-one faculty were transferred from North Campus to South Campus and Downtown Campus. Of those released, 51 were on annual contract and 5 on continuing contract. Two of the continuing contract employees were administrators. Of the 77 black professionals at the college, six were dismissed. A study was made of factors causing the decrease in enrollment, and the committee recommended specific recruitment efforts to the college to increase enrollment. (KM)",

        "description":"In the fall semester, 1972, a Women's Re-entry Program was initiated at Diablo Valley College. The program was devised to provide a supportive and encouraging atmosphere and convenient physical arrangements so that women could return to the classroom. All classes were scheduled during elementary school hours, and child care was made available for preschool children. The program consisted of two blocks of basic general education courses in which a total of 79 students enrolled. At the end of the semester, students wrote informal essays evaluating their experiences. Every student expressed approval, usually enthusiasm, and no one stated that she regretted entering the program or totally disliked any single course. Three colloquies and a lecture series and seminar were available as  special electives. At the end of the semester a statistical analysis was made of the students' backgrounds, reasons for enrolling, scholastic achievement at Diablo, and retention rate. The Women's Studies Committee proposes new courses of study, new services, and equalizing participation in programs and activities for both sexes. Specifically, it proposes a combined course block plus optional colloquies, a child care center, a women's education center, affirmative action hiring for women faculty, women's studies programs, a director of women's programs, and steps to provide equal athletic programs for men and women.

The major product of Phase I (1969-1970) was a bibliography of resource materials used in 10 courses of study at community colleges (see ED 040 708). During Phase II (1970-1971), a series of pilot studies explored the procedural and environmental problems relating to microform utilization, and probed the matters of student acceptance and learning effectiveness of microforms (see ED 071 662). In Phase III (1972-1973), a microform handbook, consisting of six chapters, a bibliography, and appendices, was developed. It serves as a primer for educators who wish to consider the applicability and adequacy of microform systems at their  respective institutions. This final report summarizes each of the three phases, describes the handbook, and presents the conclusions and recommendations of the project staff. In addition, as appendix provides a reprint of a paper titled &quot;A Medium for Spies. . . . and Community Colleges&quot; by Dale Gaddy. (Author/DB)",

Lavatelli's program is commended for interpretation of Piaget's theory and Weikart's program for theory application.

The measure of moral judgement chosen was a child's standard of evaluating moral responsibility, on an objective (choice based on consequences) - subjective (choice based on intentions) dimension. Subjects were 72 first and second graders who were classified as objective or subjective according to their reasoning about moral judgements on a pre-test. Two to four weeks after pretesting, children were divided into 4 experimental groups and a control group. In Group I (Decentering), subjects were trained to consider both consequences and intentions. Group II (Peer interaction) subjects were divided into pairs, one objective and one subjective child, who explained their  reasoning processes to each other. Group III (Exposure to adult conflict) listened to an objective and a subjective adult argue about which choice was correct, and Group IV (Didactic rule training) subjects were told that one particular choice was correct. Children were posttested one month later. All training conditions produced significant increases in subjective judgements, whereas controls exhibited no change from pretest to posttest. Results are analyzed separately for each training condition, with discussion focusing on evidence that might contradict Piaget's theory. (DP)",

Results for a Multiple Uses Task revealed that children tended to produce more frozen than novel figures and that both types of figures showed a marked increase over grade. Results for a Comparison Task also indicated that the use of figurative language increased over grade level and that under the conditions of this task, children used more novel than frozen figures. All in all, present  results were taken to mean that the Composition Task is not a particularly good one for assessing developmental trends in figurative language usage. In addition, these results show that children as early as the third grade are able to use figurative language effectively, and that a Comparison Task represents one good way in which to encourage children to use novel figurative language.

Piaget's early analysis of children's language into a 3-stage transition from egocentrism to fully socialized speech led to more general study of social behavior. Observations of children playing at various ages facilitated the study of developmental changes in behavior with respect to rules, and changes in ideas about rules. The observed development from blind allegiance to the rule to concern for cooperative agreement was seen as the basis of the whole social-moral developmental process. Discussion of social development is constantly related to the total ongoing intellectual development, so that social interactions are  interpreted in terms of their positive contributions to cognitive processes. Literature is reviewed concerning relationships between social development and preschool experience. To counteract the problems in interpreting these studies (permanence of gains, lack of adequate controls), a detailed review of research which analyzed the effects of specific social variables is presented. Focus is on studies of dominative-integrative behavior, training in independent problem solving through social reinforcement, social learning by imitation, and the use of the whole peer group to promote social development.

The program includes on-site consultation, staff development sessions and paraprofessional training. In this paper, the following critical issues in program development are explored: (1) The drive by consumers for participation in the decision making process, (2) Parental pressures for early acquisition of cognitive skills, (3) Credentialling in the field of human services and the provision of alternative educational routes for new professionals, and (4) The relevancy of child development and sociological theories. An assertion is made that a  professional white mental health agency with a knowledge of child growth and development growing out of years of practice and research has a significant contribution to make to institutions that serve minority children and their families.

Two pilot studies were conducted in this large suburban school district, using kindergartens from four of 17 elementary schools. Two of the schools served middle class families; the other two served lower class families and were eligible to receive Title I funds. Educationally advantaged pupils judged 'least ready' on the basis of standardized test results and teacher ratings were selected for inclusion in the extended day kindergarten and control groups. Both extended day groups participated in the regular kindergarten programs in the morning and received an additional 90-minute period of  structured activities in the afternoon. These activities differed according to the needs of the pupils and are described in some detail in the report. Results favoring the experimentals over the controls were apparent at the end of the kindergarten year, most noticeably in the educationally disadvantaged sample. (Author/CS)",

Families enter the program when their child is 1 year old. At this stage, services are provided in the home, with training provided mainly for mothers. After the first year, the mother and child go to the center for learning activities. Project families also participate in several workshops with each other, and frequent parent discussions are held. Language instruction is woven into all program  activities. The evaluation design includes plans to gather data on children, mothers, and other family members on an annual basis. Control group families will be involved. Evaluation measures for children and adults are listed, including developmental scales, intelligence tests, structured interactions, attitude surveys, child rearing inventories, etc. Initial data has been collected for 34 program and 28 control families, but only preliminary analysis has been completed.

They were tested with subscales of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Ability (ITPA). Spontaneous speech was recorded by inserting a small transmitter and microphone into vests worn by the children. The transmissions  were recorded and scored, using Hunt's T-units, a vocabulary range measure, and a count of concepts used in speech. Analysis of results indicate that both hypotheses were partially supported. Discussion focuses on methodological issues which may have contributed to the unclear data. (DP)",

First, the youngest children showed a large general factor (essentially evaluative) which tended to break down with age. Second, the structure developed from two independent factors at 6 years of age, to four factors at 9, to five factors at 12 and college age. Changes in semantic structure helped clarify some of the developmental differences in concepts noted in earlier studies. (Author/DP)",

This is an important distinction because locus of control will be a superior predictor of behavior if it is multi-(as opposed to uni-) dimensional. Responses of 449 elementary school children, 388 junior high students, and 389 high school students to the Nowicki-Strickland scales were factor analyzed. Results indicated that there was a general factor (dealing with feelings of helplessness) across all ages. However, other factors were not nearly as general across ages. The differential factors may also be sex  related at different age levels. It was hypothesized that the differential factors may reveal important developmental tasks relevant at each age level. Results are discussed with regard to their implications for locus of control of scales in general, and differential scoring and creation of subtests to reflect these factors are suggested as logical next steps.

The results suggest that internals are more apt to be amused by the discovery that they have been the object of a jest than externals are. This display of humor, particularly that of superiority humor, was thought to reflect a distance from the immediate demands of the task which if a general characteristic would facilitate the acceptance of evaluative feedback.

When both comparatives were used, subjects learned adjacent pairs faster and more often reached criterion than when only one comparative term was used in training. In testing, subjects were successful on transitive inference tests only when the double-comparative relation was used within pairs during training.

Because day care is in its early developmental stages in Canada, government, social workers, industry, women's lib, and education each have their own  reasons for promoting it.

Lower SES children generally identified coins at an early age, while middle class children identified various denominations of paper money earlier. (SBT)",

The discussion does not offer categorical answers, but raises provocative, complex questions about the qualitative and quantitative aspects of interdisciplinary educational programs. There are some heuristic hypotheses advanced about the importance of matching evolving professional and paraprofessional personalities, and programs for optimum interdisciplinary education. Factors which facilitate or obstruct the growth and development of interdisciplinary educational programs are discussed, and questions are posed about cost-benefit factors in education and service. Fundamental clinical research is called for  which will substantiate or dispel with hard data the rather mystical reputation interdisciplinary education now enjoys. (CS)",

Focus is on the variability among children in comprehension and evaluation of action, motives, and consequences of modeled behavior. Findings indicated that comprehension of acts in terms of motives and correctness of evaluations both increase with age. Behavioral differences appear to be related to these kinds of age differences in comprehension and evaluation. In a study, third graders who watched an aggressive television show with separations (commercials) were more aggressive than third graders who watched without interruptions, but this difference did not hold for older age groups. Finally, possible effects of age-related changes in the bases  for evaluating social acts in general (i.e., Piaget's moral development paradigm) are discussed. Preliminary data concerning these questions are presented. All of the research is discussed and interpreted in reference to Bandura's cognitive mediator concept. (DP)",

Investigation of situational variables should advance the behavior modification technology in general. One methodological approach towards such control is presented. It focuses on definition of those spatial and logistical properties common to the daily environments in which problem behaviors occur. Standardized laboratory situations were derived from mothers' reports of difficulties in managing their children, from study of the environments in which the difficulties typically took place, and from study of the behavior modification results of a pilot project involving 8 mother-child pairs. After the pilot study, 10  additional mother-child pairs were placed in standardized environments as an integral part of their modification program. Both the development and present uses of these laboratory analogs of problem-producing environments in daily life are presented with data showing their potential contribution to applied and conceptual efforts in understanding parent-child interaction.

Data were obtained from a longitudinal study of of 143 high school seniors from 8 rural high schools in Hamilton County and Story City, Iowa. The present thesis utilized data from an original study completed in 1948 and a follow-up study in 1967. Past research in occupational career decision-making was utilized to formulate a theoretical approach to examine the relationship between educational  congruence and social background factors; the extent to which educational congruence functions in the service of occupational congruence; and the relationship of educational congruence to occupational congruence as it affects far-reaching outcomes of educational and occupational satisfaction. Two generalizations about education's relationship to occupation were tentatively submitted: (1) society has placed too much faith in the specific contribution of formal education to occupational competence; and (2) post high school education has not made the knowledge it imparts useful to students who seek both occupational and personal satisfaction.

The study, conducted by examining 573 school districts in five urbanized States, reports on a 4-year period, beginning with the 1965 fiscal year. The investigation revealed that rural areas receive more aid proportionately than do metropolitan areas, that many individual programs give more help to rich districts than they do to poor ones, and that uneven fund flows from year to year make it difficult for administrators to plan effectively. The report concludes that although overall federal aid tends to be allocated in greater proportion to districts with below-everage incomes and above-average ratios of non-white students, these  attempts at equity are insufficient to overcome the national maldistribution of educational funds.

Coleman. According to the authors, dificiencies and inconsistencies in the study center around the method of collecting data, the design and validity of the instruments used, and the statistical techniques employed in analyzing the information gathered. The presentation argues that these weaknesses produce findings that fail to provide a sound framework upon which to base policy decisions. However, the authors agree that the Report has helped to focus school-related research on \"outputs\" and that it has a substantial number of other merits. (Author/JF)",

The paper then demonstrates that the State has an affirmative duty under the 14th Amendment to end public school racial segregation wherever it exists no matter what its cause. The paper concludes by arguing that there can be no such thing as de facto segregation in public schools. According to the author, all such segregation is de jure because public school officials compel attendance, fix zones and boundaries, and make school attendance assignments. (Author)",

Data on teacher attitudes were said to include: minor modifications in teacher's working area could improve both environment and educational program; and teachers were excluded from planning school facilities in which they worked. Three areas for research efforts were then suggested: evaluation of facility planning, measurement of effective use of environment, and  assessment of relationship between man and physical environment. It was then suggested that funding of improved special educational facilities might come from the government, both state and federal.

The main program contained two areas of instruction in written language: verb vocabulary at a high level of generalization and sentence structure. The program materials were field tested with 78 children in the preparatory levels of three schools. The only criterion for admission to the sample was a simple test of minimum word recognition ability. Subjects ranged from 5 to 10 years of age, and from three and one-half to 10 1/2 years on psychometric scores. Three validation criteria, one final performance criterion and two measures of gain, were applied in 28 instances to the pretest and posttest data from the sample groups. The criteria  were met in 21 instances. Of the 78 children, 77% achieved mastery in verb vocabulary, and 83% in sentences. Each of the sample groups evidenced statistically significant learning in all areas of instruction. The mean time required for the program was 4.7 hours. It was concluded that the program represented a very effective, as well as an efficient, method of teaching written language to young deaf children. (Author)",

Teachers participating in the model were said to view children on videotape in many school settings, review academic achievement by studying records, select course of action on preprogramed materials, receive immediate feedback as reinforcement, study commercial instructional materials, and plan remedial programs for two learning disabled children. Two evaluation instruments developed were an opinionnaire and a set of three microsimulated situations. The simulation model was tested by 17 persons in a small elementary school. Results of the  opinionnaire indicated that the model was successful and could serve as inservice training. Analysis of microsimulator showed significant difference between means of control and experimental groups, and two of three subtests showed significant differences in favor of the experimental groups.

It was found that in general, teachers' major problems centered in direct instruction, not pupil characteristics, professional relationships, classroom arrangement and management, or psychological information. Curricular areas of greatest difficulty were said to be social studies, language arts, seatwork, and science. Data indicated that teachers consistently had problems  finding instructional materials and student activities. It was also found that special education teachers knew only three of the 14 materials presented: Peabody Language Development Kits, Frostig Program for Development of Visual Perception, and Readers' Digest Skill Builders. Regular teachers knew only of the Readers' Digest Skill Builders. Teacher needs for audio-visual materials seemed to have been met.

Koppitz. Mildred E. Huberman and others then investigate food as a psycho-educational tool. Description of project rejoin, an innovative job training program designed for emotionally disturbed female adolescents within a residential setting, is made by Richard R. Peters and others. Patricia Brennan and others then explain use of token economies in behavior modification programs in special education. Next, Robert B. Phillips and Robert J. Thomas discuss pre-occupational and vocational programs for the emotionally disturbed and learning disabled. (CB)",

The 1967 class received intensive training for 3 years, while the 1968 class received intensive training for 2 years. Comparison of pre and posttest data for students receiving intensive training indicated improvement in areas of visual-motor integration, certain aspects of gross motor development, particularly in awareness of body parts. Occasional indications were also found of significant improvement in associative processes and in sequencing. Test results also suggested carry over from training success to academic achievement. Children receiving the enrichment program in the class of 1967 were  said to score significantly higher than the control group on vocabulary tests. In general, written statements by teachers, specialists, and administrators demonstrated project effectiveness. Children in the training program were found to be more attentive and better organized. Comparison of growth scores for children in the training program who originally showed deficiencies in perceptual motor match and/or in associative processes improved most in the areas. Auditory dynamics seemed the most difficult to remediate. (CB)",

The TOMAR was designed to classify children as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learners in reading, to have sound measurement characteristics, and to be suitable for administration to groups of children rather than to an individual. Project development of a substitute alphabet and three word lists equated on meaningfulness and number of different letters was examined. Data pertaining to teaching method selection, reliability, validity, and profile analysis indicated that relationship between classification scheme and instructional procedure was not clear. Students taught to their strengths were found to gain more significantly than students taught to their weaknesses.

The teaching method was developed with a group of six deaf preschool children, and then demonstrated and modified in five other schools for the deaf. The teaching method was found to be suitable for deaf children, 3 and 4 years old, with no previous knowledge or skills in speechreading, speech, reading, writing, or manual communication. The teaching method consisted of the use of print as the major input for the child, preprinted vocabulary as the leading means of demonstrating or expressing syntactic understanding, and child participation and control over classroom activities during project sessions. The  project emphasized the power one can exert over people through proper use of language. Guidelines were provided for making print become symbolic for the children and for demonstrating syntactic functions of words within various sentence structures. An appendix of six stories concerning reactions of both children and teacher to the project teaching method suggested that the method was applicable to analysis of a wide variety of sentence structures and to deaf children at various grade levels.

The stated basis for pseudo-retardation is the person's ability to function at a normal level at certain times or in some areas. In a general discussion of pseudo-retardation, the author advocates that clinical diagnosis of retardation needs to include assessment of the motivational variable. The girl's mother is said to have accepted the diagnosis of temperamental abnormality and consequent retardation and to have reinforced the girl's dependence. The girl's normal eye movements are said to have suggested,  however, that the girl knowingly controlled behavior of those around her. Behavior change principles implemented to change her dependent behavior and intellectural development are shown to be successful. It is concluded that the girl's excessive need for attachment after the age of 1 1/2 years motivated her mother to be overprotective, which the girl exploited with a guise of retardation. (CB)",

Probable reasons for lack of services discussed include: the social stigma attached to being mentally handicapped; patterns of American culture; attitudes of professional persons; attitudes of psychiatrists and psychiatric services; influences of various volunteer agencies; and systems impediments. In conclusion, guidelines are presented for designing a  service delivery system, which include: define, analyze, and quantify problem; formulate solution; identify, quantify, and inventory resources required to implement solution; determine extent to which additional resources are required; develop information base that will justify allocation of necessary funds; recruit additional resources; implement solution; and evaluate solution.

The program's three major curricular emphases were self care skills, language development, and motor development needed in recreational activities. The teaching techniques included task analysis, behavior modification, systematic language instruction, and errorless learning. Field testing of the systematic language instruction area of curriculum was conducted in nine classes for custodial and trainable mentally handicapped children in three states. Four teachers received extensive training and supervision; four other teachers received minimal supervision; and one teacher was supervised by long-distance contacts. As a control, four contrast teachers  used different curricula. Research findings were that teachers not previously exposed to systematic language instruction could, with supervision, effectively use it, and that retarded children taught by the systematic language instruction achieved better on a set of language concepts than did children exposed to a different method. The study was concluded with the recommendation that a number of demonstration centers be developed. (For related programed instruction guidelines, see EC 040 486, 040 539-41.) (CB)",

Distinctive features of the program are said to be: controlled language statements and questions designed to limit the stimuli to which the child responds; provision for child response at motor level, in addition to vocal level; direct, tutorial instruction; controlled learning environment; use of immediate, positive reinforcement techniques; analysis of learning tasks; pretest-teach-posttest sequence; teaching to a specified criterion; specification of prerequisite skills; and programing for the classroom teacher. Manual  guidelines consist of four major areas. First, detailed guidelines instruct the teacher on programing himself for the highly structured curriculum. The second section on prerequisite behaviors for language instruction and the third section on vocabulary meaning and usage include model lesson plans. A master word list and a materials list comprise the fourth section and are the basis for the language curriculum and teaching methods presented.

Students were referred by schools as severe behavior problems or extreme learning disability cases; intelligence ranged from retarded to normal. Research, conducted in two laboratory classrooms, involved the individual-organism design in which each child served as his own control. Research on preparing programed instructional materials resulted in individualized programs in beginning reading, arithmetic, writing, spelling, and language. Research on procedures included development of individual pupil assessment techniques, a structure for the class day, techniques for modifying social-emotional behavior in the  classroom, procedures for training the teacher's assistant and parents, and analysis of associated theoretical and methodological problems. Conclusions were that handicapped children can make academic and personal-emotional-social progress in such special classes at the primary level; that teacher aides are necessary to help with individualized instruction; that the teacher training curriculum needs to include behavioral technology; and that, with modifications, findings can be incorporated into public school special classes.

The video tape project stresses interaction of the experimenters with numerous professional consultants and judges experienced in management, education, examination, and evaluation of multiply handicapped children. Prototype development utilizes Behavior Stimulation Procedures (BSP) which consist of five 10-minute units: unstructured orientation of child in examining area, child's task orientation and ability to perform simple  eveyday tasks, stimulus orientation in which the child is bombarded with sensory stimuli, interpersonal orientation, and interview with person working with child. Ten consultant judges, using a prototype video tape procedure and behavior rating scale, which consists of the following eight behavior categories: auditory, visual, tactile, and gustatory-olfactory receptive behaviors; and object centered, people centered, tactile motor expressive, and oral expressive communication (see EC 040 600 for scale), evaluate each 10-minute segment of the 20 films, yielding 8000 discrete data items.

Subjects were divided into low and high achievers according to their grade in the electronics course. In addition, data were obtained from personal interviews, teacher anecdotal records, and answers to student questionnaires. Findings suggested that media as a sole means of instruction may not be suited for all learners, but works well for most, and is superior  to traditional classroom instruction. Also, results indicated that 1) select factors of the EPPS and GATB (especially intelligence) were capable of predicting achievement within the multimedia environment used for this study, 2) whether the high achiever uses verbal or visual media is not critical since success for him can be achieved with any media, and 3) the majority of students said they liked the system and would recommend its continuance in the course.

A pilot study was planned to determine to what extent library science students choose the same decision pathway in the resolution of an administration problem, to what extent elapsed time varies among students in making these decisions, whether such an in-basket exercise would stimulate class discussion, and whether library science students would find the SIBE a useful learning mode. Among the 33 students in the pilot study,  concurrence in the pathway choice ranged from 1 to 6 students per problem, with a mean of 1.88 students in agreement. The total time for completion of the four problem exercise ranged from 26 to 63 minutes, with a mean of 42.9.

He scores the networks for the inane, if not actually harmful, nature of their programming and for the quantity and subject matter of commercials. Action for Children's Television (ACT), he points out, has succeeded in bringing these failures to public attention and in causing at least a temporary effort on the part of the networks to improve some of the programming aimed at children. However, he continues, the commercials aimed at children continue to glorify such non-nutritional items as candy and sweet snacks and the cartoon programs continue  to portray violence as having a harmless effect. Commissioner Johnson lauds the efforts of the Children's Television Workshop and of Fred Rogers, but, he insists, it remains for the general public to maintain constant pressure on the networks to improve. He suggests such vigilance could be aided by a separate institute to evaluate the total programming performance of the broadcast industry, especially in the areas of its treatment of violence, its impact on the minorities, its journalistic performance, service to the community, and the effect of its advertising policy.

This report presents some of the approaches that are being used in setting up such cooperatives. Experts for the Appalachia Educational Laboratory in Charleston, W. Va. tell how they helped districts in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania develop and test the cooperative concept. In addition, they--and authorities from other parts of the country--give some  pointers schools can use in setting up their own cooperatives, including how to head off problems. The report examines the kinds of services that school districts can profitably share. Examples are drawn largely from a Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory survey of such programs in 46 states. Another part of the report takes a look at how some states have changed their laws to make multidistrict cooperation possible through intermediate education service units. These units, in some cases statewide, give districts access to top-quality service programs. (Author/JY)",

Seven of these projects were specifically designed to help the disadvantaged, eight employed a strong multiplier strategy, ten were structured around some sort of consortium plan which involved more than one institution, and five projects were oriented toward paraprofessional and technical areas. (Obviously, more than one priority emphasis was present in some projects.) Sample projects include: an interdisciplinary approach involving the areas of  administration, teaching methodology, supervision, library science, curriculum, and educational technology; an interrelated program which combined formal coursework with field experiences in three selected urban school districts; a series of six three-week institutes to extend the acknowledged competencies in the organization of management of print materials of certificated librarians to include audiovisual materials.

        "description":"The Federal Communications Commission has asked that companies seeking authorization to construct and operate communications satellite facilities for multi-purpose commercial uses in the United States give consideration to the communications needs of schools. In response to this request, MCI Lockheed Satellite Corporation proposes a low-cost telecommunication service for use by schools beginning in the 1970s. The service would offer satellite information transmission capacity equivalent to five television channels for school use at no cost for five years after the satellite goes into operation, and at a fraction of the prevailing commercial rates thereafter. This low-cost satellite information transmission capacity would be sufficient to provide many combinations of service. For  example: three channels could provide at least one computer terminal full time in each U.S. school district; one channel could distribute instructional television and radio lessons nationwide to schools; and one channel could interconnect existing and planned noncommercial public broadcasting stations. School users will obtain access to the service through earth stations operated by the schools, the community, or the commercial common carriers. Capital costs for school-operated earth stations could be on the order of 1J per student-day for school districts of average size. (Author/JY)",

The number of channels that can be built into a cable system is going up; the cost of added channels or such features as two-way communications runs in nothing like a straight-line equation; the prospects of profitable cable operations are high. At the national level, the Joint Council on Educational Telecommunications and PubliCable are among the educational agencies attempting to influence the FCC and Congress to set basic requirements for educational channels for  every cable system in the country. On the local scene, many communities are framing the basic ordinances which will govern cable television in their jurisdiction. Educators must be prepared to work with both the city fathers and the cable franchise holders in establishing a place for education in the cable television policy of the area. In areas where a franchise has already been granted there still exists the possibility for educators to obtain use of &quot;non-standard&quot; channels or to secure a review and revision of a franchise.

The first of three sequential phases reviewed in detail new developments in Naval equipment technology that influence the design of maintenance training devices: solid-state circuitry, modularization, digital technology, standardization, functional packaging, general-purpose displays, computer aiding, automatic test equipment, lifetime spares design, life-cycle costing, and total system design. In the second phase, three generalized training devices were recommended for development: 1) a digital systems training device, 2) a communications system training device, and 3) a generalized torpedo maintenance training device. In the third phase, the design and use characteristics  of each of the three devices were developed, with emphasis on the digital systems device. Each of them was developed to the functional block diagram level. On the basis of these studies, recommendations are made for the inclusion of computer-assisted instruction techniques as they relate to the digital systems trainer. (Author/JK)",

Ninety Air Force trainees were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (hardcopy, positive-image, or negative-image), and their performances were compared. The purposes of this study were 1) to replicate an experiment of Baldwin and Bailey's (1971) in order to see if their results could be reproduced in a different user environment, and 2) to establish the reliability of instruments which Baldwin and Bailey developed as tools for use in future microfiche evaluation. In general, the previous results were replicated. No significant difference in performance among any of the presentation  modes was found. No significant difference in performance across all instruments for the positive versus the negative fiche was found. Some variation in performance on individual tests was found in both studies.

Three classes in an Air Force training school used microforms for a 30-hour course, and three control groups used the same material in hardcopy form. Findings showed that the trainees used the microform systems effectively and intensively over a one-week training period. The experimental group did as well as the control  group on examinations.

The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has a campaign of its own to bring attention to PBS programs carried by local ETV stations. This campaign utilizes spot announcements on network television and ads in newspapers in the top ten markets in the country. Spot announcements on network stations are presented near the early evening news programs in order to reach potential viewers who 1) have a television set, 2) are home to watch television that evening, and 3) have at least some interest in informational programing.  Network commercials are also important in reaching the non-urban population and, on a cost-per-thousand basis, have proved to be an effective, economical way to advertise. In the highest education-income range, however, there are potential viewers who do not watch network television. Since these people rely for the most part on large metropolitan dailies for their information, PBS places ads in the top ten metropolitan dailies in the country. (JY)",

An experiment was conducted to ascertain whether cartoons, the accompanying text, or a combination of the two were responsible for the facilitating effect of imagery found in an earlier experiment. The results of this experiment failed to validate the findings of the earlier  one in that no such facilitating effect was found. A second experiment was therefore conducted, using paper and pencil rather than a hardware simulation of the task. The results of this experiment also showed no evidence that imagery improves performance.

The executive program consults short-term and long-term data about the individual, his objectives, capabilities, interests, and present status before it selects and arranges blocks from the data base to display for him. Evaluation and feedback are also individualized.

One such area is the arrangement of differential reinforcement for sophisticated reinforcement contingencies. That is, the capacity of the computer is required to determine whether the student has met the criterion for reinforcement. With this in mind, a computer-controlled program was designed to teach young children to classify a single array of objects many different ways. The child was presented with many objects and asked to touch all the things that were alike. As he classified the objects by color, shape, size, and the like, the computer presented appropriate reinforcements. Testing of this program showed it was successful in reaching a low error rate and satisfactory improvement in the skill of  multiple classification. The computer successfully managed reinforcement contingencies for this task which would be difficult or impossible to arrange with simpler devices or procedures. (JK)",

Emphasis was placed on developing computer routines which interpret student answers in their normal chemical form and tell the student what, if anything is wrong with them. Among the forms of answers for which routines were developed are labeled numerical answers, chemical formulas, and chemical equations. For each topic lessons were developed in each of the following three styles: 1) instructional sequences, 2) practice problems, and 3) quizzes with forced review of week areas. The combination of the three  lesson styles was successful in providing each individual student with a unique educational experience. The effectiveness of these lessons was determined by analyzing the data generated by the students while using these lessons and by comparing the exam results for students who had computer-assisted lessons with those who did not.

Full-time TV teachers were more satisfied  than those released more than one but less than three hours per hour of finished TV presentation.

The research was conducted with 15 subjects from each of four age groups--5, 7, 9, and 11. Each child viewed three examples of each type of transition. Then he was asked to describe what he perceived as having happened relevant to that transition. Judges evaluated whether the child had perceived the intended meaning in each transition. Analysis of the data indicated that children perceive these transitions with increasing  accuracy as they grow older. Also, they most frequently can identify examples of clean exit.

The first few pages of the newsletter present a rationale for having ninth grade students learn programming, and some programs which were written by such students are presented. The relationship between machine language and a high-level language such as BASIC is then discussed. A general overview of the principle components of a digital computer and their relationships is presented, together with a discussion of the basic operation and use of a computer. These principles are then applied to a program, MICROCOMPUTER, which simulates a small computer. Instruction and data words are discussed, various instructions  of the accumulator are described, and the functions of the control unit are provided. A sample program including a flow chart and procedures for signing onto and using MICROCOMPUTER are also included. (SH)",

Teacher preparation and selection are described as are the criteria for school and student selection. The program is designed to operate through a scientific/democratic decision-making process where the teachers decide as a group on objectives, strategies, and assessment. The teacher's tasks throughout the year are listed along with details on the support they will receive. Criterion measures for testing  program effectiveness are presented. Attachments to the main proposal chart the differences in instructional activities that characterize the three methods, provide time and scheduling rules and a typical daily schedule, list assumptions held in each method, describe an experimental research design for evaluative innovative learning activities, and present a theory of parent effectiveness.

The authors deal primarily with physiological criteria, and consider examples of assimilation and its phonological or phonetic relevance. Co-articulation and reduction are also considered; they are viewed as factors responsible for assimilation at the phonetic level which may also provide the physiological motivation for a rule in the phonology. Two distinct limits are set on the co-articulation rules: mechanical or similar limits expressing what can or can't be done with particular articulators in a particular time-governed environment, and linguistic, psychological, or perceptual limits, expressing just what any particular language will tolerate in the way of  missed targets before confusion arises. The linguistic limits are within the realm of linguistic competence and should help generate only grammatically correct forms. The phonetics must be grammatical and follow particular rules; in addition, it must be capable of articulation. (Author/VM)",

There is a phonological level of processing which reflects the sound structure of the language; the rules associated with it are not affected by variables associated either with the motor system or the environment. One level of processing can be called motor planning, another can be seen as executing the motor plan, and a level of control operates over the execution of the motor plan. The discussion that follows these assumptions concerns the phonetic processing mechanism and raises larger questions concerning the interrelation of linguistic competence and performance.

The linguist and the language teacher must reexamine language learning theories and make changes according to the new data. Language learning is partly habit formation, but meaning and communication must also be included in the classroom activities. There are three types of drills: mechanical, meaningful, and communicative. Mechanical drills can be conducted without grammatical analysis. In meaningful drills, the student must recognize the characteristic features involved in language manipulation. Communicative drills require free transfer of learned language patterns to appropriate  situations and allow the speaker to add new information about the real world. (VM)",

One possible solution suggested here is a topic-by-topic approach, with the idea that there are two basic types of sentences: introductory sentences which introduce the existence of an object or fact, and other sentences which assert things other than the existence of that item. Chapter two covers quantification; chapter three discusses restrictive and non-restrictive clauses; chapter four considers topicalization; and chapter five deals with negation. Appendix one discusses  formal constraints on the deletion of reflexive pronouns and considers the role of presupposition in grammar in the area of pronominalization by deletion.

The assumption that the first step to economic security is \"good speech\" is incongruous with the indisputable experience of blacks. Blacks, realizing this, are attempting to glorify the legitimacy and viability of their heritage and recognize it as one of many valid means of linguistic expression. The educational frames of reference should be changed and there should be means for developing new lines of orientation.

Differences and disagreements between structural and Chomskyian (and post-Chomskyian) linguistics are discussed in another paper. The author of the fourth paper performs a structural semantic analysis on a line from one of Sherwood Anderson's short stories. The analysis is based on Firthian concepts of collocation and context and  employs ideas developed by Katz and Fodor, Sydney Lamb, and Uriel Weinreich. The fifth paper presents a discussion of subject-raising verbs and structures that accompany such constructions. One paper considers various aspects of the varieties of English spoken in India. The final paper discusses Whorf's linguistic relativity and criticizes that theory in terms of recent linguistic thought. (VM)",

Its use of musical effect, metaphor, and the mysterious and imponderable creates for the trained reader a sense of permanent beauty. The German-speaking, adolescent, secondary-school student is ripe for such an experience, having reached a point in life when his inner discovery needs outward expression. Consequently, he will often find deep beauty and meaning in the lyric poem. Lyric ballads provide an engaging means for beginning instruction, and further study of the poetical treatment of everyday phenomena will enhance the student's appreciation of the world around him. Lyric poetry might even be used to teach historical, geographical, and biological material, as long as its  intrinsic, artistic value is not ignored. Caution must be exercised, however, in the choice of poems. In considering their difficulty, one must remember the abilities of the students, sex differences (girls are generally more sensitive to lyric poetry), and individual capacity. Each student must be permitted to make poetic discovery at his own level. A list of references is included. (RS)",

Classes listened to haiku, discussed the elements of the form, and then wrote their own haiku on suggested topics. A quasi-musical choral speaking performance was developed on poetry of Morgenstern, using solo and chorus alternation, polyphonic effects, and &quot;Sprechstimme.&quot; A brief study of phonology was the motivational device for this undertaking. Grammatical games were incorporated into creative writing; short expressive texts were composed using only nouns, only verbs, or a syntactically free combination of words. Modern German poetry was studied by a variety of techniques, including student efforts to write poetry on  the theme of the poem to be treated, analysis of formal symmetry, concept-by-concept reconstruction of the poem, and discussion of the poet's style of observation and expression.

        "description":"This article discusses methods of teaching poetry and composition to German speaking elementary-school students in Switzerland. One effective device for treating poetry is enactment; children practice acting, declamation, pantomime, and narration while learning the poem. Another device is choral speaking with individually assigned roles, which allows the teacher to rate students' speaking skills, including fluency, expression, intonation, and pacing. Both methods permit the teacher to minimize his active role. A useful technique for approaching composition is telling stories about pictures. Children learn effectively to describe events and actions and to order their presentation. Subsequently, they will be able to write more coherently. In assigning a composition, the teacher  should not give a one-word title, since this is too vague and uninspiring. Preferable is the &quot;framework theme,&quot; a series of sub-topics or suggestive sentences grouped under a general heading. This device stimulates the student's imagination, keeps him from going astray in his presentation, and promotes fluency. Concrete illustrative examples of all the above methods are furnished. (RS)",

Word-by-word construction of sentences is eschewed and is replaced by substitution drills. Word-frequency counts are presented as an important tool in choosing vocabulary, and the advantages of several modern methods are discussed, including: the use of two-track tape recorders in the language laboratory; programed instruction; and audio-visual techniques. Two approaches to written work--analytic and &quot;whole sentence&quot;--are compared, and reasons are given for the postponement of writing. After presenting a  sample lesson made up of dialogues, oral exercises, a reading selection, picture description, and an anecdote, the author suggests solutions to potential problems in change of method, pacing for different grades, and correction techniques.

The program includes teaching strategies that trigger universal learning strategies. The program is divided into four general stages, each stage containing particular educational strategies. The first stage is designed for learning to read and contains tasks for linguistic preparation toward reading readiness; it also develops visual and auditory learning ability and fosters motivation. The second stage, learning how to learn to read, is designed to trigger the learning strategies that students must apply to the task of making sense out of the configurations on the printed page. The third stage, learning how  to read, develops a set of strategies for applying the results of the preceding stages. The fourth stage, reading for learning, involves the general strategies of empirical cognitive processing. These four stages should be recycled throughout the entire school life of the student.

This is done by means of motion picture films which portray three geometric figures in action and elicit stories about animated beings as they move in social space from informants. The responses provide data on the relationship between language, culture, and personality. Two of the assumptions supported by the evidence are that culture is transmitted in two differential lines of transmission and that these two differential lines of transmission remain, for the mature adult, differentiated into two complementary and mutually-exclusive cognitive systems which can be identified by linguistic coding systems. The paper  describes the instrument and the use of films. Details on administration, scoring, content analysis, computer use, and results are provided.

Pre-listening skills should be taught just as pre-reading skills are taught. Children in command of the auditory perceptual abilities which contribute most to listening will transfer these abilities to increasingly difficult listening task, e.g., listening for comprehension. Six areas for pre-listening development have been isolated: perceiving the position of a stimulus in space and time, perceiving figure-ground relationship, perceiving stimulus constancy, perceiving spatial and temporal relationships, auditory-motor coordination, and perceiving the nature (structure) or the subject matter (sound). All six strategies are developed as listening tasks, first in the  context of nonlinguistic sounds and then in the context of speech. A list of references is included. (Author/VM)",

According to the performative analysis approach, the force of each sentence should be stated explicitly as a part of the underlying representation of that sentence. After consideration and rejection of performative analysis, the author suggests an approach which states that sentence force is a function of sentence meaning, analogous to the work in semantics showing that sentence meaning is a function of constituent meaning and sentence form. Three types of relationships between sentence meaning and sentence form (explicit, underdetermined, and idiomatic) are described along with  examples of each. A list of references is included. (VM)",

Rote learning can be effective on a short-term basis, but for any long term retention, it fails because of the tremendous buildup of interference. The theory of subsumption infers the operation of certain &quot;cognitive pruning&quot; procedures in meaningful learning by means of which a person  systematically &quot;forgets&quot; certain cognitive material in order to enhance learning. This perspective provides a strong theoretical basis for the rejection of rote learning processes and suggests, accordingly, a restructuring of theories in second language acquisition. (Author/VM)",

The major aim of the program is to help children develop facility in the use of the language structures of standard English. The handbook discusses the role of language in development, aims of the program, guidelines, and main aspects. The program is designed to occupy the entire school day for the whole school year. It is concerned with four basic problems: oral language patterns of standard English; reading and writing  skills; perceptual skills (listening, looking, touching); problem solving and critical thinking. These considerations are interwoven through seven learning units or blocks of activities and suggested plans. Details on the first three units are provided in the handbook along with suggested daily programs, materials, and methods. (VM)",

An overview of the role of the teacher as potential researcher introduces the principal sections. Distinctions between overview reading and topical reading include references to specific journals, periodicals, and other sources considered to be important to language teachers. Guidelines which identify the most important criteria in evaluating typical research undertakings concentrate on demonstrating how teachers may determine the applicability and validity of research for their particular needs. Advice for the teacher conducting research stresses the need to  limit the scope of the problem and the careful development of an operational plan. A bibliography is included. (RL)",

        "description":"An experiment in the teaching of reading in Spanish to second- and third-grade students, conducted by the author at the Ethel Phillips elementary school, utilizes a modified version of Dr. Laubach's \"syllabic, analytic-synthetic\" method of language instruction. In this approach, vowels are combined in succession with each of the consonants to build syllables. Syllables are combined to form words, and these are then used to build sentences. Pictures for each key word are presented for association. Results indicate that success in school of children from Spanish-speaking homes may be directly related to the concept of self-identity. It is suggested that development of programs leading to curriculum-wide literacy in Spanish is considered by authorities in bilingualism to be one of  the key factors in raising the Spanish-speaking child's level of expectation in his academic achievement. Major chapters in this study discuss: (1) the problem and definition of terms, (2) review of related literature, (3) procedures of the study, (4) analysis of data, and (5) summary, conclusions, and recommendations.

Agreement across cultures on the mood expressed is high, and accuracy in response increases with the length of the expression to be interpreted. The results suggest the presence of a universal emotive language in the vocal channel. Details of the experiment are presented.

Primary objectives of the program were: (1) to introduce children to basic Latin structure and vocabulary, (2) to extend the English vocabulary of children through the study of Latin roots and affixes, and (3) to acquaint children with classical culture and its influence on the present. The achievement of pupils in these three areas was measured by criterion-referenced tests which contained items on Latin structure, classical culture, and English vocabulary. The 1971 V (Vocabulary) subtest of the Iowa Tests of Basic  Skills was used to compare pupils who had studied Latin with those who had not. Results of the survey are discussed with statistical data. Appendixes contain: (1) sample principal's questionnaire, (2) cooperating teacher's evaluation form, (3) pupil's questionnaire, (4) parents' questionnaire, (5) cultural information test, (6) word power game, and (7) an oral Latin test.

A questionnaire asking chairmen and deans if they approved, disapproved, or had reservations about hiring women, found most approved, but two disapproved and six had reservations. Faculty wives with terminal degrees reported both a general resistance to hiring women and specific discrimination and inferior treatment of faculty wives. Women were in rank 1.23 years longer than men before being recommended  for promotion and 1.59 years longer before actually being promoted. In order to take into account the effect of criteria for performance (teaching, research, and service) on salary, a matched pair study was conducted. Matches were independently confirmed. Salary differentials favored men in 20 of 25 matches. A survey of power positions indicated that women are less likely than men to have major administrative responsibilities and are underrepresented on some promotions and tenure committees, despite their willingness to assume these tasks.

Fourteen departments and two schools have no females on their regular teaching staffs; no women are to be found on the faculty in any of the natural sciences, mathematics, or in engineering and applied science, despite the numbers of women earning PhD's in these fields annually. One-quarter of the administrative staff are women, yet there are no women in the three highest ranks, and  65% are in the lowest rank. The rank which is a first step for men is given to women after long and faithful service. There is a strong tendency toward segregated male and female job classifications, with the women's jobs receiving lower pay, despite the fact that some require greater skills.

The most significant finding is the absence of women from the faculty, significantly less than other prestigious institutions. Many departments have no women on the professorial ladder. Women are concentrated in the lower ranks--23% of the lecturers and 30% of the instructors, while only 4% of the laddered faculty. There is also a preponderance of women in research positions, which are marginal compared to ladder faculty. Data indicate that although Yale trains significant numbers of women (21% of PhD's awarded), it does not consider them qualified applicants for Yale positions. This is true even in departments who display a tendency to hire their own PhD's.  Other labor sources explored also revealed pools of qualified women from which Yale could have recruited. The authors therefore concluded that Yale has discriminated against women solely on the basis of sex. They urge the University to recognize the achievements of women as equal to men, and to take advantage of the resources of eminently qualified women academics.

They conclude that the evidence reveals discrimination against women in a number of areas--numbers employed, salaries, appointment level, promotions, and numbers of graduate students. Supporting data appear in the appendix. The main body of the paper covers recommendations regarding personnel policies. To redress the balance in female appointments, a formula for departmental hiring is presented along with other procedural steps for hiring. To ensure fair treatment in tenure and promotion, general principles for the process  are suggested--explicitly specified criteria, uniform application, systematic collection and dissemination of information, public recording of decisions, and effective grievance machinery. To equalize salaries, an allocation of special funds is advocated. They recommend female appointment to key line administrative positions, provision for development opportunities and search committees consider women. They endorse a statement concerning conflict of interest in lieu of a past nepotism regulation. Finally, they recommend that a unit's personnel decisions become subject to college-level or central administrative review if it persistently fails to correct existing inequities. (LR)",

In Virginia, each college and university seem to have been designed to serve a specific slice of the college-bound population, with as little overlap as possible among the institutions. Separate public women's colleges prepare women for traditional female professions. Virginia is one of four southern states that maintains sexually segregated public schools of higher  education. Three exist now, and only recently three others became coed. Staffing patterns across institutions reveal differential hiring of the sexes; women are found concentrated in the lower ranks; women's average salary was lower for each rank at both 2-year and 4-year institutions. State female institutions enroll 11% of the state's students, yet receive 6% of the state funds. In coed institutions, differences in the sexual composition of the student body suggest that women are excluded from prestigious institutions. Specific recommendations for changes are made.

        "description":"On January 27, 1971, Chancellor Dumke of the California State College system presented proposals for a new approach to higher education to the Board of Trustees. This paper explains these new approaches, the first of which is to offer degrees based on academic achievement as measured and evaluated by competent faculties, rather than on the basis of accumulation of credits, hours, semesters, and classes attended. This could be done by establishing advanced placement working relationships with the high schools and through comprehensive examinations given lower division students. The general education breadth requirements in the liberal arts should be redefined in terms of basic bodies of knowledge, appreciations, and skills, instead of units and elective courses. Comprehensive  examinations should also be established in major fields offered in the upper division. The 2nd proposal suggests: (1) putting an absolute ceiling on the requirements for the degree and for majors; (2) expanding the use of late afternoon and evening classrooms and laboratories, and the Saturday use of these facilities; and (3) analyzing cost data to determine whether costs of some programs can be reduced without loss of quality, and whether some programs should be discontinued. A September 1971 report on the status of some projects initiated on the basis of these proposals is included. (AF)",

In addition to the questionnarie, the presidents received a 3 page enclosure with information on the D.A. degree. Of the 181 institutions contacted, 151, or 80.7 percent returned useable replies. The majority of the responses were favorable to questions concerning approval of the degree; willingness to hire, pay, and promote D.A. holders on an equal basis with Ph.D.'s; allowing D.A.'s to teach all disciplines at all 4 undergraduate-year levels; adequacy of preparation for  undergraduate teaching; and administrator-perceived prestige. Four out of 5 respondents felt that the Ph.D. dissertation was not a sine qua non for undergraduate teaching. Only in faculty-perceived prestige did the D.A. fall considerably below the Ph.D. Among the levels of institutions, the doctoral institutions were least favorable and the 2-year colleges most favorable in their attitudes toward the D.A.

A review of some of the literature indicated that most past efforts to evaluate college teaching had used some sort of rating form and the results were quite ambiguous. However, 3 studies using the critical incident technique showed some promise for developing an evaluation device and that technique was used for this study. Students at Georgia Institute of Technology collected some 3,000 incidents describing \"best\" and \"worst\" teachers. These incidents were categorized into behavioral areas describing the dimensions of effective and ineffective teaching. The results were quite similar to those from other critical incident studies. The general conclusion was  that a taxonomy of teaching behaviors has been isolated and that these behaviors can be described using the behavioral statements contained in the body and appendices of this report. The behavioral statements can be used to describe effective and ineffective teaching behaviors as seen by students. Further research is needed to establish the psychometric characteristics of the behavioral items. (Author/AF)",

The procedure in use appears to be working smoothly and suffers little abuse. Aside from physical education, courses taught under this system primarily are taken by seniors. The number of courses elected for pass-fail grading is small: 3.3 percent of total grades. Primary results indicate the students taking courses on pass-fail performed better in quarterly grade average than other students. Studies of students exercising this option show that the number of courses authorized to be taken is usually limited: (a) by number of courses allowed, and (b) by year of student. Results from extensive surveys at Princeton and the University of Southern Illinois indicate that students  suffer some loss in motivation in their pass-fail courses, and possibly as a result they learn somewhat less. While students who have a pass- fail option will take a few additional courses which they might otherwise have missed, still a willingness to explore and try new areas is not assured by pass-fail grading.

Tuition and required fees for residents (of the respective state or district) for 1971-72 vary from $70 at the District of Columbia Teachers College and The City University of New York to $2,800 at Cornell University. Rates for nonresident students vary from $175 at the University of Guam to $2,800 at Cornell University. Room rates  vary from $141 at Idaho State University to $780 at the University of Toledo. Board rates vary from $288 at California State College to $900 at the University of Alaska. Over 67% of the approximately 370 institutions report a tuition and required fees increase over 1970-71, ranging up to $350 for residents (University of Connecticut and Central Connecticut State College) and $1,000 for nonresidents (Prairie View A &amp; M College, Texas). Eight of the institutions report a tuition and required fees decrease. (HS)",

The report shows that median prices have increased in 1971-72 over 1970-71 costs for both resident and nonresident students. Tuition and required fees at NASULGC institutions have risen 8.80% for residents and 16.99% for nonresidents. Room rates have increased 2.28% and board rates 7.63%. Tuition and required fees at AASCU institutions have risen 8.28% for residents and 4.04% for nonresidents. Room rates have increased 3.93% and board rates 4.25%. The major reasons for this cost increase are: (1) inflation; (2)  maintenance of current level of program quality; and (3) inadequate appropriations from state legislature. The lowest charge for resident tuition and fees among these public universities was $70, the amount charged by District of Columbia Teachers College and City University of New York. The highest cost was at NASULGC member Cornell University ($2,800). In a regional comparison of NASULGC member institutions, the Southeast was the least expensive and New England the most expensive. In a comparison of AASCU member institutions, the Southeast region registered the lowest charges and the Middle Atlantic region the highest for residents, while the West was the highest for nonresidents.

The survey also shows that faculty and student interest in the D.A. degree is much greater in those institutions that currently offer the D.A. degree, are  definitely planning to offer it, or are considering the possibility, than those which are not.

A vital one is the faculty and how well they support the college's mission, and if they do not, why not? Prior empirical evidence generally indicates ambivalence in faculty views. This report attempts to measure the extent of agreement with the college philosophy among faculty members in three Pennsylvania colleges with 2-year programs. Answers to a questionnaire sent to a random faculty sample indicate that community college faculty were somewhat more positive to the philosophy than were junior college and commonwealth campus faculty, but, in general, faculty are ambivalent, in their support of their institutions. Sources of ambivalence in the faculty member's  milieu are his personal perceptions of the college goals, the behavior and attitudes of the group, and values derived from past experiences. Interaction of these often conflicting forces causes confusion and ambivalence toward the goals of the community college. The college must find ways to reduce such incongruences. To achieve goal compatibility, colleges might well (1) review their recruiting policies; (2) accept and appreciate diversity in faculty behavior; and (3) understand the need for diversity in faculty philosophy among the three types of institution, for each serves a unique clientele and purpose. Educating faculty to 2-year college goals should ideally precede their appointment, and a pre-service summer institute is recommended. (MN)",

Class size was held to thirty students and some flexibility in schedule and format was allowed. After  the first session of composition and American government, students' subjective, written evaluation of the two courses was extremely positive. Concrete endorsement of the program came from the high rate of return for a second session of the courses. Future planning includes the present courses intact, plus an additional course in humanities. Although adequate planning and cooperation are necessary, the ultimate success of an honors program must come from enthusiastic and inspirational instructional leadership. Also, if honors work is to be special, the need for special administrative arrangements must be acknowledged and reconciled. (MN)",

The particular approach advocated for the experimental instructional system was based on the following: (1) students' egos must be involved in their work to be successful, (2) multiple instructional methods are the most successful, (3) instruction must center on contemporary issues, (4) basic information must be presented, (5) irrelevance must be countered, (6) the model system must be replicable, (7) academic and social aspects should be emphasized, (8) model city neighborhood liaison should be stressed, (9) ghetto problem sensors must be built in, and (10) assessment methods relevant to the students should be used.

        "description":"This was the first phase of a continuing evaluation of a Community College Studies Program designed to provide educational opportunities for the academically under-prepared student. The subject college had always had a remedial program of some type, but it only recently conducted formal program evaluations. The most recent was during the 1967-68 academic year. Using a randomly-selected control group for comparison purposes, the study demonstrated that the effects of remedial efforts were virtually indistinguishable from those obtained in the regular college courses. As a result of those findings, it became necessary to make a choice--either to eliminate remedial efforts or to restructure them to produce measurable differences. The latter was chosen and long-range evaluation was  included in the program. This culminated in the Community College Studies Program (CCS), begun in the 1969 fall term. Discussions of the evaluation design and procedure centered on: (1) selection of population, (2) selection of tests, and (3) selection of research design. The evaluation results were discussed according to (1) a 16 personality factor test, (2) a self-rating scale, (3) a deviation score, (4) the Florida Twelfth Grade Test, (5) attrition, (6) the distribution of grades, and (7) a college student questionnaire. Program organization and a detailed description of it were included in the appendix. (Author/AL)",

Such teachers are not being created by present pre-service and in-service training or being developed at colleges and universities. The place to make subject-area specialists into talented instructors is the community college itself. A first year of teaching can be a metamorphosis into quality teaching through a highly instructive internship. This internship model suggests that first-year teachers spend an intensive month in pre-service training under the direction of a Professional Development Officer. They should then have a light teaching load the first semester to allow time for extensive  in-service training with a master teacher and progress in the second semester to more teaching responsibilities with exposure to additional master teachers and training. An example of dollar cost and long-term savings applied to Contra Costa Junior College District (California) is provided along with specifications for implementation of the plan. (MN)",

With this reach for necessary supplemental resources have come both explicit and subtle inducements encouraging the community colleges to develop specific types of programs. To examine the real and imagined impact of federal financing on community college operations, the Center for the Development of Community College Education at the University of Washington cooperated with interested trustee groups in Washington, Oregon, and California to organize an educational \"federal funding\" conference for trustees and administrators of  public community colleges. The topics explored at this conference included: (1) the funding crisis endemic in higher education; and (2) the problems and pitfalls as well as the advantages of community college grantsmanship and the structure, philosophy and operational problems of federal funding agencies.

Little has been done to facilitate a student's task of successfully implementing his college training in the occupational marketplace.

Transplanting existing program models would not meet the special problems and circumstances of the 2-year institution. A discussion of the ideal components in developing a guidance-oriented community college placement service resulted in a felt need to first clarify the role of  placement in community colleges and then to have further workshops to (1) develop the ideals discussed, (2) suggest methods of implementation, (3) develop individual differences among colleges, (4) discuss problem areas, and (5) summarize goals and objectives.

This review focuses on the development and presentation of a pattern for decentralizing the decision making process in multi-unit educational systems, emphasizing community college administration. The multi-branch community college district in theory provides opportunity for a more economical and efficient management and a minimum duplication of space, equipment and staff. Every educational institution should have as its prime purpose the development of an environment of learning--a major function of leadership. The four key tasks of leadership are:  (1) defining the institution's mission and role, (2) building the institution's purpose into its social structure, (3) defending the integrity of the institution, and (4) gaining the consent of constituent units. The effectiveness of any organization is closely related to the quality of leadership found in the chief executive. Strong central control can result in maximum efficiency, economy, and impartial treatment of institutions, but it risks depersonalization, avoidance of responsibility, and lower morale. Maximum local control can encourage creativity, increase program relevancy and further morale, but it can result in inefficient handling of matters of organization-wide concern. (MN)",

The first theme considers what should be done about branch libraries, in the rapidly changing conditions of today, for the greater efficiency and economy of library service. The author suggests that there are too many small branch libraries in the towns and cities in England. The author recommends that the library authorities should concentrate their resources solely for the improvement of the large district libraries, those which are located in obviously important sub-areas, far enough from the town center to warrant their existence. Small, ineffective, badly situated branch libraries should be closed. The second theme considers how librarians can plan library service for the future in the forthcoming local government revolution.

As more and more blind people take their place in the trades and professions, the production of quality materials must keep pace. In answer to a widening need for the development of standards for the production of these reading materials, the National Accreditation Council's Commission on Standards gave first priority to the project when undertaking to fulfill its responsibility for updating, refining and expanding the basic standards encompassed by the Commission on Standards and Accreditation of Services for the Blind (COMSTAC). Agencies or groups producing  reading materials in any or all of the three forms will find this study a useful adjunct to \"The Comstac Report.\" In addition to improving the quality and variety of materials produced, it aims to increase efficiency and cut down on duplication by encouraging central reporting and interagency cooperation in cataloging and exchanging materials.

It is felt that greater care should be taken at top-level planning to ensure that some proportion of the income and credit available is allocated to various services to allow departmental planning to be carried out effectively. This cannot be reduced to simple programming. It is stressed that while planning should control, control should not be the purpose of planning. The purpose o planning must always be the provision of better service for people and that this be done in the most efficient manner possible. Whenever institutions are created there is always the danger of lavishing on the institutions the love and care which was intended for the people they serve.  (Author/NH)",

For schools which have not yet fully achieved their objectives, these standards can serve as a guide for charting goals to be reached in progressive steps over a planned period of time. A quality school library media center requires: (1) the guidance of a qualified librarian who is competent and effective as an educator, (2) the formation and implementation of a sequential teaching and learning program which reflects the philosophy of the school, (3) provision for a library media center which provides  pleasant quarters planned for expansion, (4) sufficient funds to provide adequate professional and clerical staff and (5) provision for continued maintenance of a materials collection selected for balance.

Use of the given techniques should make it possible to move quickly to a stage where there is an interaction between techniques and their adaptation to the available equipment which permits progressively more rapid and sophisticated analysis as well as an increasing \"spin-off\" to assist practical decision-making.

In a library situation young children see most books from a spine-out angle; thus when allowed to select a book by themselves, the first characteristics noticed are size and color. This study is based on the hypothesis that children transfer their preference for a favorite color to book color preference, if the quality of color is emphasized. Children also relate colors to moods. The two colors that were preferred by at least half of the 41 children tested were red and purple. With all the color choices totalled, the preference order was purple, blue, red, orange, brown, green, black, and yellow. The findings indicate that sex does make a difference in  determining color preference. There was not enough consistency between favorite color and book color preference to justify a strong connection between the two. (Author/MM)",

This dissertation examines the relationships between a document being indexed and the index terms assigned to that document in an attempt to quantify the extent of \"machine-like\" indexing occurring when librarians and scientists index technical text. A number of possible relationships between the text and the index assignments are predicted and tested with two models: a multiple linear regression model and a Boolean combinatorial model. It is concluded that indexers in general do not index technical text in a \"machine-like\" fashion and that neither model is useful as a  general predictor of human indexing. (Author/NH)",

From the data gathered it was concluded that, while Howard had made great strides to improve its collection and staffing, it still has a long way to go in order to catch up with the leading institutions. Particularly inadequate are the number of clerical and hourly employees and the funds allocated for these purposes. To move ahead Howard will require a substantially larger library budget, and within the budget larger percentages should be allocated to hourly assistance and  to binding and rebinding. The number of clerical and hourly employees should be increased by one-third and the periodical titles doubled. (Author/NH)",

This interim report summarizes the findings of the Task Force regarding library resources, services, and principal needs. It then outlines the elements of a library service  concept based on the library as a means of access to the full body of library resources in the state.

External evaluations of the three treated and three control groups were used to determine if differences existed among the groups on measures of  intelligence, language, cognition, and school readiness. Each child was tested twice to provide information on test reliability on the Stanford-Binet, Caldwell Preschool Inventory, and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA). All groups improved their performance on the second administration of the tests. Group 3 surpassed the scores of their controls on the Caldwell and Binet tests. Group 1 performed better than its control group on the ITPA. Group 2's performance did not surpass that of its control group on any measures.

The study involved 93 children assigned to four groups who were tested for IQ gains during a 6-week Head Start program in summer, 1968. Group distribution by sex was approximately equal; distribution by race was also equal in Groups I, II, and III. Group IV had only black children with pretest IQ that was meaningfully lower than that of the other groups. Groups were given the initial Stanford-Binet either at home or during the first or second week of school. At the end of the program, each group was again tested. A preliminary analysis of variance of  the mean pretest IQ scores and the mean posttest scores showed that the four groups were essentially similar at the beginning and end of the program. These results indicate that, despite the possible variations in teachers and programs and in pretest IQ, overall differences among the groups were small and random indicating that test performance did not improve. Magnitude of change is also discussed in the study. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document]. (MK)",

        "description":"Freedom in the classroom should concern the schools as much as the development of cognition and skills. Freedom has traditionally been regarded as something that the child already possesses or which will develop by itself. However, freedom is not a naturally developing property of man, but a delicate and fragile quality of mind and behavior which must be recognized and encouraged by the schools. Relational patterns of perceiving and behaving which describe how three different types of children relate to the classroom environment are: survival, adjustment, and encounter. The most immature and closed pattern is that of survival in which the child regards the world as a dangerous place and wishes to keep change to a minimum. The adjustment pattern typifies the child who first  discovers what others expect of him and then produces the desired behavior. Change is tolerated if sanctioned by authority. The pattern of encountering is the most mature and is seen in the child who is able to tolerate uncertainty, can postpone gratification, is curious and receptive to his environment, and is not afraid to express emotions. Components and antecedents of freedom, and their significance for the teacher in helping all three types of children achieve freedom in the classroom, are discussed.

Data were obtained from teachers, observations in the classrooms, and an individual session with each child. Each child was rated on a series of scales focussed on curiosity and other relevant dimensions. Findings indicate that the most curious and exploratory children at four years old are, for the most part, among the most vigorous, searching and adaptive at age six. An additional finding was that from the structure of the rooms, the conduct of events, and the nature of the curricula, it seemed evident that the schools the subjects attended did  not generally assume that questioning and exploration were fundamental to learning. Some interactions were recorded that suggested active discouragement. Such situations have complex, long-term implications for the exercise and development of exploratory behavior, both in children who have been non-exploratory and in children who enter school with a basically exploratory stance.

Poor people share a sense of hopelessness and helplessness, a lack of belief that they can change their situations, and low self-esteem. Programs to train child care workers who are themselves disadvantaged (parents, foster home mothers, day care and institutional staff) should show trainees that what they are doing is important, and that how they stimulate and interact with the children in their care can vitally affect the children's development and chances for the future. This objective can be accomplished by involving parents and staff in decision making, showing respect for them as individuals and respect for what they know, and discussing with  them the babies' preferences and individual styles. To effect meaningful and lasting changes in children, parents must be involved in intervention programs. Such programs should stress respect for cultural differences and for parents' choices on how to raise their children, coupled with constant and intensive support for the caregivers. (NH)",

        "description":"The overall aim of this project is to continue the investigation of the effectiveness and practicability of a home-centered technique for cognitive, language and personality development of mother and child to help break the proverty cycle. The plan represents an innovation in family services which, if effective, would extend the reach of the professional and, in the long run, reduce the needs for such services as participants become more capable of meeting their own needs. The home or \"backyard\" center is the home of a mother in the project, who comes from the disadvantaged population. Workload consists of four days (eight sessions) with children and one day of in-service educational training. Although aides and advocates are used in a variety of projects, the type of  professional responsibility, decision making and role assignment of the non-professional in this project is unique. The research plan of the project, methods of procedure, treatment plan, development of materials, home center, and parent education are topics discussed in this report. (Author/MK)",

Data for all three countries come from representative national samples and present the first opportunity to compare data from several countries that are broadly representative of the respective populations of children. The present data provide basic norms which have long been needed. The variability of height and weight with age and with sex is very similar in each of the three countries. The heights and weights of children in the United Arab Republic fell between those of the other two countries, but somewhat closer to those for India. Heights of children have increased during the past half century.

Some of the qualities of open education are discussed and contrasted with those of traditional school programs. Suggestions regarding the development of pacemaker caliber programs in the United States include ideas for involving teachers, children and parents in the process of change, and for developing  increased independence and initiative on the part of both children and teachers.

The first paper reports on a pilot study of the effect of parent participation in Head Start on subsequent utilization of community resources. It is also concerned with how parents view Head Start personnel and how individual staff members view each other. While it was demonstrated that parents did change as a result of their participation in the program, the measures used were necessarily crude. An important aspect of the project is concerned with the development and validation of an instrument which will be sensitive to these important changes. The second section reports the rationale  and approach to the development of an instrument to measure pre-post changes in parental attitudes, especially in the area of alienation. The third facet is concerned with an experiment to test the value of special instruction in producing more effective modes of home teaching in parents of disadvantaged children. The first step has been the preparation of an instrument of measure parental attitudes toward the Head Start program. This instrument and the description of the study are included as the third report in this section. (Author/MK)",

Placements were highly consistent within and across children in respect to location of object vis-a-vis the child's own body or the other object. Systematic variations occurred in children's placement of the face of featured objects in reference to self. These variations appeared related to testing order and type of object placed.

Many materials specifically designed for handicapped children are equally appropriate for young children without handicaps because a sensory modality is incorporated in the design. For a material to be appropriate for a child, it must be suitable to his developmental level and specific handicap. Various factors to be considered when selecting appropriate materials are sensory dimensions, physical structure, cost, and content configuration. A teacher must be cognizant of the skill levels and motor responses required for use of the material. Manipulative devices are considered desirable because they offer first-hand experiences which  enhance a child's learning. Cost consideration is not restricted to price alone. A teacher must estimate the cost in time needed to use a material effectively, and consider the material's durability. (Author/AJ)",

The report presents (1) preparation of the data of the main and corollary studies for computer analysis, (2) extensive revision and refinement of the specially designed Functional Category System (a comprehensive instrument covering all verbal statements of the preschooler), and (3) analysis of the results. Findings from the main study support significant relationships between some IQ effects and some social class effects as indicators of linguistic effectiveness (performance). Ethnicity  (black, white) was significant only in interaction with some social class effects. Significant sex effects were noted. The corollary study assessed effects of a school readiness program or a child development program and indicated that, in general, no subjects showed significant pre-post changes in IQ. IQ scores of advantaged children (in accord with their initial selection) remained significantly higher than those of children selected from the two Head Start programs. (WY)",

        "description":"A primary purpose of the present study was to further investigate the effects of children upon parents in order to gain a better understanding of the interactional relationship between parents and children. Subjects were 42 middle and upper-middle class parents and their daughters. Mothers and fathers were first observed separately with their child in structured and unstructured interaction situations. Each parent was also interviewed separately concerning child-rearing attitudes and behaviors. Interviews were videotaped. As predicted, children's task behaviors (both dependent and independent) resulted in different parental responses. Mothers and fathers interacted more, both verbally and physically, when the children acted dependent. Fathers seemed to reinforce daughters'  dependent behaviors more than mothers did, but were less controlling than mothers when the child acted dependent. The differences in parental response may relate to parents' differential involvement or expectations for their children. Whatever the explanation, both mothers and fathers should be studied directly to gain understanding of the similarities and differences in parental behavior and the parent-child relationship.

It was reasoned that this curriculum should home. This curriculum was tested on 20 4-year-old disadvantaged children in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. The program was conducted for eight months, two hours daily, with a teacher-pupil ratio of one-to-five. The Stanford-Binet was administered four times during the experiment, curriculum content and procedures being modified in the light of results. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) was administered at the beginning and end as a control measure for non-specific effects on IQ. Total IQ gain was 13 points on the  Stanford-Binet--no better than that achieved previously with the highly structured programs which made no effort to teach Binet-related content. Gain from the WPPSI turned out to be of the same magnitude, thus indicating that the gains were in no wise test-specific. These results were taken as indicating that there was not a close relationship between curriculum content and intelligence test performance, leaving open the possibility that what accounted for the non-trivial part of the IQ gain might have been the accererated acquisition of certain basic thinking skills.

Subjects were 56 Canadian, white, middle class boys. An ostensible peer gave half of the subjects help in winning a prize. The other 28 boys were refused help. One-half of the subjects in both help and refused-help conditions were 8 years old; the other half were age 12. The peer informed each subject individually that he had committed an accidental transgression and asked the subject not to tell the experimenter about it. When questioned about the accident, 12-year-olds who had received help from the peer were more willing to lie and thereby deny any knowledge of the  accident than were 8-year-olds who had also received help. No differences in lying behavior were found between 8-year-olds and 12-year-olds after they had been refused help by the peer. (Author/MK)",

With television and other media, teachers can utilize excellent programming in the classroom at a relatively low cost, an important asset because the rising costs of education have occurred at the same time that the public is demanding more individualized and personalized instruction. Educational TV is expensive but because of the wide viewing audience the actual cost per child of a program list &quot;Sesame Street&quot; is one cent per child per hour. &quot;Electric Company,&quot;&quot;Ripples&quot; and &quot;Patterns in  Arithmetic&quot; are among other educational TV programs cited.

        "description":"Video-tape recordings of the Romper Room program carried by TV station WEMT, Bangor, Maine were examined in an attempt to classify and describe various program elements. Tapes were monitored to obtain descriptions of program activities and to focus on some of the commercial announcements. For the total week studied, more than one-third (36%) of all program time was spent in &quot;toy play&quot; which involved playing with, demonstrating, or exhibiting various brand-name manufactured toys in other than identifiable commercial announcements. Lessons were the second most frequent activity, followed by cartoons, games played without the aid of toys, reading aloud to children and miscellaneous talk by the hostess. Approximately 81 per cent of all time was &quot;live&quot; from the studio, with the  remaining 19 per cent devoted to recorded material, comprised of film, cartoons, filmed commercials and credits. Formal commercial product announcements and program promotion ranged from 7 to 11 per cent of total time on various days and averaged to 9 percent for the week. However, if one includes toy play, in which toy products were prominently displayed and demonstrated, as well as commercial credits, plus all formal commercial announcements, then 47 per cent of the time for the week was devoted to commercial content. All of the toys which could be identified by manufacturer were Hasbrow or Romper Room toys. This pattern seems too outstanding to be mere coincidence. The author concludes on the basis of the data of this study, that a major purpose of the program is to promote its toy  products. A related study is EM 009 321 announced in RIEFEB72. (Author/MK)",

        "description":"The aims of this study were: (1) to specify who the infant-mother relationship evolves, and (2) to demonstrate how the development of object concept affects the evolution of that relationship. Subjects were 19 male and 17 female Caucasian infants from 4 to 12 months of age. The development of an interpersonal relationship was assessed through the use of controlled interaction situations with an adult stranger and identical situations with infants' mothers. Situations included imitative play and speech, creating a stress situation, and leaving and entering the room. Results indicate that the infants did exhibit differential responsiveness towards their mothers versus a stranger. Findings also show that when the infant solidifies his notions of object permanence and becomes capable  of inferring the mother's location from a series of visible displacements, maintaining proximity contact and/or interaction with the mother becomes less crucial. The acquisition of object permanence facilitates the ordering of experiences. Simultaneously, the infant's perception of regularities in the mother's appearance and behavior contributes to his imbuing her with the quality of permanence through time and space. It seems highly probable that it is this reciprocity or mutual influence which characterizes the relationship between development of the infant-mother relationship and object concept development.

Internal control refers to the perception of positive and/or negative events as being a consequence of one's own actions and thereby under personal control. The Bialer (1961) locus of control scale and two creativity measures (Instances and Uses) adapted from Wallach and Kogan's (1965) creativity tasks were employed to test fluency, uniqueness and flexibility. The results do not present a clear pattern of findings. For all female subjects (particularly second graders) internality correlated with creativity as measured by the Instances creativity measure. For male kindergarten subjects, low internality correlated  with creativity as measured by the Uses creativity measure.

        "description":"The purpose of this 1971 study was to see if there was sufficient evidence at South High School of the Omaha Public School District to support any of the following hypotheses: (1) controlling for intelligence quotient (IQ) and socioeconomic status (SES), Spanish American children have a significantly lower self-concept than Anglo children; (2) controlling for IQ and SES, Spanish American children have a significantly lower grade point average (GPA) than Anglo children; (3) self-concept is related in a positive and significant way with IQ and SES; and (4) self-concept is positively and significantly correlated with GPA. Self-concept was measured by the Tennessee Self-Concept Scales; SES was assessed via the Index of Status Characteristics; GPA was taken from the last 2 consecutive  semesters for each student; and IQ was taken from school records. Spanish American and Anglo 10th, 11th, and 12th graders (n=40) were matched for high or low SES as well as for high or low IQ, and 5 children from each ethnic group were drawn from each of the 4 resulting classifications: high SES, high IQ; high SES, low IQ; low SES, high IQ; and low SES, low IQ. To determine the significance of the difference between the Spanish American and Anglo groups (hypotheses 1 and 2 above), the t-test was used; the index of correlation between variables (hypotheses 3 and 4 above) was established by the Pearson product-moment. None of the 4 hypotheses was adequately sustained to conclude that any of them held. (BO)",

First, letters were circulated to departmental chairmen and faculty members asking them to write a papagraph describing each summer job that could be done by a bright grade 12 or 13 student (the department would pay part or all of the student's wages or an attempt would be made to find the money elsewhere). One the number of jobs was ascertained, letters were sent to Indian Affairs counsellors who were to recruit Indian students having plans to attend a university or community college in the fall. Initially, the students were asked to indicate their main interest and departmental  preference at the university. After sufficient positions had been committed, a list of job descriptions along with an interview application was mailed to the students. Students selected to take part in the project were notified to come to the university (travel fare and lodging were provided) where they were interviewed by professors representing the student's first and/or second departmental choice. All students were then placed. During the summers of 1969 and 1970, 27 students participated. Generally, students' reactions to the program have been positive. (LS)",

Criteria for determining the college plans of adolescents were taken from responses to the question &quot;What further schooling do you plan after high school?&quot; Those selecting the alternative &quot;college or university&quot; were classified as aspiring to a higher education. The standard procedure for distinguishing rural and urban areas according to community size was used, while socioeconomic status was determined by the amount of education attained by the parents. To test for the relative achievement potential of rural and urban adolescents, scores derived from the Minnesota Scholastic Aptitude Test were used. It was revealed that neither  intelligence, rank, school size, nor satisfaction accounted for aspirational differences across community categories. These data suggest that a conception of academic opportunity, on which much of the analysis was based, may not be the most profitable way to examine aspirational differences with respect to community size.

The program focused on giving special consideration to core courses, English and math, in a team-teaching situation. The 43 ninth-graders selected to participate in the program represented their ethnic groups as follows: (a) Anglo, 30.6%; (b) Mexican American, 39.4%; (c) American Indian, 18.1%; and (d) Black, 11.9%. In respect to the first objective, 6.9% of these students dropped out of school compared to 18% of the vocationally placed students and 8.1% of the regular classroom students; absenteeism rate for  the special academic group was 4.5%, compared with 9.5% among the vocational students and 4% among the regular academic students. On an \"attitudes toward school\" scale on a pre-test basis, the special academic students had a mean of 76.3, compared to 75.9 for vocational students and 78.2 for regular classroom students. When given an alternate-form \"attitudes toward school\" scale as a post-test, the special students' mean was 77.4, compared to 74.3 for vocational students and 75.1 for regular classroom students. Covariance analysis indicates that the produced change in attitudes toward school was significant beyond the .01 level. The obtained F, with degrees of freedom 2 and 281, was 5.0. This indicates that differential change in attitudes did occur. (Author/LS)",

On pre- and post-tests designed for the ISP, 9th and 10th graders in the control schools performed better in the areas of woodwork, building construction, and metal fabrication but did not perform as well in drafting and power mechanics as did students in the ISP schools; the overall average significantly (.05 level) favored the ISP students. On the Cooperative Industrial Arts Tests, prepared and standardized  by the Educational Testing Service, the ISP 9th and 10th graders scored significantly higher (0.5 level) in drawing than the control students but fared the same as the control students in the areas of woods, metals, and electricity/electronics. This test battery was also administered to the 9th-grade industrial arts students at 2 Utah urban junior high schools; these students scored better in all areas than either ISP or control students (significant difference was reached at the .05 level in all areas except woods). On the Stanford Achievement Test--High School Technical Comprehension, 11th- and 12th-grade control students scored higher (but not significantly at the .05 level) than the corresponding ISP students.

A secondary part of the study compared Indian students' attitudes to those of Mexican American and Black students at Phoenix Union High School (PUHS), an inner-city school. A 65-item instrument was designed to obtain information pertaining to 5 categories: recreation, teachers, self-concept, home attitudes toward school, and value of education. Included in the sample were 578 PIHS, 385 Sherman Indian High, 356 Stewart Indian High, and 1022 PUHS students. The attitudes of students within Phoenix,  Sherman, and Stewart Indian schools were analyzed in terms of school, sex, grade level, tribe, years in public school, years in BIA school, supensions, and infractions. Treatment of data consisted of extracting the attitude scores by summing the numerical scores assigned to each response. These raw scores were analyzed using 1-way and 2-way analyses of variance. Several significant relationships were revealed. Among them, it was found that students in the 3 Indian schools had positive attitudes, but PIHS students had more positive attitudes toward all 5 categories than did Stewart and Sherman students. PUHS students showed more favorable attitudes toward self than did students from the Indian high schools. The questionnaire is appended. (LS)",

Techniques used to collect subjective data on program effectiveness inlcuded questionnaires, opinionnaires, anecdotal records, rating scales, diaries, and interview records. Information was obtained on such factors as teacher attitudes toward migrant children, workshop effectiveness, teacher estimates of pupil growth,  effectiveness of paraprofessional personnel, and suitability of materials and methods employed in the programs. It is noted that, of an estimated 80,000 school-aged children defined as migrants, 48,376 received services with 1970 funds. In addition, almost 28,000 migrant children were screened for various health defects, of which 10,607 children received medical treatment. Although no new programs were introduced during the 1970 fiscal year, services were extended to children in an additional 13 school districts.

        "description":"Testimony given at the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations hearings--held on April 27-28, 1971, in Washington D.C.--centered on bill S.10 which is designed to revitalize rural and other economically distressed areas by (1) establishing incentives for a more even and practical geographic distribution of industrial growth and activity and (2) developing manpower training programs to meet the needs of industry. The hearings focused on 3 primary areas: what rural policies and programs are presently operative; the implementation and degree of coordination taking place within the Government; and what legislative steps can be taken to speed up the process of rural revitalization, making it more lasting and effective while relieving population and industrial pressures on  cities. Included in Part 1 are the test of S.10; staff memorandum No. 92-1-13 (purpose, background, and previous hearings on S.10); Resolution H.C.R. No. 16 of the Arkansas State Legislature (endorsement of S.10); statements from 19 senators, consultants, and various state and Federal officials; and 8 exhibits (circulars, information from the Office of Management and Budget, 2 addresses on policy for rural and urban America, and a relevant newspaper article).

For evaluative purposes, pre- and post-test data were collected on this sample of 441 participating students using various instruments, checklists, surveys, and work sample tests ranging from the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test to teachers' weekly reports. Evaluation revealed that the experimental group generally showed no significant  advantage over the control group (n=353) in terms of reading comprehension, arithmetic-computation ability, and self-esteem; however, significant positive findings for the experimental group were indicated in the students' participatory ability in conducting oral job interviews and completing job application forms; in 11 of 14 areas of on-the-job work functions; in attendance; and in personal appearance, behavior, relationship to peers, and punctuality. Included in the document are 13 recommendations, 17 tables, and 17 appendixes showing and describing the program and evaluative instrumentation used. (MJB)",

A survey of findings indicates that programs have varied from community to community and that only general trends can be identified at the present time. Among the findings are (1) experiments in language programs suggest that children benefit from many kinds of language interventions but that a more structured program is generally more effective than an unstructured one; (2) as measured by tests not sensitized to subpopulation variations, children from low-income families perform below middle-class children in cognitive, intellectual, and  achievement behavior; and (3) children of parents having a high level of involvement in Head Start perform better on tests of achievement and development. This review of reported findings has critical implications for future work in the area of early childhood education for the disadvantaged Mexican American child. Major questions remain unanswered regarding characteristics of learner, design and development of replicable instructional programs, training of teachers, and parental involvement and education.

Findings included that (1) the manner in which a person is dealt with by \"significant others,\" especially in the early years, is considered to have a great deal to do with that person establishing a satisfactory identity and a positive self-view; (2) Mexican American children have been found to experience ever-present conflicting demands and pressures to do and be at school something other than what they do and are in the subculture; (3) many educators are seen to hold stereotypic views of Mexican American  children due to overgeneralization of the literature regarding specific Mexican American populations--this affects the children's performance, as is maintained in the \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" theory; and (4) due to inconclusiveness of research on the Mexican American child's self-concept, the broadly accepted idea that Mexican American children, as a group, have a negative self-concept is a stereotypic view. Discussion of the review concludes that educators, \"by seeing all or most Mexicans as 'fatalistic,''unable to delay gratification,''lazy,''dependent,''having negative self-concepts,' etc., and then reflecting these beliefs to the children with whom they deal,\" are forcing the Mexican American child either to reject the majority culture or to deny what he is. The only  recommendation is to research why the Anglo insists on cultural homogeneity. (BO)",

In order to test this thesis empirically, 439 Pima students' (grades 7 through 12) projections of status mobility for education and occupation were ascertained. It was revealed that some aspects of the mobility orientation of Pima youth are high while others are low. Educational aspirations are especially high; occupational aspirations are lower; the materialistic value-orientations are  particularly low; the pro-Anglo orientation is not high enough when it is considered that most of the opportunities for social mobility are outside the reservation; and it would appear that the Pima family is not able to acquire and pass on the mobility skills needed to achieve social mobility in the Anglo society.

The study examines a number of indicators--such as family, friends, religious leaders, teachers, and counselors--of the relative influence exercised upon the post-secondary vocational and educational plans of 955 Utah high school students. In addition, the study provides data on (1) the weight of various nonpersonal factors that students feel are important in terms of their plans and (2) the relative effectiveness of various media in transmitting information to the students in terms of this life-area. Data were obtained by administering a 68-item questionnaire to students from 15 Utah high  schools. Selected to represent a cross-section of all high schools in the state, the schools sampled were divided into 4 categories: Urban, Suburban, Large Rural, and Small Rural districts. Since it was assumed by the research committee that parents would be named by students as having the greatest influence over the students' decisions, the students were asked to have their parents complete a special parent questionnaire. Responses from 256 parents returning completed forms comprise a second part of this study. The data obtained were reduced to a series of tables of responses to specific questions. The Appendix contains the student and parent questionnaires. (LS)",

        "description":"In 1971, the Appalachia Educational Laboratory initiated a comprehensive Needs and Feasibility Study designed to present an overview of the educational needs of Appalachia and to pinpoint critical problems the region's educators will face in 1976. The study consisted of 5 independent components: a review of pertinent literature, analysis of data collected in a 1967 AEL survey of Appalachian superintendents, a 1971 survey of teachers and administrators, a 1971 survey of a panel of Appalachian experts, and use of a convergence technique at a meeting of approximately 200 decision-makers in Appalachia. Main objectives were to determine systematically what educational products should be developed by the AEL and to provide the potential users of these products an opportunity to  participate in their identification. Experts anticipated that, during the next 5 years, changing attitudes within and about Appalachia, increased educational leadership, and curriculum changes would be needed. Critical needs in the area of product development were innovations relating to new patterns of educational organization and new means of focusing on vocational or career education in Appalachia. The greatest pupil need in the cognitive-psychomotor area related to reading skills; the most critical need in the affective area was positive change in attitudes, including self-concept, regional perceptions, and career concepts. Improved educational leadership was identified as the most acute system need. A description of the procedures used and the study results are presented in this  report, along with 8 appendices (55-pages) and a 22-page bibliography. (JB)",

        "description":"After discussing the view that ethnic and socioeconomic status are, undesirably, predictive of academic success (e.g., only 3 or 4% of the Indians in Northwest Washington were high school graduates at the time of writing), this document sketches the rationale and methods of Western Washington State College's (WWSC) Project Catch-Up (PCU). Described as a 6-week summer residence program for junior high age youth who came from backgrounds of ethnic minority status or poverty and who exhibit high potential but low achievement, PCU provided formal instruction in the areas of language arts, art, science, and math. It is reported that PCU, a demonstration project in 1966 and 1967, became in 1968 a 5-year project with a 10-year follow-up evaluation; this progress report describes the  1969 summer program and presents a follow-up evaluation (as of June 1970) of participant groups from 1966 to June 1970. Although 4 standardized tests (administered yearly) were to be part of the follow-up since 1968, results &quot;have not been completely analyzed and will be reported at a later date.&quot; After discussing dropout rates and mean grade point averages for the participant groups from 1966 to June 1970, the report concludes that PCU seems to be successful in effecting better school retention. Appended are 1969-70 PCU expenditures, a description of WWSC's Fellowship Program for Experienced Teachers of the Disadvantaged, and a paper on the results of the 1968 and 1969 administrations of the California Psychological Inventory.

The method used to accomplish this was based on the assumption that the Pine Ridge Indians would express their primary values in response to a series of questions based on ideas commonly held in either the traditional Dakota or modern American culture. In this attempt to describe the value system of the Dakota Indians and to suggest an explanation for reservation religious practices, a shift was noted from the traditional Dakota values to the modern  values of Western Civilization. This study revealed that the Dakota Indians had, to a large extent, lost the old system of social values which gave purpose and direction to their lives. Reactions to this state of affairs varied with each individual from stubborn maintenance of traditional values to rejection of all Dakota values and full acceptance of non-Indian values. The assumption of positions at either extreme may provide a relatively stable personality adjustment, but the individual who vacillates between the 2 value systems is likely to search for some sources of meaning in group-approved and recognition-giving activities, such as are available in marginal religions.

Major data on which this study was based came from interviews with 223 parents whose children attended various types of schools in Arizona during 1967-68: Nazlini (Bureau of Indian Affairs), Many Farms (BIA and public), Rough Rock (community), Kayenta (public), and 2 Tempe schools (public). The interview questions focused on 2 major areas: (1) parental knowledge and understanding of the school and (2) parental feelings and attitudes toward the school and its programs. It was revealed, for example, that 64% of the parents at Rough Rock were pleased with the local school board, while no more than 1 in 4 parents in the other Navajo areas was satisfied  with the local board. Also, the parents at Rough Rock knew more things they liked and disliked about the school. The Tempe group, however, was better informed concerning the functions of school boards than were any of the other parent groups. The Tempe group also had better teacher-parent understanding and cooperation than did the Navajo Reservation schools.

The more extended the time of the deprivation, the greater the problem of amelioration. Research has shown that children who experienced deprivations do respond to early intervention and improve their performance. Intervention may take many forms and to some extent depends on the observed deprivation or assumed deficit. However, the outstanding intervention programs have in common clearly stated objectives, curricula consistent with objectives, high professional-paraprofessional ratio, individual instruction and attention, and parent involvement. Three exemplary programs are the Demonstration and Research Center for Early Children in  Nashville, Tennessee; the Institute for Developmental Studies in New York; and Learning to Learn in Jacksonville, Florida. One persistent problem concerns the long-range impact of programs. In order to gain permanent results, we should (1) find ways to develop the children's intelligence instead of merely teaching them skills; (2) seek the help and cooperation of parents, as well as the involvement of the entire community; and (3) initiate follow-through programs to provide a continuity of good programs.

The experimental group consisted of all students enrolled in developmental reading and study skills laboratory programs at the Community College of Allegheny County, Boyce Campus. The two control groups were students enrolled in English composition courses. Neither group had participated in a class in efficient reading. Control A emphasized theme writing and some readings in literature; control B emphasized the reading of literature and combined this with some theme writing. Alternate forms of the Craig test were scored for rate and comprehension and computed to give efficiency. An interval of 6 weeks elapsed between pretesting and post-testing. Consideration was  given to the problem of IQ and student motivation contributing to reading efficiency gains. Results showed that the experimental group averaged an increase of 48 percent in efficiency, while controls A and B averaged increases of 8 percent and 33 percent, respectively. The experimental group was initially the least efficient among the three groups, but ended with the highest average efficiency. The author concluded that it is advisable to place students in a reading laboratory program when they enroll in English courses emphasizing writing. (AW)",

        "description":"Four paradoxes appear in research on learning to read: (1) the ability to name letters is a good predictor of reading readiness, yet letter-naming training does not help children learn how to read; (2) visual discrimination is often better in poor readers than in good readers; (3) learning to read two languages is easier than learning to read one; and (4) it is easier to learn to read in two alphabets than it is in one. These findings which contradict common sense may be easily explained by examining the thought processes at work during the reading process. Too often reading research looks at external aspects of reading such as eye movement, perception, and letter-naming and neglects the central processes of concept formation and reasoning. Examining the first paradox, for  example, early experience with letter-naming often indicates an environment in which the parents read a lot and talk about reading, which gives support to the school's effort to teach reading. Learning letter-names for a child from a less stimulating environment, however, is often the rote learning of meaningless symbols. Hence letter-naming can indicate reading readiness but is not a useful method of teaching reading. The other three paradoxes can similarly be explained by looking at the cognitive processes involved. The implication then is that the learning and thought processes of the child must be the starting point for any teaching activity. References are included. (AL)",

The list of word attack skills was originally drawn from a prepared curriculum guide of a public school system and subsequently refined. The skills are the ones commonly taught in elementary schools and considered essential to reading development. The remaining components of the Design are keyed to the specific skills listed in the outline. Behavioral objectives were written for each skill at mid-level of specificity to define the tasks that the child must be able to perform in order to demonstrate skill mastery. Each skill is assessed by a criterion-referenced test; no group-referent norms exist. A criterion  of 80 percent correct is set in recognition of measurement limitations and variables. The assessment instruments are the informal guides to individual skill observation and the formal Wisconsin Tests of Reading Skill Development. Each test consists of approximately 15 to 20 items and has a reliability of .80 or higher. The pupil Profile Card is the primary vehicle for pupil accounting with the Design. Available materials for each skill are listed in the Teacher's Resource File. School personnel are encouraged to add useful materials and activities to the files. References are included.

        "description":"A total of 118 students were enrolled in the Multi-Language Rapid Reading Program, and by the end of 9 weeks they were able to read intermediate French and Spanish with rates up to 35,000 words per minute (w.p.m.) in Spanish and 25,000 w.p.m. in French. No student scored less than 750 w.p.m. in either language, with 65 percent the lowest comprehension score. The results of this program demonstrate that the teaching of foreign language can be speeded up considerably. Some experts insist that it is impossible for a person to see more than about an inch in print in one focus and that the maximum possible reading speed is therefore 800 to 900 w.p.m. However, these experts have limited their consideration of the direction of reading to that of left to right. They have not taken into  consideration that there are many different ways of reading a page and many people can see entire paragraphs and pages at a glance. The amount of evidence pertaining to the positive results of various rapid learning programs should indicate to writers of textbooks in reading, mathematics, spelling, and foreign languages that new methods of learning should be outlined which will bring about greater learning at much faster rates.

Subjects were marginal admission students at Wayne State University who were economically disadvantaged and 91 percent of whom were black. Forty-three subjects were used in the experimental phase, and 184 were used in the correlational phase. The experimental subjects participated in a reading and study skills course which used either the lecture method or the demonstration method of instruction, and the  subjects were divided into groups of internal or external locus of control. The Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control Scale and the Triggs' Diagnostic Reading Test were administered at the end of the reading course to all marginal admission students. After 2 full years of study, HPA's were collected from university records. No significant effects of locus of control, instructional method, or instructor on HPA were found.

Two studies about the operation of the mind in information processing and learning were related to two clinical cases. The hyperactive child in the first case was partially brain injured. Visual modes of instruction tended to excite him excessively and result in poorer performance. The author proposed that for this child, audio presentation of instruction would offer more learning prospects than video. In the second case, the child's slight hearing loss was assumed to have resulted in some distortion of auditory input, and this affected his learning. It was  felt that the child's facilitation pattern for coding was not sensitive enough for picking out cultural chords and that for him the instructional system might be too encumbered. It was concluded that breaks in learning often stem from physiological processes and that the psycho-educator should make use of the established facts of the past 7 years from anatomy and physiology to update pedagogy.

Over a one-semester period, comparable lessons were taught to two groups matched for IQ, age, reading grade level, and freedom from sensory defects. The difference between the instructional treatments was one of sensory mode of lesson presentation and application--one group was taught using both aural and visual methods and the other, using a visual approach only. The groups used the same materials, were taught the same comprehension skills, and the same teacher taught both groups. Results from a standardized reading test showed that when sensory learning modality preference was not  a variable, a correlated listening-reading instructional approach was more effective than a reading-only approach. Specifically, the listening-reading approach was found particularly effective for auditory learners and for students with no sensory modality preference. One conclusion was that in a group of students which is undifferentiated by learning modality preference, an aural-visual teaching approach to reading is more effective than a strictly visual approach.

The use of high spped computers has enabled the compilers to analyze five million words from a body of materials frequently used in elementary and junior high schools. Computers helped make more extensive citations of works possible and thus facilitated choosing words to include in the dictionary and word frequency book. Because the last word frequency book was compiled in 1944, the change of types of materials used in schools and the rapid increase of new words in our language have made it necessary to have current information on word frequency for the use of teachers and  writers of materials. New mathematical techniques have improved the accuracy and scope of word frequency analysis. The word frequencies are listed by grades, thus enabling teachers and writers to get accurate information on the specific level they are interested in. Word frequency information has been found to be helpful in determining readability and selection of texts, choosing words for use in psychological studies, teaching of English as a second language, and compiling vocabulary lists.

One approach taught vowel and consonant sounds, while the other taught only consonant sounds. Thirty sessions of instruction over a period of 8 weeks were administered to the two groups from classes for severely retarded readers. The subjects were pretested and post-tested on phonics sections of standardized reading tests, a cloze comprehension test, and an intelligence test. There were no significant differences between the achievement of the two groups on any of the tests. All gains made were very slight and could not be attributed to the training during the study. Both groups did generally  better with consonant recognition than vowel recognition. The author concluded that the teaching of phonics is not valid for retarded black high-school-age readers.

Materials used for comprehension practice were articles gathered from magazines and journals relating to 19 interest categories. A computer code number indicating reading level, interest, and location in the laboratory was assigned to each article. Short comprehension tests were also developed for each article. Every 2 weeks, the computer assigned reading materials to  students on matched interests, recorded materials assigned to each student, and updated student progress during each printout period. Each student was also given a private conference every 2 weeks, and the information was coded and supplied to the computer for evaluation.

        "description":"A reading program designed for adults in business, industry, or self-directing professions must focus on specific reading skills which are different from other adult reading programs. Professionals generally have good-to-excellent reading skills which they developed in school and college and are thus primarily concerned with developing (1) efficient and fast reading, (2) the ability to deal with professional jargon and technical vocabulary, (3) the ability to deal with specialized reading materials in their fields, and (4) facility for creativeness of expression. Because professionals have learned meticulous and careful reading skills in school, they often need to learn skills of general comprehension of large quantities of material. The materials used should be those the  professionals come in contact with--either brought in by the students or found by the teacher. Some guidelines for working with professionals are (1) make the program visably individualized, (2) review basic reading skills, (3) teach general as well as technical vocabulary skills, (4) teach flexible rather than fast reading, (5) explain the theory behind the techniques taught, and (6) be egalitarian and uncondescending toward the class.

        "description":"The effects of prereading techniques, specifically \"advance organizers\" and \"structured overview\" were studied by comparing retention and comprehension of reading material in high school students with and without prereading treatment. An advance organizer is a brief passage giving a general and inclusive introduction to material to be read. A structured overview consists of student-teacher interaction dealing with terms and concepts related to the material to be read. The subjects were 157 students in social studies classes in a rural Virginia high school. Subjects were tested on reading ability and classified in four reading ability groups. Subjects were then divided into three treatment groups: one group received the advance organizer, one a structured overview, and the control  group received no prereading treatment. Students were given a 3,000-word passage on labor unions (an unfamiliar topic), and 24 hours later they took a 22-item test on the passage. Results showed no statistically significant differences between the three groups, although the structured overview group performed consistently better than the advance organizer group. When reading ability was high or low, the control group was lower or equal to the experimental groups, but when reading level was commensurate with that of the passage, the scores of the control group were higher.

An approach to accountability, based on Bloom's concept of student mastery of subject matter, consists of six components which the student passes through in the reading instructional process: (1) rationale: the learner perceives the importance of instruction to his own needs and goals; (2) diagnosis: preevaluation helps determine the learner's abilities and subsequently the learning objectives he needs to pursue; (3) objectives: specific performances are outlined to show the student what the instruction will teach; (4) alternate learning activities; a variety of methods, media, levels, and types of learning activities are employed to  suit instruction to the student; (5) post-evaluation: to inform the student and the instructor whether instruction has succeeded in enabling the student to intentions to be reciprocated. The findings showed that both O's intent and the learning activities are modified according to feedback from the learners. In this program, individualized segments are short, learners can take as much time as necessary to master the objectives, and instruction is characterized by appropriate practice, positive reinforcement, and immediate knowledge of results.

In a later phase of the project, teachers were given a choice of a textbook-based or non-textbook course. Data are reported bearing on the effects of  curriculum materials, teaching styles, type of course chosen by the teachers, and on changes in student critical and creative thinking abilities. Both the expository and inductive teaching styles proved superior to the indeterminate style in producing changes in creative thinking; the non-textbook course favored creative thinking. Also reported is a study of the effect of different instructional methods for developing the concept of conservation at the first grade level.

Further, for American education to be successful in this regard, it must formulate a strategy that is addressed to the individual in his own environment. Within this context, an EEE continuum is described, elaborating a range of teaching-learning activities at various levels of education. Included are: (1) formal and nonformal programs of environmental education, (2) training programs for educational personnel, manpower development, and  professional education, and (3) assessment activities to determine priorities and assist in planning environmental education programs. In developing an educational response to the problem, OE advocates state plans for EEE, together with action-oriented curricula developed by individual school systems, coordination of community environmental action programs, and creation of state councils for environmental education. The regional and national roles of OE in supporting local programs are also presented. To show how OE plans to promote the EEE effort, activities planned by the Office during 1970 are outlined.

To this end, several articles address themselves to various facets of the whole topic of environmental education and the spirit of stewardship. \"Transforming Man's Attitude Toward the World\" is the lead article by Sen. Gaylord Nelson, relating several ramifications of the Environmental Education Act of 1970. Other writings deal with science, social studies, aesthetics, and math in the  environment and in environmental education. Curriculum development is explored in two articles, \"Environmental Education: An Action Model,\" and \"Improving Wisconsin High School Conservation Courses.\" One additional story characterizes a school site for environmental education at the Forest Park Outdoor Education Center, Franklin, Wisconsin.

With supplementary materials it could be used in a unit on local or Wisconsin geography, as an introduction to problems of urban growth, or as a segment on governmental entities which make up a modern metropolitan area. Two filmstrips are employed to present the facts. Part I describes the public land survey and its effects particularly on farm boundaries, field shapes and plowing patterns, road locations, and community shapes and patterns. Part II deals with the effects of the survey on patterns of local government in Wisconsin and raises some questions on the  consequences of 19th century governmental patterns as they complicate 20th century urban growth. Both filmstrips are explained in their entirety, illustrating each frame and its accompanying script. Supplementary materials in the booklet relate the long range significance of the Land Ordinance of 1785, early policy questions of land use, methods of establishing and maintaining boundary lines, and the numbering and describing of sections, townships, and ranges. Additional materials include maps, tests, a bibliography, and suggested uses of the materials. Filmstrips are not included. (BL)",

This is undesirable in a time of increasing fluidity and change, because adaptation to new situations is difficult. Unified science, based on the premise that science is a unity, offers a more flexible approach. Reasons supporting the view that science is a unity range from the philosophical point that there is only one universe to the pragmatic one of educational advantages with respect to universal scientific literacy. An ideal science curriculum would span the total period of general education from kindergarten to grade 12 or 14, and would be built of modules of varying length. A relatively small number of  major concepts and a \"spiral approach\" would provide continuity. Testing within the ideal program would emphasize higher level cognitive skills and the social implications of science. Unified science curricula can be implemented by obtaining a consensus among teachers in a school district of the articulating concepts to be used, cooperative selection or development of modules, and the replacement of the existing programs one year at a time until all grade levels are using the unified program.

The sample consisted of a kindergarten and a second grade class from one school and a first grade class from another school. Each class was divided into three groups. The first group was given three 20-minute training sessions, the same for each grade. The second group was given a similar treatment in which the words \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" were used and stressed. The third group was a control. All nine groups were given the same test of 16 experimenter-designed, diagram-completion items before and after treatments. The pretest showed substantial differences between the nine groups, so treatment effects were first  analyzed by a rank order test on group means. The data supported the prediction that experimental groups would perform better than control groups, but detected no difference between the two versions of the experimental treatment. Three multivariate analyses of variance were also performed in an attempt to eliminate the effect of initial group differences. (MM)",

        "description":"The purpose of the 1968-69 investigation was to determine the applicability of a curriculum evaluation model to investigate high school students' achievement in three physics courses (traditional physics, Physical Science Study Curriculum, and Harvard Project Physics). Three tests were used to measure student progress: The Dunning-Abeles Physics Achievement Test, Form E., the Wisconsin Inventory of Science Processes, and the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal, Form YM. The classroom verbal behavior of each class was recorded on audio tapes and quantified using Flanders' Verbal Interaction Analysis system. The results of the study indicate that the students exhibited greater change in physics content mastery than in understanding science processes or in critical thinking,  although there was a significant increase in all three components. No specific curriculum was found to be more effective in enhancing student ability-growth in any of the three tested components (physics content, understanding science processes, and critical thinking). The total classroom verbal interaction patterns were found to differ among curricula and between high and low achieving classes, leading to the judgement that there is a relationship between classroom verbal behavior and a physics curriculum as well as a relationship between classroom verbal behavior and student achievement. The funds for this doctoral dissertation were provided by the U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. (Author/TS)",

The Path-Printer  provides a record of the student's path through the learning program. (Author/CP)",

The bibliography is organized into six parts: Bibliographies, Agencies and Organizations, Journals, Environment, Environmental Education, and Materials. Part I, Bibliographies, includes related collections in specific areas as films, conservation, and science. Part II, Agencies and Organizations, lists names and addresses of groups providing extensive materials about the environment and environmental education. Part  III, Journals, enumerates publications with a major emphasis on the environment. Part IV, Environment, is subdivided into general, urban environment, population, and environmental resources - food and pesticides, air, water, noise, and energy. Part V, Environmental Education, separates general, environmental quality and aesthetics, perception, curricula and programs, and techniques. Part VI, Materials, contains entries aimed toward secondary school students and includes literature, films and filmstrips, games, and posters. (BL)",

The authors' concerns are discussed from the vantage point of their areas of specialization: law, sociology, and economics. The first author states that water law abounds with unanswered questions and administrative efforts to isolate water's use for public consumption from its many other uses are equally arbitrary. In the sociological area, there seems to be a failure on the part of all citizens to understand water supply and pollution issues. The economist estimates that available ground water resources might be able to satisfy projected water supply needs in Rhode Island at costs significantly lower  than those associated with surface reservoirs.

Each of four lessons contains one or more of these major ideas: 1) individuals develop a set of values as they grow up; these values reflect those of the society and the environment that surrounds the individual; 2) surveys, like the one included here as an example, are used as evidence in understanding the interpreting behavior patterns of people; 3)  changes occur in values as social and economic conditions change in a society; 4) behavior patterns are shaped by the values that people hold; and, 5) values differ from society to society.

        "description":"The five episodes from American life narrated in this unit attempt to show various methods of protest against different oppressions, ranging from revolt against the law by armed resistance, to getting an objectionable practice eliminated by a fresh interpretation of the Constitution through the courts. An important fact is pointed up--even though the Constitution gives us certain rights, we must demand them. If we do not claim our freedom from imprisonment for debts (Part I), our freedom from racial discrimination (Part II), our freedom to assemble and speak (Part III), to work under fair conditions (Part IV), and to practice or not practice our religious beliefs (Part V), others may take them away. A few of the general teaching objectives are: 1) to understand that political  protest (and labor strikes) may be the result of intolerable economic conditions; 2) to understand that economic pressures among the poor may lead to rebellion; 3) to believe in the legal processes set up for redress of grievances; and, 4) to realize that changing a law by using the judicial process is difficult and yet is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.

        "description":"This developmental paper generally describes a task oriented model for teaching about conflict and conflict resolution, using student groups for problem solving, which can be developed in the classroom. The model involves: 1) identification of the issue, topic, or problem by the entire class; 2) identification of ideas, concepts, or facets of conflict by sub-groups; and, 3) generalization. The merits of this method include: 1) students learning to work together; 2) active participation in concept and idea development; 3) demonstration of conflict and resolution within the group process itself; and, 4) student motivation. Almost any type of problematic or conflict situation can be used that are simulations or real in the individual, the classroom, the school, the community, and  larger groups. Current issues with practical implications which directly impinge on the student are especially useful. Specific techniques are briefly described: case study method; classroom negotiation; individual exercises in the perception of conflict; observation of nursery school age children; historical literature and clinical cases; video-tape for feedback purposes; and, role playing simulations such as the Prisoner's Dilemma or Black and White.

Allen; and, philosophers, conservationists, businessmen, architects, journalists, teachers. The testimony ranges from very high level, abstract, global thinking to detailed descriptions of specific action programs. The record has been carefully edited and condensed in order to present the essential themes, and a wide variety of viewpoints. There are many uses for this book: curriculum planners and teachers will find many of the proposals helpful in guiding their own thinking; both high school and college classes in education and government will find this an illuminating source of information on how national priorities are formulated; and, study groups focusing on environmental problems will find it a stimulating case study.

Three adjacent inner city public schools, an elementary, junior high, and high school, were involved. Thirty-three teachers in the schools received 68 older students as educational agents to provide individual attention to their own students for approximately 4 half-hours per week. Training was provided the various helping participants, e.g., receiving teachers, olders, and seminar leaders. This evaluation is based on questionnaires from 25 receiving teachers and 29 olders and interviews with the 5 seminar leaders, 3 sending teachers, and 3 olders. The report deals separately with each element of the program: the youngers, or learners; the tutors, or olders; the receiving teachers; and, the seminar  leaders. Each section reports on selection criteria and either the effects of the program or reactions to it. The evaluation concludes that teachers are provided with a new way to cope with individual pupil needs. For the learners, academic achievement gains were notable, as were positive shifts in attitudes toward learning and self. The tutors benefiting from experiencing concrete evidence of their usefullness and importance to others, both younger children and adults. (Author/DJB)",

In the spring of 1965 a national probability sample of 1669 high school seniors at 97 high schools were interviewed in-depth; a random sample of their parents, social studies teachers, and school principals were also interviewed. In addition, all members of the senior class in a majority of the schools completed an abbreviated self-administered questionnaire. Through 1968 the data were examined to determine political orientation as well as to assess the relative impact of family, school, and community on political learning. Part I of the report examines  the sample to determine: 1) the breadth of the social studies curriculum in American High Schools; and, 2) the extent and sources of variability in course exposure and impact. Part II presents a political portrait of the students in the individual schools and compares them with those of students in the nation as a whole. The national sample is divided into two sets of sub-groups to examine the differences among students: 1) located in different regions of the country; and, 2) having different educational aspirations.

The methods involved: 1) analysis of available literature; 2)  interviews with educators and secondary school students; 3) school visitations; 4) analysis of student examinations; 5) attendance at conferences; and, 6) analysis of questionnaires administered to 416 education students and 276 secondary school teachers in five districts. It was found that both the educational system and the teachers were caught between conflicting pulls of values and norms with teachers not quite trained to meet systemic expectations, and the political system itself placing lower allocation priorities on education than on ventures with immediate and visible payoff quality. The major influencing factors in the socialization of teachers were: teacher age, prestige of educational background, commitment to general education, tenure, community, and social class.

        "description":"In this assessment of the status of economic education in North Dakota, where less than 5% of high school students are exposed to a formal course in economics, three things were evaluated: 1) the economic preparation of high school teachers of economics; 2) economic preparation of high school teachers of Problems of Democracy (POD); and, 3) the role of the institutions of higher learning in preparing economics teachers. The results of the first evaluation indicated that the tendency in teacher preparation is in the direction of the minimal state requirements (5 semester hours). In North Dakota all high schools that do not offer a course in economics must offer POD. Better than one-third of the teachers of POD were found to have no economics background. In evaluating economic  education by colleges and universities, four subject areas (social studies, home economics, business education, and history) were chosen on the presumption that economics, if taught at all, would most likely be included there. Each reporting college institution graduated approximately 65-80 teachers in the area of social studies. In only 50% of the cases was a minimal background (6-9 hours) in economics required. In the other subject areas, the level of training appears even less. Efforts of the Joint Council, and the North Dakota Council must be relied upon to upgrade the status of economic education in North Dakota. (Author/JLB)",

The two computerized bibliographies, Southeast Asia: A Bibliography for Undergraduate Libraries and Middle East and North Africa: A Bibliography for Undergraduate Libraries, designed to serve as book selection tools for librarians, were graded and edited while in a pre-bibliography state by scholars and librarians who evaluated books for their degree of importance to undergraduate libraries: books that should be included in all undergraduate libraries, those that a library should have if the  college offers a course in either of these areas, and books that a library would need to support undergraduate area studies. The graded draft was then produced and circulated to a panel of college librarians and other consultants for revision. This is a new approach consisting of the following features: information on the availability of each title; computer production; grading as to significance; and keying to critical reviews.

        "description":"In 1969 the Cincinnati Public Schools received a grant from the Ohio State Department of Vocational Education to develop interdisciplinary career orientation materials for junior high school pupils. The preliminary social studies materials were taught in grades seven and eight for one year, then revised. During 1970-1971 each social studies teacher in the project selected activities from the new manual, Man: His Life and Work; twenty-one teachers in four schools were involved. Each activity was prepared for use under one of the following topics: American History, Urban Living, Ohio History, and Social Sciences. Objectives were coded to the categories of Bloom's taxonomy. In March, 1971 teachers were asked to report the mean achievement of their classes on the activities they  taught using a standard form (Appendix A). The mean achievement was then determined for each teacher and each activity; it was then possible to determine mean achievement for topic categories, categories in Bloom's taxonomy, and by income level of school. A T-test of independent means was then applied to the results to determine if differences in income level affected mean achievement or achievement by category of the taxonomy. The mean achievement for the 269 activities was 84 with no significant difference between low-income and average income schools. Teachers taught more activities in American History and Urban Living, and preferred activities from the cognitive categories. Inservice teacher training was suggested. (Author/SBE)",

(It is interesting to note that allegations that historical study develops patriotism and good citizenship were made most often and strongly during periods of national crisis); 3) Prepares one for life as accomplished through the development of perspective and a better understanding of the present, among other things; 4) Teaches the historical methods of defining problems, developing pertinent questions, formulating and testing hypotheses, gathering and analyzing  data, and reaching conclusions; 5) Develops historical mindedness, a quality deemed essential for an objective approach to issues; 6) Develops specific skills such as research, map, and other graphic skills, and critical thinking; 7) Provides a guide to action; 8) Develops better persons; and, 9) Miscellaneous values. Although historians did not always agree, nor stress the same values, nor use identical terminology, there is considerable consensus regarding the nature of their discipline and potential values to be derived from its study.

The physical setting of this area is described briefly. Algonkian life is presented in three major stages of development: 1) the prehistoric period of nomadic life as traced through archaic artifacts such as tools, weapons and ornaments; 2) a period of cultural transition occurring about 2500 B.C. and referred to as the early Woodland period; and 3) the post-colonial period, around the 16th century, in which these Indians began living in larger settlements and established a cohesiveness of tribes that prevented Europeans from seizing the land by  force. Indian population later decreased in this area when outward pressures, diseases, and conflicts caused the Algonkians to move farther inland. Descriptions are given of physical appearance and dress, housing, settlement sites, food, social and political structures, Indian practices of warfare, wampum, and ritual.

        "description":"The author states that art and the aesthetic have historically become inseparable. For art education this raises the question: is the role of art in education functioning in the same capacity as art in society? It is conceivable that overreliance on past orientation, or even that any reference whatever to that limited vision of the art-aesthetic, has significantly diminished our capacity to comprehend the real-aesthetic of human experience. The aesthetic side of man is essentially an experience of encounter with the world of discovery, and ultimately of self-awareness. This encounter is initially funded through all the senses which is a complex multidimensional compendium of phenomena. The author, however, attempts to explicate a partial taxonomy to account for the sensuous. The  aesthetic becomes the media of art where through sensation and conceptualizing, one is able to synthesize a perception which has a self-referent. In the information processing culture, the aesthetic will be the knowing, interactionary relationship between ourselves and our cybernetic environment. It is proposed that the new aesthetics be pursued as the humanistic ways of knowing, wherein multiple aesthetic modes are viewed as parts of the whole human phenomenon. This synaesthesia is the activity of coming to the self's real-actualization and knowing of the future culture, as well as an awareness of existence within the space-time continuum. (Author/SBE)",

Partial results were: 1) general agreement as to value of multidisciplinary approach, and 2) black students tended to be more critical of the course.

        "description":"This study investigated the kinds of dimensions that children use to compare and contrast two sets of social stimuli--houses and jobs. The research was based on the assumption that obtaining knowledge of how similarity structures are formed for social domains would be useful in explaining the development of personal preferences and conceptions of social status. Free sort and triad procedures, and preference and importance rank orders were used to explore the ways in which 120 fourth and seventh graders from urban and suburban areas categorized houses and jobs. The younger children grouped pairs of houses with similar details and pairs of jobs with similar functions. The older children used a greater variety of different criteria to group the stimuli and were more likely to sort  the total array on the basis of a single attribute. Explicit social status categories were used infrequently by all children. Status was an important determinant of preferences and important ranks. Urban children liked more houses than did suburban children--perhaps reflecting an attempt to minimize their own distance from the top. Job preferences and importance rank orders resembled adult occupational prestige rankings. While social status knowledge increased with age, even the older children were more likely to select glamorous jobs as ideals than high status ones. (Author/JLB)",

The second major objective is to apply the paradigm to nine propositions of government policy that commonly emanate from the subject matter of an economics course: strengthening public enterprise, equity, creeping inflation, balanced budget, agriculture, business, labor: restraining economic power, labor: compulsory union  membership, and international trade. It is assumed there that teachers may lack bibliographic sources, but desire source materials on both sides of the propositions discussed, consequently sources are included. It is also assumed that these different views will emanate from and be expressed by the students not imbued by the teacher. The monograph was written in response to a 45 to 60 minute interview with each of 33 teachers of economics in a large metropolitan school district. (Author/SBE)",

        "description":"Can educators be effective change agents, and if so, how? Let's consider our opportunities from three viewpoints: 1) the social setting of the school; 2) the school systems themselves; and, 3) the teacher. Within the social setting, one of the most important limitations to change is the resistance of many parents. The new curricula and approaches will be largely stillborn unless we can convince patrons of the efficacy of key elements. As to institutional blocks, we find, among others: standardized tests, nationally produced texts, accreditation rules; bureaucratic structure of schools; and lack of economic pressure to change. As to teachers: 1) teachers are relatively isolated from one another; 2) lack of any real assessment of efforts; and, 3) teachers tend to be fairly  conventional and conservative. Some steps toward strengthening the teacher's impact are: 1) encourage policy of employing, and appropriately rewarding, change agents in the schools; 2) differentiated staffing and differentiated rewards; 3) freer communication and brainstorming; 4) democratization of the school systems and classrooms; and 5) strengthened cooperation with parents and other concerned laymen. Two books are recommended for social studies teachers: Beyond Freedom and Dignity, and Without Marx or Jesus. (Author/JLB)",

The Teacher's Manual, a guide to the international relations game, is  arranged in three major parts. Part I, &quot;Foreign Policy and the International System&quot;, defines and explains the objectives of foreign policy. Determinants, themes, instruments, and decision making patterns are listed as key components upon which to conduct the game.

The power structure was represented by 500 invited adults from education, business and industry, labor, media, religion, foundations, national organizations, and the arts. Over 500 proposals are included here on: 1) the Draft, National  Service, and Alternatives; 2) Drugs; 3) Economy and Employment; 4) the Environment; 5) Foreign Relations; 6) Legal Rights and Justice; 7) Poverty; 8) Race and Minority Group Relations; and, 9) Values, Ethics, and Culture. In summary, there were six apparent themes that ran through all of the work of the conference: 1) Youth Involvement, Rights, and Representation; 2) Community, Self-Control and Participation; 3) Equality and Pluralism; 4) Libertarianism as a freedom to choose ones own way of life; 5) Humanization: individual, social, and economic; and, 6) Humanitarianism.

        "description":"This curriculum guide provides a general view of the various considerations governing a senior year or high school course in world religions. An early section on objectives sets out some of the aims of a course in world religions. It states that the particular aim should be the development of a sympathetic understanding of the meaning of different religions and their effect on the life and thought of their adherents. At a more personal level, such a course should help a student to clarify his thinking on some of the fundamental questions about himself and his relationship to his fellow man, to the universe, and to the concept of a transcendent order. In the next section, Designing a Local Course, some of the implications of these aims are explored in a general discussion of  teaching strategies, materials, learning activities, and points of view. Five possible ways of organizing a course are suggested: inquiry, biographical, survey, the arts, and a thematic approach. Teachers will probably prefer to draw from several of these in constructing a course. Also included are general comments and suggestions on five different religions--Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The choice of these religions is not intended to be restrictive but to give a general idea of the type of considerations that should govern the planning and development of a course. (Author/JLB)",

        "description":"This paper discusses how the contributions of psychology may be fruitfully applied to the problem of teacher education and describes a curriculum offering designed and implemented to illustrate the author's conclusions regarding theory and practice. Conclusions from the discussion section are 1) teacher training problems can be seen as emerging from the realm of the practical rather than the theoretic; 2) the contribution of theory to problems in the practical realm needs to be understood in terms of both its constructive and vitiating elements; 3) eclectic operations are required in dealing with problems emerging from the practical realm. Goals set up for the teacher education experience are to provide school-based illustrations of the learning process, to help teacher trainees  make explicit their own assumptions about the learning process, and to aid teacher trainees in an understanding of the role of theory and practice in teaching. The second half of the paper describes a curriculum designed to achieve the foregoing goals--a 3-week unit inserted into graduate methods seminars in each of six subject matter areas, the unit focusing on the process of learning the particular discipline. The unit for the foreign language group is outlined in detail including a list of readings and description of discussions and video tape recordings. The seminar unit is then evaluated in terms of broader implications for teacher education. (JS)",

Each component of the model is described in detail. Basic components include 1)  curriculum decision-making responsibilities at team, school, and system level for the professional staff; 2) development of a school information system to provide appropriate data for individualizing instruction; 3) development of an individualized reporting system; 4) a system of instruction which seeks optimum individualization; 5) the development of differentiated staff roles; 6) the assignment of learners to an ungraded instructional pool; 7) reallocation of space and facilities; and 8) a high degree of school-community involvement.

The first half of this paper traces the growth of this awareness through the writings of leading educators and through an examination of teacher education programs which were established to implement their proposals. These include Project 120 at Hunter College, the Associated Colleges of the Midwest Urban Semester Program, the Inner-City Teacher Education Project in Missouri, the Syracuse University Urban Teacher Preparation Program, the Inter-Institutional Program Development Project, the Sausalito Teacher Education Project (STEP), and the Cooperative Urban Teacher Education Program  (CUTE). The second part of the paper deals with future prospects for inner-city teacher education and examines the challenges facing the teacher, economic factors affecting teacher supply and demand, and the desirable characteristics of inner-city teachers. The need for exposure to inner-city conditions during training is emphasized, as are the problems of language and communication, reading skills, individualized instruction, and the increased use of paraprofessional personnel.

The first is the degree of student response. The next is concerned with relative clarity o r ambiguity of teachers' expectations. The final dimension is concerned with the degree of warmth shown by teachers to students. Indexes designed to measure student perception of the dimensions in the model were developed and related to various criteria in a large sample of 2-year college  students.

The alternative is a Clinical Program based on the ComField Elementary Teacher Education Model. The new program is operational at the six Southeast Center Schools of Seattle. Instructional packages have been developed and an evaluation instrument has been prepared. The program has five major components: 1) inservice training for supervising teachers; 2) the entry program, a combination of observation and seminars for career decision-making; 3) the foundations component, which is now largely a sequence of standard college courses offered on the WWSC campus; 4) the laboratory component, in which students complete the instructional  packages and demonstrate competencies in the classroom; and 5) the practicum, in which students become interns and may be certified. The faculty for the Clinical Program consists of two clinical professors, about 35 supervising teachers, and a Resident Center Director. The total cost of the program is about 50 percent lower than the per-quarter cost of student teaching in the standard program.

Part II is the delineation of an overall conceptualization process, defining perceiving-mediating-valuing processes, in which the individual student is to engage in the building of the seven social properties. Part  III is concerned with the role of the teacher directed toward the development of the individual as a human being. This section has three major objectives: 1) to provide the teacher with a self-evaluation tool to assist in determining individual degrees of readiness for attempting the type of teaching called for; 2) to outline a strategy for implementation of the major ideas in the project; and 3) to furnish one or more models of teaching units addressed to a particular social property, stated behaviorally and delineated as a sub-strategy.

Methods of organizing and using data and of validating theory are discussed. Internal and external constraints are listed, as well as the role of individual values as a counterbalance to these constraints.

Topics considered included innovations in the curriculum and general program characteristics in both college and university programs and in school based programs, the preservice curriculum, optimum use of the education labor force, and change agents and external financing. The paper by Donald N.

Projects visited included those at Temple University, University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Washington University in St. Louis, San Fernando State College, San Jose State College, Berkeley Public Schools, the University of Washington, and a meeting of the Southwest cluster. Conversations were held with the project director in most cases and with community representatives, students, teachers, and university faculty where possible. The topics discussed were 1) representation of the community, 2) nature of community participation, 3) experiences in the community for trainees, 4) issues of  power and parity, 5) attitudes toward community participation, 6) impact of community participation, and 7) institutionalization of community participation. It appeared that community members have given real assistance in recruiting minority group candidates to teacher education at all levels, have helped orient teacher candidates and faculty members to the community on a personal level, and have shared in setting goals and sometimes in direct instruction. Although the projects have involved friction and trauma, almost all project directors attest to the worth of extended participation. (MBM)",

        "description":"This study determined the effects of teaching prospective teachers Gagne's conditions for rule learning. Forty-eight students in the Social Sciences Methods Course for Elementary Teachers at Auburn University were randomly arranged in two groups. Both groups learned to develop a teaching unit to teach concepts, while only the experimental group received the conditions for rule learning treatment. This treatment consisted of a multi-level program called PROMOD. Following the treatment, the subjects in both the experimental and control groups were asked, as a posttest, to teach a child a social science concept from the \"Man: A Course of Study\" curriculum. Finally, videotapes of the teaching performances were analyzed by a team of observers. The major conclusions were that 1) there  was a significant relationship between teaching prospective teachers the conditions for rule learning and their rule teaching behavior at the .01 level of significance, 2) there was not a significant relationship between the conditions for rule learning and the rule teaching behavior of prospective teachers who are not taught the conditions, and 3) there was not a significant relationship between the achievement level of prospective teachers as determined by grade point average and rule teaching performance.

The pupils were selected by classroom teachers as being underachievers in mathematics on the basis of standardized tests and observations. These pupils were tutored twice weekly by undergraduates enrolled in the methods class. Twenty-nine of the 66 pupils in grades 1 through 6 completed the full 9-month period, the others missing one quarter of instruction because they  could not attend at a time when it was possible for an undergraduate to tutor them. A total of 72 undergraduates were included. Each was given a pretest to determine his basic mathematical knowledge, followed by a posttest at the end of the quarter. The t test was used to determine the exact degree of improvement. Results showed that there was a significant difference in achievement for the children in grades 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. There was no difference in grade 4. There was a statistically significant improvement in knowledge of basic mathematical concepts for undergraduates enrolled in the methods course. (Author/RT)",

Plymouth State College agreed to conduct a 30-week institute to train these teachers in teaching elementary science, specifically in the use of ESS materials. The school boards within the Union agreed to send their teachers to the institute  and to implement the program in 1972. The program was financed by a special program grant for a local charitable organization, the Spaulding-Potter Trust. The institute is being evaluated through pre and post measures of the participants' understandings of and attitudes towards science. Written critiques and open feedback on the methods and materials presented in the institute are evaluated as they are used by the participants in their elementary classrooms. (Author/MBM)",

During the summer session of 1970, the specification of course objectives and development of instructional packers was accomplished. The course material was divided into 12 units. The package for each unit contained the following elements: student directions, statement of objectives, assignment sheets, supplementary reading materials, and criterion checks. The materials were field tested during the fall semester of the 1970-71 academic year. The major management and record-keeping procedures were also developed during that period. During the spring semester  of the same year, a study was conducted in which student achievement and attitudes under the individualized and traditional methods of instruction were compared. No significant difference was found in achievement or achievement gain between both groups, but students in the individualized group were found to have a significantly more positive attitude toward the course.

It was found that experimental-design research in an ongoing social system was extremely difficult because of inability to control internal and external variables. After reviewing various methods used to evaluate social innovations, the staff decided on a combination of the case-study technique advocated by Weiss and Rein and the quasi-experimental design advocated by Campbell. Factors jeopardizing internal and external validity were identified and tentative research designs were outlined for five questions. The questions involved  comparing project and non-project schools in relation to student achievement, school climate, staff attitudes, teacher ability to perform tasks specified in the original proposal, and degree of actual staff differentiation. Each research design specifies a hypothesis, data-gathering instruments, dependent and independent variables, and statistical treatment. (RT)",

This broad involvement, plus the capability to institutionalize the process through program approval, certification, and accreditation procedures offers real promise for significant and lasting relevance and accountability. The renewal process would occur simultaneously in all the  participating agencies, which would ensure continuing adaptability and flexibility to changing needs on the part of educators and those who prepare and certify them. The model offers an opportunity to institutionalize planned change across a broad spectrum from preparation to practice. (MBM)",

Comparisons were made between 22 elementary school teachers and 15 college students selected from a group of 150 volunteers who had no formal education courses or teaching experience. Teaching quality and ability to solve simulated incidents were judged by several experienced professors of education; pupil achievement was  measured by a subject-oriented test; attitude toward teaching was assessed using three standardized tests. Results indicated that although the experienced teachers were rated more effective in teaching, there were no differences in the ability of the two groups to bring about intended behavioral change in subject matter. Secondly, the interns scored higher in their ability to solve simulated teaching problems. Lastly, the interns tended to emphasize the role of a teacher as a motivator more and as a communication specialist significantly less than did the experienced teachers.

The analysis  generally favored the student teaching teams over their solo counterparts. It was noted that team student teaching, compared to solo experiences, allows for greater individualization of teaching and student learning, changes the self-image of prospective teachers positively, provides additional teacher models and helpful peer evaluation, aids trainees in maintaining composure during stress situations, permits significantly greater involvement of school children in learning tasks, encourages more frequent and appropriate teacher reinforcement behavior, and yields less teacher initiated talk.

Instead of giving piecemeal grants, all discretionary funds within OE have been concentrated in one division in order to assist a limited number of school systems to install totally new programs involving all aspects of the school. Each site will be funded for a 5-year period, after which it should be able to continue with combined state and local assistance. Each site will have about 10 schools, all of them in areas where there are large concentrations of disadvantaged children. A locally-developed needs assessment will be the basis for the package of programs funded by OE. Proposals must conform to three criteria: 1) evidence of state and local commitment, 2)  comprehensiveness, 3) program objectives stated in precise measurable terms. Initially the renewal sites will probably be identified by the states with final selection by OE. The state department will also house at least half the total number of \"educational renewal extension agents.\" The agents would tie practitioners to federal, state, and local researchers.

        "description":"This manual is a programmed developmental sequence to be used in providing inservice and preservice training for professional educators--teachers, supervisors, and administrators--in the techniques of interaction analysis. It is designed to implement a 30-40 hour program, which would ideally be enacted in three sessions over a span of several weeks. It is designed for use in a flexible workshop setting with a maximum of 30 participants per instructor. The developmental activities suggested present an increasingly intense involvement with the three phases of interaction analysis instruction: tallying, analysis and interpretation, and usage. The manual has been organized to cover in detail all aspects of the organization and administration of an interaction analysis workshop. It  provides the trainer with complete descriptions of each activity, including rationale, objectives, procedures, and materials; student materials for reproduction; and transparency copy for reproduction. Specific material lists appear with each activity description. A general list, including sources of the material and audiovisual equipment necessary to complete the program, is also included.

        "description":"The seven papers in this book were prepared as the bases of discussions at a BEPD-sponsored conference which dealt with the ways in which teachers can make a difference in education. The conference was a followup to one held a year earlier on the topic, \"Do Teachers Make a Difference.\" The implications which can be drawn suggest the need to make American education more heterogeneous so that students can be offered a number of valid alternative choices. Teachers also need alternatives, as some function best in a structured setting while others perform more effectively with fewer constraints. Programs and the assignment of teachers must be tailored to the needs and aspirations of individual students, and teachers must be trained for this. The individual papers included are 1) \"How  Teachers Make a Difference,\" by Alexander M. Mood; 2) \"The Difference Teachers Make,\" by Philip W. Jackson; 3) \"A Tool-Development Strategy for Research on Teaching,\" by N. L. Gage; 4) \"Structure and Teacher Performance: A Prologue to Systematic Research,\" by Dan C. Lortie; 5) \"New Directions for Research on Teaching,\" by Barak Rosenshine; 6) \"A National Coordinated Program of Research on Teaching Effectiveness,\" by Ned A.

        "description":"This paper applies the Carlsson-Robinson Theory of public employment wages to examine differences in salaries and quality of teachers using data from the Coleman Report. A modified Carlsson-Robinson model of quality determination is complemented with four testable hypotheses of salary determination. Teacher salaries were found to be determined by the level of per capita income in the systems employing them and by the salaries paid in competing occupations in the area. The local cost of living, the quality of the local labor force, and the quality of the teachers themselves were found to be statistically insignificant in determining differences in salary. The same analysis indicates that teacher quality is determined by the quality of the local labor supply and by the salaries  offered to teachers. This result supports the view that school system officials do use their salary budgets to seek high-quality teachers and, moreover, that such teachers are attracted by those higher salaries.

A formal training program was conducted for a period of 6 weeks, 4 hours daily, by a target school principal and an experienced teacher. Trainees received instruction in academic as well as general education topics. The instructional aides are used in classrooms and pull-out programs to give individualized instruction to identified students in language arts and mathematics. They also  perform other routine duties for the teacher. The resource teachers are responsible for the supervision of the total program in each target school; they hold weekly inservice meetings for the instructional aides so that their education is on-going.

Teachers were trained to rate children in terms of observational categories, to help them interpret the needs and potentialities of the disadvantaged child. A videotaped training curriculum which reflected those clusters of behavior which are highly predictive of intelligence and school readiness was prepared, using a group of 4-year-old day care students as subjects. Each child was observed and taped for five periods of 20 minutes, and also tested for IQ. A package of six half-hour tapes was completed in the spring of 1970 and  tested on participants in a training program for day care teacher assistants and on a group of 15 student teachers. A further program involved second year students in early childhood education at New York Community College. Results indicated that the technique employed and the substance and quality of the tapes had value beyond their initial intent or scope and that the tapes are adaptable to a wide range of educational approaches. It is hoped to test the tapes on a wider scale and develop them for broader implementation. The manual used in the program is included in the document. (MBM)",

Its major objective was to build a field-based program using predefined behavioral objectives and their accompanying performance criteria with an instructional program integrating theoretical knowledge with practical experience. Twenty trainees were selected for the program on the basis of grade-point average and a personal interview. Administrative arrangements were made to allow program participants to take their professional courses on a pass-fail basis. Seminars were coordinated with concurrent classroom experience at progressively increasing levels of responsibility in three types of school: inner-city, urban, and suburban. Cooperating teachers in these schools were designated\"clinical associates\" and provided with inservice training. Of the 20 trainees, 17 completed the program successfully and were certified. Of these, 12 had obtained teaching positions as of June 1970. Detailed recommendations for program improvement include closer involvement of cooperating schools, previous rather than concurrent training of clinical associates, and involvement of trainees in developing objectives and criteria.

Oral language production was assessed using the Gloria and David Oral English test, an individually administered audiovisual repetition task. Children were selected from all second grade classrooms in five participating schools. The spelling test consisted of 15 words selected from the phonological assessment according to the criteria of (1) a total number of production differences of 10% or more for all subjects in both groups who attempted the word and (2) the word contained a feature previously published research indicated as being pronounced with a high  frequency of divergence for groups of Negro and white residents of the region. Conclusions include: (1) The white children were better able to produce the dialect of English presented by the model than were the Negro children; (2) Pronunciation differences which existed for the Negro pupils included those that existed for the white pupils; (3) A number of Negro pupils had the production capability for many dialect features of standard English; (4) The overall spelling performance of the white pupils was more rational than that of the Negro pupils.

        "description":"This paper documents the methodological study which was undertaken to discover the best way to obtain high quality tape-recorded samples of casual, spontaneous speech from children in kindergarten through Grade 3. All children interviewed were from schools in areas qualifying for compensatory education programs under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. With the exception of two sessions, all group interviews were video taped. There were six groups of children, aged 5 to 9, participating in the interviews. The technique of interviewing children individually was tried out with Groups 1 and 2. Two paired interviews were conducted with children from Group 2 and three paired interviews were conducted with children from Group 4. The most important finding  suggested by this survey is that it is possible to elicit and record casual speech samples from 5- to 9-year-old children in an artificial environment, provided great care is taken to make the children feel relaxed and unthreatened. Apparently, the best method for doing this is to choose one child from the socioeconomic group under study and allow him to form a group of peers at his discretion. (Author/CK)",

Implications for the design of a spelling component within a unified communication skills program are presented. (Author)",

        "description":"Representatives of three major universities, with the help of about 30 consultants and over 200 teachers and several thousand students in 24 field-testing schools, over a two-year period prepared and tested a handbook or catalog of representative performance objectives in English for grades 9-12, which is included as an appendix to this report. The field-testing of a preliminary version of the catalog revealed its usefulness not only in the designated grades but also, in many instances, its adaptability to grades 7 and 8. Conclusions include: (1) The fears of performance objectives, held by many teachers of English, are unwarranted; (2) It would be a mistake to attempt to use mere mathematical measurement of accomplishment in many segments of English; (3) In teacher education,  prospective teachers need to be helped to learn to think in terms of what kinds of responses they may expect from students. Recommendations include: (1) The handbook-catalog should be used as widely as possible in college courses for pre-service and in-service teachers of secondary school English; (2) Teachers of both junior and senior high school English should be encouraged to use a published version of the handbook-catalog in establishing objectives for their classes.

In all, 50 courses are offered for students' pre-registration. Each student chooses six nine-week, one-quarter credit courses. He is assured of being enrolled in a minimum of four of the courses. This policy has encouraged an exodus from study halls to English classes and also permits students deficient in credits to make up for lost time. In answer to the students' complaint that having the same class all year was unendurable, teachers recommended that all elective courses should be offered on a nine-week basis. To convince students that language arts really had a \"new look,\" creative titles were given to  each of the courses. The Madison program offers the advantages of nongraded and multi-age grouping. Students have the opportunity to judge their own ability to enroll in courses in which they believe they are capable of achieving. Increased enrollment, positive attitudes, grade improvement, and additional courses indicate the success of the Elective English program. Other advantages of this program are: (1) It is student centered and of interest to students; (2) It allows for individual differences; (3) It permits teachers to be a responsible force in the construction and implementation of the project.

For this formulation, a linear transformation of the logarithm of the correct response is maximized if the examinee reports accurately his personal probability. To equate omits scores with choice scores, the transformation can be chosen so that the score is zero if the examinee indicates complete uncertainty. If this is done, the scoring function depends on the number of alternatives. One could also align uncertainty and response omission by granting credit for omitting items, though it is felt this might be hard to explain to examinees. (Author)",

One subgroup is used to discriminate among criterion groups, the second to provide normal linear predictions for each group. Individualized regression constants are subsequently obtained by computing probabilities of group membership from the discriminating measures and weighting the group prediction equations by these probabilities. The technique is illustrated by the prediction of cumulative University of Washington GPA for student groups categorized by terminal university status using achievement and aptitude measures from the Washington Pre-College testing program. Errors on validation were slightly less for the adjusted predictions than for a single pooled prediction  equation suggesting this may be a promising approach to the moderation of predictions.

Traditionally, instructional strategy research and development takes the learner as he comes, an integrated organism. In learning theory research, there is control and limitation on the structure of the learning materials, whereas instructional subject-matter is rich in potential organization and hierarchical orderings. Moreover, learning theory research deals in a subset of factors relevant to instruction. This paper addresses problems in bridging gaps between learning research and instructional development by considering the relevance of the premises of learning  theory and identifying some promising directions that draw on the concepts of cybernetics and information processing.

The program provides basic elementary education to individuals functioning at or below the third grade level in arithmetic and English, as well as those who are unable to speak, read, or write the English language. The objective of the project is to train unemployed and underemployed youth and adults who have inadequate skills, to obtain and hold jobs, so they may become productive, functional members of society. The subjects were selected from terminees of the program who had been given the Basic Education Test (BET) upon entry and the Adult Basic Learning Exam (ABLE) during the training  period. Analysis of variance and trend analysis were conducted and the results indicate that the program was effective in giving its trainees an increase in educational attainment with a linear trend.

Consideration is given to the effect the use of videotapes of actual classroom behavior have on test planning. Two methods of incorporating such situational material into the test specifications are discussed, and some perceived advantages and disadvantages of each are presented. An account is given of the planning method employed in Project NuTEx, a research project supported by the National Teacher Examinations, along with some evaluative statements about the effects the adopted method had on the project. The many ways of presenting objective test items in a television test are described, and the problems this increased  flexibility presents are briefly outlined. Some indication is made of research questions that must be answered if television is to be used rationally as a testing medium. (Author/AG)",

More appropriate conceptions of tests are: (1) tests for selection; (2) tests for pupil guidance; (3) tests for evaluating instruction.

        "description":"Using the data from the Educational Opportunities Survey (1965), this report shows shows that for sixth grade students, 24 percent of the total differences among students in their academic achievement is the maximum national value that can be associated with their membership in one of six racial-ethnic groups (Indian, Mexican, Puerto-Rican, Negro, Oriental, or white). This relationship prevails before the allocation of these groups to different social conditions has been taken into account. After a variety of social condition variables have been accounted for, such as the social and economic well-being of the family, the presence or absence of key family members, the students and parents aspirations for his schooling, etc., the precentage of difference dropped to 1.2. Similar  results were obtained for other grade levels and for each region of the country. Hence, no inferences can be made about the \"independent effect\" of membership in a particular racial-ethnic group on academic achievement because of the influence of a variety of social conditions. Other analyses show that variables pertaining to the motivational and attitudinal aspects of family life play a greater role in academic achievement than either racial-ethnic group membership, social class membership, or the type of school attended.

Following the administration of a six-category test battery, the children were placed within two groups: Group 1, containing 84 children, was exposed during the first half of the school year to one-half hour daily enrichment classes composed of learning games intended to improve the academic operations previously evaluated; Group 2, with 73 children, remained within their regular classroom environment during the first half of the year. Following a second testing using the six-category battery, the children in Group 2 were exposed to the daily program of Learning Game  enrichment, while Group 1 remained in their classrooms. The Learning Games, in general, are activities which require an active response on the part of the child. The content of the enrichment program was unique to each school and flexible. Analysis of the data involved intra-group correlations of the test scores, inter-group comparisons of rates of change, and other similar procedures. (Author/JM)",

The sample consists of all elementary school students who were bused from the ghetto schools as well as a sample of white children in the receiving schools. The first measurements were taken in 1966, just prior to the implementation of the busing program. There were actually three different busing dates, a source of both problems and the opportunity for making various comparisons. The availability of such built-in controls is important since a basic ingredient for a true assessment of desegregation effects was lacking: namely, a matched school district that did not desegregate. Post-measurements were taken in the spring of  1967, one year after the majority of the children had been desegregated, in the spring of 1969, and most recently in the spring of 1971. The approach taken examines the causal nexus for individual variability within the classroom and within the school. In 1969, a sample of kindergarten children was included, and reassessed in the most recent testing. In 1971, an additional sample of kindergarteners was included. The data from these new samples make possible the assessment of the effects of the recent changes in race relations and other events affecting the community at large on the child's home environment.

The resulting need was for a special academic program that would make learning more meaningful, create an effective climate conducive to altering negative self-image, provide for positive rather than aversive reinforcement, and increase existing intellectual skills. Such a program was begun in the 1968-69 academic year at the Casa Grande, Arizona, Union High School. Students who were involved in the special program during the 1968-69 and 1969-70  academic years differed from their predecessors. Only nine and one-half percent dropped out of school compared to 20 percent in previous years. Absenteeism averaged only five percent among these youth compared to an average 12 to 15 percent among comparable youth. Minimal increase in intellectual skills was also demonstrated as most students showed a post-test increase on a test designed to measure potentiality in the areas of abstract reasoning, numerical ability, verbal ability, and language usage.

Various successful programs were studied in order to discover the factors the schools had in common. The study was conducted during the School Year 1970-71 and four successful schools served as the basis of this report. Two schools were in New York City, one in Kansas City, and one in Los Angeles. The report describes the research goals and method; it also gives a detailed picture of the four schools and draws some conclusions. In particular, it is believed that the success of the schools identified shows that the failure in beginning reading typical of inner-city schools is the fault not of the children or their background, but of the schools. Appendix 1 deals with the  test that was used to determine reading ability. Appendix 2 contains a comment on beginning reading achievement and income. (Author/JW)",

A six-week instructional program was conducted between June 8 and July 17, 1970, for 40 suburban students and 20 central city students. The students came from elementary schools and junior high schools. School district officials tried to select students who had demonstrated scholastic ability and a record of good school attendance. UML was a voluntary program which brought students together across state lines. Buses were provided for transportation. The stated goals were: to utilize community resources in learning about the metropolitan area  and its people; to facilitate the development of positive intercultural understanding and intergroup relationships among students of differing social, economic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds; and, to actively involve students in high interest learning experiences dealing with the future of the metropolitan area. In this report, an evaluation of the program is presented. Most of the evaluation report describes the perceptions of participants and observers. Strengths and weaknesses of the program are also analyzed. Finally, various recommendations are presented. (Author/JW)",

One hundred questionnaires were drawn at random from each high school. Honesty in response from the students was encouraged by guaranteeing the anonymity of the schools and students involved. From the results, it was shown that the white students sampled from segregated suburban high schools tend to report having generally favorable attitudes toward, but little contact with black Americans. This is in line with long-term trends which have made it socially unacceptable  to express openly negative attitudes towards blacks. However, it was also found that a substantial minority of students expressed hostility and prejudice towards blacks (stereotypes); these students offered simplistic or negative proposals for solving problems of race relations.

The responses of the 529 black students indicated that contact with whites and liking for whites are positively related and that these variables influence attitudes on matters involving civil rights. The responses of the 599 white students indicated that contact with blacks and liking for blacks are positively related, and that attitude toward blacks is an intervening variable between negative sterotyping of blacks and contact with blacks. For both groups of students, a circular process appears to be at work wherein contact leads to increased  acceptance and increased acceptance generates receptivity for additional contact. Mediated by variables involving interracial trust and stereotyping, this process appears to have had a measurable impact on the attitudes of students in the sample even though they have relatively little contact with and a high level of distrust for persons of the other race.

The nature of maternal communication was assessed by analyzing the verbal behavior of the mother while in discussion with her child. A series of mother-child pairs were given three experimental tasks which required that mother and child reach a concensus. The tasks were designed so as to stimulate discussion between mother and child, as well as to provide the mother with an opportunity to exercise her authority over her child. The discussions between mother and child were analyzed according to a schema based on the assumption that there are four basic functions of human  speech: to teach, to please, to demand, and to defend oneself. An additional purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between the nature of maternal and paternal control and the child's resistance to temptation. The extent and nature of familial control was assessed by means of a questionnaire which was filled out by the child. Positive control is defined as the encouragement of the child to feel some responsibility toward some positively defined goal. Negative control is defined as a barrier, limitation, or restriction imposed by the parent on the child's activities. (Author/JM)",

The focus of this program, subtitled &quot;An approach to Community Educational Improvement,&quot; is the development of a success technique for use with inner city pupils. The success technique is an application of reinforcement theory to modify pupil behavior utilizing relevant, rewarding experiences with positive outcomes as the reinforcer. Over a three-year period, the major goals or objectives of the program are: to train teachers, assistant teachers, and pupil models to use the success technique; to observe, record, and evaluate behavioral changes that occur in project  pupils who are exposed to success technique; and, to develop, refine, and document the success technique based on experience obtained from utilizing and evaluating it, so that it can be replicated in other schools or cities. Criterial behavior being observed include conduct, academic achievement, and self-concept. Although it is too early to be able to draw conclusions from the data collected, the evidence is promising. For example, over the first 22 weeks of the school year, disruptions per student dropped from around 3.5 to around l.5. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In this report, the results of analyses of data from ESEA Title I Program evaluations collected in the 1969 Survey of Compensatory Education are presented. These data analyses bear on the evaluation of the operations and impact of the programs in 9236 school districts and 3219 elementary schools, involving 215,995 teachers of 5,733,976 pupils in grades two, four, and six. The data analyses are organized around four general questions about compensatory education programs in Title I elementary schools during the 1968-69 school year. (1) In what context of families, schools, and communities were compensatory education programs conducted? (2) What was the extent of the needs for compensatory education programs and how did these needs vary with such factors as pupil's ethnic-group  membership, urbanism of school, etc.? (3) How efficient and sensible was the process of allocation of resources for compensatory education programs? Were Title I funds and participation in compensatory education programs allocated to the schools, teachers, and pupils with the greatest need for such programs? (4) What impact did compensatory education programs have? What were the outcomes of such programs in terms of pupils' performance on standardized achievement tests, teachers' ratings of pupils' academic personal and social growth, and teachers' general satisfaction with compensatory programs?

        "description":"With the increase in the number of newly desegrated and not yet integrated schools has come a rise in reports of student behaviors considered anti-school and anti-teacher. Many institutions are strengthening security personnel to enforce order and discipline. But community reaction to \"police\" may be more destructive than the unacceptable behavior of children. Student participation in administration does not necessarily reduce or eliminate the occurrence of such behaviors, which are not in themselves a new phenomenon. Hiring uniformed guards is more of a new act which everyone confronted with serious discipline problems does not do. A more positive and constructive approach is the continual evaluation of discipline standards in all schools, integrated or segregated. Teachers must  take into account the many factors which comprise natural barriers not only to the learning process but to human interaction as well. The disadvantaged have a \"second education\" quite different from that institutionalized by Jews, Chinese, and Japanese: it is a \"reality education\" with one's social and even physical survival at stake. This informal education is uniquely divergent from the formal education attempted in schools. Employment of the symbols of law enforcement to coerce surface conformity to the standards of schools is demeaning to both guards and students, and ultimately self-defeating. (JM)",

The data represent selected characteristics and findings in the population groups that were studied. The intent of the surveys was to determine the nutrition levels of disadvantaged families rather than provide a true picture of a cross section of the total population. Sampling selection was based on 1970 census data, although the actual survey was instituted in June 1968 and not concluded until May 1970. Because of the incomplete nature of the data forming the basis of this report, it is considered that one should be cautious in  drawing conclusions.

This area was rated in the lowest category for Milwaukee in terms of median educational level and income, and in the highest in terms of population density per living unit, percent housing rated as dilapidated, and unemployment. A pool of candidates composed of mothers with full-scale Wechslar Adult Intelligence Test IQs of 75 or less was randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition. Forty mothers meeting this IQ criterion had babies over an 18 month period and were assigned as either experimental or control families. All families selected were of Negro extraction. The experimental intervention is comprised of two components: the infant stimulation program, and the maternal  rehabilitation program. The former program is designed to facilitate intellectual development of very young children. The plan is concerned with a staff to manage and arrange instruction for children, a physical location which promotes learning, and the stimulation program. The latter program was initiated to better prepare the experimental mothers for employment opportunities and to improve their homemaking to teach the mothers basic academic tools necessary for vocational adaptability and an occupational training program to teach specific vocational skills.

Thus, it appears that because of different styles of caretaking in the two cultures, by three-to-four months of age the infants have already acquired culturally distinctive behaviors, and that this has happened out of awareness and well before the development of language. This interpretation is challengeable on two grounds: (1) behavioral differences may be genetically determines; and, (2) social change happens within a particular human group, resulting in  significant shifts in baby behavior. Comparable data obtained from Japanese-American mothers of the third generation and infants can provide information to help settle both of these arguments. Naturalistic observations were made on two consecutive days during 1961-1964 in the homes of 30 Japanese and 30 white American first-born three-to-four month old infants equally divided by sex and living in intact middle-class urban families. Data on the ordinary daily life of the infant were obtained by time-sampling. The behavior of the Japanese-Americans is apparently closer to that of the Americans than that of the Japanese.(JM)",

Uncertainty about one's future precipitates uncertainty about one's modes of conflict resolution that are bound up with a particular sense of future, and thereby threatens to reawaken the conflicts anew. This &quot;identity crisis&quot; exists for many members of all groups that have labeled themselves as &quot;ethnic,&quot; as well as others that have been excluded from this rubric by those who now seek to overdefine themselves. Remarks here are confined to Slovak-Americans, with whom was done one and one-half years of field research in the industrial region  of Western Pennsylvania, focusing on a third and fourth generation family analysis. The formulation proposed in this paper would suggest that as a consequence of socialization, individual, and experience in the world beyond the family, ambivalence would still be very much present. As for the problem of marginal status, the current assertations of &quot;ethnic pride&quot; and the beginnings of &quot;ethnic power&quot; movements would certainly suggest that socioeconomic and cultural marginality are not issues of the past. Thus, for the present generation the phenomenology of the ego would be little changed from earlier generations. (Author/JM)",

It presently feeds about 3.6 million Americans living in about 1,000 counties and cities. It is an out-growth of farm-oriented legislation which was developed in the mid-1930's. The program reached its peak levels after World War II. Since the early 1960's, it has been overshadowed by the Food Stamp Program, which now reaches about 10.5 million people. The Committee believes that the Food Distribution Program is fraught with problems and difficulties. First, the testimony of  recipients is recorded. Secondly, members of the private food sector describe what is wrong with the program as it now exists; and, thirdly, is recorded how it might be substantially improved.

It was found that the students knew about 30 percent of the material before reading the programs, that mastery rose to a very high level on the immediate posttest, and that about half of the improvement was lost by the end of the course (an interval of about 96 days). There was considerable variation in item difficulty by the end of the course. Most of this variation was independent of topic difficulty or measures of time difficulty obtained from the early posttests. Instructors (who were also experienced technicians) were asked to indicate the items that were most relevant to subsequent  instruction or to performance on the job. These ratings were not very reliable. The indicated items did not differ appreciably from the remaining items in terms of student proficiency. It was concluded that if the instructors were correct in their ratings, there was enough forgetting to hinder a number of students in learning from subsequent courses and in performing their assigned duties on the job.

This program was designed to train lower-aptitude personnel in a relatively shorter time to assume ET duties in the fleet. The fleet performance capabilities of 51 X-ET's and a matched sample of 43 Class A School graduates (A-ET's) were assessed by performance ratings and structured interviews with the technicians' supervisors after the technicians had experienced approximately 24 months duty in the fleet. The two groups were rated comparable in overall technical performance, but the A-ET's were rated as more capable in the specific areas of electronics troubleshooting and in the use of test equipment. The A-ET's tended to be in  higher paygrades than the X-ET's, although the expressed career intentions for both groups were highly similar, and at least 70 percent of both samples had completed one or more electronic training courses beyond their original ET training. Generally, the experimental ET program successfully trained marginally qualified personnel, in a relatively shorter period of time, to perform satisfactorily the duties of the Electronics Technician rating.

Unfortunately, the abilities of available manpower have not been developed to meet the requirements of jobs at the levels where the increased demands have occurred. As a result, employment opportunities are not available for many individuals although many jobs cannot be filled. This handbook was developed to provide a basic guide for use in restructuring job systems in order to utilize available manpower resources more efficiently. The proper and judicious application of the job restructuring techniques described in this handbook may contribute to alleviating this imbalance by providing appropriate  job opportunities for these individuals. The methodology contained in this handbook was derived from a special adaptation of the job analysis concepts and techniques developed by the United States Training and Employment Service over a 35-year period.

Community views and aspirations, as well as government services and taxes, are stressed as major factors in economic growth. Several possible solutions which are suggested have in common an emphasis on the need for greater civic awareness among the residents, so that needed tax levies can be passed. This requires better public relations by local government in order to increase community participation. In addition, the researchers consider proposals for  governmental reorganization which would eliminate duplication of effort and competition between various levels of government in the area. One such alternative, the voluntary council, would enable governments to cooperate while remaining autonomous.

A natural advantage in manufacturing had been harmful to diversification, resulting in relatively great cyclical fluctuations. Johnstown exhibits population characteristics typical of a depressed area, with a low median income and migration of productive manpower out of the area. Using a random sample of 700 households and interviews with various civic leaders, the researchers determined how community attitudes were shaped  by such factors as poverty and racial discrimination.

Three feedback groups, each consisting of four vocational teachers, practiced demonstrating a manipulative skill during seven 5-minute teaching sessions. Their lessons were evaluated by a panel of two judges using a critique form on demonstrating a manipulative skill. An  analysis of the mean performance scores revealed no significant differences in effectiveness among the techniques, but it did reveal a significant change in the teachers' performance.

Twenty-four preservice and inservice teachers participated in the study, each teaching two 7-minute micro-lessons to peers or to high school students, with and without video feedback. Data collected included ratings on the critique forms completed by the teacher educator and questionnaires completed by the teachers. Statistical tests were computed and revealed no significant differences between the two groups. However,  responses on the questionnaire indicated that the teachers who had received video feedback and had taught high school students were more positive in attitude. As a result of this investigation, it was recommended that video feedback and teaching to high school students be included in the teaching practice sessions of the methods class and that teachers participating in such programs be given intensive training in the micro-teaching format.

Each teacher in the study taught a micro-lesson to four high school students. The teacher educator then viewed the videotape of the micro-lesson and conducted a supervisory conference with the teacher. Finally, the master teacher educator viewed the  videotape of the teacher-teacher educator conference and conducted a supervisory conference with the teacher educators, either on an individual basis or with a group of three. Based on analysis of the data collected from the above sessions and from the teacher educators' satisfaction and evaluation forms, no significant difference was found to exist between the two groups in effectiveness on supervisory performance or expressed satisfaction.

Subjects for the study were 36 home economics student teachers who were engaged in their final preservice experience during winter quarter 1969 at Ohio State University. Each student teacher and college supervisor was assigned to a supervisory technique, resulting in 12 student teachers involved in each technique. A pretest/posttest control-group designed provided the means for testing the hypothesesposed in the study. Results of the  experiment indicated that alternative methods of college supervision are feasible in terms of student teacher improvement in specific teaching skills and teaching confidence. However, there was no significant difference in satisfaction with the three supervisory methods as expressed by the three college supervisors. (Authors)",

The two techniques were tested at three sites in New York State and involved the collection of data in terms of teacher performance, teacher satisfaction, and teacher education and direction assessment. A two-member panel of judges for each site rated the teachers' videotaped pretest and posttest teaching sessions using a critique form on teaching a complete lesson. The teacher satisfaction data were collected on a satisfaction scale completed by the teachers after the posttest taping session. The teacher educators completed questionnaires and the directors provided  their reactions by letter. Based on analysis of these data, no statistical differences were found in teaching performance and teacher satisfaction between each of the three sets of two treatment groups. However, all five teacher educators endorsed the microteaching format for adoption in the methods courses, indicating that video recording was not necessarily an essential component. It was also recommended that microteaching sessions include high school-level persons as students. (Author/JS)",

Street interviews conducted throughout the city showed that radio and newspaper advertisements were much more successful than the expensive mobile recruiting teams in informing minorities about career opportunities. Despite the comparatively high pay scale of the police department, the minority youth indicated that service aspects of police work were more important than economic returns. Retention  of applicants is a serious problem, with less than a third of all candidates who passed the competitive exam finally appointed as probationary patrolmen. The retention rate could be greatly improved by more personal encouragement of candidates and a reduction in the 17-month delay between exam and appointment. (BH)",

The study, based on interviews with 23 public school superintendents, revealed that there is ample motivation to change and expand occupational education programs. Also, it was found that local support for occupational education programs is widespread, thus contributing to the climate necessary for change. However, obstacles to change were noted, such as the ability to obtain and effectively utilize sufficient resources for program implementation. Cost, in particular, was identified as the primary obstacle to change. In  discussing strategies for overcoming obstacles, the study recognizes two major limitations regarding program innovation--the limited power of a superintendent and the boundaries of the superintendent's ambitions for the system.

Programs were presented, reviewed and discussed System, and to: (1) orient counselors to the ramifications of H.B. 509, (2) Specific recommendations were that: (1) Faculty members must be thoroughly trained to implement any innovation, (2) Each district should designate an individual to assume responsibility for the program, and (3) The program should serve grades K-12.

One of the studies was of the Texas Junior College drafting and design curricula, another was of the buildings and equipment, and the third used an industrial survey to determine criteria for a program guide. The assumptions for formulating the suggested curriculum were that: (1) the course of study should be for students wishing to pursue a particular vocation, (2) the occupational needs of students are generated by employers, (3) the classification of occupations implies common knowledge and skill, (4) some occupations require unique knowledges and skills, (5) duplication  of subject matter should be minimized, and (6) adequate equipment and facilities are necessary. The surveys of junior colleges were confined to those colleges with associate degree programs, and the industrial concerns were stratified according to areas of specialization, volume of employment, and regional location.

The first was to obtain desirable subject matter for an instructional program in nondestructive testing through a survey of selected manufacturing and service companies in Texas, and the second was to determine the degree of emphasis that should be placed on each subject. Fifty-nine categories of business were represented in the sample population of 276. A questionnaire, which utilized a rating scale, was used for collecting the data which was analyzed by chi-square procedures at the .05 level. It was concluded that subject matter shown in the questionnaire should be retained and formulated into an instructional program in nondestructive testing and inspection. Because there is a shortage in this field, graduates of the  proposed program will find positions, and their training will be reduced due to their knowledge and skills. It was recommended that program planners should incorporate the subject matter contained in the main areas of: penetrant, magnetic particle, eddy current, ultrasonics, and radiographic nondestructive listing and inspection. A related document, the instructional program, is available as VT 014 417. (Author/GEB)",

        "description":"The demand for the associate professional is creating new jobs, providing services, and making greater use of manpower. This demand began in 1956 when the number of white collar workers outnumbered the blue collar workers in the United States. The post-industrial worker is a &quot;knowledge worker,&quot; who expresses dissatisfaction with his job because individual performance is not given enough consideration. The force of the non-profit sector of society on the economy has been overlooked, although the steady use of urbanization has greatly increased the need for community services. One important factor on which mid-level scientific, technical and professional personnel will depend is reasonable and accurate occupational forecasting data. Other factors that reduce our capacity to meet  the needs of associate professionals are social and cultural attitudes, resistance by professionals, and union, seniority, and bargaining unit constraints. Although many factors work against job restructuring, the benefits of restructuring are evident in increased employee satisfaction. The formal education system needs to be changed to meet the needs of people who for livelihood and for personal growth and fulfillment must engage in a lifetime of learning. The concept of education should be changed to include society as an education system. (GEB)",

        "description":"As with any new theory, it is necessary to validate the basic construct of vocational maturity. Once this is done, instruments to measure vocational maturity, or decision making, can be evaluated. With this as an objective, this paper discusses some of the problems associated with measuring vocational maturity, such as identifying variables, methods of data collection, and item selection procedures. The selection and definition of related vocational maturity variables is complicated by the lack of a well-defined taxonomy. Choice of methodology is difficulty, since three approaches have been used in previous data gathering--the partially structured interview, the structured interview, and fixed alternative questions. The paper also examines the basic assumptions regarding  vocational maturity as well as validation by internal and external evidence. Validation by internal evidence is discussed in terms of the four dimensions of Crites' model: (1)Consistency of Vocational Choice, (2) Wisdom of Vocational Choice, (3) Vocational Choice Competencies, and (4) Vocational Choice Attitudes. Validation by external evidence presents problems in that the existing data regarding external evidence is somewhat limited at the present time. (JS)",

        "description":"By examining the relationship between culture and the formation of personality, this paper attempts to define and describe the \"culture of poverty.\" While recognizing that many studies and findings exist which support the culture of poverty concept, the paper also recognizes that there are too many unanswered questions to state unequivocally that the lifeways of the poor actually form a unique cultural pattern. Valentine, for instance, argues that the concept of a culture of poverty was constructed by theorists who cannot escape their own middle-class bias. He also fears that analyzing problems of the poor in terms of a culture of poverty may result in too much emphasis being given to alleged motivational peculiarities of the poor at the expense of overlooking structural  characteristics of the stratified system. Valentine therefore recommends, and the data in this report support, a full-scale ethnographic study of impoverished groups to determine whether a culture of poverty does in fact exist. In any case, it is widely accepted that life experiences of the poor have produced different modes of response. Therefore training programs need an imaginative approach which will discover and make optimal use of latent motivations and aspirations of the poor. (JS)",

Four basic types of contracts can be used to procure goods and services: fixed and performance contracts for resources and fixed and performance contracts for results. The basic considerations in choice of type are risk, relative technologies, management skills between school and contractor, institutional considerations, and other intangibles. In contracting for student achievement, the goals sought are associated with reading, mathematics and vocational education skills, i.e., those skills that lend themselves to precise specification. The greater the technological and managerial advantage of the prospective contractor over the school, the greater the advantage of a contract for results over a  contract for resources. The greater the risk in a project, the greater the advantage of a performance contract over a fixed contract. There is a large number of operational programs at the present time, but they are all experimental, and most are narrow in scope. In most of the programs, the contractors are directly involved in the classroom teaching and learning process. The real strength of performance contracting is its versatility--its potentiality for use in a wide variety of contexts. (Author/CK)",

The present assessment differs in that many of the data upon which it is based are derived from informal study conducted during a two-year period. This study involved on-the-spot visits to universities, research agencies, publishing houses, library inspections, and a number of personal interviews, throughout Italy, with sociologists, university professors, research people, students, and other personnel associated with Italian sociology. Formal research was also conducted. It was found that Italian sociology during the past 25 years has emerged into one of  the strongest positions among the countries of Europe. Further progress, however, depends to a great extent upon reorganization of the Italian university and the creation of employment opportunities for sociologists throughout Italian society. Reportedly only a very small percentage, less than 10%, of graduates from Trento and the post-graduate programs are successful in finding employment commensurate with their professional training and interests.

To judge the effectiveness of this approach to individualized instruction, a formal test program was devised. The tests show a dramatic educational gain for the children in the project. Evaluation of the materials indicated that they need to be made more applicable for classroom teaching. Testing methods were found to be insufficient; better ones need to be developed. It is  recommended that similar studies be conducted. An appendix presents ITPA and SRA graphs for two students, as well as tabulations showing their percent gains on 12 tests.

The effect of the decision of local school administrators concerning the critical needs of the community with respect to how these decisions shaped Adult Vocational Education (AVE) programs in these cities was studied. AVE students were questioned, and the following data were collected: (1) 72% of males were white; (2) 67% of males had completed 12 or more years of school; (3) 84% of males were employed; (4) Major reason for attending was job upgrading. It was found that lack of financial assistance hampered most programs. However, present AVE  programs could be expanded and operated for a minimum amount of money if the disadvantaged group were recruited and safeguards were devised to prevent local school systems from utilizing the AVE money for other purposes. The AVE program in two of the cities studied is a small part of a large adult program that has no direct ties to other vocational training. Other findings of this study are: (1) None of the programs has in the past utilized a formal planning process for guiding program development; (2) No descriptive data on students are presently collected; (3) Guidance is limited to course selection and scheduling problems; and (4) The thrust of current programs is such that job development is unnecessary.

Several outstanding scholars were invited to present papers on their studies of the social systems and communication networks of scientific communities, and to help elucidate the nature and characteristics of professional behavior of educational researchers. William Garvey and his associates described the more typical communication channels in educational research. William Paisley and David Lingwood examined the concept of invisible colleges as a way of examining the community of educational researchers. Ronald Corwin and  Maynard Seider reported on their interviews of scholars who have examined the institutionalization of science. Warren Hagstrom and Norman Storer each examined the educational research community, using conceptual frameworks that have evolved from their studies of the social structure of the hard sciences. These authors were joined by selected leaders within the educational research community who discussed the papers and made recommendations to the research community in general and to AERA specifically. A list of colloquium participants and footnote references are provided. (Author/DB)",

It is stated that no one is willing to discuss the real implications of promoting education in any land. Questions of social upheaval or loss of traditional values caused by increased attention to education in developing nations are said to be seldom mentioned. Three issues are called to the attention of writers in this field: (1) the lack of criticism of the UNESCO approach or the traditional export of educational systems and policy; (2) the fact that well-known authors do not seem willing to entertain considerations of so-called &quot;ethical&quot; questions; and (3) that many educators from developing nations are not  challenging the theories and machinery of their influential counterparts.

Obstacles to the adoption of family planning in the countries of tropical Africa are a very high mortality rate among children; a socioeconomic structure that favors high fertility; very low levels of literacy; infrastructure and female participation in non-agricultural jobs; an inadequate health infrastructure; an acute lack of health personnel; and governmental opposition to the idea of population control. If family planning were introduced as an integral part of maternal and child health (MCH), it is believed that the program would have some chance of success. Potential areas of  assistance by donor countries in creating a network of MCH centers are: (1) if desired by the countries, building up a &quot;post partum&quot; family planning program in major hospitals of major cities; (2) stimulating the development of MCH centers in both rural and urban areas; (3) offering scholarships for the training of nurse-midwives and developing local facilities for their training; and (4) offering assistance in the fields of census taking and demographic sample surveys.

The Individually Prescribed Instructional System (IPI) at Draper Correctional Center, which teaches basic education skills, as well as vocational skills, is an example of a training system developed and promoted by a psychologist. This system uses programmed instructional modules. In addition to the system's diagnosis, prescription, and  management function, testing is conducted to evaluate the learner's progress. Contingency contracting is also used within the IPI system. The system can be tailored to a variety of settings containing different populations, and having varying amounts of resources. (DB)",

The pervasive role of generalization in intervention assessment is indicated, and the task of predicting recidivism as the criterion is pointed out. The direct and indirect ways of observing human behavior are presented, and the 10 basic dimensions of behavioral measurement are given. The six-stage process of behavioral research is given, and the prediction of recidivism is  related to the Environmental Deprivation Scale, which serves as a door-opening device for intervention.

        "description":"A description is given of the development and application of contingency management (CM) techniques to the educational performance of a broad cross section of adult, male prison inmates. By most standards, these inmates are judged to be at the lowest rung of the motivational ladder. Draper Correctional Center experimental and demonstration projects were begun in 1961 to provide basic education through the use of programmed instruction (PI). To modify the operation of the self instructional school, an Individually Prescribed Instructional System was created, and effective CM procedures were developed. CM procedures were also applied to vocational training at Draper in the Manpower Development and Training Programs. Six studies made of the use of CM in the Draper program show that  the materials and techniques that have been successfully employed fall into two categories: the contingency or performance contract, and progress plotters. Results of the studies clearly indicate that performance-contingent pay to trainees is significantly superior in getting efficient and effective learning in both basic education and vocational programs.

It is divided into five sections: (1) Introduction, which advocates that policy for processing and disseminating scientific and technical information be considered an inseparable part of policy for science and technology, (2) Current Information Policy and Practices, (3) Goals for a National Policy on Scientific and Technical Information, which include promoting the efficient and successful development of the nation's capability in science and technology, (4) Implications for Public Policy, which include international interdependence, and (5) Conclusions and  Recommendations. Conclusions include: (1) The activities of the OECD in the scientific and technical information field have been constructive and should be expanded; (2) The rapid expansion of knowledge, especially in the fields of science and technology, makes it increasingly difficult to share and use information effectively, and governments at the highest level ought to accord priority attention to developing methods for the efficient use of new information; (3) Proper handling of scientific and technical information must not be regarded as an administrative or mechanical matter. It is recommended that policies and strategies for scientific and technical information be developed as an integral part of the design of policy as a whole and R and D policy in particular. (CK)",

        "description":"This guide has been developed to assist Officers-in-Charge of Navy service schools in implementing effective in-service training programs. The primary objective for any school is to maintain effective instruction. The guide contains four chapters. Chapter I, Definition and Scope of In-Service Training, defines training as special training or instruction provided for Navy instructors to increase their over-all competence and effectiveness as instructors. The scope of the training is focused on assisting the school staff in achieving the goal of improved instruction. Chapter II, Planning an In-Service Training Program, includes a discussion of program publicizing, making the program work, and keeping the program going. Chapter III, Conducting an In-Service Training Program,  includes discussions of individual effectiveness and supervisory and collateral duties. Chapter IV, Controlling an In-Service Training Program, discusses the characteristics of a good in-service training program, factors which may serve as indicators of a good program, and follow-up activities. Seven appendices contain a bibliography, a sample written in-service program, sample monthly in-service training report, a resume of two appropriate in-service training meetings, samples of suggested forms, methods of instruction, and the graduate-undergraduate concept.

        "description":"Current definitions of illiteracy and functional illiteracy are reviewed, and their relationship both to estimates of the scope of the problem and to efforts toward its solution are discussed. Applying functional standards according to the requisites of particular societies, it can be seen that even countries with high literacy rates, such as the United States, harbor large functionally illiterate populations. It is argued that adult basic education efforts in the United States and abroad should be planned on a situation-specific basis, with goals, content, and evaluative components derived independently of the usual grade school equivalencies.

The discussion is comprised of three sections: a consideration of the literacy continuum among the African population of Rodesia; results of a small study of literacy retention in a TTL; and a brief account of a related study of literacy effect on the development of subsistence agriculture. Adults who have never been to school comprise 40% of the total African adult population and 34% of the TTL population. Using 1962 data, it can be assumed that the highest proportion of absolute illiteracy is in the European Farming Areas, particularly among alien workers. (DB)",

Some philosophical orientation, considered to be a reflection of the current thinking of many serious adult educators regarding their objectives in implementing a learning center literacy program, is included. The Learning Center for Adult Basic Education incorporates team teaching, individualized instruction, and a wide variety of materials, including programmed hardware and software. It also includes experiences to acquaint the student with his cultural heritage, knowledge of his community, and ways in which he may help to shape his community life. Some of the broad objectives of the Center are: (1) to advance each adult student as far as possible in the available time; (2)  to enable students to gain skills and understandings commensurate with backgrounds in reading, communication, and other areas; and (3) to allow the students to develop an awareness of their needs and desires for continuing education. Testing and evaluation currently in use in learning centers differ in length, types and approaches. Auxiliary services include health services and child day care. A bibliography is included. (CK)",

        "description":"This study measured the extent of reading deficiencies in the United States. The research focused on reading skills that are required to cope with everyday experiences common to the lives of most Americans. Interviews were conducted with randomly designated respondents in 100 different locations throughout the country. The national sample used is based on the 1970 census. For scoring purposes, the material in the questionnaire was divided into 10 separate sections or series: (1) telephone dialing series, (2) classified housing ads, (3) classified employment ads, (4-10) the application form: (a) personal identification series, (b) employment series, (c) income series, (d) housing series, (e) automobile series, (f) medical series, and (g) citizenship series. It is concluded that 4%  of the U.S. population 16 years of age and older (approximately 5,649 adults) suffers from serious deficiencies in functional reading abilities. The reading difficulty index for blacks (64) is nearly three times as high as that for whites (22). Income level and age are two other indicators of reading ability. Easterners and Southerners scored lower than those in the Midwest and West. An appendix presents the statistical treatment of the questionnaire data, as well as a copy of the eight-page questionnaire. (CK)",
