The main points of concern are--(1) that sea-level solar radiation is biologically beneficial and necessary for man's physical and mental health, (2) that urban man has inadequate exposure to certain wavelengths of ultraviolet light normally received from sunlight, and (3) that man has created an electromagnetically polluted environment that is potentially harmful to life. Data references and observations supporting the above statements indicate that man must be concerned with creating a biologically optimum electromagnetic environment. To achieve this, the author cites a need for the creation of a profession called spectrum engineering, which would be primarily concerned with  electromagnetic radiation and its biological effects on life. An important aspect of this concept is \"bio-lighting\", an artificial light source that would produce a quality of light the approximate equivalent of sunlight found at sea-level. A listing of the effects of various wavelengths of solar radiation on life, and a list of references, are appended. (JD)",

The first section of the report considers the broad problems of collection and dissemination and attempts to relate them to other developments in the field. The second section describes the content of the ideal catalog; examines the cataloging being done by  agencies in the field; and in the light of these two factors makes recommendations as to the feasibility of the catalog. The appendices include charts and tables, a sample budget, a suggested system of media classification, and a list of sources of materials.

The study was designed to obtain additional empirical data, collected in a real time training environment, on the effectiveness of CAI as a teaching method relative to the conventional mode of instruction (CI). Four specific objectives were set forth: (1) a comparison of the CAI group versus the CI group on two performance criteria--test achievement and time to complete course material; (2) a comparison of the two groups on four follow-up performance criteria--written/performance tests and setback/failure rates; (3) an assessment of student attitudes toward CAI; and (4) a comparison of the revised versus the feasibility study CAI material. The findings completely  support the basic conclusion drawn in the feasibility study that CAI is as effective as CI in teaching basic electronics and further demonstrates the capability of CAI to reduce training time to a significant degree.

A systematic task-by-task approach was adopted for the study: learning objectives were assessed, the present keyboard experience program (in Wichita Public Schools) was studied at first hand, an analysis was made of the applicability of existing computer-related technology, preliminary design alternatives were formulated, and designs were subjected to feasibility testing and evaluation. Three computer-based designs were developed, tested, and evaluated: an instructional management system, an advanced CAI system, and an intermediate  approach. Significant conclusions which emerged from the study include that a CAI keyboard experiences system is susceptible only in part to the solutions being found for CAI systems in other educational areas, that the interactive CAI keyboard systems is most technologically feasible but is not economically feasible, and that a keyboard experience program involving automated non-computerized methods for individualized instruction is both economically and educationally feasible, and should be implemented.

Although the battery was developed for more general application in high schools and colleges, this article focuses on the results obtained in a variety of \"intensive\" or semi-intensive foreign language courses in a variety of Western and non-Western languages, mainly under governmental auspices, as in the Air Force or at the Foreign Service Institute. Validity coefficients for the tests often reached high levels, with multiple correlations as high as .84. Results suggest there are at least four main  components of foreign language aptitude: phonetic coding ability, grammatical sensitivity, rote memory for foreign language materials, and inductive language learning ability. Aptitude is general over different languages, and the tests offer diagnostic possibilities. Results are interpreted in terms of a model that depicts relations among aptitude, ability to understand instruction, motivation, time allowed for learning, and quality of instruction. An appendix of test descriptions and a list of references accompany the text. (Author)",

The study aimed to review a number of specific methods used in conducting the unstructured and unscheduled laboratory procedures and discover the most effective arrangement using those procedures. The report includes detailed discussions of methods used in the open laboratory. Problems of equipment storage, clarity of directions, laboratory assistants, faculty responsibility, conference periods, examinations, record-keeping and report writing are examined. Comparisons are made between student time spent in the laboratory and grade performance, and between space utilization in the traditional laboratories and in the open laboratories. Final forms of laboratory manuel  revisions and results of student evaluation forms are included. The conclusions concern faculty-student relations and their reactions to the course. It is noted that although the open laboratory itself was successful, the general biology course was cancelled and replaced with separate courses for majors and non-majors. The last section of the report contains the rationale and outline of the new biology curriculum resulting from this study and includes methods for continuing evaluation of its content and effectiveness.

In 1967, 149 universities representing all types of institutions across the nation were visited. It was hoped that answers to 4 major questions would provide data and trends truly indicative of the future. Questions concerned: (1) institutional plans for expanding graduate and professional schools substantially during the next 15 years and the nature of the expansion; (2) the expected establishment of graduate and professional programs by new institutions and their financing; (3) expansion of graduate and professional schools as the result of state plans; and (4) the  extent to which plans of existing and new institutions for expansion or establishment of graduate or professional work depend upon federal policies and programs.

Other factors affecting American society are an increase in affluence, an elevation of the educational level of the population, and a growing interdependence of institutions. The fact that this country is currently going through the second phase of the Industrial Revolution is characterized by: (1) the growing number of people working in the service area; (2) the increasing size of the professional-technical class of labor; (3) the changing population characteristics of professional and technical personnel; and (4) the increased dependence on research and theory. Two revolutions are going on simultaneously; the underprivileged are seeking liberal reform,  and individuals are looking for a moral change in social values. These forces challenge traditional authority, and institutions such as the university must develop the ability to cope with these changes. Most particularly, universities must include in their curricula (1) the competence to cope with information overload, and (2) the competence to deal with the affective, emotional, interpersonal aspects of education.

These assumptions are that: (1) graduate students are excessively supervised; (2) examinations are the best criterion for student selection and for judging professional promise; (3) evaluation is equivalent to education; (4) students learn what is presented to them; (5) truths of education are given; (6) method is more important than substance; (7) students become creative professionals after being passive learners; and (8) graduate students should be regarded as manipulatable objects instead of as persons. Other specific problems are the newness of the field of higher education, its lack of visibility and \"respectability,\" the lack of adequate research opportunity and  support for graduate students, and an attempt by a few to maintain the status quo.

Proposals are now being made to raise tuition drastically as one way of meeting increasing costs. This would be a tragic step at a time when efforts are being made to extend the benefits of higher education to millions who were previously excluded. Considerable public agreement exists on the aims of higher education which include universal access to as much higher education as students can handle; the existence of a great variety of institutions and programs; freedom from financial constraints in choosing institutions; academic freedom; efficiency and equity in allocating the costs  of higher education; a balanced public budget; and the advancement of civilization. Different emphases will demand different patterns of financing. In general, however, the system of financing should veer toward the free public education model; student aid should be in the form of grants, and should be administered outside the institution. Institutional support should come from a variety of sources and include substantial unrestricted income. Private institutions should receive public funds to keep tuition down. (AF)",

Veering toward \"free education\" is inconsistent with ordinary notions of equity because: (1) the purely private benefits of higher education accruing directly to the individual are substantially greater than all costs incurred, and (2) individuals who attend college, as a group, come disproportionally from upper income families. A policy of high tuition, even higher than actual costs, for those who can afford it and substantial aid to those who can't would be more equitable. A low tuition policy may also adversely affect an institution's ability to maintain academic freedom and determine its own programs, because of its increasing dependence on the action of  legislators. Pressures on governmental budgets are increasing at all levels and there is little likelihood that there will be a substantial increase in governmental support. Income from tuition will be essential to cover widening educational opportunities and instructional costs which, otherwise, will continue to exclude many individuals with real economic need from higher education. High tuition and high student aid are complementary. (AF)",

Part II dealt with the results of a questionnaire to which 1230 institutions responded. Questions were asked about the institution's openness to students from different  ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, institutional \"effectiveness\", student participation in decision making, school spirit, faculty attitude towards innovation, faculty autonomy, cooperative and interinstitutional programs, and important changes that had occurred on the campus.

Because of the job's complexity, it is essential to redefine administrative functions, to base decision making on empirical findings, and to conduct institutional research and studies of governance to help determine what skills and abilities a president must possess. Though there are many different types of institutions with needs for different types of men, one basic requirement is essential - the president must enjoy the greatest mental health available to man. With all the pitfalls, there are still several good reasons why the job can be rewarding. (1) A college president can and must share in a new formulation of university  decision making. There is great need for a kind of systems analysis of management for different types of institutions and for strong leadership in the area of decision making. (2) A president can help restore the learning purposes of the university and encourage a shift of emphasis from research to teaching.

At the University of Minnesota, studies have been made on diversity among students, diversity within students, diversity in student background, resident-commuter differences, and attitudinal and interest differences.

It may be generally assumed that students come to college believing, to various degrees, that college is a place (1) for intellectual development and growth of personality; (2) for acquisition of vocational training; or (3) to have fun. These views are generally incongruent with the values of the faculty, and students thus tend to seek support from peer groups. As a result of increased awareness, the freshman becomes quickly aware of the hypocrisy and cynicism found in many corners of our society. In college, he should ideally learn how to evaluate what he perceives in a  way that permits change and development, but does not lead to alienation. If he does not learn this, he may adopt a set of values by imitation of his peer group. Urban universities will be challenged by more students from deprived backgrounds, student militancy, and the need for adult and community education. Universities can group students in such a way as to maximize educational benefits. (AF)",

Questions concerned adequacy of the student aid program, responsibility for the program, funding procedures, support for private and vocational institutions, type of aid preferred, work-study programs, loan and special aid programs, student eligibility, and coordination of federal and state programs. Results showed significant differences between responses of state and institutional personnel, especially regarding the  adequacy of present programs, and much confusion among state officials regarding state offerings. Recommendations for state action included: establishment of a state agency, conduct of an in-depth study of the aid program, making state guaranteed loans widely available, providing state scholarships for those in financial need, support for public and private institutions, increased participation by lending agencies, and establishment of priorities in allocating aid.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of specialized individual counseling as a practical method of assisting male college students referred to the Dean of Students for official disciplinary action and to discern what type of technique of counseling offered the best hope for rehabilitation. The major objectives were to see if the academic achievement, attrition rate, and the disciplinary recidivist rate of these students would be affected by special attention and counseling techniques. Group A were provided with confidential vocational and personal counseling; Group B with supportive counseling; Group C with directive counseling; Group D with no counseling but a brief discussion of the offense; and Group E with disciplinary action by student judicial boards  in the residence halls. Students were assigned at random to the first 4 groups. Findings indicated that at the end of the experimental period and the follow-up period there were no significant differences among the GPA means of the group, nor were there significant differences in attrition rates or later disciplinary referrals. Because of the changing nature of the college scene and the demise of the concept in loco parentis, these attempts at working with disciplinary problems have become obsolete and the problems are now generally handled by student disciplinary boards.

Entering freshmen at the college were presented with their KOIS and SVIB profiles at seven group meetings. Some explanation of the results of the tests and short discussion periods, conducted by an experienced counselor, comprised the meetings. A questionnaire administered at the end of the meetings showed that 55 per cent of the students found the KOIS more helpful and 18 per cent preferred the SVIB; 27 per cent were undecided. The  counselors found the KOIS more valuable in eliciting information from students, although they preferred the SVIB as a counseling tool. The results of the study do not clearly indicate the superiority of either test, and counselors generally found both useful. (Author/RC)",

An individual's rights are guaranteed and protected by the federal Constitution which states that: no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. With regard to academic matters, the courts generally maintain a policy of non-interference, leaving such decisions to the colleges themselves. In disciplinary matters, however, the courts have often been called upon to decide whether or not a student has been deprived of his rights under the due process clause. Brief examples from court cases concerning student discipline are given. Junior colleges, the author feels,  should incorporate due process procedures into the rules and regulations of the college. These should be prepared by the administration and approved by the faculty and trustees, then published in the catalog and student handbook so that every student has an opportunity to be aware of them. Some junior college administrators may feel that this approach would limit and restrict their authority although the main purpose would be to limit capricious and arbitrary power of administrators while protecting the rights and privileges of students.

        "description":"Research in the area of student attrition in junior colleges is fairly limited; however, the findings of studies conducted at 4-year colleges, where more extensive research has been done, often have relevance for 2-year colleges. This survey of the literature from both areas points to several student-related and college-related factors that appear to influence discontinuance at junior colleges. The author indicates that recent research reports on student attrition have questioned academic aptitude as a predictor of perseverence in college, and thus other factors are sought to explain who drops out and why. Student-related factors involve an interplay of actual and perceived ability, family and school background, and motivation. College-related factors begin with the student's  introduction to the school and depend on his adjustment to faculty, curriculum, and school mores. A closer link between community colleges and secondary schools would be an initial step in decreasing college dropout rates; student personnel programs and instructional preparation are other areas that need improvement.

In view of this fact, the author proposes a revolving federal loan fund to cover the operating costs for public and private institutions of higher education. Students would apply for loans and these would be administered by the Higher Education Finance Corporation. Over a ten-year period, loans would be paid back by the graduate and his employer through a surtax on his income when it reaches a reasonably affluent level. A model describes how the loan fund would become revolving within ten years, or when the first group of borrowers' loans are due for repayment. (RC)",

Communities are seen as pluralistic rather than unitary, composed of highly diverse elements, and the boards of trustees should be based on proportional representation--proportional, that is, to the contribution and involvement of the groups actually making up the several communities of the community college. A proposal is made to set up 7-man boards, three of the seats being reserved for the taxpayer-citizens--to be chosen in open elections. A  fourth seat would be held ex-officio by the superintendent-president; a fifth would be reserved for the elected representative of the faculty; a sixth would be for a full-time sophomore elected by the student body; and the seventh for a graduate alumnus or an adult evening student elected by either of these two groups.

The work was carried out in three stages: (1) gathering locally available data on such factors as printing, publishing, library services and resources, etc. in relation to existing programs in human and material resources development; (2) field investigations which concentrated on reviewing current and upcoming book development requirements for economic and educational development in Pakistan and Iran and on updating the&quot;Books as Tools for Turkish National Growth,&quot; report in Turkey and (3) utilizing the information gathered from stages 1 and 2 to formulate recommendations and prepare regional and country reports.

An IMC library provides all types of instructional materials and services for teachers and pupils. Initial findings, which were tabulated after visits to the individual facilities, indicate that 472 school libraries in 28 states participated in the study and functioned as IMC programs. In 1964, school library supervisors in 41 states and the District of Columbia provided information about 259 additional schools raising the total to 731. Based on the quantity of resources and quality of programs and services identified, the libraries were grouped into five categories ranging from  those with outstanding resources and service programs (type I) to those whose resources were less than adequate but were functioning as IMC programs (type V). The study indicated a relationship between: (1) IMC programs of library service; (2) librarians holding professional degrees; (3) availability of library schools; (4) state and school systems with library supervisors and (5) recommendations of national, regional and state standards for school libraries. Numerous charts, figures and tables amply illustrate the study's data. (NH)",

The need to update such bibliographies varies with the subject involved. Under the premise that library school faculties need to repetitively update and evaluate bibliographies and syllabi used in teaching, the repetitive production of these materials was automated with a computer. Thus, bibliographies and syllabi collected from the participating faculty of Indiana University's Graduate Library School were incorporated into a master file and subsequently printed and reproduced for faculty, student and reserve librarian use. The faculty members were enthusiastic about the convenience and  flexibility of the computerized updating, however, they questioned the practicality of using a computer for a process which, as it turned out, occurred relatively infrequently. Further research is needed to determine whether correlations exist between a particular subject area and the frequency of the need to update a syllabi and bibliographies used in teaching that subject.

One is the Bibliographic Automation of Large Library Operations on a Time-sharing System (BALLOTS) funded by the Office of Education and the other is the Stanford Physics Information Retrieval System (SPIRES), funded by the National Science Foundation. The creation of a production system for library automation (BALLOTS II) and generalized information storage and retrieval (SPIRES II)  requires the continuation of a comprehensive system development process. This process has six phases: (1) preliminary analysis, (2) detailed analysis, (3) general design, (4) detailed design, (5) implementation and (6) installation. The document represents the main output of the preliminary analysis phase encompassing the definition of goals, description of the user environment, analysis of the existing system, selection of the system scope and establishment of gross technical feasibility of the selected first implementation scope.

A detailed discussion follows of specific instruction as it is related to Piaget's three areas of knowledge, (social, physical, and logico-mathematical) to development, and to theories of learning. It is argued that instruction can be more specific in some ways, as in the teaching of social knowledge, and in the structuring of cognitive processes that will eventually result in logical thinking. Piagetian  principles of learning seem to indicate that teaching must take into account the preoperational child's total cognitive structure even when the content and strategy of teaching are specific.

This type of research yields only yes-no answers about general effectiveness without probing into the process of education itself. More research is needed on the factors that make programs effective; this research can be undertaken without sacrificing action-orientation, by carrying out the research and the program simultaneously. Evaluative research should include assessment of both possible and intended outcomes, measurements of antecedent conditions and consequences of intervention. If this alteration in research orientation takes place, it could be seen as a shift from the engineering model of evaluation  studies (input-output differences relative to cost) to the medical model (concern for specific processes). A major advantage of the medical model is that goals, side effects and program by-products receive increased attention. Finally, this type of evaluative research can serve to advance science as well as social welfare. (MH)",

In weekly home visits, parent educators taught a series of exercises that stimulated infants' perceptual, motor, and verbal activities. Maternal verbal cues elicited the sequential arrangement of tasks. Variables were type, content, length, timing, and presence of instruction.

An instructional program, based on this model, consists of a sequenced series of lessons, initially presented in Spanish and later in English. This developmental approach includes training in visual, auditory, and motor skills. The child learns a sequential pattern of language and speech concepts in both Spanish and English, with  content selected to relate to the child and his environment. Instruction is individualized when appropriate.

It is hypothesized that while a game format may be less efficient and less effective than conventional methods for the teaching of specific skills, the use of games in the curriculum will lead to significant improvement in attitude toward intellectual tasks and will minimize the need for constant supervision. This paper reports on a pilot study whose goal was to create a game what would teach children a listening comprehension of four linguistic constructions: conjunction, negation, joint denial, and exclusion. It was hypothesized that after playing the game, children would show improvement in their comprehension of spoken sentences using these constructions. In  addition, children were expected to find the game enjoyable. The subjects, eight Head Start children from 4 years 3 months to 5 years old, were pre- and posttested with four game sessions intervening. Gains in posttest scores supported belief in the general effectiveness of the game for teaching the four linguistic constructions. Although there was no objective measure of the children's attitudes, they enjoyed the game and asked to play again, which seems to indicate that the game approach is appropriate for teaching tasks not intrinsically interesting.

N-length was defined as the number of nonreinforced trials spaced between reinforced trials and intertrial reinforcement (ITR), introduced between regularly scheduled trials. The subjects were divided into four groups of 20 each. The first three groups were given 50% reinforcement with the nonreinforced trials spaced between reinforced trials and ITR in  N-lengths of 1, 2, and 3. The fourth group received continuous 100% reinforcement. This last group was found to be least resistant to extinction. The group with N-length of 1 was most resistant to extinction.

The four determinants are ability, effort, task difficulty, and luck. These factors may be classified as either internal or external sources of control, and as either stable or unstable elements. Four experiments are reported which substantiate belief that individuals are able to attribute the behavior of others, as well as their personal behavior, to these four dimensions of causality. The perceptions about causality also are demonstrated to influence subjective expectancy of success, and are related to resistance to extinction. Achievement concerns, frustration and conflict, self vs. other perception, and the  educational implications of this motivational approach are discussed.

Data was taken from tests given to more than 500 black and white children from lower and middle class backgrounds. Item analysis revealed that the OCT and PCT were sensitive to sex, education, and test order, and provided a range of types of responses for 4- and 5-year-olds. There were greater differences between ages than within an age group. Test-retest reliability was moderately high. Test order (OCT before PCT, or vice versa) had an effect,  interacting with sex and social class of the child. Middle class children tended to provide more consistent response patterns on the OCT and PCT than lower class children, especially lower class black children. Boys and girls showed differential response patterns dependent on test order. Dominant styles of responding to test items were identified for lower class blacks, indicating that styles varied with age, sex, and educational status.

A total of 144 black children in preschool and kindergarten were randomly assigned to vocabulary training, sentence training, or control groups. All children were tested with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), a sentence imitation test (SIT), and a picture interview (PI), before and after the 6-week training period. Vocabulary training involved practice in recognizing and applying words from the PPVT and the PI. For sentence training, the children imitated sentences similar to those in the SIT and constructed new instances of the same sentence types. Analyses  of variance showed a positive effect of vocabulary training on the PPVT, but sentence training did not affect performance on the SIT. There was no evidence of transfer from vocabulary to sentence imitation. The implication of the results is that time devoted to language training for young black children is better spent on vocabulary than on sentence construction. (Author/DR)",

A control group was tested for spontaneous production. Results indicate that performance was better (a) under the sentential and imagery sets than under the naming set, (b) when mediational rather than production ability was required, and (c) on later trials, although rate of learning varied by condition. An  interaction of mode, elaboration, and ability was found. Results suggest the same patterns of mediational ability obtain for first graders from ghetto and white middle class backgrounds.

This paper gives the interventionist and parent a tool for determining the infant's functional level, using the principle that maturation proceeds in a cephalocaudal direction. The child is to be rated on a list of motor skills related to head control and to locomotion. Using this assessment as a basis, and with the physician's approval, the interventionist can suggest stimulation exercises for the child which will help him to learn to  perform physical tasks, in sequence and over a period of time. Detailed instructions and diagrams are given for helping the child to attain 18 motor skills, which range from raising the head to walking unaided. The verbal response of the parent, both in providing direction and in showing pleasure and praise, is of crucial importance to the success of the retarded child in performing these programmed exercises.

Development of opern educational systems in America should emphasize transfer of the spirit of the English Infant School, rather than its physical attributes alone. Direct importation is questionable, for English Infant Schools have developed as a unique reflection of English society and child welfare concerns. Attempts to develop open educational opportunities here should be teacher-oriented. Rather than imposing an outside model on teachers, the model should be provided and teachers helped to understand it. Teachers who  accept the model should be given support and resources to help them develop open classrooms. This support involves not only specific techniques, but reinforcement of teacher's belief in the child and in the autonomy of the classroom as a legitimate goal. An increasing polarization of educational systems in this country to serve different segments of society is seen as a trend in the future. (NH)",

A group of school psychologists then independently placed each sample word into its appropriate category to form a content analysis dictionary. Subsequent computer content analysis of data agreed closely with the content analysis performed by a kindergarten teacher. Computer content analysis of sex differences also agreed closely with research and opinion about personality differences in boys and girls.

The study investigated the extent to which pupils imitate a rewarding teacher's verbal style when talking among themselves. From the 10 classes at each grade level, the six that showed the highest frequency of teacher reinforcing verbal behavior were chosen for further observation and designated the &quot;rewarding teacher&quot; group. The final sample of 72 students was derived by randomly selecting four students (two boys; two girls) from each of the classes. Pupil verbal statements were scored using five scales of imitative behavior developed from the Observation Schedule and Record 4V (OScAR) protocols. The data were analyzed  using a 2x3 factorial design (sex x grade levels). The records of teacher and pupil verbal characteristics were made near the end of the school year by trained observers who had spent adaptive time in the classrooms before collecting any data. The major findings were that girls imitated more than boys and that imitation increased with grade level. It is felt that these findings are important in demonstrating the usefulness of the OScAR technique for measuring constructs such as imitation and for measuring pupil as well as teacher behavior.

        "description":"Conditional logic, as interpreted in this paper, means deductive logic characterized by &quot;if-then&quot; statements. This study sought to investigate the knowledge of conditional logic possessed by primary children and to test their readiness to learn such concepts. Ninety students were designated the experimental group and participated in a 15-week program of weekly audio-tutorial lessons in conditional logic. 87 pupils were in a control group. A measure of verbal intelligence, and information about socioeconomic status, and rural, suburban, or urban dwelling areas were collected from both groups. At the end of the 15 weeks, the Smith-Sturgeon Conditional Reasoning Test was administered to both groups to assess the effects of the lessons. There was no significant intergroup difference.  Therefore, although the experimental method did not effectively teach conditional logic, many of the children had already mastered it even though they were well below the age of 11 to 12 which Piaget considered necessary for mastery. Conditional logic ability was found to be significantly related to verbal intelligence and socioeconomic status, but not to sex. (MH)",

        "description":"The objective of naturalistic observations conducted in schools and homes in the inner city was to relate teacher expectation to pupil behavior. Following kindergarten observations, selected black children predicted as potentially successful and black children predicted as poor achievers were observed in their homes along with their mothers. This report is a critique of the research methods employed in the study. It suggests that natural observation is particularly suited to white middle class participants. For a minority group subculture, however, the concept of a \"uni-cultural\" view of American families does not apply. The alternative offered is an anthropological approach, in which the observer assumes an activist position to develop an honest reciprocal relationship with the  subjects. For the purposes of curriculum guides and teacher training, an attempt should be made to eliminate middle class biases and stereotypes when studying black children's learning patterns. The behaviors of poor black children at home and in school differ from those of middle class white children. Their educational needs are also different. The concepts of age, status, sex, and communication factors are discussed as they apply to these differences. The appendix offers a selection of tape-recorded data that illustrate the content of black children's verbalizations and themes. (DR)",

        "description":"The Southwestern Cooperative Interaction Observation Schedule (SCIOS) is a classroom observation instrument designed to record pupil-teacher interaction. The classification of pupil behavior is based on Krathwohl's (1964) theory of the three lowest levels of the affective domain. The levels are (1) receiving: the learner should be sensitized to the existence of certain phenomena and stimuli, (2) responding: the student's responses go beyond merely attending to the phenomena, and (3) valuing: the student's behavior is consistent and stable enough to have taken on the characteristics of a belief or attitude. Classification of teacher behavior was based on Sullivan's (1953) social-psychological theory of personality. There are two major categories of teacher behavior: (1) behavior  that results in tension-reduction and need satisfaction for the student, and (2) behavior that increases student tension or anxiety. Use of the SCIOS in the classroom takes 16 minutes with an additional 5 minutes for form information, such as teacher's code number and the date and time of the class. During the first 5 minutes in the class, an observer records subjective impressions of visual aids and classroom atmosphere. The observer than records teacher and pupil behaviors in eight sections on the schedule, each requiring a 2-minute time segment. A copy of the observation schedule is included in this report. (MH)",

Using this instrument, pupil behaviors were isolated to assess the degree to which pupils (1) receive, (2) respond to, and (3) value a stimulus; in this case, the teacher. Teacher behaviors were categorized as either tension-reducing or tension-increasing for pupils. The subjects of observation were 15 teachers and 296 first graders in Title I schools. Pupils were pre- and posttested on the Lee-Clark Reading Readiness Test. Statistical analyses of 18 teacher behaviors and 20 pupil behaviors included computation of canonical correlations, factor  analyses, and multiple regression analyses. Results indicated that there was a significant relationship between teacher and pupil behavior and there is a significant relationship between pupil classroom behavior and pupil cognitive behavior as measured by a standardized test.

Due to this influx of educatables, the local school systems are unable to meet the needs of the migrant children. To determine the number and location of the migrant children in the summer of 1968, the state's teachers and the Louisiana State Department of Education conducted a survey of migrant farmers and their families. Some 3600 contacts with individuals and agencies throughout the state were made; as a result, 296 families were interviewed, totalling among them 1069 children.  Of this total, 730 were defined as migrants. Church groups and local school systems have developed migrant programs which attempt to meet the unique needs of the migrant children. However, the thin dispersion of the children presents a problem in designing educational services such as the proposed pilot project on computer assisted instruction in reading. (AN)",

In keeping with this, the 1970 National Agricultural Outlook Conference was held, at which the 2 speeches presented in this document were delivered. The first speech, &quot;Environment: The Health Perspective,&quot; discusses averting an environmental catastrophe. The second speech, &quot;The Environment and Agriculture,&quot; undertakes to answer the following questions about environment: (1) What is it? (2) What are the major factors and interactions determining quality of environment? (3) What is its present condition? (4) What is agriculture's contribution, actual and potential, beneficial and detrimental,  to quality of environment? (5) What is being done to improve quality of environment? (6) What kind of environment do we want? It is concluded that efficiency of agriculture is a major determinant in quality of rural, urban, local, and global environments. Agricultural pollution can be resolved by development and application of systems which are technologically effective and socially and economically acceptable. (AN)",

In rural areas, income is generally lower and medical services are generally poorer and not as readily accessible as in urban areas. Simultaneously, incidence of chronic illness, which limits work activity, reduces income. Programs are underway or are being planned which will help to solve the problem of rural poor who are being deprived of adequate health care. Programs include increasing the supply of services, reorganizing existing services and developing new ones on the basis of regional needs, and removing income and other barriers which impede the ability of the poor to obtain medical care. Tables pertaining to percent of persons with activity-limiting chronic health conditions are  presented, as well as tables on medical and hospital personnel and facilities in rural areas. (AN)",

Results of the analyses indicated that (1) adolescents perceived that their parents exercised high control and high interest in their children's activities, (2) female adolescents experienced greater parental control and interest than male adolescents, and (3) adolescents  perceived the mother as having greater interest and control in adolescent activities than the father.

Although research studies show that listening can and should be taught, it is pointed out that listening instruction for most children is an incidental affair. Therefore, this document explores the need for listening instruction and notes that schools are reluctant to teach listening due to the problems in measuring and evaluating listening. The author discusses (1) the listening environment, (2) stages in listening development, (3) when to teach listening, and (4) how to teach listening skills. Ideas, activities, and exercises in listening are presented to offer teachers many types of  experiences in listening which can be a part of a regular class schedule, group projects, and units of work.

The purpose of this research was to evaluate the predictive validity of the instrument over a 5-year period. Indexes of delinquency adjustment and academic achievement served as the validational criteria. The specific questions investigated were (1) Are there differences between children who are delinquency-prone and children who are not in terms of delinquency, personal and social adjustment, and academic achievement? (2) When added to a group of known delinquency preditors, do the KD Scale totals or derived subscores yield a significant increment in predictive efficiency? Overall the results indicated that the KD Scale seems to be  useless as a predictor of delinquency as represented in contacts with law-enforcement agencies, but it does have some predictive power in the areas involving personal and social adjustment and academic achievement. Also, it seems to be that, at best, only parts of the KD Scale add to the prediction of delinquency. A related document is RC 004 260. (DK)",

The investigation differed from O. K. Moore's approach in three ways: (1) parsimonious use of instructional time and machines, (2) concern with developing a reproducible set of instructional events rather than individualized programing, and (3) a strong emphasis on engineering an attentional environment rather than a discovery environment. Consequently, emphasis was on development of instructional, behavioral, and motivational strategies. Tutorial strategies were designed to facilitate adapting lesson sequence to nonmechanical or  nontechnological modalities. Reading skills are presented in detail as behavioral objectives and programing paradigms related to teaching these skills are described. Two validation studies and a transfer study are reported.

In order to have positive attitudes toward himself and toward his reading, the child must acquire basic concepts about language and its relation to himself. Among these concepts are (1) I can talk about what I think about, (2) what I can talk about I can communicate in some other way, (3) anything I can record I can recall through speaking or reading, (4) I can read what I write and what other people write for me to read, and (5) each letter of the alphabet stands for one or more sounds that I make when I talk. Concepts for the teacher to use in guiding the child to achieve the above concepts are also listed. Reports of the way four teachers employ these principles  of language experience in classroom instruction are presented, including activities and materials used. Indicators of progress in providing a setting for language expression that makes the attitudes and habits of each child central to the teaching act are listed as criteria for program evaluation.

Separate phonics inventories based on the skills sequence of the Harper and Row Reading Program are provided for preprimer through grade 3. The phonics inventory for grades 4 through 6 consists of 20 nonsense words. If the student reads these words aloud successfully, no further testing of phonics is  suggested. Both an oral and a silent reading selection are included for grades 1 through 3. For each selection there are motivating questions and four to six comprehension questions, noted as either factual or inferential. One longer selection (about 200 words) for oral and/or silent reading is included for each of levels 4, 5, and 6.

The series of 135 discrete lessons teaches auditory discrimination, associative vocabulary, listening comprehension, sensory attributes, numerical concepts, and matching. A greater number of lessons in the associative vocabulary area are included, since evidence shows that deficits attributable to culturally deprived children typically cluster in this factor. Content material is selected to minimize cultural bias and to focus on the needs of the target population. The classroom management strategies, including toys and other extrinsic rewards, are an  essential feature of the program. The program is designed so that goals are always attainable and very high scores are expected. Other factors contributing to high scores are a short time-period for the presentation of single concepts (30 to 90 seconds); the same format for all lessons; testing immediately after each presentation; explanations of possible rewards given to the children prior to the lessons; and the use of multiple-choice responses rather than forms requiring expressive language.

An intensive developmental program must be initiated to inform them and other interested parties about the advantages of working with innovations in education. Media coordinators could do much more to promote the support function of a media center. In fact, if innovative practices are to be universally accepted, a dedicated program of support from administration, faculty, and technical media facilities must be a reality. A clarification of the systems approach, instrumentation, conceptual learning, and programs needs to be made in the form of \"descriptors\" as employed by the ERIC Clearinghouse. To facilitate all of the above, in-service workshops, displays of the media support  function, pilot programs, staff augmentation, university \"media specialist\" curriculums, active association of the media coordinator with the faculty and evaluation of this association, and internship programs in media coordination are all strongly recommended.

A written test was given to all students after the training session, and again three weeks later. The same test was given to a control group which had no training with the teaching machines. The use of the simulated teaching machines led to a significant degree of learning by the subjects. Multiple choice and branching procedures required less time but did not affect test scores significantly. Small item steps required significantly more training time, but also yielded  significantly higher test scores. Significant interaction between the mode of response and branching variables resulted from a high mean criterion score obtained by the constructed response--non-branching group.

The achievement of the students in CAI was compared with comparable students in traditionally instructed classes. The results of the standardized tests were equivocal. In Reading, the CAI classes performed significantly better than comparable students in traditional classes. Differences in achievement were not obtained between the CAI and traditional Biology classes. This was attributed to computer down time and a lack of sufficient content validity in the standardized Biology test. An attitude survey constructed for the project indicated that the pupils liked working with the machines, but were frustrated when the  system did not function properly. A discussion of the project, including the results of unstandardized achievement tests, and an analysis of the pupils' responses while interacting with the computer is included.

The purpose of the conference was to discuss and analyze new trends in computer-assisted instruction, to disseminate new information on advances in educational technology, to acquaint participants with activities in New York State computer centers, and to consider ways of better coordinating CAI efforts within the state. Reports given by the major CAI users in New York make up the first section of the report. The second section contains a general discussion of the future prospects of computer-assisted instruction. The advance of computer hardware has been so rapid that hardware technology is now four to six years ahead of the user's capability to take advantage of it. There is a  general lack of computer software as a concomitant result. CAI is reported to be from five to fifteen times as expensive as conventional instruction. The conclusion reached by the conference is that all programs are in an exploratory stage with plenty of enthusiasm but little firm evidence that computers can change the quality of instruction significantly.

It concluded that computer-assisted instruction is most appropriately employed in the numerical demonstration of statistical concepts, and for statistical laboratory instruction. The student thus learns simultaneously about the use of computers and those concepts which are best demonstrated through the use of computers--for example, multivariate analysis. In an introductory course on statistical inference, computers are used for weekly laboratory exercises, generating random numbers, empirical theoretical distributions, Monte Carlo studies, means, and the like. However, direct use of the computer in instruction--namely directions and questions included on-line--is at this time  too expensive. As cost of computer time decreases it should become more feasible. Future planning centers around more flexible student terminals, and the development of a battery of computer-administered tests to further individual instruction. (BB)",

Those polled included twenty-six colleges, junior colleges and universities in the Nebraska Educational Television Council for Higher Education (NETCHE). The questionnaire investigated general attitudes toward ITV, the courses televised by NETCHE, and the supplementary instructional materials devised by NETCHE, and specific degrees of willingness to be involved in ITV programs. The results showed that the general use of instructional television is  related primarily to its high quality when used as an adjunct to already established courses, and secondarily to the need to serve large numbers of students. No general continuum of attitudes according to academic position of those involved with selection of ITV use was identified. (BB)",

The two presentation modes compared were film and audiotape. Twelve hypotheses were tested via analysis of variance to determine the relative efficiency of these modes for training sixty-five sophomore, junior, and senior education students. Measures taken included response quality, cues discriminated, response errors, stimulus recyclings, elapsed time, and attitude change. Results on most hypotheses were equivocal, and experimental bias was held to be a source of obfuscation in the results. Results showed that sophomores learned less quickly during the first half of training, but made up the  difference during the second half. Subjects trained with films showed similar initial inefficiency, while audiotape subjects discriminated fewer cues initially. Effects attributable to training level tended to be nonsignificant measures of effectiveness. A bibliography is included. (BB)",

The connected discourse is produced by a technique which deletes segments of the speech record and joins the remainder together without pitch distortion. The two problems dealt with were the sources of individual differences in the ability to understand time-compressed speech and the temporal characteristics of language which facilitate or impair listening comprehension. By reducing the amount of time available for the listener to process speech, the nature of listening priorities emerges. The insertion of temporal spacing at linguistically strategic locations have enabled the experimentors to determine whether they are behaviorally strategic. The identification of  behaviorally strategic locations has, in turn, enabled them to further understand the nature of those activities which are necessary for processing speech and to what aspect of speech they are directed. The correlates and predictors of success at these tasks further enrich the picture of what underlies successful listening. (MM)",

Although prescribed for many ills of the young--vocational uncertainty, lack of motivation, immaturity--they were never meant to solve such problems. Students become frustrated, angry and rebellious when the liberal arts do not live up to the expectations upheld in the rhetoric. If universities clarified what a liberal arts education is, and especially what it is not, both students and universities might be spared considerable grief. In addition to silencing exaggerated claims for the liberal arts, a set of genuine alternatives is needed. This would mean more and different kinds of institutions, especially community colleges, rather than more attempts by existing institutions to  absorb every field of knowledge and service in sight. Changes are needed in the framework of society so as to permit more flexibility in both when and how young men and women follow their interests and assume their responsibilities to society. Four proposals are: 1) a domestic service corps; 2) more variety in higher education; 3) lowered financial barriers to advanced education; and 4) provision of more education at an earlier level. Such programs would be expensive, but they are preferable to living in a society increasingly characterized by cynicism, frustration, hate and despair. (DS)",

The ramifications of the resulting technological developments for the educational system need to be examined. Knowledge is a \"two-edged sword\"--equally powerful for good or bad. Rapid technological development and the need to preserve humane values constitute a dual challenge for the educational system. To meet them, the system must provide more \"continuing education.\" The myths that education is only for the young and that it happens only in school must be discarded. Continuing education should be able to integrate education into experience throughout a lifetime. We need to permit easier transition into and out of the academic community at many points  in a person's life. The college students' cries for \"relevance\" often stem from the absence of a clearly defined life-mission. Experimental schools, community colleges, work-study programs, armed services training, and apprenticeship programs are only a few of the models into which continuing education could be cast. Educational systems must produce people who are skilled in techniques, yet sensitive to lasting human values. (DS)",

With the constantly growing costs of education and research and the increasing resistance of legislators and other financial contributors, cost reduction is becoming the necessary alternative. In taking this route, 11 problem areas need to be considered: 1) the \"have to spend it\" notion on the part of departments and offices; 2) the \"game\" of unrealistic budget request to assure that real needs are met; 3) adjustment from traditional prosperity to an \"economy diet;\" 4) retention of effective programs and faculty and staff momentum; 5) attraction of outstanding staff in areas of need; 6) the administrative attitude that \"success\" is measured in terms of quantity of new  faculty added each year; 7) the expensive research and grantsmanship syndrome and its often undesirable side and after effects; 8) the costly acquisition and utilization of computer hardware; 9) excesses and wastes created through personnel surpluses and course proliferation; 10) substitution of an innovative role for the traditional \"caretaker\" role of the administrator; and 11) acceptance and support for economy programs that many will perceive as threatening.

The Committee on Government Organization found that most institutions that had recently included students in the governance process had done so by adding students to existing decision-making bodies. They decided that merely adding students to the Old University Senate &quot;would leave an already inefficient and unwieldy body even more so&quot; and thus a complete restructuring was necessary. Two convocations and many open  meetings were held to explain the details and purposes of the proposed changes before they were approved by a referendum, the president, and the board of trustees.

One of his urgent concerns is the issue of race relations in the community. He suggests devoting 1 full day each month to a community-wide consideration of whatever problem most concerns the community at that time. He discusses parietal rules and a recent &quot;separatist movement&quot; of the Student Senate to assume control of the dormitories. &quot;The alternative to student separation is, of course, more effective and powerful student participation in some form of community government, based on a recognition of common interests and the legitimacy of each one's interest in the affairs of all.&quot; Rejecting the notion of a separate student government, he urges  adoption of a unicameral governing body and a major overhaul of the existing governmental structure to make it more responsible to members of the academic community. Following consideration of two widely accepted assumptions about university governance, he argues that the people of Connecticut (because they &quot;have paid for and own all of our academic facilities&quot;) deserve to participate in designing a charter or constitution of the University. He suggests that a constitutional convention be convened and that later the Board of Trustees assume the role of supreme court charged with ensuring that the actions of everyone involved in institutional legislative or executive policy have been in accordance with the constitution.

The different centers vary greatly in their use of graduate students and  administrative requirements. Most universities have established multidisciplinary centers which essentially serve the departments.

The graduate faculty having governance of a given major field generally includes scholars in more than one department. The idea of transdisciplinary programs is thus widely accepted. Problems arise, however, when it comes to financial support. The department is the budgetary unit and, there, questions of loyalty and departmental priorities sometimes take precedence. To create a special interdepartmental program with its own budget introduces the problem of what to do with the staff when the program expires. Because it is important to strengthen and promote graduate interdisciplinary programs, such efforts should not be restricted to such permanent entities  as departments, though departments must be involved and should control permanent appointments. A transdepartmental referee, who has control of budgetary and position allotments, will be needed to iron out disagreements. Mechanisms, other than departmental, must be established for initiating new transdisciplinary graduate programs and making promotion recommendations. (AF)",

Proposal I would admit a majority of the freshman class on the basis of rank &quot;in the student's own school&quot;, and the remaining students under SEEK criteria. Proposal II would admit 60% of the freshman class on the basis of high school rank and about 15% under SEEK criteria; the remaining 25% would be admitted on the  basis of stated preferences and assigned by lot. The third proposal would admit most entering freshmen on the basis of rank in class and others under SEEK criteria; additional places would be reserved so that students previously admitted to senior and community colleges under traditional criteria would still be admitted. Determination of the exact proportion of students entering under SEEK criteria would result in ethnic balance among the different units of CUNY.

        "description":"College Teaching today is in many ways a primitive profession, for there are no standards to insure that only qualified practitioners enter the &quot;guild.&quot; The prevailing stereotypes give the impression that only those with certain formal credentials are qualified as teachers. Teachers should be selected on the basis of natural communicative abilities rather than credentials alone, and should be further trained in the art of classroom presentation. Those who have responsibility for the conduct of higher education are to be severely indicted for their neglect of classroom teaching as one of the arts. If graduate student teachers are examined, it will be discovered that they do things quite differently than would be expected. In a study at the University of Rochester, it was  discovered that there was serious misunderstanding among the administration, faculty, and student teachers about the role of graduate students in the instructional process. However, a large number of undergraduates were &quot;delighted&quot; with the role that the graduate student teachers were playing. The student teachers expressed a desire for more training and supervision in teaching than they had received, and were very open to change. The graduate student, having just come through his own undergraduate program, is a great resource in the campaign to improve the quality of undergraduate instruction. (DS)",

This study makes available for the first time an inventory of financial aid currently available to students in Virginia colleges and universities. Divided into 4 parts, the study provides: 1) an evaluation of present student financial aid policies and practices; 2) a discussion of financial aid philosophy; 3) an evaluation of the adequacy of existing aid programs; and 4) a proposal for broadening financial support to meet present and projected student financial aid needs.

This new and innovative institution has set out to &quot;meet the challenge of a new generation of youth who will not be denied less than they have been encouraged to dream.&quot; The special focus of the UWGB academic plan is on ecology, or the study of man in relation to his surroundings. Because ecological inquiry is pan-disciplinary, UWGB has organized its colleges within the framework of environmental themes rather than grouping them according to traditional disciplines. The College of Environmental Sciences focuses on the problems of the natural environment, while the College of Community Sciences focuses on the social environment. The College of Human Biology centers its attention on human  adaptability--the impingement of the environment on the individual. The College of Creative Communication emphasizes the problem of human identity, or the individual's impingement on his environment. All students are required to select an environmental problem or area on which to focus (30 hours), but may also take &quot;options&quot; in a specific discipline, a pre-professional program, or professional programs in business, public administration, or education. At the core of the academic plan is a 4-year series of liberal education seminars for all students. In order to serve the students, community and region more fully, sub-regional campuses are located in Fox Valley, Manitowoc, and Marinette Counties. (DS)",

One hundred forty potential dropouts were selected from the 1968 entering freshman class and half were placed in sample groups and half in control groups. Assigned to special residence halls, the sample groups were provided with graduate research assistants responsible for conducting certain activities and providing special services designed to prevent college withdrawal. The activities and services included academic advisement and tutoring, personal guidance and counseling, and social and  economic assistance when necessary. Activities were conducted on an individual and group basis. After one year, the results indicated a significantly higher (beyond 95% confidence) rate of retention for the sample students as compared to their control counterparts. Grade point averages for the sample students were also substantially higher, although not statistically significant. It is recommended that the program be combined with the counselor preparation program and enlarged to include all freshmen. (DS)",

        "description":"This study, conducted over a period of three weeks at the University of Kansas, attempted to determine whether knowledge of musical structure would effect greater understanding and, eventually, enjoyment of music. Experimental and control groups comprising freshmen who were not enrolled in a music course listened repeatedly to excerpts of classical, light classical, broadway show, ballad, jazz, rock 'n' roll, folk, and country-western music. The students' verbal discriminations of musical structure were taped as they commented while listening to the music, and nine preference ratings were obtained for each excerpt. Discrimination scores concerning the structural elements of two classical selections and a numerical compilation showing the frequency of discrimination for four  selections were also obtained. For the two groups, the relationship between increased awareness of musical structure and positive affective response was fairly high for one classical work and moderately low for another. This relationship appears significant, since classical music is not closely related to the musical tastes of today's university-age person. The influence of discrimination on musical preference seemed apparent when a second control group did not react as positively to the classical excerpts as did the other group. Although it is felt that the method used in this study seemed to establish some positive changes in listening habits among the subjects, further research would help to determine its utility for the teaching of discriminative listening in the general music  curriculum.

After alleged violations by state financial officers, SACS appointed a special committee to evaluate the validy, application and effectiveness of Illustration 7 and examine other aspects of the relationship between state budget agencies and institutions of higher education. A list of questions was developed and extensive interviews were held with public and educational officials in the 11 Southern Association states. This report summarizes observations and problems, identifies  actual or potential problem areas, and presents recommendations for the improvement of state-institutional relations. It was found that states' financial policies vary considerably; 5 states apply extensive control while others are more lenient. Personnel management and control is probably the most sensitive area of administration involving state-institutional relations. Recommendations concern new budgetary approaches, revision of Illustration 7, and improved communications among SACS, the state budgetary agencies, and the state institutions. (DS)",

First, the committee advocates complete withdrawal of all in loco parentis activities by the University. Second, noting that student representation on practically all University committees was inadequate, the authors urge that committees review their structures and responsibilities with a  view toward accommodating more student members. Third, students should be allowed to govern themselves to a greater extent. Faculty and administration supervision should be reduced and simpler means of communication between students and faculty should be developed. Finally, restructured and limited university disciplinary procedures are recommended. The committee urges no duplication of any civil law penalties by the University except in certain cases. Trials should be conducted by joint student-faculty panels with absolutely no administrative involvement. (DS)",

The compositions used, William Schuman's &quot;The Last Invocation&quot;, Dello Joio's &quot;Jubilant Song&quot;, and Barber's &quot;Reincarnations&quot;, require special perceptual skills and present many learning problems because of their pitch, harmonic and rhythmic features. Seventy members of an A Cappella Choir were randomly divided into control and experimental groups; both of them briefly examined the scores, recorded the three numbers, and had eight rehearsals with the same conductor. The control group was  limited to the score and rote drill procedures; unknown to the singers, warm-up exercises and drills were derived from problems in the music to be learned. The experimental group received the same treatment, but were also exposed to theoretical derivations of the musical problems and cross-referencing to encourage transfer of learning to reoccurrences of the same patterns. Performances were recorded again and evaluated by three choral judges who unanimously decided that the experimental group's post-rehearsal tape was superior in accuracy of pitch, rhythm, and security of singing. It was concluded that planned learning activities based upon analytically-derived problem features of choral music are highly effective in developing the musical accuracy of choral singers. (WM)",

The results of the 570 returned questionnaires are examined in detail, and comparisons are made among the different types of institutions. At denominational colleges, administrators are seen as being genuinely interested in the student's welfare. Disciplinary sanctions are most severe at these types of institutions, but students also report the most  agreement with their college's policies. At the universities, students acknowledge respect of procedural due process on the part of their institutions. Sanctions were not perceived in matters of sex and alcohol, and only rarely in off-campus matters. At junior colleges, students indicated only limited awareness of their campus policies. They reported administrative edict to be the manner for resolving conflict, and perceived themselves as playing no role in institutional governance. The conclusions suggest the IPCU is a reliable and valid measure of perception of disciplinary policies and practices. Several implications for further research are offered. (DS)",

The recipient group contained 57 men and 51 women; the control group, 45 men and 40 women.

The groups were similar in age, marital status, and mother's education; they differed in ACT  scores, family income, father's education, and number of dependents in family. Half the recipients said they probably could not and a quarter said they certainly could not have attended college without the aid. They ranked their direct benefits as: more years of college, more time for study, full-time schedule, better grades, less part-time work, time for other activities. They also felt a special obligation from receiving the aid. Recipients made higher grades (also related to ACT scores), had fewer academic suspensions, had a higher graduation rate, earned more credits, and more remained enrolled.

        "description":"Junior college students on academic probation are as heterogeneous as the college population itself. They range from high-ability students dismissed from 4-year institutions to those with severe visual-motor handicaps. The differences should be more carefully identified so that appropriate help can be made available. Special counseling (required by California law for junior college probation students) must be given so that they can make realistic educational and vocational plans. The single 15-minute interview or the 50-minute group session required by one college does not provide such an opportunity. Changes in penalty grading and probation practices have shown favorable results. Not only do they reduce the number of students on academic probation, but they also switch the  college emphasis from punishing inappropriate behavior to rewarding the appropriate. Fears that less punitive grading practices would lead to student irresponsibility have so far proved unfounded. Research on limited study loads, required periods of non-attendance, and other common restrictive sanctions of probation has not shown them to be effective in increasing success among probationary students. The open-door college has an obligation to all students, but especially to those on probation. For the below-average student, the junior college truly represents his last educational opportunity.

        "description":"Fifty instructors, from nine school districts and five 4-year institutions, are taking part in the SET program--Students Evaluate Teaching. Research shows that (1) students can and do make fairly sound ratings of their teachers; (2) they tend to agree with each other; (3) teachers rated best by students tend to obtain highest student gains; (4) student ratings often differ from those by principals, supervisors, and other teachers. SET is an effective way for students to express their opinions, valid or otherwise. A visiting instructor is requested by any educator who feels the session can help him improve his teaching. The visitor leads a student discussion, during which he elicits their comments. The requesting teacher prepares his class for the visit, urging candid comment.  Both teachers assure the students that their anonymous remarks will be used only for improving course content and teaching methods. (This report includes a copy of the visitor's discussion agenda.) Transcripts of the session, a conference between the two instructors, and a class discussion after the visit make up the evaluation. The experiment's immediate objectives are to give a chance for the teacher to improve his instructions and the student to express himself on the programs. It is a way to define a group's concept of what makes one member of an occupation more effective than another. The SET evaluations will be raw data for application of the Critical Incident Technique. Future plans for the program are discussed. (HH)",

The nature of the community must be defined before an effective program can be organized. The college can then determine the area of services to be offered. Cultural programs are considered to be those offering lectures, films, exhibits, theater, and so on. Interviews were conducted with directors of community services at seven varied community colleges. All had lecture series of varying scopes. The College Association for Public Events and Services was the booking agent for the series. Colleges with comprehensive programs offered art and science exhibits. Film series were the most popular cultural programs, as even isolated colleges are able to contract for them. Theater programs,  performed by college drama classes or by community members, are usually successful. Some colleges stage fine arts festivals; some operate planetariums; others sponsor community chorus and orchestra groups. A successful cultural program will improve public relations and promote community support for the college. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (MS)",

The trend is to state control because of funding, the efficiencies of central planning and coordination, and the mobile population. Listed are the advantages and drawbacks of four levels of control: a public school district, an independent district, a college or university branch, and the state level. Descriptions and a few statistics are  given for typical students' background, academic ability, employment, occupational choice, motivation, attitudes, and age range. Included also is a brief description of the seven principles developed by AAJC for the legal establishment of junior colleges. The author then details the establishment and status of the 2-year college in New Mexico--its organization, boundaries, affiliations, course of study, taxation, bonds, and governance. The last chapter deals with program specifications for a possible college in Albuquerque. The essential program areas are academic affairs, occupational training (following national and regional manpower needs), general and continuing education, community services, and student personnel.

Faculty members should be willing to help by providing information or making public appearances, for, if the taxpayers have a favorable image of the college, they will vote the necessary funds. Students can contribute by serving as liaison with high school students and teachers. They can talk to their friends and address club meetings and assemblies. On campus, they can guide visitors, act as aides at ceremonies, gather news from college clubs or from  their parents' clubs or businesses. The community-relations director should also visit or write to school superintendents, principals, club directors, counselors, and high school faculty, offering student or faculty speakers, help with in-service training, and the like. He should also offer the services of a faculty speaker's bureau to chambers of commerce, service clubs, etc., and should let radio and TV stations know that the college can fill certain slots with discussion or information programs. As a last step, he should maintain a mailing list for regular news releases to the board of trustees, state education committees, school boards, legislators, and all the local news media--newspapers, radio, and TV.

From 28,396 students of 26 colleges, a random-stratified sample of 499 was drawn according to each college's enrollment and by sex ratio, with provision for alternates. Usable responses to the 9-item questionnaire came from 277 men and 211 women. As all did not answer all items, they were analyzed individually. Data on residency, high school background, degrees earned, transfer status, value of college experience, and post-college activities were to be used, after analysis, by the State Education Department for statewide planning. The study showed the need for a standard Student  Information System to supply full and uniform data on each student in the system. (The Florida Community Junior College Inter-institutional Research Council is now developing such a system.) It was found that the &quot;average&quot; student attends the college in his own county directly after high school, takes over two years to get his diploma, works while at college, graduates from the same one he enters, enrolls in a transfer program, majors after transfer in education or arts/sciences, and feels his junior college experience was helpful. The detailed procedures used in this study could be a model for those wishing to make a similar one. The investigators felt the questions raised by the study were its most valuable result. (HH)",

As equipment for occupational programs is both expensive and soon obsolete, many colleges have turned to industry to provide the work experience. Thus the student can not only be involved in real work situations but also earn as he learns. All such jobs, part of the course requirements, are supervised by a teacher or coordinator and the employer. The value of such programs to students and community and the usual methods of operation are discussed. One survey found these major difficulties: (1) lack of coordinated supervision by college and employer; (2) little relation of college courses to job experience; (3) conflicts in work and class schedules; (4) student over-interest in the  paycheck; (5) occasional poor placement of students. Los Angeles Trade Tech reported that companies actively seek participation in the programs and that lack of time is the worst problem. Orange Coast College had difficulty finding suitable work stations and persuading employers to pay wages. Pasadena City College's problems were lack of time for the coordinator, students leaving school for jobs for which they were not yet ready, and inadequacy of state average daily attendance payments. Long Beach City College, in its auto mechanics program, noted that its students had trouble maintaining the clean driving record necessary for their jobs. The lack of a full-time coordinator was Los Angeles Pierce College's biggest problem. (HH)",

Its students now make up 60% of the University's enrollment. According to the State Regents, it should (1) be supported as providing a broader public post-secondary educational opportunity; (2) be open to all high-school graduates (or equivalent), operated at low cost, and reasonably accessible to commuters; (3) offer general, transfer, occupational, terminal, adult, and continuing education, as well as guidance and counseling; and (4) provide its own distinct services and not be converted to 4-year status. The comprehensive college, offering both transfer and technical  programs, can best accommodate (1) future needs of higher education, (2) the increasing heterogeneity of ability of high school graduates, (3) the growing group of semi-professionals. A recent criticism of the 2-year system maintained that it is no longer viable for the cities and recommended a looser time schedule to fit the student's talents, whether he needs one year or seven. In reply, the speaker defends the structure, pointing out that it gives a sensible, dignified stopping place for those who &quot;reach their natural limits&quot; in less than four years after high school. From this point of view, the community college is relevant to student needs in all its functions--transfer, general education, and middle-range career preparation. (HH)",

The latter must feel that their concerns are taken seriously and their rights supported and must, in turn, respect the college's authority and right to protect itself as an institution. This intercommunication must go on formally and through constant student/staff contact (a special responsibility of the student personnel staff). The preparations must anticipate likely situations and specify official responses. When a protest is imminent, the dean should repeat the college's published limits, discover the issues  and their degree of validity, and act as liaison with officials who have real power to act on any promised concessions. If these actions do not stop the riot, further talks must be arranged, even for \"non-negotiable\" demands. If it still continues, the college must get rid of the dissenters or close down. Whether and when to call in the police and the press will have been among the early decisions. During the incident, the dean in person must issue warnings, define penalties, and collect offenders' names--without involving other staff members and severing their links with the students.

In 1969, an analysis of student mid-term progress reports was made, to see whether particular groups or courses were associated with poor academic progress. Results showed that 22% of the students received one or more F, and that residents received F's more often than day students. Certain courses and programs had a large  percentage of failures.

Chances for attainment of his goals are enhanced when they are consistent with his talents and resources. If they are not, his frustration and disappointment cause him to \"cool out,\" drop out, or be unhappy. Of two studies of students whose degree aspirations were discrepant with ability or income, the first concerned degree goals either notably lower or unrealistically higher than others with the same measured aptitude, and the second was of those whose family income was inappropriate to  their degree goals. Both subgroups were compared with students with more realistic goals, using the demographic and educational data provided in the Student Profile Section of the ACT Battery. Generally the subgroups' characteristics were similar to other students' except in degree of non-academic achievement. From these findings, aspiration appears an important predictor in its own right, being based to some extent on the experience of success in high school. Academic and extracurricular accomplishments both have a notable impact on aspiration, the latter often being a primary area of satisfaction and therefore having a strong effect on the conception of self and ability.

There are three main arguments in favor of non-punitive grading: (1) an F grade is a double penalty, requiring better-than-average grades to counterbalance it; (2) fear of an F may impair the performance of anxiety-prone students; (3) A-F grading systems discourage experimentation outside of one's major field. Arguments against the non-punitive grading system are that (1) a potential F grade is an incentive to do better work; (2) failure occurs in life and it is unrealistic to exclude it from the academic world; (3) F or D grades that  result in students' dismissal open up space for more qualified students. It is felt that this last reason is the most valid. In view of limited educational resources, it is suggested that schools have a dismissal policy based on some number of withdrawal grades. (MS)",

Since junior colleges accept a full range of students, including many of low ability, conventional teaching methods are not adequate. Teaching the junior college student requires special attention to motivation, guidance, basic skills, instructional support, and instructional design. The learning resources center can help to meet these needs by providing an integrated facility where the student can develop needed skills, a positive attitude towards learning, and the ability to use the counseling resources provided by the  college. Also it can provide the administration with information on the characteristics of the students served. The components of the learning resources center and their integration into a unified system are described. (MS)",

Administrators involved in faculty recruitment in the Kern Joint Junior College District were interviewed, and all faculty members in the district answered a questionnaire regarding their perceptions on why they were hired. Responses showed that Kern administrators attempted to hire faculty mainly on the basis of academic and educational skill. However, there were some preferences for younger people with innovative ideas. Although no deliberate effort was made, a balance of personal factors was achieved. The majority  of both faculty and recruiting administrators perceived the same hiring criteria. (MS)",

Starting in 1965, college students tutored disadvantaged (minority group) elementary and junior high school students after school. Students were tutored in English, reading, math, the Constitution, and other areas. The program included field trips. An evaluation of the 1968-69 phase of the tutorial project was drawn from questionnaires completed by the 39 tutors and from the tutors' journals. It was concluded that the tutorial project was extremely valuable for both tutors and tutees. The program could be strengthened by recruiting more minority group tutors and by pre-tutorial orientation. The program could be expanded to include other community services (juvenile hall, mental hospitals, etc.). [Not  available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (MS)",

Statistics show that educational development is positively correlated with economic development, yet educational systems often have not kept pace with technological, social, and economic developments since World War II. Junior colleges, with their flexibility of function, may be able to provide the necessary increase in educational opportunities in order to increase the middle-level manpower. Australia has recently opened several Colleges of Advanced Education to provide non-university tertiary education. Canada has junior colleges in six provinces. Great Britain has technical colleges giving occupational preparation, and sixth-form colleges giving two years of university preparation. In Japan, most  junior colleges are private women's colleges. Junior university colleges in Ceylon are designed to educate students who cannot get into universities. Chile was the first Latin American nation to use junior colleges to train technical manpower. Colombia also has a developing junior college system. There are plans for the establishment of a junior college system in Kenya. Many nations have not initiated the junior college, possibly because it is not appropriate to their present stage of development. (MS)",

The study reported here was undertaken to determine (1) what interlibrary loan (ILL) services are now provided by participating libraries, (2) if changes in existing services will result with the establishment of service areas, and (3) what part of the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) ILL service can be taken over by KOMRML.

The results of this study point to  two main considerations for those administering KOMRML. (1) The proposed referral network may or may not be a more efficient system than the existing laissez-faire one; the social value of the KOMRML document delivery system will have to be judged on its cost effectiveness in delivering documents dependably.

Since this is a federally sponsored program, monitoring devices must be established to determine if the program is accomplishing the aim of improving access to medical information. In this paper, two perspectives are used on which to base a design for measurement of document delivery services and on which to base performance standards: (1) the cost to the user of this service, and (2) the efficiency of the procedures. One overriding factor governs the design for measurement: a more precise definition of what variables are to be included with different measurements is necessary before any realistic performance standards can be established. Three sources of data are  suggested: (1) the records generated in making requests, (2) the user time involved, and (3) the operational procedures in providing the service. Four priorities for analyzing this data are then suggested: (1) determining who uses the service, (2) analyzing reasons for unfilled requests, (3) collecting and analyzing data on request and loan processing time, and (4) establishing the actual user real time cost in using the service for different environments.

Since only three hospitals have such an administrative unit, less than 40% of the physicians can be said to have access to the library resources of the community. Because of the number of appointments each physician has and because of the distance between the hospitals and his office any attempt to develop other than a library access service in  each hospital can accomplish little in making the scholarly record available to the practicing physician. Further, because of the commitment of many of the survey hospitals to medical education, improved library service appears almost mandatory. (Author/JB)",

A questionnaire dealing with personnel, physical facilities and collections was sent to each of the six hospitals, and the investigator visited five of the Essex County hospitals. The data received from each of the hospitals were then compared with recommended  standards for hospital libraries as prepared by the American Library Association in 1953.

The study showed that, (1)  LC consistently publishes bibliographic information earlier than NLM - two months earlier in the case of the 209 sample and one month earlier for the 55 sample, (2) the decision to use either LC or NLM as the principal source can be based largely on the number of titles to be cataloged at the end of the search period, (3) a new factor - that of the cost of searching and of typing cards as opposed to the purchase of printed cards - becomes important and (4) the alerting service of WSUML compares favorably with that of &quot;Current Catalog.&quot; (Author/JB)",

        "description":"This final report summarizes a study of the availability of library services for health professionals in Southeastern Michigan, begun in 1964 by the Wayne State University Medical Library, the Detroit Medical Library Group, the Wayne County Medical Society, and the Greater Detroit Hospital Community Council. Objectives of this investigation were to determine: (1) what groups of biomedical professionals had library service, and the extent of that service, (2) cost of minimal access service on a community basis, and (3) administrative mechanisms to improve and develop library networks. Study data were obtained from the institutions of the Detroit Medical Library Group by observation, interviews, and questionnaires. These data covered: (1) interlibrary loans, (2) reference services,  (3) bibliographic controls and administrative mechanisms, and (4) the biomedical community. The resulting studies primarily described the existing situations. Specific methodologies and conclusions on the basic areas covered are summarized in this report, and the four major contributions of this project are discussed. Reports of the separate studies are ED 032 890, ED 032 891, ED 032 892, LI 001 829, LI 001 830, LI 001 831, LI 001 832, LI 001 833, and LI 001 838. (JB)",

        "description":"After a detailed study of the reserve processing activities of the Columbia University Library System, it was decided that an attempt to design a reserve system which would make the fullest use of computers would be undertaken. This would be an integrated system developed over a period of time in a series of clearly defined phases. Three different phases were distinguished which could be developed in series or simultaneously, depending on such factors as operating software and hardware availability. After three years a fully tested system, called Reserves Processing has been developed for Phase One and implemented in two working environments. The Reserves Processing system accepts input in the form of brief bibliographic citations, inventory data and course information, creates a  master machine stored reserve file, produces a variety of records to assist in the processing of reserve books, and prints a variety of lists to be used for reference purposes. All of these operations, except input, are done as off-line, batch-processed operations. Only input is done in an on-line mode. This report includes a general systems description intended for the non-technical reader as well as program and hardware specifications and intended for the technical reader. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"The main problem considered in this project is whether it will be possible for civilization to cope with the increasing quantities of archival information that must be stored in libraries, and if so, whether traditional methods of identification and access will prove adequate to the task. It is concluded that unless the storage, transmission, and retrieval of information in library archives is automated, there is no hope of keeping pace with the exponential growth of libraries. Part I explores the problem of determining the relationship of library growth to the growth of those components of civilization that support and use libraries. Part II analyzes cost factors in maintaining and updating card catalogs. It was found that simple situations do not require automation, but that  complex ones, which appear unavoidable for most large libraries, demand automation on economic as well as on access grounds.

        "description":"Beginning in 1956 about 250 students in two London, England junior schools were intensively studied over a 4-year period for intellectual, educational, emotional, and social development. The schools approached instruction differently; one was child-oriented; the other was subject-oriented. In 1964 this followup study was conducted with some of the same students in the 1956 study who had gone into four secondary modern schools. The students selected for restudy had been of average or below-average reading ability in their junior school. Standardized tests and projective tasks were administered to these students. The measures were similar to those used in the 1956 study. Several questionnaires were completed. The student himself, an interviewer, a teacher, and his parents were  informants. The followup data and the data from the 1956 study suggest that questions such as whether a child-centered or subject-centered approach achieve better results are so broad they are almost meaningless. The background and personality of the individual child are very important determinants of school achievement. The data also indicate that the projective tasks used in assessing the student's development are accurate. [Not available in hard copy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (WD)",

To determine actual cognitive problem-solving processes, (rather than inferring them from results), subjects in these studies were presented with a problem and allowed to ask a sequence of questions which the experimenter answered and recorded. The sequence of questions is called the subject's tactic and is identified by the number of questions, type of questions, and the temporal order of the questions. It is recognized that problems are built with a certain logical structure (intrinsic difficulty) and a certain language structure (extrinsic difficulty). An ideal tactic approximates the logical structure of the problem, has no order  reversals, and is not redundant. Good tactics are those which provide enough information to solve the problem. A system of numerical indices was developed for scoring tactics. Previous research using these instruments to investigate individual cognitive processes and the effects of language on these processes has revealed that concrete and verbal languages run through a larger variety of logical structures than do abstract symbolic languages.

Classification behavior and inferential thinking were the main concerns of the study. The measurement instrument was the Matrix Test, a device that requires the child to select a picture to complete a row of pictures on the basis of the relationship established by the other pictures. The 44 items on the test can be seen as falling into one of four classes: Perceptual Matching, Class Membership, One-Way Classification, or Two-Way Classification. The subjects were 160 black lower class children (40 each from kindergarten and grades 1 through 3) and a similar group of  white middle class children for comparison. Only a child's selection responses were recorded; no measure was made of the thought processes behind them. The measurable results showed no differences based on sex or the abstract-representational character of the stimuli.

The VNP group read books that emphasized the special vocabulary but were not given puzzles. The control group spent an equal amount of time on a neutral task. PV and PNV groups showed high interest and similar, significant gains in puzzle-assembly skills. The VNP groups, however, regressed in performance and showed little interest.

Thirty-six Caucasian beginning first graders (divided evenly by high and low socioeconomic status) were given three forms (S, A, and B) of the Metropolitan Readiness Test. The following spring, the children took Primary I Battery of the same test. The scores were converted to percentile ranks and analyzed. High SES children scored significantly higher than low SES children. The revised forms were equal in difficulty and harder than the old form. A significant practice effect was manifest with mean percentile rankings  progressively increasing with each subsequent administration of the tests. There was no reliable support that the new forms discriminated against disadvantaged children more than did the old form. There was higher variability for the higher SES children, but the difference was significant only for the new forms. The new forms are predictive of maturity and limitations of ability for high SES children, but are questionable when applied to low SES children. Forms A and B are reliable over the total range of population, but not for a restricted subgroup population. (MH)",

An adult meaning system allows an adult to transcend component word meanings and integrate, in the presence of a speaker, the underdetermined and the factual proposition into a meaningful whole. Subjects were 60 5- and 8-year-old middle class, racially mixed children. Subjects were asked to repeat sentences heard in conversation and on tape. Sentences included: (1) those with referential nouns, (2) those with \"modals,\" and (3) control sentences containing neither. A three-way analysis of variance was computed on age by condition by sentence type, using the two ages, the two conditions, and the modal and control sentences. Results indicate that recall of the  modal sentences is better than the control sentences heard in conversation but not heard on tape. The interaction of sentence by age shows that the older, but not the younger, subjects perceive the difference between the modal and control sentences. This supports the hypothesis. All subjects, however, master sentences containing referential nouns. Both the modal and the referential systems seem to be necessary to understand sentence meaning. (JF)",

Each movement is described according to history, aim, curriculum, materials, and methods. Criteria for each section of the contemporary preschool were identified by analysis and synthesis of opinions of four current authoritative sources in preschool education. The criteria were then compared to the description of each preschool movement to identify its influence. The Froebel kindergarten contributed the view that education is a process of growth and advocated using the method of self-activity through play. The Montessori movement put emphasis on responsibility to be given to  children for care of self and environment. The Child Study movement resulted in increased attention to the physical, social, and mental developmental needs of children. Head Start influence can only be predicted, but effective factors may be increased attention to social services, health services, parent and volunteer involvement, and the effort to adapt a program to the needs of a specific group of children.

Comparatively little time was spent on caretaking activities, aimless wandering, and teaching of pre-academic skills. A considerable amount of time was spent on structured waiting for the teacher, language development, dramatic play, and  social interaction. Group vs individual activity differentiated classes and seemed dependent on teacher control. The next step will be to relate the obtained classroom characteristics to specific changes in children. With the causal relationships between process and product more clearly understood, more effective programs can be devised based on data rather than intuition. (MH)",

The complexity measure used was one developed by Dr. Sheldon Frank and Dr. Harry Osser, and is based on the concepts of generative grammar and transformations. Language samples were collected from mothers alone in an interview and mothers and children together in a play session. There were two groups of mother-child pairs: one from Harlem (black lower class) and one from Washington Square (white middle class). Analysis of the language samples indicated that all the mothers greatly reduced their syntactic complexity when talking to their children, but each mother's language was still more complex  than that of her child. There was no difference between the Harlem mothers and the Washington Square mothers in their syntactic complexity in the interview, but the Harlem mother-child interactions were less complex and more didactic than those of the Washington Square group. Finally, the Harlem children seemed to articulate less clearly than the Washington Square children and their mothers had more difficulty in understanding them. There were more requests for clarification in the Harlem interactions. (MH)",

Flexible arrangements allowed this mature trainee to plan and follow his own program in consultation with the staff of the Research and Development Center in Educational Stimulation at the University of Georgia. Experimentation in ongoing school programs enabled the trainee to develop an inventory of early mathematics accomplishments for 5-year-olds, which was then used systematically by him in New York State as well as by others in Follow Through programs. Development of this group test of mathematics achievement is described, including the specification of detailed administrative procedures necessary with young children. The postdoctoral research training program  was judged effective for its purpose, following the original proposal to provide a high level professional apprenticeship. Suggestions are made for improvement of the USOE research training program by expanding its scope to include establishment and support of advanced training centers to meet current retooling demands for high level educational personnel.

The intervention project is presently being carried on through weekly home visits. These visits have four objectives: (1) to increase the quantity and quality of mother-child verbal interaction, (2) to instill the idea in both the mother and the child that adults are helpful, resource-controlling persons, (3) to shift the behavior  control techniques from diffuse nonverbal reinforcement to verbal reinforcement with specific explanations, and (4) to have the mother encourage increased complexity in the child's language. This home teaching program lasts 12 weeks; 9 for the program, 1 for make-up, and 2 for evaluation. Field trips, singing, reading, and a wide variety of games were among the program activities. (MH)",

Both experimental and control groups were given the Philadelphia Reading Test and the Philadelphia Test in Fundamentals in Arithmetic. Attitude measures were The Pupil Attitude Toward School Inventory and The Way I Feel About Myself instruments. The single sex classes scored significantly higher in reading than the control group, but there were no significant differences  between the all-boys classes and the all-girls class in reading and arithmetic. All-boys classes were more positive toward school, learning, teachers, peers, and self than the other groups. The control group was more positive in these attitudes than the all-girls class.

This report provides an anecdotal record of the program's development. Two rooms were secured in the basement of a school, 50 black, underprivileged first and second graders were selected, and a small staff was hired. The staff included a teacher-in-charge, two assistant teachers, two aides, and a clerk. The initial goals were to keep the child safe, to improve his self-image, to develop his expressive and creative abilities, to work on remedial academic work, and to offer supplementary nourishment in the form of daily snacks. The teacher-in-charge involved the  children in projects and trips and encouraged them to learn through doing. However, the problems were many: staffing, inexperience, lack of intra-staff communication, disturbed children, vandalism, and inability to lose the feeling of being intruders in the basement rooms. The program is still in the testing phase but some progress has been made in solving these problems. (MH)",

A sample of 1,870 was obtained from the open-country portion of 30 low-level-of-living and low-income counties in Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.

Thirty-three other Indian families (non-Yaqui) and 13 Mexican-American families also resided in the tract, producing observable cultural interactions. Experimentation was initiated through the Yaqui religious hierarchy, this being their only functional leadership structure. Principles of operant psychology and applied and cultural anthropology were utilized. Areas of development selected by the residents were recreation, adult education, and house construction. The Yaqui showed increased interest in community development, and 2 of the men exhibited  significant leadership ability. Major factors affecting the work were a lack of leadership structure outside of their religion, cultural differences between participants, a reluctance to accept outside assistance, and a lack of motivation.

The interview sample comprised 648 households (408 in Evangeline Parish; 240 in Pointe Coupee Parish) reflecting 3 types of communities: (1) where French was the predominant language, (2) where English was the main language, and (3) where French and English were used fairly equally. The general level of education in both parishes was low by modern standards. Household heads who preferred  to speak French at home averaged significantly fewer years of school. Employed household heads in the French districts were more likely to be farmers than those in mixed or English areas. Both parishes were low-income areas, and French speakers were most often in the low-income group. The French were preponderantly Roman Catholic; the non-French were largely Protestant. The study showed that the process of assimilation was under way at varying speeds and that the French would respond to programs representing economic and educational opportunity. (CM)",

Among the characteristics examined were rural and urban residence, occupation, age, sex, education of the family head, and ethnic background. The criterion used for designating poverty was income under $3,000 per family. The conclusion reached was that poverty exists disproportionately among the poorly educated, rural residents (particularly farm operators and farm laborers), minority groups, and families whose heads are not likely to be employed. Identification of the poverty group suggested implications for action programs dealing with the two basic categories of people involved in poverty. Programs needed to be  instituted for those for whom remedial action would provide more opportunities. Programs were needed for those who could not hope to raise their incomes by increased education or higher pay scales (e.g., persons receiving pensions, welfare, or social security). More research and vigorous application of existing knowledge were considered essential. (CM)",

The sources indicated that a disproportionate number of Minneapolis Indians were already on the city's relief records and that the Indian caseload would be growing more rapidly than any other ethnic caseload. Among the factors of individual Indian welfare recipients studied to isolate problem areas were sex distribution, age distribution, marital status, education, age distribution by sex, marital status by sex, and active military duty of males. A comparison was made of high-school graduates as opposed to non-high-school graduates, relief recipients only, as  related to year of first application for relief. There was some encouraging evidence that a high-school education is of use to the urban Indian since the Indian non-graduate needs assistance sooner and for a longer time. Other conclusions are listed, and recommendations are made. Findings of the agency personnel survey, designed to define problem areas as seen by agency personnel, are presented. A map depicting Indian relief clients per census tract is included. The document is appended with numerous tables relating to the factors studied. (CM/GC)",

Learning is more rapid and retention is greater because outdoor learning experiences involve all of the child's senses. Resident outdoor programs improve communications between teacher and student and promote group interaction in all phases of daily life. Objectives of such a program are to sensitize the child to a natural environment, to increase his capacity for observation and learning, to develop a sense of responsibility toward natural resources, and to provide outdoor recreational experiences.

A program is described which utilized Teaching Research Language Development materials so they could be taught by teacher aides. The materials, commonly known as &quot;Language Games,&quot; were structured in order that the children participating could help to teach one another. By 16 weeks, based on an average of 15 minutes per day, 4 times per week, significant increases in learning performances were noted, and continued use of games is expected to result in even more effective increases in language expression. The process of choosing children and teacher aides to participate in the program is described. The intensive training program with aides working directly  with children is reviewed.

Interview data were obtained from all physicians in a 20-county rural area and from a sample of physicians in a metropolitan center. Two major background factors were studied: (1) family occupational background and (2) location of physician at selected points in his life. All doctors, regardless of resident-type, tended to have fathers in upper-status occupations, with the exception that more metropolitan specialists were recruited from lower status occupational backgrounds than other resident-types. During  their youth, rural medical and osteopathic doctors had predominantly rural backgrounds; metropolitan doctors came from urban areas. Low mobility existed among all physicians, with highest mobility among osteopathic doctors and lowest among metropolitan specialists. Rural physicians were more involved in community life than metropolitan doctors, and there was very little difference between community involvement of medical doctors and osteopathic doctors. Due to more hospitals and increased technology in rural areas, the rural and urban medical practices have begun to show greater similarities. (AN)",

The study was limited to those individuals residing in the same 11 counties plus the Ohio Valley-Kentucky area. Some 307 subjects were interviewed during the summer of 1960. The document compares, in narrative and statistical fashion, the career levels of nonmigrants to those who migrate to industrial areas. In addition, migrant and nonmigrant comparisons are made considering the educational attainment effect on career opportunities.

        "description":"A group of 34 subjects each with a reading deficiency of 1 year or more were studied on the following variables: visual perception, arithmetic, memory, auditory perception, and laterality. The age range was from 8 to 13 years, with a mean grade deficiency of 1.93 years. Using the Minnesota Percepto-Diagnostic test as the diagnostic instrument, the subjects were assigned to one of three reading categories: primary retardation, secondary retardation, or retardation due to brain injury. The study was divided into two problems. The first compared the three reading categories on each variable by analysis of variance and by t tests. Auditory recall and consistency of direction in drawn figure placement were associated with brain injury. The second problem compared the three reading  categories with normative populations on each of the variables by means of t tests. The primary group was not significantly different from the normative populations on any of the variables. Difficulty with arithmetic was found to be associated with secondary reading retardation, and poor auditory recall was associated with brain injury. A continuum of organicity underlying all three diagnostic categories was suggested. References are included. (Author/WB)",

The reading passages used in the testing were at difficulty levels either 2 years below, 2 years above, or at the subjects' grade level. The final subject sampling included 708 students from each grade. Each of the 35 fifth-grade classes and 32 eighth-grade classes were randomly assigned to either cloze or multiple-choice tests. The California Achievement Test was given to all subjects before the study began. Independent variables considered were the type of test, the grade level, and the passage difficulty. An overall analysis of results showed the cloze test to be sensitive to grade levels but less sensitive to change in passage  difficulty. The two tests overlapped in measuring some parts of comprehension, but the multiple-choice tests measured more. It was concluded that caution should be used when applying cloze test scores as measures of comprehension until detailed analyses show what the cloze procedure is measuring and the grade and difficulty ranges for which it is appropriate.

Data is reported from some cloze technique investigations, using children from first grade through high school and adults from a variety of populations, which suggest that the cloze technique is applicable to many types of communication and that it can be used to discriminate among the readability levels of passages and among the reading comprehension levels of readers.

It was hypothesized that the reader learns (1) to extract distinctive feature information simultaneously from several parts of the configuration and (2) to integrate this information for identification of the whole. Two hundred and sixteen college students were given booklets with six 150-word passages of text. Each passage was printed in one of six typographic styles making use of upper and lower case letters. The subjects were asked to locate 20 words in each passage. The results of the experiments supported the hypothesis that disruption in the total look of the word does not  interfere with the reader's ability to identify that word unless discriminability of elements is disrupted, as in the passages where the size of the individual letters was mixed. Even then, the readers coped well with the disruptions. References are included. (NH)",

The 28 test stimuli were composed of 12 three-letter words and their component letters. When the letters were presented individually, the other two positions were filled with blanks. Each stimulus was initially projected at below-contrast threshold, and contrast was gradually increased until recognition was possible. There was an increase in mean gain for both words and letters with grade level, with a slight drop for  adults, but these differences were not statistically significant. A zero correlation was found between Stanford Achievement Tests reading subscores in grades 2, 3, and 4 and recognition gain.

The analysis deals primarily with Gibson's second and third stages of the reading process: learning to discriminate graphemes and phonemes and learning the rules of grapheme-phoneme correspondence. After the skill descriptions are made, the skills are classified according to type of concept skill (i.e., concepts, rules, and strategies) which are prerequisite to learning the component skills of knowing and using the rules of correspondence. The prerequisite conceptual  skills which are task analyzed are (1) multiple discrimination and association, (2) concept of class, (3) information reduction, (4) sequential rules, and (5) logical rules. Related issues which are discussed are (1) inductive and deductive techniques and (2) organized access and use of memory.

Ten disadvantaged 5-year-old Negro children served as their own controls, circling in booklets the letters seen after a 1-second presentation by memory drum. The memory drum tapes used five random orders and presented each letter twice. The letters appeared in the response booklets once with high-confusible alternates and once with low-confusible alternates. Mean errors for the high-confusible condition equaled 7.7, for the low-confusible condition 2.1, significant by t test at the .01 level. The concepts most frequently involved in errors were (1) location in space (b - p, d - q, f -t) and (d - b, p  - q) and (2) vertical extension of a letter part (d - a, q - a, n - h). Letter pairs with the lowest percentage of distinctive features were those most frequently confused. Tables, references, and an appendix are included. (Author/WB)",

Only nine articles represented experimental investigations of the problem. These articles were examined with respect to the adequacy of reporting information and data concerning the diagnosis of brain damage. The criteria for diagnosing brain damage were generally inadequate or nonexistent. There was little evidence to suggest that children with chronic neurological impairment at the level of the cerebral hemispheres require or benefit from teaching procedures which differ from those used for reading retardates without brain damage. Advantages and limitations of various neurological tests are discussed. Recommendations are made for standards to be followed in documenting brain  damage in research studies on the teaching of reading to brain-damaged children. A bibliography is included. (Author/CM)",

Significant correlations were also found between predictor variables.

Lectures are combined with group discussions, and achievement in the course is evaluated mainly by essays written during the semester. Data reported were collected during three successive semesters when minor changes were made in course structure. Scores on the general sociology test indicated that students were learning a satisfactory amount of basic sociology. Questionnaires were used to assess student reactions to essays as the basis of grades, to the discussion meetings, to their assigned tutor (discussion leader) and to the lectures. Associations between these variables were studied, and correlations between over-all course evaluation and other response and personal  variables were investigated while controlling on grade, approval of essay system, sex, age and semester in college. Findings were that the over-all evaluation was positive, that modifications in course structure had little effect on student responses, that the general reaction to the course was more strongly associated with reaction to lectures than to other course structure variables, and that freshman students appear to have special difficulties.

        "description":"It is suggested that the dilemma at every level of science education has its roots in the discrepancy among the goals of science education appropriate for different groups of learners. Considered are the major goals of science education as applied to two groups of pupils - the prospective scientists and all students in general. For the prospective scientists, the primary goal of science education is to provide them with the basic preparation for their further professional studies. For every student at all levels, the goals are those which contribute to the individual's scientific literacy. The three components of scientific literacy were identified as (1) understanding of key concepts and principles of science; (2) understanding of the aims and processes of scientific inquiry,  and (3) understanding of the interactions between science and the general culture. Based upon these goals of science education, the author speculates upon the key features of science instruction in 1991. He suggests that within secondary schools and colleges there be established two curricular streams: a Prospective Scientists Stream and a Scientific Literacy Stream. Each stream was discussed with examples of the concepts to be studied and instructional procedures to be used in the elementary school, secondary school, and college. (RR)",

A basic theme was chosen, expressed as &quot;man + natural resources = survival + development.&quot; Twelve broad understandings which contribute to this theme were identified, each serving as a focus for many concepts. Concepts and broad understandings were organized into a hierarchical structure. An integrated program was developed by identifying relevant concepts and materials in existing science and social studies courses, and building these into a sequence giving spiral concept development. Suggested learning experiences were included. This report  reviews the literature on Conservation and Environmental Education and on Attitude Education.

The most efficient feedback procedure was that of administering a specific review until the criterion frame performance was correct. The least efficient procedure was that of repeating the previous presentation as many times as necessary until a correct performance was achieved. In a second experiment, one hundred and sixty school children in the second, third, and fourth grades demonstrated that although the hierarchy of concepts was logical it did not represent the skills in a sequence acquired by these children. Two related studies were also included although they were not a part of the project's proposal. The first  investigated various combinations of right-wrong knowledge of results on conceptual learning. The results indicated that knowledge of results did not facilitate learning of the concept acquisition task. The second study examined the effect of the amount of negative knowledge of results upon naming of fractional amounts. Students receiving only the correct responses on the first trial showed significantly fewer errors in subsequent trials than the group which was given four alternative responses but no knowledge of responses on the first trial.

Subjects were 130 junior year student teachers (all but two of them white) who were assigned by their state college to four elementary schools in a small city school system. A 34-item questionnaire designed to tap attitudes toward teaching in inner-city schools was administered during the first and last week of their 9-week practice teaching period. Data analysis included observation of pre-post changes by grade level taught; covariance analysis of the post data taking grade taught and social class level into account; correlation of pre-post change scores on every item with those on every other item; and an analysis to tease out the significance of student  teacher social class background. General findings: Overall significant changes were in attitude toward discipline and control (more difficult than expected); toward teaching in the face of social problems (change toward pessimism); and toward inner-city children (positive change). Teaching experience widened the gap between attitudes of those teaching upper and lower grades. Items on teacher control correlated frequently with other items but not with those related to desire to teach in inner-city schools. Few effects were associated with social class per se, but there was significant interaction of social class with grade taught. (Complete findings are discussed.) (JS)",

Chapter 2 presents the model of the proposed new structure for organization and government which includes a faculty council, senior administrative board, committees and departments, other offices, and constituencies for deliberation and policymaking decisions. Chapter 3, based on the assumption that the next stage in the growth of the Faculty should be the adoption of a 5-year bachelor of  education degree as the basic undergraduate sequence, outlines a curriculum plan which permits the student to elect any one of 30 or more programs, each concerned with a speciality, and to follow one of four routes to the degree. Chapter 4 describes proposed doctoral programs and degrees, the master of arts degree and programs, the master of pedagogy, and other graduate programs. Faculty internal relations (e.g., student relations and personnel policy) are dealt with in chapter 5, external relations (within the university and off-campus) in chapter 6.

The 2-week episodes are intended to introduce a sociological perspective into existing social studies courses. The studies were designed to explore the relationship, if any, between the amount of formal teacher preparation in sociology (i.e., the number of hours of exposure to preservice and inservice instruction in the discipline) and the effectiveness of the episode materials in promoting student learning. Both studies indicate \"very little difference in student performance, when controlled for ability level, regardless of the level of teacher preparation in sociology.\" Among the possible conclusions suggested by the comparative  studies are: \"the materials produced by the SRSS project can be as effectively taught by teachers with considerable sociology and no special training as by teachers with considerable sociology and special training\" (i.e., they are \"teacher-proof materials\"); the effects of special training and preparation in subject matter and methods cannot be measured in terms of student performance on objective, cognitive tests\"; and \"the national evaluation scheme of the SRSS project straightjacketed all teachers to such an extent that differences in preparation could not affect the results.\" (Author/JS)",

On each item teachers may be observed to operate at one of four levels: (1) knowledge of (the environment for); (2) ability to establish (the environment for); (3) ability to analyze (the existing environment for); (4) ability to evaluate (the existing environment for). Teacher questionnaires and interviews supplement classroom observation records in the description-writing process. The instrument is being further refined and a program to prepare clinicians developed. (The category items, a sample observation sheet, and steps in administration are included.) (JS)",

The two program components were coordinated by different sets of leaders on an alternating schedule. In the methodology component 22 groups representing the various elementary grade levels and secondary and adult school subject areas explored teaching materials and techniques through a variety of resource people, research projects, and field trips. For the human relations component, which focused on feelings and attitudes, members were assigned to small discussion groups led by psychology and group dynamics  specialists; they met after each speaker's presentation to the total workshop group. Groups in both components included student workshop aides, parents, and community participants. Teachers, students, and parent-community representatives had also been involved in the 16-hour spring planning phase for exploration of problems involved in teaching minority students and for determination of workshop content. The resulting interaction was deemed the workshop's major strength. Major weaknesses: the alternating schedule, size of methodology groups (often too small), and failure to involve administrators in the operational phase.

Such problems as the political conditions, the lack of clear-cut goals, and the failure to plan alternative methods for achieving goals are seen as major limitations. To overcome these conditions and to permit positive planning, an \"educational service system\" is proposed as an analytical method. It is emphasized throughout that system procedures can contribute to education only as they are adjusted to the realities of the educational context. The six major steps in the process of systems analysis which are identified and discussed are: conceptualizing the system or the \"problem universe,\" defining the \"subsystems,\" stating the objectives of  the system, developing alternative procedures, selecting the best alternative, and implementing the system.

A class of 69 interns were randomly assigned to five treatment groups and one of their classes was chosen to be used in the experiment. In Febraury each class in three of the groups was given the Bryan Student Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ) and a parallel self-appraisal form only, and a fifth group was not tested until the end of the experiment. The three groups of teachers whose pupils were given the SOQ were given three feedback treatments; (1) no feedback, (2) written feedback only, and (3) written feedback plus a conference with a supervisor. In early May all five groups were given the SOQ and the self-appraisal form. The data were analyzed in three stages: (1) to  compute basic statistics, correlations, and factor analyses, (2) to detect differences between treatment groups, and (3) to detect possible sources of invalidity and to assess the accuracy of self-appraisal. There were significant differences between the treatment groups. Feedback, as compared with no feedback, was effective in changing subsequent pupil ratings, but in a direction opposite that which was expected. Those teachers receiving feedback were rated lower in May than in February. The conference mitigated this effect, but did not eliminate it. (Findings, instruments, and references are included.)

Fourteen eighth-grade teachers and 16 fifth-grade teachers were asked to rate special study children five times during the year on a behavior rating scale focusing on identification of under- and overachievement. From the pupils who met age (10, 14) and other criteria, four or five children were selected from each class for special study. Within each class were identified the boy and girl whose previous year's grade point average (GPA) rank in that class showed the greatest positive rank-order discrepancy with their California Test of Mental Maturity (CTMM) IQ rank in that class. The same plan was used to select the boy and girl exhibiting the greatest  negative discrepancy. Thus a set of underachievers and overachievers were identified in each classroom. Teacher ratings were compared with the actual discrepancy scores between CTMM and GPA. Results demonstrated that teachers correctly identified more overachievers than underachievers. However, this was due to the fact that teachers identify more students as overachievers. Comparing the hit rate with the guess rate, it was concluded that teachers are not good judges of student capability. Secondary and elementary teachers appear equally poor judges. More research is needed to isolate the factors that prevent teachers from identifying children who are capable of performing at higher levels. (JS)",

        "description":"A study had two aims: to explore the ability of pupils of grades 4-7 to give operational evidence of generalizing in selected numerical situations, and to study the effects of differing manners of verbalizing a generalization on the retention of the ability to use the generalizations. Pupils (18) from each of grades 4-7 in a public school were randomly chosen and given an individually administered discovery test consisting of the stimulus portions of instances of generalizations. For the exploratory part of the study, the number of instances required before the pupil gave correct responses, as well as the number of generalizations apparently formed, were recorded and analyzed by a grade-by-IQ level-by-sex analysis of variance and with respect to a linear model with independent  variables age, IQ, arithmetic achievement, and mathematical interests. Performance on a follow-up test (one week later) based on instances of the generalizations on the discovery test was to provide information for the influence-of-verbalizing study. Indications are that most pupils can form generalizations of the type encountered, although pupils of lower IQ require more instances. With the number of instances needed as a criterion, the optimal grade level at which to offer generalizing tasks appear to be grade 6 or after. The plateau at grade 6 supports Piagetian thought, although it may be due to a plateau on computational proficiency. (Instruments and bibliography are included.) (Author/JS)",

The liberal education component provided  general knowledge to the student through part of his junior year. The teaching experiences, provide instruction and specialization through the senior year to provisional certification. An optional fifth year provides partnership teaching with in-depth study in the six professional components.

        "description":"Teacher educators need to plan instruction with behavioral objectives; their selection of lesson content, teaching strategies, and student evaluation criteria should be consistent with these objectives. In the Florida State University model program, trainees are expected to reach the above goals by progressing at individual rates through performance specifications. The trainee moves through three phases: underclass (general and preprofessional education, which may be undertaken in a junior college), preservice (academic and professional), and inservice. It is expected that the academic and professional faculty will collaborate closely during this program; stimulus for collaboration comes from their mutual development of a battery of diagnostic tests to be used in trainee  selection and placement. Learning for the trainee continues beyond graduation into a full-time teaching position in a &quot;portal school&quot;--a public school responsible for training new teachers as well as educating children. The &quot;portal school&quot; should encourage cooperation between university and school personnel and should provide feedback for improving both the preservice and inservice phases. Other important features of the Florida model are its emphasis on differentiated staffing and its computerized management control system, used to monitor individual trainees' progress and to provide feedback for program modification.

        "description":"A key concept of the Michigan State University model is the clinical behavior style of the teachers it produces. Teachers are expected to approach teaching as clinical practice and to stylize a particular set of activities: describing, analyzing, hypothesizing; prescribing, treating, and observing consequences. Training in the clinical approach occurs, in part, in a clinic-school-network--a cooperative project of the university and one or more school systems--where prospective teachers observe and analyze teacher behavior patterns, where interns teach, and where the university staff develops teaching materials. The model, which was designed by interdisciplinary teams, has five major areas of study: general-liberal education, scholarly modes of knowledge, professional use of  knowledge, human learning, and clinical and field study. The trainee moves individually through single purpose experiences and modules, each of which aims for a specific behavioral objective. The modules, as well as information about student progress, evaluation, research, and clinic-school settings (rural, suburban, and urban), are part of an information retrieval system. Trainees may specialize in a subject area and age group. The program also features entrance requirements based on evolving standards, continual feedback for program modification, early trainee experience with children, and faculty currency through the rotation of professors into field experiences.

Hence, the functions and behaviors of teachers in given settings need to be specified. The ComField model itself does not specify them; rather the adopting college and public school system should be equal partners in selecting the competencies and behaviors to be taught in laboratory and live conditions. Similarly, they should jointly evaluate trainee performance and make policy decisions. The model also expects the trainee to become a self-understanding, self-directed learner, to contribute to the design and continual assessment of the program, and to  function in a wide range of social contexts. The latter presumes the involvement of the community. The model provides for a preservice component, which can be adapted to many types of education programs, and an inservice component for supervising and practicing teachers. It also features eight support systems: personnel, supplies, instructional development, program evaluation, program modification, cost accounting, and a computer-based information management system.

The model's 4 preservice years, composed of seven instructional units, focus on process goals. The first 2 1/2 years are devoted to liberal education with the aim of developing in the trainee new ways of perceiving, realizing, feeling, and deciding. The junior and senior years are for specialization and for professional study in six areas: methods and curriculum (focusing on problem resolution), child development, teaching theory and practice (focusing on decisionmaking), professional sensitivity training, self-directness, and social-cultural foundations. During the latter unit, the trainee, working with a counselor, determines the behavioral changes he  would like to bring about in his pupils and attempts to accomplish those changes in his fifth or inservice year--a year of partnership teaching in a school. All the instructional units are composed of modules, which are planned instructional episodes lasting from several hours to several months. Instruction is often individual; the largest grouping of students is fifteen. The model also provides for support systems, continual feedback, and the participation of students, teachers, researchers, public schools, and education industries in program development and implementation.

Teachers acquire an understanding of these roles during preservice and inservice experiences in four methodologies: inquiry and feedback groups--democratically organized groups of students who administer the program to themselves under faculty counseling; differential training--a model providing the faculty with ways of individualizing instruction; laboratory school--an inquiry school in which teaching and learning are studied as well as carried on; and a contract laboratory--a &quot;real&quot; school for direct contact with children. An example of the interrelationships among the four roles and methodologies is found  in the contact laboratory. The trainee moves through six phases--from &quot;experiencing the school as an unpaid teacher aide during the first four to eight weeks of the program; through tutoring, designing an individualized learning unit, working in an inquiry school, and operating an educational program for children (after school, summers, or weekends); and into internship, which specifies a two-thirds teaching position and proximity to other members of the trainee's feedback group.

During these phases, the trainee experiences learning activities through proficiency modules (PM's), which are manuals of instruction--available from computers, published documents, or the trainee himself--that guide him through individual study and group interaction toward acquiring specified behaviors. The modules are classified into &quot;types&quot; if they relate functionally and into &quot;blocks&quot; if they are  to be used sequentially. Each PM also incorporates a variety of evaluation devices for pre- and posttesting. Data on the trainee's progress (and on the program) are kept in tape storage.

Each specification identifies the behavioral objectives. Specifications were developed within five broad contexts and apply to one or more of the six target populations involved in elementary education and the preparation of elementary school teachers. The model is predicated on the assumption that the elementary school will move in the direction of team teaching, specifically with the instructional organization of the multi-unit school or a modification thereof. Each specification is identified by number and coded according to a numerical code in terms of information contained in the specification. This coding process is  designed to enable the user of the specifications to deal with them more effectively and flexibly in developing model programs in a variety of contexts. A process was developed whereby composites of specifications can be identified and programs based upon these specifications can be designed and implemented. An evaluative process was designed so that any program arranged in behavioral terms can be evaluated at a given point in time with provisions for prompt and objective feedback for program self-correction and modification.

Results of the study indicate that \"the increasingly popular use of 'sensitivity training' and its techniques of behavior modification are not accompanied by concomitant enthusiastic change in the participants.

Teachers began by transcribing children's stories, feelings, and ideas without changing the wording, until the children progressed, at their own speeds, to writing on their own. It was found that those children accustomed to dictation demonstrated a higher degree of fluency, in both oral and written communication,  than those not accustomed to it.

A world literature course with those aims introduced in a small Wisconsin high school focused on plays and novels dating from classical Greek literature to the present and including literature from Greece, England, Spain, France, Russia, Norway, and Italy. Because the class was composed of an exceptionally able group of students, methods of teaching included lectures, panel discussions, class discussions, students' reports, and student research papers. Full-length films, filmstrips, drama recordings, musical  compositions, art slides, and theater productions provided supplementary material. Solicited student comments indicated varying levels of enthusiasm for the course. (JM)",

Since reading interests and motivation vary greatly, the English teacher, while fostering responsible choices, should let each student explore his personal interests at his own pace. Serving as a resource for his students, the teacher, by applying such outside criteria as book awards, can make available that literature which answers both student needs and the literary requirements of the school curriculum. Dialogue with individual students, shared classroom discussion, and the use of composition assignments to clarify ideas further effectuate literature programs in which the student is offered a framework for dealing with his own problems and a means of  acquiring a literary heritage. Finally, the essential factor in any successful literature program is the teacher's ability to transmit both a personal interest in students and his own involvement in literature. (MF)",

One such doctrine is that society has always been influenced more by the nature of the media than by the content of the message communicated. McLuhan divides media into two types: hot media which feed a single sense with a message full of facts and which are low in participation; cool media which give few facts and require the recipient to actively complete the message and which are high in participation. Reading a book is hot; watching television is cold. According to McLuhan, only television of all communication media involves us with everybody and gives us desirable tactile involvement. The acceptance of McLuhan's  beliefs by young people can lead to alienation from the educational and social structures of the society and to an obsession with involvement, role-playing, and ego gratification. Teachers and critics must oppose &quot;the tacit approval of emptiness&quot; at the core of McLuhan's glorification of illiteracy, for in playing a role rather than doing a job, the young person grows up ill-equipped to carry out long-range plans or to function productively in a culture.

Also tested were the effects of an experienced teacher, as opposed to an inexperienced one, on the students' writing improvement. Two classes of students who had failed composition acted as the experimental groups, and a class of freshmen who had not previously taken a college composition course served as the control group. Experimental materials used were overhead projector transparencies on the structure of the paragraph, a picture-essay book, short films,  newspapers, magazines, and paperbacks. Results showed that students taught with experimental materials (1) improved their writing, (2) enthusiastically changed their attitides toward English, (3) did not improve in reading skills, and (4) gained almost as much from an inexperienced teacher as from an experienced one.

        "description":"The English teacher's broad interdisciplinary awareness and his training in critical analysis and communication through symbols prepare him to develop, with his students, evaluative criteria and analytical techniques for film study. Crucial to teaching film courses or units is his knowledge of how a film achieves its objectives through uniquely expressing the relationship between form and content. Short non-narrative films, imaginatively illustrating basic cinema techniques, can introduce principles of film analysis into the classroom, while eliminating problems of cost, length, and complexity inherent in feature films. Also useful are short films that develop a story line, express social comment, or present the film as a legitimate non-literary art form. More advanced units  could take up the styles of individual directors, the transformation of literature into cinema, and the historical development or sociological aspects of films. (MF)",

In each grade, 16 males and 16 females were equally distributed into two ability groups based on IQ. Data from the writing samples were analyzed with an analysis of variance in which the factors were grade, sex, and ability level. The data consisted of five ratios computed from a frequency count of sentences, T-units, clauses, and words, together with frequency count of 11 kinds of subordinate structures. Results showed significant differences between the two grade levels, but not between sexes or ability levels. Grade differences included the use by 12th graders of longer clauses and T-units; more coordination between main clauses by 8th graders, resulting in a higher  ratio of T-units per sentence; more frequent use of noun clauses by 12th graders; and more frequent use of adverb clauses by 8th graders.

Teachers in the experimental group read, orally, a story every day to the children, using carefully selected books which allowed for emotional identification with characters and situations. Teachers were also provided with a manual of accompanying activities and story-reading techniques. Two standardized tests were administered to students before and after the experimental period. The results revealed that the improvement of the experimental group (155 students) over the control group (130)  was significant in vocabulary, word knowledge, and reading comprehension; marginal in quality of vocabulary; and insignificant in word discrimination. Among the conclusions were that associating language learning with intellectual and emotional experiences strengthens the student's language power, and that reading to socially disadvantaged children helps to overcome their lack of experience with books and increases their perception of meaning and word skills.

Most of the respondents were familiar with IR and had used it at least limitedly in their classrooms. They praised IR's advantages as generating greater student interest, allowing for self-paced progress, and encouraging personal student-teacher relationships. However, they felt that, when IR was used exclusively, basic reading skills were neglected. In actual practice, IR has probably been absorbed into total reading programs, has had an influence on the selection and uses of materials in the classroom, and has made teachers more aware of pupil differences. The future of IR probably lies in its ability to pressure schools to encounter individual  differences and resolve them with the reading program. (JB)",

Findings showed that children ranked school problems highest, with world and national problems rating second place, personal problems third place, and home problems fourth place. Conclusions drawn were that fourth graders do write about their problems, concentrating most on those associated with school (especially their inadequate classroom performance) and, to a lesser extent, on problems acquired through secondary sources.

The purpose of this ESEA Title 3 in-service program was to produce teachers who could plan, implement, and evaluate teaching activities for each of Taba's cognitive tasks, and who could utilize these methods in appropriate places in the learning process. To achieve this objective, an inductive in-service educational program that balanced theory and practice and that approximated the kind of learning sequences and approach used in the classroom was administered to 27 teachers, 3 principals, 4 supervisors, and 3 curriculum directors for 1 year. The feedback received during the program stimulated  modifications in it. Results indicated that the program was effective in changing teacher classroom verbal behavior. Summative evaluation led to the acceptance of new hypotheses in regard to Taba in-service education and pointed to way toward studies yet needed.

Without oral history methods, this will be prostituted to mean a superficial view of opinions set forth by white society. All the broad areas of Black scholarship must begin to relate to the problems of capturing the life of the race on tape and retaining it for posterity. Oral history holds that what is of importance is what actors believed the truth to be at the moment they made their moves. To determine this, one must obtain first-hand reports from the actors as well as the observers in order to determine their ideas concerning the causes of the event and the course it took. For example, a survey conducted by Chicago State College in the spring and summer of 1967, dealing with the Black community, intergroup  relations, labor, intracity migration, and religious institutions produced data leading to an interpretation of those topics which could have never been arrived at in any other way.

The cultural difference theory asserts that the statistical differences noted by psychologists in intelligence testing, in family and social organization, and in attitude studies of the Negro community are surface manifestations of the viable, structured culture of the Negro American. Acquisition of new cultural patterns cannot occur without recognition of and respect for existing cultural patterns. The failure of psychology to recognize a distinct black culture has four main  sources: the basic ethnocentrism of psychology, the socio-political myths surrounding our conception of assimilation, ignorance concerning the fundamental notion of culture, and embarrassment of the black middle class and the white liberal to deal with culturally rooted behavioral differences.

Any standard classroom can be used, with minor modifications and inexpensive equipment and materials. All students could participate, probably working in small groups. The main reason for proposing laboratory work for this age and type of pupil is that they can very easily lose interest in school and school work. A program of this type would stimulate a disadvantaged youngster not only, perhaps, to explore the sciences further upon entering high school, but also to complete his schooling with his middle-class counterpart. Although no school or program can by itself hope to  overcome the manifold effects of the disadvantaged, the science teacher has the ready-made advantage of being able to create interest in his subject, particularly in school children attending a middle school. The teaching tactic of involving the learner in a variety of \"discovery\" activities capitalizes on the middle school disadvantaged child's natural curiosity about the world. (JM)",

        "description":"This narrative report introduces the Rough Rock Demonstration School's background, organization, and setting, which is characterized as a scene for doing what is needed in Indian education. Educational services discussed are preschool services (which include a Head Start class and a kindergarten class), phase one services (for the primary grades), and phase two services (for older students). Dormitory services are discussed in terms of staff, students, activities, and problems of behavior and health. The Navaho Curriculum Center's activities, financed primarily by E.S.E.A. Title I funds, are discussed in terms of a transition period at the beginning of the 1968-69 fiscal year, and of its continuing work, which emphasized the writing of Navaho language books and the use of  classroom aides. The Rough Rock Development Project is discussed in terms of its development out of the Community Services Division of the demonstration school. School Board decisions from July, 1968 to June, 1969 are listed and briefly discussed. [Photographic illustrations have been deleted due to their marginal reproducibility.] (JM)",

        "description":"The Hartford Project Concern attempted to discover if the educational deficits so persistent among minority group inner city children can be prevented or corrected by placement in a suburban school. Two hundred and sixty six were randomly selected by classroom units from those schools with 85 percent or more non-white population and were reassigned on a chance basis to vacant seats in 124 different classrooms in 34 suburban schools in five suburban communities. A control group of 305 was selected in an identical fashion. During each of the four terms between Fall 1966 and Spring 1968 each child was given a battery of tests under identical conditions. Teacher reports, interviews, etc. were also utilized. The overall pattern of differences between experimental and controls  indicates that programs, if begun in suburban schools by grade 3, can influence experimentals toward better understanding of expectations, i.e., better test-taking skill, increased self-discipline, and increased ability to evaluate responses in terms of external standards.

        "description":"While the concept of decentralization does highlight parent participation in school affairs, the actual process of getting parents involved in educational decision making is one of progressively building up confidence, knowledge, and skills of strategies which the system has withheld from them in the past. A small group of risk-taking parents can gradually participate more by making projects visible and involving. As the group becomes a place of support and excitement for the parent, isolation and fear of confrontation begins to be be overcome. In addition, through reaching out to similar groups in progressive stages, the group increases its sense of determination, strength, and knowledge. As it gains a high level of sophistication it must, in turn, contribute to newer groups in  an effort to constantly increase the coalition power of parents throughout the city.

The subjects included 180 four-, five-, and six-year old children. Sixty children at each age level were selected, twenty children within each level of high, 20 of middle, and 20 of low SES. Delay choice scores were unrelated to SES. Age proved to be the only significant variable. The six-year olds were significantly more willing to delay gratification than the five-year olds, who in turn obtained higher delay choice scores than the four-year olds. This study, within the limits imposed by the tasks used and the groups involved, lends no support to the thesis that lower class children are less willing or able to delay gratification than other  children of the same age, or that they are less willing to trust adults.

Kindergarten predictive measures were the Bender Gestalt Test and teachers' evaluations; follow-up measures were yearly standard achievement test results. Analyses revealed consistently high and significant relationships between teachers' ratings and subsequent school achievement. Teachers were surprisingly accurate in early identification of both high risk and high potential children. The Bender-Gestalt Test was more accurate for identification of high potential than high risk children. Findings support the use of these measures for initial screening of children entering formal  school programs.

A case study of a Black child who was hastily diagnosed and institutionalized as brain damaged, retarded, and psychotic illustrates this point. A bicultural model, rather than the deficit oversimplified model, is a preferable conceptual framework. Educators and health specialists must not only recognize the legitimacy and creativity of ethnic subcultures, but also must recognize that Afro-Americans are already more conversant with and competent in the main stream culture than most non-Black Americans would realize.

A pupil and a teacher sample were chosen from five Minneapolis inner-city schools. The pupil sample contained 62 American Indian, 46 Negro, and 143 white children. The teacher sample contained nine male and nine female white teachers. The children were classified by sex, race, grade IQ, tested achievement, and teacher assessment of achievement. A comprehensive statistical analysis was performed, including a three-way analysis of variance, and an analysis of covariance. Findings include the following. Girls obtain higher achievement scores  than boys. When achievement scores are adjusted for IQ, the same sex differences occur. Differences in IQ scores do not exist between sexes. Differences in IQ scores exist between Indian, Negro, and white children, with the latter obtaining higher scores. Differences do not exist between boys and girls in achievement-group scores. These findings have important implications for curriculum design and the deficit theory. (JM)",

The authors examined the status of programs in the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union by holding discussions with officials in selected health facilities of these countries. Midwifery and coronary intensive care were studied in the United Kingdom and feldshers and feldsherism in the Soviet Union. It was concluded that neither of the countries provides programmatic or regulatory models  that can be applied directly to the development and utilization of intermediate health professionals or medical auxiliaries in the United States. However, selected elements of the medical care systems in the countries studied do provide guidance for regulatory revision.

The project was conducted in two phases: an initial planning conference of representatives from industrial arts state associations and five regional pilot programs. At the planning conference 21 states presented ideas and plans they felt could produce significant inservice education in their state. Five were chosen: (1) Technical Competencies--Colorado, (2) Student  Involvement--Florida, (3) Classroom Management Competencies--Georgia, (4) Leadership Development Competencies--Oregon, and (5) Curriculum and Professional Competencies--Pennsylvania. Each of the programs is described and evaluated and recommendations are included. (GR)",

In April an ad hoc Committee on Allied Health Personnel consisting of nine persons was appointed, including armed forces liaison representatives. The committee, with staff members of the Division of Medical Sciences, studied military programs and had discussions and correspondence with education-oriented groups and governmental officials.

The underlying assumption was that the development of needed programs on a sound basis in the St. Louis area would result in general concepts valuable to community colleges in other urban areas seeking to develop courses of study in the health field. During the investigative year, information was collected from representatives of health service facilities through interviews, questionnaires, and reviews of pertinent literature. During the second year, the data were analyzed, programs selected, and curriculums developed. During the third year, the major emphasis was upon  implementation of the six selected programs, and a survey was carried out to determine what allied medical personnel were utilized by private practitioners of medicine, dentistry, and optometry. Other sections of the document deal with core curriculum, liaison with local and national organizations, student evaluation of programs, clinic affiliation, and specialized on-campus facilities.

During this phase, four agencies agreed to participate: the Los Angeles County Probation Department, the Alameda County Probation Department, and the California State Departments of Corrections and Youth Authority. The primary accomplishment was the establishment of career ladders within the participating agencies with breakdowns by specific tasks of required knowledge and skills. There was an assessment of the climate of each agency for developing the necessary innovations, and program trends for the future were analyzed. Methodology included the use of a study group for each agency composed of three agency professionals, three  preprofessionals (new careerists), and three clients of the system. (JK)",

Special training needs and criteria for training were defined by conducting interviews with 69 persons knowledgeable in the work performed by technicians associated with food and radiation. Major conclusions were: (1) Some post-high school vocational or college training is needed, (2) Core training should include radiation technology, health physics and safety, food processing, food chemistry, and mathematics with supplementary courses in biological sciences, packaging and electronics, (3) On-the-job training should be a  definite entity in the training program, (4) Technicians must demonstrate logical thinking ability, neatness, accuracy, and responsibility, (5) A 2-year curriculum offered through a technical college or community college appears to be the most feasible, and (6) Continued inservice education is recommended. The document includes sections relating to (1) personnel safety, (2) facilities, (3) a conference on training food irradiation technicians, (4) a Federal Drug Administration report, and (5) an appendix of resource materials.

Age structure is defined as the distribution of employed workers in civilian occupations, while participation rates are percentages of employed persons of a specific age class as compared to the total Southern population. Participation rates for males of labor force age declined from 72.3 percent in 1940 to 68.3 percent in 1960 and for women they rose from 21.7 to 32.2 percent. The greatest increases in occupational employment participation rates occurred in occupations where there were high educational or occupational training prerequisites. Profound changes were recorded in white and nonwhite employment. Because of heavy out-migration, the proportion of nonwhite males in  the labor force declined from 24 percent in 1940 to 17.5 percent in 1960 and for nonwhite women it dropped from 39.1 to 23.3 percent.

For the 20-year period, white collar employment rose by 3.2 million, blue collar by 2.5 million, service by 700,000, while farm employment declined 2.6 million. The change in the size of the labor force was projected to be 25.8 percent from 1960-1970 and 19.6 percent in 1970-80. These projections were greater than for the nation as a whole because of  prospects for better education and training programs, reduction in out-migration, changes in age distribution, more urbanization, industrial growth, and more equal employment opportunity in the South.

        "description":"To evaluate the effects of selected treatment and classification factors on the preparation of high school students for initial entry into agricultural occupations other than farming, and to compare the effectiveness of structuring agricultural subject matter based on the principles approach with the traditional approach, 24 Nebraska schools were randomly selected for this pilot study. For Phase I, the four treatment groups of related instruction, directed work experience, a combination of related instruction and direct work experience, and a control group were evaluated in a three-way analysis of covariance design. No statistical differences in the various treatment combinations were found although students with no exposure to related instruction scored higher on the  work-opinion inventory. Phase II of the study evaluated the principles approach in teaching agricultural subject matter based on a standardized agricultural achievement test. It was found that the achievement of subjects taught by the principles approach was equal to or significantly greater than the control group. A major problem in Phase I was lack of an adequate dependent variable measurement, and in Phase II it was difficult to get teachers to completely adopt the new method of instruction. Appended are the instruments used in the study, the agricultural principles taught, and a course of study for off-farm agricultural occupations. (DM)",

In tests of quantitative intelligence, mathematical skills, conceptual knowledge, readiness and aptitude, it is not reasonable to think of the language of the test as a neutral factor. It is with such tests that this paper is especially concerned. Particular lexical items used in a test may affect comprehension and result in false interpretations of the test performance. In analyzing the language of the test, tester and the language of the child, this paper has pointed out some ways in which children's test performance can be influenced by linguistic variables.

This investigation by the Center for the Study of Evaluation has been undertaken as part of the Higher Education Evaluation Project. Disciplinary practices do not exist in a vacuum; they are assumed to be functionally related to institutional characteristics and plutosopy. Disciplinary practices differ from institution to institution. Various aspects of college environment will be studied by the consensus approach. The validity of discipline data will be examined against data already in existence. The present study deals with only three institutional types of  higher education: (1) denominational colleges, (2) universities, and junior colleges. Since it has become necessary to place the entire question of student discipline within reasonable perspective in terms of the aims and goals of American higher education, it is concluded that the only real education is self-education and the only successful discipline is self-discipline. Favorable conditions make individual growth of mind, body and spirit possible. A higher educational institution must educate not only in the domain of the mind, but also in the realm of the spirit.

        "description":"The development of thinking is accepted as the most comprehensive aim of American education. A prominent means of stimulating pupils' thinking in the classroom is the effective use of questions. To design a good question, the teacher should begin by analyzing the type of thinking to be fostered and settle on the type of task to initiate such thinking. The phrasing of good questions has been neglected in research and practice. A major aim of the social studies incorporates the development of pupils' thinking. This study investigates the influence of question types on the stimulation of critical thinking and social studies achievement. The concern is centered on teachers' classroom questions, and employing questions to develop children's thought processes. Teaching is not just  asking questions, but rather stimulating pupils to ask effective questions. Social studies should guide children's thinking in a consideration of the rapidly changing present. Appropriate questions can expedite the achievement of having children analyze and evaluate their world. The five chapters of this study outline the objectives of the research problem, touch on related literature, detail the procedures utilized in the study, and present findings and conclusions. This research presents the question as a significant variable in the teaching-learning process.

        "description":"This study investigated the determinants and consequences of teacher-parent relations in the preschool context. Differences in teacher-parent relations appear to depend on the relative power of the two parties. Since teachers always control the main service offered by the institution, i.e. care and/or education of young children, and are always dependent on others for resources, i.e. money, the main variant was defined as the degree of parental control over financial resources of the organization and degree of parental dependence on its service. A four-fold typology was developed to demonstrate that teacher power is relatively highest in subsidized day care centers and parent power is relatively highest in private nursery schools. Data for the study came from participant  observations and interviews with teachers in 12 preschool programs in a midwestern urban community. Implications for program planning and execution were shown for schools that differed along the relevant dimensions. (Author)",

        "description":"In the course of controversies over preschool goals and methods for disadvantaged children, practices identified with professional preschool education predating Head Start have become labeled &quot;traditional&quot;, and teachers associated with it are stereotyped as &quot;sentimental&quot;. A cluster of teacher attributes implied by the &quot;sentimental&quot; stereotype includes belief in (a) the uniqueness, (b) the lovability, and (c) the preciousness of the young child. Roots of the belief are traceable to the romanticism of Rousseau and Freudian views of the psychosocial vulnerability of the young. The beliefs are seen also to serve functions for the teacher related to aspects of her working conditions. The functions of sentimentality are interpreted in terms of (1) confusion of role models, (2) low  occupational status, and (3) over-determined responses to the young child as captive client. Hypothesized relationships between teacher attributes and working conditions are proposed. (Author)",

The purpose of the program was to test the hypothesis that the creation and use of systemic links in extension work would result in desired changes in homemaking practices among low-income families. The assumption on which the experiment was based was that women who lived in the target communities and were themselves in the low-income stratum could communicate more effectively with other low-income housewives than professionally trained extension home economists. County extension staffs identified likely prospects for the role of systemic links, recruited those persons, provided intensive  training experiences in certain homemaking practices, and then instructed them to initiate contacts with client system families and establish themselves in the role of teacher and counselor. Measures of recommended practice adoption by client system homemakers indicated that the creation and use of systemic links is an effective procedure in programs of directed social change. (MF)",

The approximately 60% of the respondents who knew about government training programs and who were more familiar with federal than with state and local ones, obtained their information through  the mass media. Government subsidy to employers to encourage on-the-job training was preferred to institutional training by 65% of the employers. About 49% of the managers were willing to hire \"disadvantaged\" workers when their on-the-job training could be supported by federal funds, but only 42% were interested in hiring those who were institutionally trained.

In the face of formidable problems in such areas as economics, nutrition, population, and technology, India must develop a system of adult education and a method for effectively combatting mass illiteracy. Although the percentage of illiterate adults within the population is decreasing, the number continues to grow. The university in India has been generally unconcerned with its social milieu, conservative on providing community services, and apathetic on social problems. As in any society, this  attitude must be overcome if enough mature leadership is to be found.

Examined were three major training areas: power sewing machine, nurse aide, and clerical office work. Six tests were tested for their ability to predict success: the WAIS Revised Beta; Purdue Pegboard; English, California Surveys of Reading, Arithmetic, and Spelling; the GATB; and the Wonderlic Personnel Test. Two separate criteria for success were established, against which these tests were checked for predictive ability: success in training, and the ability to remain employed after six months. No clear patterns emerged on the expectancy tables. On the teacher rated group, most of the results were inconclusive. A clear cutoff point was seen on the WAIS Verbal IQ at the  dull-normal range (Wechsler classification system). This was not seen on the Performance IQ table where there seemed to be no pattern. Reading achievement seemed to fall above the seventh grade level although low reading achievement seemed to have little to do with teacher ratings. In the nurse aide group placement failures were uncommon. (author/nl)",

There were three broad approaches: interaction modes (including professional meetings, seminars, lectures, and sabbatical leaves); subsidized short courses and other noncredit and credit outside courses; journal clubs and other educational activities in the laboratory. Top management provided some educational opportunities, but motivation was largely relegated to supervisors. Actual employer programs consisted mainly of combinations of university credit courses, professional meetings, and laboratory lectures and seminars. Participants saw PCE as a complex and  dynamic process oriented toward keeping up to date within one's own domain or related disciplines, or acquiring additional pertinent information needed to continue in one's area of specialization or assignment. In the universities, research and degree teaching were of higher priority than PCE. Recommendations were made for action by management, professional societies, and universities.

Of all respondents, 75% failed to turn in lessons beyond the 1/4 point and 34% submitted no lessons; however, 63% indicated that they had learned something from the course, while 40% planned to  complete their course eventually. All respondents had at least a high school education and 68% had had some college. About 22% were enrolled in more than one correspondence course, and 28% were taking other college credit courses. Men and women differed significantly in age distribution, educational background, and course load. Findings showed, among other things, a need for better student counseling. (author/ly)",

Questionnaires were sent to 90 persons; 90 responded. Half the respondents were aged 21-44; 66% were women. Most respondents (84%) had some college background, but far more men than women had taken graduate work. The men were more enthusiastic than the women about the effectiveness of overall course content and of the correspondence method. Students generally spoke well of course content, instructional materials, and other aspects of their correspondence course experiences. However, major drawbacks were noted: (1) campus administrators' minimal efforts to communicate with the students; (2) many instances of long delays in delivering  course materials to enrollees and in getting lessons corrected and returned; (3) the large number of students for whom instructors' comments on evaluated assignments were of little help. A large minority of students wanted two or more supervised examinations included; a like number felt that too much writing was required in preparing lessons. (author/ly)",

        "description":"The history of Citizens' Forum in Canada 1943-68 shows how it used a combination of radio, television, study pamphlets, and study groups, and led to many new programing techniques and formats for radio and television. Educational needs engendered by the Depression and World War II are described, along with earlier examples of public affairs broadcasting in Canada. Changes in Forum format, administrative organization (national and regional), and broadcasting policy are traced, with emphasis on changing postwar educational needs and demand, varying forms of panel discussion and feedback, the eventual deterioration of the group discussion component, and the characteristics of the televised version of the Forum. Major topic areas over the years have been (in order of numbers of  broadcasts) International Affairs; Work; Government; Morality; Ethics; and Religion; and Education. Results of the review suggest that: radio educations's effectiveness is enhanced by listening groups; programs such as Citizens' Forum must alert and inform as well as educate; successful educational radio depends largely on skilled field leadership, extensive promotional activities, and continuity in format and broadcast time.

        "description":"The recognition of the systematic nature of the interference of the mother tongue when learning a second language is among the most significant advances in linguistics for the teaching and learning of foreign languages. The work of Weinreich showed that interference between language systems--the absorption of loan words, calques, and phonological, morphological, and syntactical features from one language to another--did not happen by some mysterious process in mid-air or in mid-history, but in the nervous systems of bilingual speakers. The more individuals there were who were bilingual in the two languages of the region, and the greater their community prestige, the more chance there was of their own &quot;interfered-with&quot; speech habits being adopted by monolingual speakers of the  surviving language. Rather than linguistically analyzing and comparing two languages to predict possible errors on the part of the learner, the author feels it safer to analyze the errors that are actually made and then start looking for the reasons in the system. He warns that &quot;systematic perceptual distortion&quot; in both pupil and teacher can produce faulty diagnosis of an error where an awareness of structural factors is lacking. An illustration of misdiagnosis on the phonological level is given in a contrasting of English and Urdu stop consonants. (AMM)",

On the basis of modern Bantu evidence and the comparative method, a maximum of 21 classes have been posited for proto-Bantu. The striking difference in the number of classes posited for proto-Bantu and individual Bantu languages is due to the counting system and the status of certain classes. The semantic content of class in Bantu languages has syntactic significance only to the extent that it corresponds to the semantic/syntactic features of the noun, and to that extent class is irrelevant. The semantic features ascribed to the respective classes in proto-Bantu are based on the predominance of such features across Bantu languages in  corresponding classes. Listed and discussed are selected classes of proto-Bantu and their semantic features ascribed to them in current linguistic literature. (Author/AMM)",

        "description":"In discussing the rich linguistic history of Afro-Americans, the author points out that black people had a linguistic system when they came to the New World and frequently had a knowledge of a form of English which had been influenced by Black Portuguese and West African languages. Despite many assertions to the contrary, Black English, \"the variety of English spoken or understood by many persons of Afro-American descent,\" is not a deficient use of Standard English. It represents a logical linguistic evolution typical of people who have been exposed to many different languages. Attitudinal and philosophical changes are needed with respect to the utilization of Black English in the schools. The teaching of Standard English as a tool language is a tenable goal for American  Education, so long as it does not preclude instruction in Black English. These points suggest a re-evaluation of how teachers should meet the educational needs of black children. They imply a need for a number of revisions and additions to contemporary education in such areas as materials, curriculum, teacher preparations, and certification.

While an increasing amount of adequate materials for teaching speaking and writing is available, the approaches, techniques, and materials for teaching reading and aural comprehension remain basically the same as 20-40 years ago. Programed materials based on sound linguistic analysis and concentrating on the right problems can \"free the student from the lockstep of the class.\" To help the foreign student develop skill in reading, which requires a passive recognition of  perhaps ten times as many words as the student can get by with actively, the author suggests an intensive concentration on the teaching of grammar structures and function words. (The latter account for about 50 percent of the words on any given page of prose, and are generally much more difficult for the student to learn than content words.) The author, of Macalester College, Saint Paul, Minnesota, reports briefly on a graded, three-level course in aural comprehension which is self-testing and self-correcting: correct answers are on tape.

The number of combinations possible in terms of columns on the data processing card and characters on the key-punch machine is sufficient to accommodate a great variety of approaches to analysis; the linguist may adapt the available card space and character variety in any way he deems appropriate. It is not necessary for the linguist himself to be fully acquainted with the actual functioning of the key-punch, the sorter, the printer and/or reproducer (although none requires more than a few minutes  introduction in order to operate it); a technician may be provided with a precise outline of the print-outs the linguist wishes to see and perform all of the necessary operations for the linguist. An examination of reduced and simplified data corresponding to two hypothetical research questions serves to illustrate the procedures involved. The first is an application of the method to a study of lexical variation, and the second an application to an investigation into the syntax of Brazilian Portuguese. (Authors/DO)",

Chapter III outlines suggestions for  setting up bilingual programs, the need for which must first be recognized by the local school board and superintendent. In Chapter IV, a brief description of English phonology and points of English grammar as they contrast with Spanish and Navaho illustrate some common teaching problems.

Twenty-two black children between the ages of nine and 12 were taped individually and in group interviews over a period of two weeks. Observations of this and other data led to a postulation of a specific linguistic &quot;register,&quot; or range of styles of language. The &quot;school&quot; register, which the children used during the first interviews, was non-fluent and distinctively different from the &quot;non-school&quot; register, in which they were verbal, fluent, and articulate. Implications of this distinction between registers are  discussed in the light of disparate theories of the relationship between BE and WE, and their pedagogical applications, particularly in the teaching of reading. In presenting a linguistic analysis of CBE/Fla, the author lists the phones, a probable inventory of phonemes, and their phonological rules. She found four main morphosyntactic deviations from standard WE, namely the use of &quot;be&quot; in the present tense. Appended is a sample transcription of &quot;The Three Little Pigs,&quot; as told by a verbally gifted 11-year-old boy in CBE/Fla. (AMM)",

Some Choctaw children know no English upon entering school; others know a little, or speak it as a first language learned from Choctaw-speaking parents. For these children it is necessary, the author feels, to teach English as a second language, emphasizing the oral skills. The simplified analysis of English and Choctaw presented in this paper contrasts important features of the two languages, and points out for the classroom teacher certain sounds and grammatical  structures which can be expected to be the most difficult for Choctaw students learning English. Facial diagrams and detailed explanations illustrate how to teach the students to pronounce difficult sounds. Examples of different pattern drills, some of which may be used as games, are suggested for teaching difficult grammar points. This paper is prefaced by a discussion of problems pertinent to second language learning and teaching by the editors, and concludes with a bibliography of references of special interest to the teacher.

Contributors supply filled-out Project Description Forms, abstracts, or current documents. LRIP puts out bi-annual Reports listing research current in the previous six months and runs a service supplying on request abstracts for the project descriptions listed in  the latest Report. Its principal problem is that of persuading investigators to contribute project information of sufficient detail and currency.

Although special emphasis is given to the problems of non-native English speaking teacher-trainees operating under adverse teaching conditions, it was felt that the wider applicability of the modern audio-lingual techniques that are given practical application in the text would make the handbook of value to all those concerned with classroom language teaching, and it has thus been published as a special issue of\"Lenguaje y Ciencias.\" The publication is divided into eight chapters: \"The Teacher's Appearance\"; \"Set Routine\"; \"The Teacher and His Lesson Plan\"; \"Presenting New Material\"; \"Conducting Practice\"; \"Admonishing and Praising\"; \"Homework\"; and \"The Teacher and His Class.\" There are, in addition, two appendices; \"Model Lesson Plan,\" and \"Form Showing Convenient Summary of Student's General Lesson Plan\"; and a short annotated bibliography.

Although in the past, testing has not had many constructive effects on student development, future tests will seek to discover early indications of potential that can be developed and utilized. Tests have been used administratively as a tool for attacking educational systems, but their use must be redirected so that they become a more integral part of education and a means to evaluate and improve our total educational program. The impact of testing on counseling is unclear, and consequently it is more realistic to consider the interplay between the two. Tests should be used to obtain pre-counseling diagnostic information, information for the counseling process, and information  for post-counseling decisions. In regard to instruction, too much emphasis has been placed on evaluating the pupil and not enough emphasis on evaluating the teacher's instructional procedure. If used effectively, tests can have a positive impact upon instruction by helping define educational objectives, improving teaching and learning, and motivating both pupil and teacher to obtain maximal benefits from the learning experience.

Although it may be possible to correct some problems by a clearer restatement of the scientist-professional model, a new model of clinical R and D has distinct advantages in the spectrum of psychological activities and role models. The clinical R and D model does not propose that the basic scientist and the applied professional be merged into a single person who has the option of performing either or both functions. It rather proposes that they not be combined, but that a specific role be created for a third person between the two extremes. Without the development and support of a  man-in-the-middle both ends of the continuum may suffer as clinical psychologists come to regard research as only a task to be engaged in to satisfy a particular image or role, and professional practice would serve to generate frustrations at not having more effective tools available.

They differ, however, in fraternity membership, academic major, year in school, and scholastic achievement. (3) Users show a personality pattern somewhat at variance with many stereotypes, while they are in some ways anti-social, they are  characterized by valuable traits as well, and (4) the character structure of non-users is not necessarily superior to that of users.

A brief description of the EPPS is given, noting its quickness and easy administration. The 15 personality variables are presented with a brief description of the meaning of each item. Methods of interpretation are presented including: (1) there is no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; score, (2) both the socially desirable and undesirable context of each term is explained, (3) consideration of both extremes of each high and low variables, and (4) involving the counselee in explaining his ideas of the results. Only the individual knows the true meaning of his score. Use of the EPPS in premarital counseling is illustrated in one example. Sometimes just pinpointing the differences in  three basic personality needs; affiliation, succorance, and nurturance; makes for increased understanding and tolerance. (KJ)",

A second purpose was to provide a behavioral and an unobtrusive measure of interpersonal attraction. Subjects were 40 college student volunteers from an introductory psychology course. Each subject was assigned two confederates who posed as students from another class. One confederate was given prior instructions to agree with the subject on all but two of the subjects' attitudinal statements, the other confederate was told to disagree on all but two. The subjects were then given instructions for seating. The males failed to show a preference to sit nearer the agreeing confederate. Results show that: (1) Females prefer to sit nearer a  person who agrees with them, than one who disagrees with them; and (2) Males respond to both attitudinal similarity and to their personal feelings about others in determining their location with respect to others.

        "description":"Project PLAN is designed to make educational programs fit the needs of individual learners, and the problem of how such a curriculum can be implemented is discussed. In addition to individualization of what is to be learned and amount of exposure to learning matter, individualization must also be based on the student's learning style; for example, on the various ways in which the content to be learned may be studied. This imposes a massive monitoring task which must be computerized. The paradigm for the development of a PLAN program of studies for secondary school is summarized. PLAN education, however, is designed to be more than a program of academic instruction, and guidance is an integral part of the project. The guidance program will be developed over the next few years and  prototype I will implement the educational and vocational counseling effort by attempting to make the educational system vocationally and learner relevant. It calls for experiences which will increase the child's knowledge and skill in the areas of: (1) independent learning, (2) rational decision making, (3) the assessment and implication of individual differences for vocational, avocational and social choice, (4) vocational information, and (5) leisure and citizenship opportunities.

A total of 32 college freshmen participated, most of whom were poor and had below average academic averages as measured by high school grade point average. Selected sets of cognitive and personality measures are used as predictor variables, and the concept of college success was enlarged to include student ratings by professors and student self-ratings, in addition to college grade point average. The success measures represent only the student's first semester in college and therefore the results presented are indicative rather than conclusive. They include: (1) cognitive measures, such as those in the ability cluster used in this study,  are highly questionable predictors of future college success in minority populations; (2) non-intellective measures, such as personality variables, may be useful as predictors in minority populations and further emphasize the need for research in this area.

The purpose of encounter groups is always one of facilitating the growth of the person, and of teaching individuals how to communicate more effectively with each other. Encounter groups are particularly appropriate for the person who experiences a \"loss of family\", who is lonely often and sad in his being in society. The encounter group represents a substitute family, a safe place to experiment with new behaviors. However, it is only a substitute family, it does have limitations. It is for those who are for the most part free of profound and chronic psychological difficulties. A participant comes to grow, as a person, not as a patient. The ideal situation of  encounter is one of sharing and communicating in a situation of safety. The trained encounter leader always makes certain that each person's integrity and his readiness for insight is protected. The changes in people following an encounter experience are an increased sensitivity and awareness of self, and a concomitant increase awareness in others and their sensitivities. (KJ)",

The responses of two groups of ninth graders to adjectives were studied in a correlational design by means of an informally derived Semantic Differential Scale. Adjectives considered socially desireable and socially undesireable were ranked on a continuum with the extremes being white and black. Results indicated a near perfect consistency in assignment of socially desireable traits to the lighter categories and undesireable traits to the darker categories. Interpretation for the causes of this evaluative assymetry of black and white will have to await further research, especially analysis of data  from black respondents. (KJ)",

The experts try to explain this phenomenon and in general, their explanations are the same, a put down of our youth.

The purpose of the study was to cause a shift in behavior from the \"presmoker\" or \"smoking experimenter\" toward the \"nonsmoker\" rather than the smoker. The general concept, the cigarette smoking habit is a health hazard of sufficient importance for youth to resist the pressure to smoke, was used to develop a unit in smoking for seventh graders. A pilot study was conducted using a five lesson unit on smoking education. Three different approaches were used: (1) the individual approach, (2) the peer-led approach, and (3) the teacher led approach. Teacher preparation was also tested, a regular classroom teacher as opposed to one having been trained in smoking education. A total of 575 seventh  grade students participated. Results indicate (1) the teacher led approach appeared to be most effective in situations where good discussion was possible, peer-led was more effective in smaller size classes; (2) regular classroom teachers were more effective; (3) girls made a more significant change toward non-smoking than boys; and (4) in general, the five lesson experimental education unity changed attitudes and beliefs about smoking.

The effective means for the total control of the environment is now available. The generation gap is due to this success. However, while technical development is greatly advanced, moral development is retarded. A guilt has developed in the younger generation because they feel morally compelled to achieve social justice. Young people have not developed and cannot develop effective solutions for our social problems. But they are poetical, and they do have sharp insight into certain truths which most of us  cannot or will not see. The young understand the older generation and tune them out and reject them as being out-of-tune with reality. The way to communicate with the young is to stay young and alive, to be loving, and to be willing to let the young share in a more vigorous leadership and drive towards achieving more humane and mutually respectful human relations and more effective social justice.

In order to understand the arena in which guidance specialists have been operating, three kinds of concerns are reviewed. First of all, the background and practices that surround the desegregation notion are presented. The counselor image is not generally that of an aide to black students. Guidance counselors cannot guide what they have rejected and do not know, and they cannot direct where they have not been. The first need is for counselors to know themselves. The second factor is training. Much needs to be changed in counselor education to make counselors more responsive to \"black\" needs. Thirdly, black and white counselors must be able to work together. Also, counselors  must be concerned with accountability to the black community and not just accountability to the white one. The role of guidance counselors should be one of detecting, protecting and guiding students to the solution of difficulties involving people. They must be sensitive to the feelings of resentment and hostility of their clients, and interested and committed to accepting the student for what he is. (KJ)",

        "description":"The elements of planned change outlined in this article, while directed toward a student personnel program, may also prove useful if applied to other aspects of the college program. One useful scheme for thinking about change describes it as a level or phase of behavior within an institutional setting, not as a static \"habit\" or \"custom,\" but as a dynamic balance of the institution. Driving forces or those raising the level of production are listed. Those tending to lower the level of production are also given. When these forces balance each other a level of production is established which is a quasi-stationary equilibrium. Change takes place when an imbalance occurs and continues until the equilibrium is achieved again. The application of this theory to student personnel work is  explained through a diagram of degree of identification of student activities with institutional intellectual objectives. The three major strategies for achieving change in a given situation are: (a) increasing the driving forces, (b) decreasing the restraining forces, or (c) a combination of the two. A case illustration presents an example of a force field situation on a state university campus as an example of the use of such a model as a way of analyzing and effecting change.

A nine point self-anchoring Expectation scale was developed to determine how closely the subjects came to meeting the perceived expectations of their parents, their school, their peers, and themselves. Both male and female smokers did not feel that they came as close to meeting their parents and schools expectations as did the non-smokers. The two groups however failed to show any significant differences in perceiving themselves as living up to the expectations of their peers and themselves. Assuming that smoking is a compensatory action by youngsters who do not succeed academically and socially, it is recommended  that educators approach the cause of the problem, which is failure, rather than smoking which is the effect. If it were possible to downplay smoking and at the same time broaden the potential for achievement to enable more students to increase their feelings of self-worth, smoking might become a less necessary crutch.

The sample consisted of 866 students from Northeast High School and 269 students from East High School. Thirty-three characteristics were selected from a review of the literature as being related to high school withdrawal and an individual discrimination function coefficient was ascertained for each of the variables. In this way each student was assigned to the group he most resembled--dropout or  persister. These groups were subdivided and significant differences were achieved for dropouts and persisters in all 32 groups in the Northeast population, and in the cross-validation process differences were significant for the total student group and for males. It was demonstrated that school dropouts can be predicted at a high level of accuracy by use of multiple discrimination analysis and that characteristics of dropouts from one high school may be used to predict dropouts at another high school with varying degrees of accuracy.

Subjects consisted of two matched groups of about 100 sophomores at Chicago City College. The experimental group was given an intensified counseling program while the control group received the regular amount of counseling, and at the end of the year the effectiveness of the intensified counseling program was determined. It was found that additional counseling of prospective  graduates increased the graduation rate, but the specific factors in the counseling process that contributed to this increase could not be ascertained. The following recommendations were made: (1) counseling services should be improved; (2) community colleges should increase their efforts in keeping students aware of requirements; (3) there should be an increase in predictive measurement instruments; and (4) a more thorough analysis should be made of the factors in the counseling process that contribute to increased student success.

Five null hypotheses were proposed within the general problem: Are academic achievement, self-discipline, self-concept, sex-role identification, and attitude toward school (authority) different for junior high boys and girls who are grouped by sex, as opposed to those grouped together? A total of 300 students participated in this study. Conclusions drawn from this study include that all five of the null hypotheses tested by the study were supported by the treatment of analysis of covariance. The few significant differences attributed to the interaction of the  dependent variables and the grouping effect were judged to be spurious.

Since morale has helped to account for intergroup differences in effectiveness, it might be a significant variable affecting the process and product of higher education. Twenty-two items relevant to institutional morale were selected from the College and University Environment Scales and used in the development of the morale scale. The scale was scored to yield a morale score for each of the Colleges in the sample and normative data were obtained using Pace's group of one hundred institutions, which reflects a broad cross section of American higher education. The morale scale was found to discriminate among the one hundred institutions and within eight homogeneous subgroups of these colleges. Significant  correlations were found between morale and 37 institutional variables and this provides some support for the validity of the scale. (Author/RSM)",

The results of the final form of the test seem to indicate: (1) that the test may be a good discriminator among groups of students who have differing backgrounds of knowledge of scientific method, and (2) that the test appears to discriminate changes in students as a function of having had training oriented toward scientific method. The test, however, seems to be a poor discriminator among individuals in a group. Further conclusions are: (1) the test will serve  quite adequately to discriminate between groups of students who are taught scientific method by two different techniques, (2) further development of the test ought to involve factor analysis to discriminate among subscales, and the production of more items so that the test could be lengthened, and parallel forms could be offered.

A fourth study examined the utility of leveling pupils on socioeconomic factors. The personality variables were Locus of Control (LC), Evaluative Style (ES), and Incentive Orientation (IO). The subjects consisted of pupils from grades three to six in nine elementary schools. In Study I leveling procedures revealed practically significant correlations between achievement and both LC and IO for pupils of below average and very high intelligence, respectively, but Study II, conducted in different schools, failed to  repeat these relationships. Study III indicated that different schools were not a reliable determinant of the relationship between personality and achievement. Study IV suggested that socioeconomic leveling effects the relationship between these two variables. The second part of the investigation evaluated the effects of LC and ES upon incidential and intentional learning. It was found that internal LC children responded with greater effort during learning than external LC pupils but that ES was an inconsequential correlate of learning. (Author/RSM)",

        "description":"The relationship between instruction and transfer was studied to determine if tests of transfer would influence evaluation of instruction differently than tests of learning of specifics. Subjects were 120 fourth graders of average intelligence. The children were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: (1) rule treatment, (2) specific instructions treatment, (3) answered problem treatment, or (4) control group. The three experimental groups were given the same problems to solve and only the problem solving instructions were different. There were no statistically significant differences in competence in solving the specific problems among the three groups, but the rule treatment group produced the greatest degree of transfer. It was concluded that to attain the general  goal of transfer, instruction associating rules with problems was preferrable to instruction which focused upon the problems without rules. Recent work lends strong support to this conclusion, but it has also been found that the level of performance on both learning and transfer tasks depends heavily on the particular tasks involved. Findings of the present study indicate the need to include transfer tests to measure outcomes of instruction if instructional goals include affecting students behavior in contexts other than those in which they were learned.

The sample of students was divided by sex, IQ level, and residential locus. This report discusses achievement motivation and productivity (the number of words written in achievement motivation stories). The achievement motive measure is shown to have low reliability, so the major part of the report deals with productivity. Productivity is higher for girls than boys across all schools, and is lower in rural than in urban schools. Race per se, with social class and IQ controlled, is not a significant source of variance. Productivity, it is speculated, may be a good indicant of academic socialization. Productivity data are discussed also in terms of  current research in the language-and-cognition domain. (Author)",

Two social support conditions, varying only in S's perception of the partner's adequacy as a valid reference for making judgments, were created. A unanimous group was also included to provide a conformity baseline. Results indicated that conformity was significantly reduced in both social support conditions; moreover, the valid social supporter produced a significantly greater decrease in conformity than did the invalid partner. The data support the hypothesis that independent assessment of reality provided by a partner is crucial to the efficacy  of social support in reducing conformity. (Author)",

A secondary purpose was the investigation of the extent to which findings from concept learning experiments in laboratory settings would generalize to the learning of types of concepts typically taught in school. The concept learning tasks used consisted of the learning of a series of plane geometry concepts. A sequence of 16 experiments were run using fifth grade children from 16 small town elementary schools. While the sequence of experiments did not prove long enough to produce a maximum response, the following results were obtained. The variables of verbal cue, time per slide (visual), and ratio of positive to negative  instances produced the greatest increments in response. The design did move in a direction of a maximal response, although not as rapidly as expected. Desirable features of this experimental approach, such as the ability to expand or contract the number of variables, were demonstrated. (Author)",

Separate analyses were made for four samples: (1) random sample of 100 students, (2) sample of 50 students with IQ's below 90, (3) sample of 50 students with IQ's from 90 through 110, and (4) sample of 50 students with IQ's above 110. Instruments used were the: (1) Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Tests, (2) Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, (3) Stanford Achievement Test, and (4) Wide Range Achievement Test. The primary conclusion was that even within a single classification of operational definitions of underachievement, selection as an underachiever was not equally probable for methods using different measures or criteria to  establish academic aptitude and academic performance. Recommendations were: (1) to explore interrelationships among selected discrepancy methods of selecting overachievers, (2) to direct research to the role of group intelligence tests, (3) to investigate the validity of factors in five parts of the Jastak procedure, (4) to investigate the use of a median split to obtain scores representing negative self-concept, and (5) to investigate measures of self-perception and methods of selecting underachievers.

The failure to produce sufficient and valid data is attributed to &quot;many complex and interacting variables,&quot; which are not speculated about in the document. (DE)",

A pilot project is proposed for the Chicago area. The goal of this project encompasses the development of an urban center that will conduct a series of inservice training programs for administrators and teachers within the urban area. These programs will be designed to help participants function more effectively in interpersonal contacts by examining interpersonal situations to assess their own and others' behavior and thus select the best procedures for attaining desired ends. To accomplish this aim, an expanding network of sequential phases is proposed. Sessions for general administrators  are to be followed by training of principals, district level administrators, and other personnel who will also be trained to conduct training sessions with teachers within their own schools. The urban center will use current CERLI inservice education programs as a model. (DE)",

With this feedback, a public relations strategy was outlined with materials and methods subsequently developed to meet the indicated needs.

Part two stresses the need to formulate an interlocking system, from the Federal level to the local classroom, in the area of planned change. Through a systems approach, a capacity to apply all relevant knowledge and the use of inside and outside resources, the program for planned change would be enhanced.

In the first phase, the problem is identified, data are gathered, and a prototype model is designed and carried out. At this juncture, an evaluation and redesign stage is inserted. Finally a field test of the model is made that is evaluated, redesigned, and again field tested. A final evaluation is made before a complete field test is conducted and this completes the cycle of development. Concurrent, sequential development of the phases in this program eliminates lags.  If this program were to continue, suggestions are made that would modify the cycle of development to maintain continuous growth and interest.

Following a short-term systems approach, existing educational management systems may be improved by a series of 11 specified steps. For the long-term application of the systems approach to the management of national, State, and local educational systems, more comprehensive planning is required. Information being developed by  Project CAPE, an extensive national survey assessing educational progress, could serve as the background for a national educational system analysis, followed by systems applications that would be regional in scope. A seven-phase system model for program development is outlined. (JK)",

The results were that 15% were defined as underachievers (fail was below learning quotient of 90) and half of these had a learning disability. The learning disability group were inferior to all groups in verbal tests and language skills; their processes of organizing experience appeared different; and their social maturity was below average. These children showed no greater incidence of visual defects indicating a need to emphasize behavioral and medical aspects in remediation. Some children with deficits in learning  showed dysfunctions of the brain again indicating the need for medical diagnosis and attention. There were indications that the underachievers showed more signs of neurological disturbance which suggested a relationship between these disturbances and learning deficiencies. Teacher ratings on the basis of the pupil rating scale used were found to be of critical usefulness. Extensive tables of results are included. (Author/JM)",

Subjects were adolescent patients, normal siblings, parents, and a normal control group of adolescents and parents. Perceptions of the family and ideal family were obtained on the Family Concept Q Sort. Patients were significantly lower than their siblings on perceived family adjustment and satisfaction while normal siblings did not differ significantly from normal controls. Parents of patients scored lower than parents of normal controls. Clinic parents both saw the family as unrelaxed; they perceived involvement and sociability but not an effective or interpersonally satisfying social unit.  (Author/RJ)",

It attempts to increase students' awareness of, and appreciation for, change and innovation; provide exercise for creative abilities which facilitate the fluent production of original ideas; teach techniques for the systematic production of new idea combinations; and, through humor, to create a free atmosphere encouraging spontaneity and imagination. In a preliminary field test, responses to an attitude questionnaire and three divergent production tasks (such as thinking of changes and improvements  for a doorknob) showed the program to be effective. Twenty-three subjects (21 seventh and two eighth grade students) who studied the program in a 10-week creative thinking course produced 65% more ideas on the divergent thinking tasks (ideas which were rated as significantly more creative) than 32 seventh grade control Ss enrolled in a creative writing course. There also was good indication that the trained Ss acquired more creative attitudes, including confidence in their own creative ability, than the control Ss. (Author/RJ)",

The population included 939 subjects for whom test data were available; 644 were interviewed and 207 were retested on various standardized measures. Instruments were developed to obtain initial data from school and agency records and current data from the subjects themselves. The typical subject was male, between the ages of 23 and 42, of average intelligence, lost vision before the age of five, and could not see sufficiently to read large print. Findings showed a high percentage unemployed; those employed had in general an annual income below the median for the general population and were engaged in a narrow range of occupations. Variables that  seemed to be most related to vocational success included I Q, sex, other disabilities, travel ability, and level of education. Except for I Q, and certain subtests of vocational interest tests, results of personality and vocational aptitude tests were not highly related to vocational success. Additional data analyses and implications for educators and rehabilitation counselors are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"To assess static balance ability in children 239 subjects (ages 5 to 9) were tested using a technique of electronic ataxiametry. Body weight displacement was measured for various postures. The scores correlated significantly with teacher's evaluation of school preparedness, basic math skills, and reading achievement in samples of normal children. Girls who ranked high in static balance ability in comparison to boys showed higher scores within sex group correlations between equilibrium control and between school and reading readiness. Thirty-three educationally handicapped students who had slightly lower static balance scores in postures with occluded vision were efficiently divided into balance impaired and balance unimpaired groups. Indications were that the study appears to add  to the knowledge of the role of maturational and organismic factors in learning difficulties in both normal and educationally handicapped children in primary grades. Extensive tables of results are included. (Author/JM)",

The data upon pre- and posttesting with the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking revealed no significant differences between the two groups. However, the author felt from analysis and informal observation that Stretch did improve verbal originality, certain scores of the lower ability group improved more than the higher ability group, and all students improved significantly on almost all measures.

It comprises five volumes, of which this--divided into two sections: An Overview of Individualized Instruction and IPI, and Behavioral Objectives and the IPI Mathematics Continuum--is the first. Section I deals with the history of individualization, an overview of individualized instruction and how instruction is individualized, in each case considering the phases of pretest and posttest. Next it gives an overview of IPI and how instruction is individualized in it; a director audio-visual tape, sample items, worksheets and a mathematics continuum are part of these. A summary sheet and a glossary of terms conclude the section. Section  II discusses behavioral objectives in IPI mathematics, here using a second director tape (audio), and the organization of the mathematics continuum. A summary sheet concludes this section and this volume. (GO)",

Each behavior to be mastered demands a suitable test or test items specially designed to measure the behavior. The role of achievement testing constitutes the matter of this second in a series of five volumes designed to equip the teacher with the basic skills in teaching in IPI. IPI uses achievement testing in four ways and they are designated: Placement Tests, Unit Pretests, Curriculum Embedded Tests or CET's, and Unit Posttests.

He criticizes the placement testing procedure as inadequate, as it does not allow for the employment of a general psychometric model. The unit pretests, which function as diagnostic tests, provide only an outline of the current state of the student's knowledge in a subject, but do not include sufficient assessment of that individual's learning history to make an adequate prescription. The curriculum-embedded tests seem to function adequately. The unit posttests provide information about a  student's mastery of individual items, but not about his ability to combine these skills to a more general application. Improvement of the testing system demands careful examination of goals at all levels of analysis and, in particular, demands that all elements under examination be related to the ultimate purposes of the system.

The curriculum designer has the responsibility of specifying, with varying degrees of exactness, how the typical pupil would move from a beginning level of ability to some final level of ability. An overall sequence spanning several school years may be thought of as progression of units with specific objectives. The term &quot;unit&quot; has a relatively specific meaning when used in the context of the IPI curricula. It involves some unitary ability composed of a limited number of objectives. The overall goal for a unit should be well enough defined so that it describes  how a pupil would be evaluated to determine whether or not he had the abilities indicated by the goal of the unit.

The reasons most frequently listed for attending Hofstra were location, academic program, and financial factors. The academically superior student cited financial reasons more frequently, while the poorer student was more influenced by academic reasons. Better students who perceived Hofstra less favorably, and those for whom Hofstra was not first choice were  more likely to be influenced by financial reasons. .

Most PhD programs, after paying lip service to the value of good teaching, proceed to deify the notion of research training, though there is ample evidence that most PhD recipients never publish or use their research training. A new PhD degree should be designed for the education of prospective junior and four year college teachers. The curriculum for this degree would be interdisciplinary and would include teaching internships. This new degree would strengthen the research value of the PhD. The standard PhD program needs to be made more relevant by  linking the constancy of the human condition to the immediacy of social change. Improved communication is also needed between university and society because those who pay the bill have a right to know the university better. If the university does not change itself, outside agencies may impose changes upon it. It is vital that the university itself accept the responsibility for initiating the needed changes. (AF)",

The new generation of undergraduates will not be content to accept without question the ways and modes of traditional graduate education. New answers must be found to such issues as: (1) effectively meeting the predominantly teaching needs of the two and four year colleges and the undergraduate schools; (2) limiting research in the name of higher social goals; and (3) involving the graduate school in the community and in the solution of social problems. The first problem could be met by eliminating the need for a dissertation from the PhD degree and substituting two years of teaching  experience in a two or four year college. The question of research, especially war related research, and its implication for mankind is a highly complex one. If the research under consideration imperils the university as a center of humane learning, such research should be stopped. The university has always been a creature of and responsive to the dominant forces of society.

The university, long engaged in basic and applied military research, is now being asked to help solve our social and environmental problems and serve as the agency to bring about social change. The university's response to these demands has been characteristically academic: the establishment of a new degree program, or institute. A few of the faculty have undertaken limited public service activities. The public expects more; it expects the university to develop a social technology to overcome the vexing social problems of our society. This can only be  accomplished by changing the present form of research in the social sciences. Applied social research may require direct involvement in the political process and idealogical commitment, which could arouse strong local antagonisms and lead to control over the university by radical groups of the left or right. The establishment of independent problem-centered institutes may be a better approach to tackling the problem of effecting social change. (AF)",

        "description":"Although student participation in academic decision making has become generally acceptable, there is still controversy about who has the ultimate decision-making authority within the university: the faculty or students. Historically, universities based on faculty power, prevalent in northern Europe and the US, have in general been governed by consensus methods and have been productive in scholarship, while universities in which student influence is strong have become highly politicized and have generally ceased to be academically distinguished. The US university has been based on the \"generational concept\" in which the faculty alone are the enfranchised citizens of the community and students pay for the privilege of attending the institution. Students are objecting to that  concept and see the university more as a city-state in which there should be only one class of citizen, with equal rights in the decision-making process. When the faculty attempts to compromise on these issues, it may compromise on the principles on which the university is based. Direct and formal student involvement is desirable. But, in the final analysis, the faculty must determine what standards of behavior are to be required of all in the interest of the continued existence and development of the university. (AF)",

Though students have been effectively and productively involved in decision making for generations, the current demand for multi-level involvement differs because it represents a grasp for student power. If decision making includes the collection and interpretation of facts, students and faculty are equally qualified to do the first, but faculty by virtue of experience may be more qualified to do the latter. However, students and faculty can work together to develop sound solutions to university problems. As Kingman Brewster has stated: the great majority of students do not want to spend much of their time and energy in the guidance of governance of  their university. In addition, it is important to recognize that a student generation lasts for only four years and students are therefore not accountable for the policies they help devise. While students should serve along with faculty on university committees, their role in decision making should be limited to policies that will have short-range effects. (AF)",

Others argue that most students are not interested in governance, or that their transitory presence at the university makes their participation in decision making undesirable.

The momentum of the reforms at the undergraduate level is now carrying over to graduate schools. Students no longer consider graduate education a privilege, but a right to advanced training and to something beside a \"worthless\" degree. They want involvement, and the opportunity to establish new criteria for educational professionalism, which emphasize the quality of teaching and service to school and community. Long a fragmentized group, graduate students are now organizing to improve their position. The faculty is generally more concerned with publishing and consulting than with teaching, and their loyalty is not to the student or university, but to the outside  world. As a result, students have not been getting the instruction they deserve. Graduate students could be effectively involved in bridging the gaps between undergraduates and faculty by acting as counselors for undergraduates, as critics and evaluators of the educational process, and as members of university committees and advisory councils.

        "description":"There is increasing protest regarding the validity and usefulness of current methods of evaluating students' abilities and achievements. With higher education accessible to the masses, increased competition for college, graduate school, and good jobs has made the attainment of \"good grades\" more important than ever. Yet the appearance of objectivity and precise evaluation in grades really conceals a host of assumptions and undefined variables. Many alternatives have been proposed: pass/fail, satisfactory/unsatisfactory, etc. The traditional system of grading has many advantages, however; it has been tested by experience and the grade point average is one of the most consistent indicators of a student's probable success. Although the traditional system is objectionable, there is  no one panacea. It is important that the teacher/grader be aware of the capabilities and limitations of alternate grading methods, and be willing to experiment with a mix of alternatives, including more individual counseling and personalized diagnostic evaluation. The re-evaluation of the grading system should be extended to a complete re-evaluation of the mission and regulations of graduate degree programs. (AF)",

        "description":"In the Spring of 1968, a joint study group called an Ad Hoc Committee on Grades and Evaluation was created to examine current methods of student evaluation. Several members of the group believed that letter grading on the undergraduate and graduate levels was counterproductive, because grades do not accurately reflect either student performance or capability, and they corrupt the learning situation, because the power to grade puts the ultimate weapon in the hands of the faculty and thus constitutes a form of tyranny. Other critics charged that the present system prevents an individual student from integrating his courses, seminars, and independent study into a meaningful whole. Strongest objection came from students and scholars in the humanities and social sciences where the  element of subjectivity is harder to eliminate. Though the faculty has learned to read transcripts with caution, students and the general public tend to take grades at face value, aware that many of the rewards and punishments of academic life are distributed on a very precise calculation of academic averages. While the committee members are fully aware of the many advantages of the traditional grading system, they will recommend a drastic reduction in the amount of letter grading and encourage alternative methods of evaluating students.

Of the 240 responses, 127 indicated that they used systems other than the A-F traditional system, either in part or in toto. Other systems used include pass/fail, satisfactory/unsatisfactory, pass/no credit, and some variations of the A-F traditional system. Responses indicated that use of the less traditional system increased markedly in the last 5 years, and varied widely. In some universities, the use of a certain system was determined by institutional policy; in others, by departmental, student, or faculty option. The greatest use of less traditional methods was in theses and dissertations, followed by independent research, seminars and electives. Only 24 schools permitted  nontraditional grading in standard lecture courses. Leading advantages cited for utilizing less traditional methods included the belief that they were more realistic and exerted less pressure on students. Disadvantages included administrative confusion because of a multiple grading system, and a fear that students might be penalized in later competition for stipends. (AF)",

        "description":"Dissatisfaction with traditional grading practices has been increasing steadily during the past few years. Although alternative methods have been used by many institutions, there will be no commonly accepted system until some agreement has been reached on the goals of graduate level instruction and grading. There is no evidence to indicate that undergraduate grades are predictive of graduate performance. Success at the graduate level may be dependent on a different pattern of abilities and proficiencies. Given the attrition rate, the problem of graduate admissions is badly resolved by reliance on grades. The relationship between professor and student strongly affects grades. Too few professors take, or have the time, to consult extensively with their students, thereby depriving  graduate students of much needed advice and sometimes of a fair assessment. Another area of concern involves the relationship between grading and the nature of the discipline. An answer may be found in a mixed grading system that takes into account the nature of knowledge in the various areas of the college curriculum, the means of appraisal available to instructors in these areas, and the different purposes to be served by appraising and reporting students' progress.

Teaching should help lead the student not only to a discovery of the subject matter and its implication for society, but also of himself as a human being.

These exams would generally only be taken by those who intended to major or minor in a field and would be taken when entering that field and when completing it. Without the grades, work in the classroom would have to be meaningful in itself; and without the teacher as the sole judge of one's performance,  both teaching and learning would become more stimulating experiences. Students should also be allowed to question the relevancy of particular questions on exams.

Some tentative conclusions were: (1) the lack of difference between the experimental and control classes in acquisition of  skills tested (i.e. in post-test scores) indicates that the experimental teaching method and curriculum were neither better nor worse than the control teaching method and curriculum; and (2) scores on the objective tests were more closely related to assignment of course grades in the control group than in the experimental group.

It is desirable therefore, to develop a reasonable and consistent plan for college scholarships. This plan would employ cost-benefit and other techniques of economic analysis to attain national policy objectives. In this plan, the social value of a college education for various groups of high school graduates would be measured through various means by the subsidizing agency and the private value by the financial sacrifice the potential students and their families are willing to make. Through economic and mathematical analysis, these two factors would be utilized to obtain a maximum social gain from a national college student subsidy budget.  (Author/DS)",

The Center conducted a research project to determine whether certain attitudes, values and interests of students and faculty at cluster colleges differed from those at other colleges. Results indicated that cluster college faculty and students were more concerned about the institution's educational philosophy and were more knowledgeable about it than their counterparts elsewhere. They were also more open to change, innovation and experimentation in education. Because cluster colleges are new, innovative and must compete with institutions having traditional programs for funds, they must evaluate themselves and their goals to a greater extent.

This coding manual accommodates monographs only (as presently defined by MARC), but it is compatible with the serials system now being developed. Again following MARC, this manual deals only with works in the Roman alphabet. The &quot;Anglo-American Cataloging Rules&quot; have been used for identification and definition of catalog data, and the coding attempts to be consonant with these rules, as far as possible. The arrangement of the manual follows  the division of the catalog card data into three fields: the A-Fields (which refer to the 'body' or upper part of the card, the B-Fields (for notes, tracings and other data in the lower part of the card), and the I-Fields (for added description). Each of these sections has its own introduction. Within the sections the arrangement is in alphabetical order by code letter.

The system is also designed to accommodate the varying degrees of complexity which will occur in serial collections of different size and scope. The system is designed to function as an aid to serials librarians in maintaining control of their basic files in terms of ordering, subscription renewal, expected arrivals, claiming, binding, and holdings inventory. The machine portion of the system is designed to be compatible with  emerging State and National standards. To further this goal a machine record has been constructed which strongly resembles the standard machine record for monographs (MARC) developed by the Library of Congress.

The system can be planned and put into operation by one staff member in approximately thirty hours plus secretarial time. Before the system is developed, contact is made with suppliers of information retrieval systems to determine the feasibility of an automatic retrieval system for the organization. If an automatic system is not warranted by present information needs, the procedures and conceptual framework for the non-automatic system can be easily adapted to an automatic system in the future.

More specific objectives were the development, implementation, and evaluation of an indexing algorithm which will enable the computer to assign automatically index terms to documents. This final project report describes the automatic indexing method that was developed in which index tags for documents are generated by the computer. The computer scans the text of periodical articles and automatically assigns to them index terms with their respective weights on the basis of explicitly defined  text characteristics. A machine file of document references with their associated index terms is automatically produced which can be searched on a coordinate basis for the retrieval of specified drug-related information. A statistical evaluation of the output of the indexing algorithm and information concerning the system's ability to respond to specific queries is given. (Author/JB)",

Team reports agreed that the programs had been more successful in bolstering the social and emotional needs of the children than in the advancement of their intellectual skills. The interaction of the preschoolers with their teachers and teacher aides, whether these were teenagers or adults, was critically important in establishing an acceptable learning environment. Contact with older persons able to respond quickly to children's questions and needs for attention encouraged and reinforced development. Male teenage aides were especially valuable as  many of the children did not have satisfactory father contacts at home. It was generally agreed that the essential training and experience in preschool education could be given in inservice programs or in short institute sessions. Learning by doing was stressed by all Centers, and adolescent, parent, and community involvement in the educative process was suggested by the survey report. (MS)",

(2) Is the learning of good and poor readers affected differently by the additional cues? For the 72 elementary school subjects in the study, color was shown to have a positive effect upon learning when intralist similarity was high, but there was no reliable differential effect for good and poor readers. Serial (as opposed to scrambled) order of presentation was shown to enhance both initial learning and recall. Instructions to use verbal  mediators also enhanced learning; but again there was no differential effect for good and poor readers.

To the extent that specific aspects of that environment can be identified as significant antecedents to behavioral inadequacies, remedial efforts should concern themselves with those aspects. Disadvantaged boys from father-absent homes exhibit a low level of maturity in their cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes. Yet, while this immaturity seems clearly to spring from social factors, preschools have traditionally stressed school readiness skills. The problems experienced by disadvantaged boys seemed to be caused by a combination of (1) paternal  absence, (2) lack of appropriate masculine model, and (3) low social esteem of the male and male role. Remediation seems to require at least (1) a competent masculine model, (2) varied child-model interaction, and (3) reinforcement of the boy's imitating behavior. The presence of these conditions in a coordinated social-learning program yielded significant intellectual and emotional gains. Social-learning techniques can be used to supplement programs with specific enrichment goals, and may also be used to broaden the range of the advantaged as well as the disadvantaged. (MH)",

Right now, the flurry of activity in educational reform for the very young is more concerned with activity than results. For example, the Head Start program is receiving more and more amplification in spite of the mixed evidence concerning its success. Also, the questionable tactic of imposing middle-class life on the economically deprived to attune them to our middle-class schools continues as one of the most well-advertised efforts of concerned reformers. Psychologists can be most useful if they will assume  roles as setters of goals, sources of innovative educational ideas, repositories of knowledge, and gatherers of information. The current state of knowledge of basic psychological principles for educational reform is indeed sad. It is in research that psychologists have the most to contribute. This research could best be carried out in experimental schools with various innovative techniques being measured against each other. (MH)",

Data were collected from tests, interviews, and questionnaires of students, parents, and teachers from 104 Head Start centers across the country, and control areas. The major conclusions drawn from these data were: (1) Summer programs are ineffective in producing lasting gains in affective and cognitive development, (2) full-year programs are ineffective in aiding affective development and only marginally effective in producing  lasting cognitive gains, (3) all Head Start children are still considerably below national norms on tests of language development and scholastic achievement, while school readiness at grade one approaches the national norm, and (4) parents of Head Start children voiced strong approval of the program.

They hope that through parent-implemented Follow Through programs, discontented members of the community can be made to feel that they have a significant role in the schools' decision making processes. Follow Through is explained as an extension of Head Start and the booklet relates some of the work of the New Jersey Work-Study Conference which proposed a plan for parent involvement. A tentative framework for educational decision making is proposed, with emphasis on making parents feel that they share in the policy making process and on casting professionals in a liaison role. A  phase-by-phase outline of the plan is included which shows how various details can be handled, from budget and facilities to personnel and community relations. (MH)",

Each of the eight phases of the study lasted from 2 to 5 weeks. The first four phases established a base period and determined the separate effects of classroom rules, half hour academic lessons, and teacher praise. In the Token I phase each child in the afternoon classes received points for desirable behavior, which were exchanged for back-up reinforcers including comic books and dolls. The percentage of disruptive behavior significantly decreased. Tokens and back-up reinforcers were then withdrawn, and disruptive behavior increased, but not significantly. Tokens and back-up reinforcers were again reinstated and withdrawn and  then replaced by the use of more usual classroom reinforcers by the teacher. At this time disruptive behavior was 37% compared to 53% during the base period. Results indicated student gains on the California Achievement Test, higher class attendance, and the teacher's increased use of praise and decreased use of criticism and threats. (DR)",

The traditional approach emphasizes the children's internal motivation resulting from spontaneous free play and warm, accepting teachers, while the experimental approach emphasizes social learning theory in the form of teacher-directed activities and frequent praise or reinforcement for appropriate behaviors. Each of the six teachers was given a choice of approach. Three chose traditional; three experimental. The classrooms were observed and evaluated for student behavior (Child Behavior Survey Instrument) and teacher behavior. The three teachers in the experimental approach did not carry  out their roles as praise-dispensers, thus making the more desirable behavior of the children in the traditional approach classes meaningless for any comparison of the two approaches. The major implication of this research is that actual application of social learning theory requires more than agreement with its principles. Observed intra-approach differences suggest that a study of individual teacher style is needed as well as a recognition that different children thrive in different kinds of classrooms. (MH)",

To illustrate the learning potential of student choice-making, excerpts from a study group's experiences and a first grade teacher's log are presented. Suggestions are given for making and carrying out rules and guidelines for individual as well as group activities.

The interacting variables of this model will be used to identify and assess  disadvantagement. A bibliography is included. E. Kuno Beller investigated the effects of early educational intervention on the intellectual development of lower class, disadvantaged children, measuring intellectual functioning by standardized tests and classroom grades and motivation by ratings and direct observation.

The main thrust of this seminar is the investigation of family and parent characteristics that influence the academic performance of young children. Robert Hess, in the opening paper, summarizes the information available on the subject, reviews the evidence for social class and ethnic differences in parental behavior, sketches the conceptions of association between features of the society and cognitive development, and speculates on the implications of the above for Head Start. A summary of studies made from 1945 to 1969 of parental influences on children's academic achievement and cognitive behavior is included, with bibliography. The second paper, by Ira  Gordon, comments on Hess' paper and expands on it. Gordon classifies the factors influencing child development as either demographic, parental-cognitive, or parental-emotional and discusses in detail several factors in each category. His investigation of these factors leads him to enunciate the idea of parent power in programs of education. In the final paper, Daniel Scheinfeld discusses the changes that must be made in parents and home life to insure more advantageous development for the children. In order for basic structural change to take place in the lives of disadvantaged families, the parents must become actively and effectively engaged with the environment. (MH)",

        "description":"The child's ability to identify numerousness as a property of a set, distinct from all the other properties of that set, may be a prerequisite to conservation of numerousness of sets. To test this theory, 11 lessons designed to develop the ability to identify properties of objects and of sets of objects and to represent length and numerousness were presented to kindergarten and preschool children. It was hypothesized that this training would help the subjects score higher on a test of conservation of numerousness. The difference, however, between experimental groups, who received the training lessons, and control groups, who received no special training, was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, since there were some noticeable differences between the amount of improvement  in the groups, it was concluded that kindergarten and preschool children can be taught with little difficulty to recognize, discriminate and label properties of objects and sets, and that this training can often be enough to increase the children's scores on a test of conservation of numerousness.

It is Piaget's view, confirmed by empirical evidence that children are not able to conserve length until age 7 or 8. Recent concern over confounding variables led to the present study in which the children from three kindergarten classes (N=71) were tested for conservation of length after different training conditions. One class received a pretest, training, and posttest; one class received only training and posttest; and one class received both tests but no training. The training was three 20-minute sessions aimed at an understanding of the property of length. Analyses of variance determined differential effects on performance of the  pretest, the training program, age and sex of the subject, and tester bias. Results showed the training program to be a significant variable, and girls made greater gains than did boys. (Author/MH)",

Scores indicated that the disadvantaged group generally did not perform as well as the advantaged children although there was much variation among individuals tested.

During the preschool year, children in the Ameliorative and Direct Verbal approaches both made more progress than the Traditional group. During the kindergarten year, only the Direct Verbal approach showed continued progress.

Using easily understood examples, the author takes you through the world of the child, pointing out what to expect in various situations and what to do about it. For instance, she notes that children are better able to run and jump than they are to draw or cut because of differential rates of development of large and small muscles. She discusses the problem of the disparity in maturity between boys and girls. She warns of children who will come to school with a germinating sickness and pass it around the classroom. She mentions the problem of verbal expression for all children, but especially for those to whom English is relatively unfamiliar.  Her advice in all situations is based on learning principles which advocate giving the child a secure and comfortable opportunity to respond to experiences and having adults react to him in a friendly, positive way.

A tabulation of the results showed, among other things, that about one-third of the farmers were satisfied with the government's efforts to improve their villages and that three-fourths were not concerned about who would govern the country. Reported attitudes were very favorable toward educating children, and some preference was given to educating the males. It was noted that factors retarding agricultural development were lack of capital, lack of irrigation, and lack of governmental support. The conclusion was  reached that agricultural technology would be accepted more quickly if loans were made available to the farmers. (BD)",

Under the SSSP, tenth-grade minority youth from small towns or rural areas of the southeastern and southwestern United States who are educationally disadvantaged but are ranked high according to the norms of their communities are given a structured 6-week basic curriculum of mathematics, communications, and reading. This curriculum is designed to prepare participating students for academic success in their remaining years of high school and in college. It is reported that of the more than 400 students who have taken part in the program, 85% are accounted for and have performed well in college. Along with  the discussion of the 1967 SSSP--in terms of teaching goals, student life during the session, and financial support for the project--the report describes 2 other SSSP programs: the 1967 Reading Workshop for elementary teachers and the 1967 Administrators Workshop.

Results of the analyses indicated that the Spanish-surname population had higher mobility and higher fertility rates than other white populations of the Southwest. In addition, over one-half of the rural Spanish-surname families and one-third of the urban families had incomes of less than $3,000 in 1959. However, the proportions of the Spanish-surname labor force in professional, clerical, crafts, and service occupations increased, and the proportions in farm and nonfarm labor declined between 1950 and  1960. Educational achievement improved between 1950 and 1960 but remained below the national median. Cultural factors contributing to the disadvantaged position of the Spanish-surname population were use of Spanish as the primary language and continued cultural isolation from Anglo society. (TL)",

Aspects surveyed and reported on are household characteristics, household income, employability and employment, education of children, farm operator families, home-produced food, and housing. The authors cite the critical problems and suggest possible solutions such as reducing the school dropout rate or improving the quality of education by bringing in outside funds to pay the costs of education.

First, there are those Indians who desire to forget their past values and devote all attention toward achieving success by totally adapting to city life. Second, and rarely found, are those Indians who attempt to retain their Indianness while still living in the urban areas. Third, and most prevalent, are those Indians who seek a balance between the concepts of Indianness and urban life.

The difference between intelligence and creativity was noted in emphasizing the need to develop the latter.

Materials were programed and semiprogramed. A diagnostic approach used the Cooperative Reading Comprehension Test (1960) and the Educational Developmental Laboratories Word Clue Test to gain insight into the individual's reading ability, interests, attitudes, and habits for a cumulative folder and to aid in designing a program and plan  of action for him. The method allowed one reading specialist and one student assistant to instruct hundreds of students and other adults, who participated three times weekly. The most obvious success was noted in comprehension and speed of comprehension results. Students kept their own attendance records and were graded \"satisfactory\" or \"unsatisfactory\" according to their progress.

They must recognize that verbal arithmetical material is conceptually packed with a high density factor which requires at least three kinds of reading adjustment: adjustment to a slower rate than  that used for narrative materials, varied eye movement including types of regressive eye movements, and intentional rereading. Two or three sets of symbolic meaning may be involved within one context; thus a student's vocabulary must include technical words, signs, and symbols.

Comprehension was viewed as an informational processing event which includes a constellation of cognitive and learning processes. Two arguments for this view were made: (1) Comprehension instruction can best be devised through an analysis of the component processes involved in the extraction and recall of factual and relational information in reading material and (2) instruction to increase comprehension ability can be predicated upon such an analysis. Information gain was defined as the extraction and recall of new information from a language stimulus and was purposed  as a measure of comprehension. Discussion focused on types of information, information gain, stimulus and response variables which may affect information processing, and student variables.

        "description":"To determine whether or not students in grades 2 and 4 comprehended materials written with patterns that appear frequently in their speech better than materials written with patterns that appear infrequently, two reading comprehension tests were devised by the investigator. Subjects were all second- and fourth-grade classrooms from two similar schools: 163 grade-2 students (81 girls, 82 boys) and 137 grade-4 students (69 girls, 68 boys). Test A used frequently occurring patterns from the oral language of second and fourth graders, and Test B used infrequently occurring patterns in the oral language of students from the same grades. Patterns were selected from Strickland's study (1962). Chi square and t tests were used to analyze the data. Results indicated (1) significantly more  grade-2 and -4 students obtained higher scores on test A than on test B (P .001); (2) grade-4 students performed significantly better than grade-2 students on both tests (P .01); (3) in general, there were no significant sex differences on either test within or across grades. Tables, charts, and a bibliography are included. (Author/WB)",

Considered are several conceptually unsatisfactory developments about a theory of measurement directly related to standard structures in mathematics from the standpoint of applying theory in the social sciences, or in the physical sciences. The problem of finitude and error in measurement are organized under four headings. First, there is the formulation of a general viewpoint toward theories of measurement. Second, there is a discussion of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of numerical measures on finite structures. Third, there is discussion of algebraic theory of error, and finally, comments on non-algebraic  theory, with some remarks about linear regression and structural models. (RP)",

Team teaching can be practiced in either self-contained or departmentalized classrooms, whether grouping is homogeneous or heterogeneous. The basic prerequisite for the successful initiation of team teaching is not classroom organization, but a realization by the teachers that the present program is not the best possible. A teaching team may consist of a variety of personnel, from teachers' aides to the professional science teacher, who usually has primary responsibility for organizing and implementing instruction. The  particular specialization of each member of the team must be taken into account in planning and utilized in instruction.

To overcome this weakness we need to re-introduce into the system a sizable component of first-hand experience designed to fulfill man's natural need to be active and productive in the affective realm. It is held that much of this esthetic experience can be gained if we attend to some of the pressing problems of our environment, natural and man-made. The introduction of necessary changes in individual and group behavior necessitates the development and implementation of a program of esthetic education which would involve persons from early infancy  through adulthood. Natural conservation and natural development can become an effective means for providing esthetic materials--a laboratory for possible esthetic experience, creative, and appreciative in scope. (BR)",

The instruments utilized were four Achievement Tests prepared by CHEMS. Each test item was analyzed to determine the concepts and/or skills necessary to give the desired response to that item. These concepts and skills were discussed during student interviews held following each of the four tests. The students interviewed earned scores that ranked among the lower 20 percent in School A or the lower 30 percent in School B. From these interviews, selected questions were chosen and were asked of those students who had earned scores which ranked within the top 20 percent in  School A and the top 30 percent in School B on two out of the first three examinations. The results showed that the students earning low scores were (1) unable to define many technical terms, (2) could not verbalize key concepts, (3) did not possess the ability to solve simple algebraic equations, (4) could not solve problems of a quantitative nature, and (5) lacked the skills necessary to interpret graphs and charts.

Within each achievement level group, S's were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups (Conference-Homework, Conference, Homework) or to a control group. Parents of Ss in the Conference-Homework group participated in parent-teacher conferences every other week for 12 weeks and received homework assignments for the Ss. Parents of Ss in the conference group attended similar conferences but were not given homework for the Ss. Ss in  the Homework group received homework assignments but their parents did not attend conferences. Among results reported were (1) Homework facilitated performance of low-and high-achieving Ss on the posttest, whereas it had the opposite effect on high-achieving Ss, and (2) High-achieving Ss showed a strong negative change in attitude, average-achieving Ss a somewhat less negative change, and low-achieving Ss a slight positive change.

        "description":"With the loss of the original religious foundation of education and its increasing secularization, there has been a shift in definition of the teacher's role. In attempting to prepare persons for assuming the responsibilities of this role, education has relied on teacher training programs as external elements of control instead of the earlier tendency to assume the recruit was controlled by internal elements of motivation and commitment. It was hypothesized that professional education programs do produce a significant change in the teacher's attitude concerning knowledge of methods to be used in his role performance, but that they do not produce a significant change in his attitude concerning teaching skills, his image of professionalization, or his spirit of professionalization.  A questionnaire to measure attitude on these four aspects of teacher role was administered to the 1955-1956 education majors (189) of Geneva and Westminster colleges (Pennsylvania) before and after professional training (student teaching semester). The 16 Factor Personality Test was also administered and personal background data collected. Factor analysis of data showed that while attitude toward the professional image, methods, and skill became more positive, attitude toward the professional spirit was negatively influenced. (Discussion of findings explores the interrelationships between the unpredicted influences of student teaching, personality and cultural factors, student disenchantment and reality shock, and the bifurcated value system of a changing culture.)

College instructors accomplish little by lecturing on how to maximize affective and cognitive growth when students first want to know, \"Should I teach? Will I be able to control children?\" Such preinstructional concerns might be met by giving them early experience as teacher aides and counseling with regard to their teaching aptitude. When 28 fifth and eighth grade teachers in six different schools were asked to describe the several children who presented their biggest problems, both elementary and secondary teachers identified more behavior problems than academic, were most concerned about the behavioral ones, and consistently  attributed problems to factors other than their own classroom teaching, i.e., to the student's ability, attitude, or home life. The starting point for principals is not to provide such teachers with \"strategies\" for maximizing student gain, but to talk with them about the topics that most urgently concern them, e.g., for beginning teachers, \"Can I send problem children to the office? Where do I get help with students who present severe learning problems?\" Teachers who receive such support will become less defensive in examining their own teaching and more willing to change their behavior to facilitate student learning.

Those tasks which relate to or involve learners in any way are \"instructions,\" and the \"educational worker\" involved with children to the extent that he has the opportunity to influence behavior in some way is a \"teacher\" whether he is aide, assistant, student teacher, tutor, full-time instructor, or specialist. Standards in the professional lives of educational workers should be focused upon and raised in four areas: (1) identification of talent, recruitment, and selection; (2) initial preparation as well as retraining, with the artificial distinction  between preservice and inservice eliminated; (3) working conditions, such as work loads, numbers of students, length of school day, planning periods, and the total school environment; and (4) retention of educational workers as careerists through raising standards of salary and benefits. The most meaningful kind of certification is \"specialty certification,\" i.e., for an area of preparation (science, mathematics, elementary education) rather than levels (provisional, standard, advanced). The \"professional\" is one who receives adequate remuneration for the services he performs--and he should be paid on the basis of experience and education, not on that of observable performance or level of responsibility.

A 5-day summer workshop was directed to the orientation of the teachers to the schools, community, and instructional program. During the school year teachers were released one-half day per month for workshops, visitation, demonstration teaching, and consultation; and they attended eight Saturday morning workshops dealing with problems in curriculum, teaching methods, and instructional materials. Each participant was teamed with an experienced &quot;helping teacher&quot; who assisted in  planning, observation, and self-evaluation, often with the use of portable videotaping equipment. Each was also assigned an advisor-consultant from the staff of a nearby college or university. Plans are underway to extend the program throughout the teachers' pretenure period. Major emphasis for second-year teachers will be commitment to a graduate program and enrollment in courses. Weekly afternoon workshops would also be offered by the district, e.g., a course in modern math methods and techniques or an independent seminar on self-directed learning.

        "description":"A 2-year investigation attempted to ascertain whether summer workshop training of elementary teachers in the use of such feedback practices as Flanders' interaction analysis, video tape techniques, and other conceptual supervisory tools would produce measurable change in the instructional behavior of their student teachers as compared to student teachers working with nonworkshop trained teachers. Pre- and posttests included the Teaching Situation Reaction Test (TSRT); a Semantic Differential on concepts of aspects of teaching; and two administrations (Real and Ideal) of the Minnesota Student Attitude Inventory (MSAI). A team of trained observers observed each student teacher six times during the semester using Hough's 23- or 32-category Observation System for Instructional  Analysis (OSIA). Results showed an increase of congruence between stated intent and instructional performance over the period of student teaching. Although the data were more suggestive than conclusive, there was slight evidence that for definable subgroups of student teachers, particular supervisory activities were related to the positive changes. (Implications are discussed, particularly with regard to the use of the instruments, and recommendations made about training designs and further research in the area. (Also included are behavioral objectives and activity descriptions for the workshops, copies of the instruments used, and a 28-item bibliography.) (JS)",

Subjects were the 69 faculty members of a suburban junior high school which serves a white middle-class community. They were white, 55 percent female and 45 percent male, with an average age of 35. They responded to a sociometric questionnaire indicating the persons (teachers or members of the professional staff) (1) whom they would seek out for advice, (2) whom they liked, and (3) whom they admired for their teaching skills. Variables studied were sex, age, and departmental affiliation. The findings reveal a strong organization along sex lines for males, who overchoose in all three categories members of their own sex. Departmental  affiliation, which also shows a strong effect on the sociometric choices in all three categories, is associated particularly with advice and liking. Age shows the weakest relationship to choice of the three variables examined. Since little is known about the social organization of the school, these and other findings of the study are potentially relevant to understanding influence processes within the school. (Author/JS)",

        "description":"The last three decades of the twentieth century will witness a drastic change in the business of providing instruction in schools and colleges. The idea of \"individualized instruction\" has been pursued in a desultory fashion by American educators for most of the century. There have been several different concepts of individualization, the most prevalent interpretation focusing on self-pacing or rate-tailoring. The impending instruction revolution will shortly bypass the simplex idea of individualizing instruction and move ahead to the more sophisticated notion of providing \"adaptive instruction\" for school and college learners, with focus on the tailoring of subject matter presentations to fit the special requirements and capabilities of each learner. Essential to the idea of  adaptive education is the means of utilizing new knowledge about individual differences among learners to bring a highly tailored instructional product to the student via computer-assisted instruction in which many identifiable learner variables are taken into account. Two concomitants to the revolution which seriously concern college faculty and administrators are adaptation to increased heterogeneity in mental ability and school preparation among college students and a drastic revision in the approach to learner evaluation and grading practices. Student evaluation would be based on the concept that an achievable mastery criterion exists for each course. (JS)",

Chapter 1 discusses the critical need for teacher education in the developing countries. Chapter 2 describes the scope of the technical assistance program with information on the number of  projects, countries involved, types of contractors, and major types of assistance. Projects operational in 1967 are described briefly by country in the four regions: Far East, Near East and South Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Chapter 3 includes an analysis of observable trends, isolating the factors which appear to underlie success or failure, and a presentation of 21 recommendations regarding overall strategy and the planning and carrying out of individual projects.

(2) The teacher interacts more directly with those pupils she rates low than with those she rates high. (3) The teacher interacts more indirectly fewer times with those pupils she rates low than with those whom she rates high. (4) The teacher uses more criticism with those pupils she rates low than with those whom she rates high. Subjects were the teacher and 33 pupils of a fourth grade class. The investigator recorded teacher-pupil interaction in the classroom two days a week for five weeks using a modified version of Flanders' Interaction Analysis in which each interaction was scored with a notation as to  which pupil(s) were involved. The teacher's rating of her pupils was measured before and after the observation period using Kilpatrick and Cantril's Self-Anchoring Ladder Rating Scale. Interaction frequencies were obtained for each pupil in each Flanders category and category group. Data were analyzed using Newman Keul Test, Kendall coefficient of of concordance, and analysis of variance to determine the existing relationship between the interaction frequencies and combined Ladder ratings of each pupil. Hypotheses 1, 2, and 4 were confirmed, indicating that observable verbal pupil-teacher interaction patterns may be an important means of communicating teacher expectancies to pupils. (JS)",

An introductory section notes the early use of Flanders' interaction analysis as a feedback tool for teachers, outlines a 1962 model in which it was used in the Temple University Laboratory on Teacher Role Behavior, and pinpoints a 1966 workshop on interaction analysis, nonverbal analysis, and microteaching as the genesis for the SKIT model, which combines all three techniques. The five steps in the SKIT model are described: (1) statement of behavioral objectives in terms of the specific teaching skill to be developed; (2) skill sessions in which the participant playing the role of  the teacher practices the classroom behavior in a microteaching context; (3) data collection (via category systems for both verbal and nonverbal interaction, video- or audiotape recordings of the microlesson, and perceptions of the student participants and of the supervisor); (4) feedback session for examining data; and (5) followup practice. An expansion of the 10-category interaction analysis system is presented which includes 29 subcategories to provide for examination of certain behaviors in greater detail. Several considerations relevant to the model's effectiveness are then discussed, e.g., teacher motivation, supervisor qualifications, advantages. (JS)",

Educational characteristics were determined through analysis of grade-point averages and class rank; IQ tests; student activity selection; program orientation (college bound or not); school problems (absences, discipline); and sex. Social-psychological characteristics were examined through scores on inventory scales measuring personal problems, psychological traits, and values.

A close association exists between school-related difficulties and problems in social-psychological adjustment.

First-year activities include a weekly seminar on campus and course work focusing on the nature of learning, the school's role in society, and special subject methods. The program is individualized to  permit additional work in the intern's academic field or in professional education. Innovative techniques and devices are utilized during weekly visits by the supervisor to provide for analysis of the intern's teaching. Supervision is provided in his subject area. The basic theme is \"humanized training through growing intern responsibilities for professional decisions.\" Presently the program employs 24 staff members for supervision alone and receives cooperation of public schools in the form of assignment of school personnel to the supervision staff. Approximately 120 interns are admitted annually; more than eight out of 10 graduates remain in teaching. (JS)",

        "description":"The concept of accountability, the notion that schools and colleges should shoulder the responsibility for the learning successes or failures of their pupils, calls for a revamping of much of our thinking about the roles of educational personnel and institutions at all levels. To create a society that is free, open, compassionate, nonracist, multicultural, and productive requires an educational system with the same characteristics. The Education Professions Development Act (EPDA) is an acknowledgement that earlier acts were ineffective in equalizing, individualizing, and humanizing instruction and that the only way to bring about change in education is by bringing about change in the people who control and operate the schools and colleges. Evaluation of the new federal programs  will be based not on the means of training personnel, but on the effectiveness of the learning that results. New emphases include preparing personnel to work with disadvantaged and handicapped; changing the system for preparing personnel; long-term projects involving partnerships among colleges and universities, state and local school systems, and the community to be served. Three EPDA priorities are programs (1) to train personnel in fields of critical shortages, (2) to train personnel to meet critical problems in the schools, and (3) to bring new kinds of people into the schools, and to demonstrate, through training, new and more effective means of utilizing personnel.

The underlying direction of the symposium was toward evaluation and certification of teachers according to specified performance criteria and the evaluation of teacher education programs according to the teaching ability of their graduates. The content of the symposium, which evolved in response to four basic tenets of the performance evaluation viewpoint  and the issues raised by each, treats four main questions: (1) What is wrong with the existing system of certification and teacher education? (2) Why propose performance evaluation? (3) How would performance evaluation work? and (4) If adopted, what steps can be taken to implement this as a total program?

Other essential characteristics of the program were its emphasis on a school-based, total-staff approach and its utilization of a teacher-facilitator in each school (a practicing teacher selected by his colleagues to serve as  coordinator). Among various findings of the study (related to teacher learning, teacher effectiveness, individual differences in teachers and teaching styles, as well as to the relative effectiveness of this particular approach to professional continuing education) were: that a practicing teacher makes an excellent trainer of teachers, that changing the behavior of a group is often easier than changing the behavior of an individual, and, more generally, that the impotence of much inservice effort is attributable not so much to teacher resistance as to the ineffectiveness of educational systems used.

The first of six courses in the minor brings insight into man's creative nature and stimulates personal discovery in students. Four successive departmental courses deal with the theory and practice of developing the creative capacity in children through music, art, dance, and drama. University students work with children in three of these courses, arranging experiences which nuture children's problem-solving abilities while providing opportunities for success for each child. A final course continues laboratory experience as students apply what they have learned to create and teach a  curriculum of inquiry in regular classrooms. Throughout the minor, small-group meetings facilitate personal inquiry into the teaching-learning process. Among the unique and innovative features of the minor are: (1) its interdepartmental nature, (2) team teaching by faculty from several disciplines, (3) continuous laboratory experiences over a period of several semesters, (4) flexible grouping to reach diverse goals, (5) functional use of student planning, and (6) interinstitutional cooperation.

The study updates a 1964 survey (ED 025 449) with an attempt to identify any discernible trends. A few more than 200 schools were identified by both the 1964 and 1969 surveys, the total under college control 15 fewer in 1969. An average of eight schools per year were closed, with two a year started or reopened, half of them starting in the last 2 years. As in 1964, elementary schools and combined elementary and junior high schools comprise about 60 percent of all the laboratory schools; a preponderance of nursery and  kindergarten programs exists in the schools opened. An obvious contrast is apparent in the announced school purposes: in 1964 provision for student teaching experiences was the primary objective, whereas the principal aim by 1969 was to serve as a center for observation and prestudent teaching experiences with increased emphasis upon research, experimentation, and inservice education.

Objective-type questionnaires were used in this indepth study of a selected sample of provisionally certificated teachers and the administrators who interact with them daily. The questionnaires covered 26 areas of inquiry and were designed to deal with such questions as: \"Why did these persons enter teaching without a regular certificate? How are they treated on the  job? What are their future ambitions with regard to teaching?\" Section 2 of this report presents data provided by teachers; section 3, data provided by their superintendents; and section 4, a summary and analysis of the results. Among these results are: (1) that the highest degree of concensus between superintendents and teachers was in their feeling that a primary reason for the lack of a regular certificate is the fact that teaching is often a late or secondary career choice, and (2) that the most apparent conflicts of opinion concerned the status and the job efficiency of provisionally certificated personnel.

The two-fold purpose of the study summarized in this report was to discover ways to assist these provisionally certificated teachers to obtain a regular certificate and to reduce the need for provisional certification in the future. The two groups of people most directly affected by certification policies of the State of Illinois (school superintendents and provisionally certificated teachers) were asked to respond to a questionnaire which asked the following four open-ended questions: (1) What could the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction do to assist provisionally certificated teachers in  obtaining regular certificates? (2) What could the teacher preparation institutions do? (3) What specific courses would be most useful? and (4) What alternatives to the current certification system would you suggest? Among the major findings of the study, based on analysis and classification of responses, were: that views of both teachers and superintendents were highly convergent; that fulfillment of the student teaching requirement is perceived as the number one problem; and that improved counseling programs, increased flexibility in student teaching and graduation requirements, and greater interinstitutional cooperation in both immediate and long-range planning are essential.

Its purpose is to delineate some of the issues and alternatives in meeting idea and information needs required for effective personnel preparation programs, and to examine their particular relevance to collegiate institutions. After summarizing the rationale for information systems, in general, the author develops the concept of the collegiate information system (including its vital operational base--the Information System Center) and summarizes a set of specifications and recommendations for its effective operation and utilization. Particular emphasis is placed  on the relationship between the Information System Center and (1) trainers of school personnel, and (2) other information systems (especially those operant at the local school district level, since they are likely to be most directly involved in collegiate-initiated preparation programs, as well as in the continuing education of inservice personnel). Although the 18 recommendations of this paper may be implemented perhaps more immediately than those of the information component of the Michigan State University elementary teacher education model, the author recommends that the latter be considered carefully in overall university planning of information systems.

        "description":"This paper projects present trends and capabilities into the future, conjectures about the educational implications of these trends, and proposes some possible responses for those involved in the preparation of school personnel. It is simultaneously an illustration and an application of the process of \"futurism\" and its increasing relevance to systems-based educational planning. After introducing the rationale for the paper, the author presents a series of 18 charts designed to serve as tentative process-models which, if extended and refined, could serve as a basis for responding to, and perhaps even influencing, the needs of the future. Each chart focuses on one of 18 societal trends (e.g., \"Increasing Youthfulness of the Population\") and outlines its possible consequence in  terms of (1) Educational Outcomes, (2) Impact on School Personnel, (3) Impact on Preparation Programs, and (4) Illustrative Responses. After presenting a synthesis and discussion of the content of these charts, the author identifies and responds to eight basic questions which anticipate the demands of this projected future (e.g., \"What values should school personnel hold and what related traits should they exhibit?\" and \"What personal-social-physical deficiencies and limitations should be remediated?\") and urges that an active and continuous dialogue be addressed to such questions. In his conclusion, the author stresses two possible and opposite directions in which we may move--one based on an obliteration of democratic values, the other on a fuller realization of them. (JES)",

The first part of this three-part document defines development as \"the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research and directed to the production of useful materials, devices, systems, and methods; such work includes the design, testing, and improvement of prototypes and processes.\" The second part identifies and discusses some essential differences between educational research and product development (in terms of orientation, role of the individual, visible results,  and codification systems) and some essential relationships between the two. Part 3 identifies and explains ten steps involved in the systematic approach to the development of an instructional product that has demonstrative effectiveness and represents a solution to a crucial educational need. These steps are discussed under the following headings: (1) formulation, (2) instructional specifications, (3) development of evaluation instruments, (4) development of learning materials, (5) pilot test of prototype materials, (6) learning materials revision, (7) product integration or packaging, (8) product field test stage, (9) product revision, and (10) product review and process evaluation.

The second composition study indicated that neither more writing nor intensive correction improves the quality of student composition and pointed to the need for more research into possible factors affecting writing skills.

Teachers recognized such problems as deletion of final consonant stops (/d/ and /t/) and the use of double negatives, but failed to recognize the language system of lower socioeconomic groups as an alternate, workable means of communication. The study revealed the teachers' naive attitudes toward language and their need for workshop education in language and cultural relativity to develop understanding and respect for different social systems. Such teacher education  could then be applied in the classroom, e.g., by the use of \"switching devices\" in which the prestige dialect is presented as one of many possibilities of expression. A negative or corrective attitude in the teaching of language arts serves merely to inhibit the disadvantaged child and to close off teacher-student communication. (MF)",

        "description":"Although books of solely black literature are being published in abundance, an anthology representing both black and white authors is needed, for only through including the literary traditions of all Americans can the national experience be accurately reflected. The origins of Afro-American poetry are found in the late 18th century, and with the &quot;Harlem Renaissance&quot; of the 1920's, black poets developed not only unique themes but the beginnings of a self-conscious movement. Of the two great black poets produced in this century, Robert Hayden does not limit himself to black themes or to a separate black critical standard, whereas Leroi Jones is seeking a &quot;black criterion&quot; for his work. The bulk of black poetry, however, still in its infancy, is frequently guilty of tedious thematic  repetition and loss of artistic control. The objectivity and distance provided by Western criticism can benefit the black writer. By grappling with the resultant tension between subjective vision and objective evaluation black artists can develop and mature. (MF)",

        "description":"This study proposed (1) to verify that students of normal ability could learn structural and transformational grammar concepts presented in the format of linear programing, and (2) to test whether the students would apply the concepts in compositions so that their writing showed progress toward maturity. Participating in the experiment were 207 eighth-grade students in two schools. One hundred students studied one programed lesson per day for 22 days; the rest of the students served as the control group. Comparison of scores on objective pre- and post-tests showed experimental students demonstrating a significant grasp of the concepts and an increase in sentence-combining skills. Other results showed females scoring higher than males, able students learning more than the less  able, and students learning more in one school (upper-middle economic level) than in the lower-middle school. For the second part of the study, 1000-word writing samples were obtained from all students before and after the experiment, and the papers of 114 students were randomly selected for examination. Results showed that experimental students increased their use of subordination and, furthermore, that students in the upper-middle school advanced more than the other school's students in their use of subordination.

        "description":"To determine the effects of oral sentence-structure exercises upon student writing, a 1-year experiment was conducted with two randomly matched fourth-grade classes of approximately equal size, one control class and one experimental class. The experimental group regularly completed exercises designed to teach students to produce sentences incorporating (1) \"who\" and \"which\" adjectival clauses or elements derived from these clauses, (2) adverbial clauses in initial and final position, and (3) nominalizations in the subject and predicate. Written exercises based on the oral drills were completed at the end of each class period. Before and after each of the two semester-long experimental phases, tests were administered in which students wrote a 30-minute impromptu composition about  a short film. Results showed that students in the experimental group wrote more words in less time, used more of the practiced sentence structures, and used a greater proportion of complex sentences than did control group students. Consequently, the oral drills and supplementary written exercises were concluded to have favorably affected the writing of fourth graders. (Tables of findings are included.) (JM)",

The themes of 135 eighth graders on narrative and expository topics were collected for 6 weeks, one theme per week. Samples of at least 1000 words were obtained from each student, and the criteria of Hunt (1965) were used to determine which sentences and T-units to include for tabulation. Two 500-word divisions of the 1000-word samples were made and two comparisons between the divisions were carried out. The first comparison involved splitting the sample at the sentence or T-unit nearest the 500-word midpoint. The second comparison was between the odd pages and the even pages. Adjective, adverb, and noun clauses occurred frequently  enough to be of importance and correlated .35, .31, and .08, respectively, in the first-half/second-half samples, and .46, .42, and .26 in the odd/even page samples. The five synopsis scores (clause length, clauses per T-unit, T-unit length, T-units per sentence, and sentence length) correlated .48, .22, .56, .48, and .62 between first-half and second-half respectively, and .69, .54, .74, .65, and .77 between odd-page/even-page samples.

        "description":"Since linguists have been concerned with a variety of approaches to the teaching of reading, their linguistic theories and recommended practices should become familiar to teachers of American Indian students. A number of studies have evolved from the work of Leonard Bloomfield and Charles Fries who felt that reading comprehension was a passive activity dependent upon oral language skills. To Bloomfield, the most important of these skills was learning the sound-symbol correspondence, based upon a belief in writing as a systematic representation of speech; for Fries, the importance lay in learning to discriminate visually between whole patterns or units of meaning. A subsequent work by Richard L. Venezky considered reading as translation from written symbols to sound, and studies  by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle emphasized a systematic phonemic approach. Although linguists are beginning to deal with the practical problems of teaching reading, the variety of linguistic approaches, with often contradictory results, suggests the need for further fundamental reading research combining the findings of linguists, psychologists, and educators.

Although there are many advantages to an overhead projector, it is limited because only a short passage of a composition can be shown at one time, large print must be used, and the materials must be read line by line from the screen.

The pairs were observed in a two-party communication situation which involved the exchange of descriptive information in order to identify similar pictures. Results showed that middle socioeconomic class pairs were significantly more accurate in the picture identification than were the lower class pairs and that white pairs were significantly more accurate than Negro pairs. Observed differences could not be attributed to differences in IQ nor to differences in amount of verbal discussion required to complete the task. Differences between SES  groups were partly attributed to the middle-class groups' ability to communicate more critical attributes about the pictures. These differences in language usage which are related to the accurate exchange of information have important implications for the design and content of language arts curricula.

        "description":"The college English department is praised for its genuinely human concerns for student and faculty needs, participatory administration, and curriculum planning approaches. Contrasted variously with this model is the traditional, hierarchical department of English criticized for its unrelinquished emphasis on literature per se and a dearth of forward-looking pedagogical thinking. Also criticized is the California movement toward educational strategies based exclusively on behavioral objectives, as the Planning/Programming/Budgeting System (PPBS) law will require in 1970 on a statewide basis in all subject areas. Extensive discussion of junior college English department philosophies and practices ranges from \"community\", interpersonal relations, symbolic behavior and self-esteem,  intellectual encounters, literature, communication problems, teacher preparation, and the training-education dichotomy to finance, program evaluation, model programs, negative national educational patterns, teacher autonomy, dialogue, communication, and responsible militancy. The author offers a seven-point program to help build a milieu of teaching and learning based on mutual trust and eleven topics for further investigation by English departments. (RL)",

Despite prospects for opportunities in higher education and for advancement in career determination, several problems arise: (1) nonprofessionals may not be capable of upward mobility, (2) if capable, they may cease to be a communication link between the classes, (3) they might have negative attitudes toward other poor persons, and (4) those selected (through the elimination of the less competent) as nonprofessionals might actually be those less in need of jobs. Although further research is needed to solve these problems, the kinds of  opportunities provided for nonprofessionals by these programs will motivate them toward greater career mobility. Also, some of the problems may be avoided if the nonprofessional tasks are on several levels of competence, each involving different career roles and expectations.

The student teachers, in contrast to controls in the group from which the student teachers were selected, maintained favorable attitudes toward  teaching in the inner city, and they claimed to have benefited in practice teaching from their tutoring experience.

A stratified random sampling technique insured adequate levels of each dependent variable. Administered within a two-month period were: the paragraph meaning and word reading sections of the Primary I and Primary II levels of the 1964 Stanford Achievement Test; four subtests from Cattell's Culture Fair Intelligence Test; and the Bialer-Cromwell Children's Locus of Control Scale. Analysis using a 2x2x2 factorial design found that, among the independent variables, only the main effect of socioeconomic level  (SEL) and the interaction of SEL and race effects on locus of control scores were significant. The sole significant relationship between locus of control and reading scores was that white upper-middle SEL subjects having higher external scores had lower reading scores. Intelligence quotient was related to reading, but not to external scores in both SEL groups. The low reliability obtained using the Locus of Control scale indicates need for further development of this scale. (JM)",

        "description":"This study deals with selected ethnographic and other methods used in research on Afro-American communities in the United States. After a review of the conclusions of psychologists on Afro-American culture, it is contended that the best method of enquiry is that of ethnography, and that, even though the ethnographic method has been hitherto used, the studies completed have been partial ethnographic studies because the researchers have neither lived in the community studied nor studied a sufficiently large area. The project described in this paper is that of studying a black ghetto as an entire community, with observation from multiple perspectives. The researchers participated fully in the activities of the community, in exclusive black organizations and associations, and  experienced with their neighbors the impact of major American institutions: the school, health services, and police; the observations relating to these are described in detail. Tentative conclusions reached include the following: the rejection of traits and complexes such as the so-called \"culture of poverty\" and \"lower-class culture,\" a view of Afro-American culture as complex and internally heterogeneous and of Afro-Americans as bicultural, and the pervasive nature of institutional racism.

The research focused on the first year of school desegregation, exploring academic, social, behavioral, and attitudinal characteristics (1) in the children transferred from Jones, (2) in a racially mixed group from Mack School (with no change in school setting), and (3) in predominately white receiving-school children. At the end of a year of desegregated schooling, half the transfer pupils showed 5 or more points gain in IQ, and 37 percent showed normal or greater gains in reading. However, gains made by the transfer group were smaller, on the whole,  than gains made by the other two groups. Forty Negro transfer pupils (still in elementary receiving schools), studied in a limited follow-up 2 years later, were at best holding their own academically, relative to national norms. There was no evidence to suggest that the normal progress of white receiving-school children was interrupted by the transfer. (Author)",

The specification of the theoretical model is inadequate, and without the theoretical framework to provide order, and a rationale for the large number of variables, there is no way to interpret the statistical results. Even in those instances where the Coleman Report makes clear the justification for the use of a variable in the regression model, the criterion used to assess the statistical performance of the variable is inappropriate. In order to suggest a more meaningful approach to the problem of measuring determinants of educational achievement for policy purposes, the role of a variable in affecting objectives must--and can--be  interpretable in the context of a proper model; further, when such a model is in the form of a regression equation, an appropriately scaled regression coefficient is the most useful statistic to measure the importance of the variable for the purposes of policy action.

Although the majority did not condone violence as a means of social protest, the sampling indicated a widespread dissatisfaction, distrust, and bitterness among the high school students.

It has involved private financing, intra-city bussing, and the initiative and participation of working class ghetto residents. Attitudinal and achievement tests on the children participating in the Project Exodus in grades three to eight, were obtained at the following times: the fall of 1967 and the spring of 1968. Similar data were collected on a comparison group of children not enrolled in Exodus and attending predominantly black schools in their neighborhood. Collection of change data was completed for 151 children. It was found  that the children in Exodus showed greater improvement in change in achievement test scores, although they did not show greater fate control. Further data analysis and research are being done to try to more clearly locate the factors related to improvement in both the affective and cognitive areas for Exodus and non-Exodus children.

        "description":"National goals in social welfare are basically concerned with translating the promise of American life into a closer approximation to reality for the aged, the dependent, the disabled, the disorganized, and the unemployed. Administering social welfare programs may create as many as 400,000 career openings in the '70's, 175,000 of which will represent opening s for junior college or high school graduates. Most of the new social welfare programs, being mainly concerned with problems of the central cities of large metropolitan areas, can be expected to emphasize vocational education in these areas. A realistic goal for vocational education in social work would be 500 to 1,000 graduates a year in each of the nation's major metropolitan areas. Associate degree programs leading to  employment in social work occupations must expand to meet this need, while existing home economics programs might serve the purpose of the high schools. Advancement in research and planning along these lines would also provide meaningful opportunities for employment for many young persons in the \"left out\" groups in American society.

        "description":"School dropouts occur most often among boys in the 10th grade of academic courses. Evidence suggests that they and others who finish high school would have had more personal satisfaction and value from a vocational-technical curriculum. Occupational preparation, if provided in schools, can make students ready for successful introduction to employment or to post high school training, thus giving these years more value to the student while lowering the rate of high school dropouts. A concentrated program of occupational guidance beginning early in elementary grades, can impart accurate information about many fields of work and nurture positive attitudes of respect and admiration for labor. One of the most comprehensive curriculum plans for such a program is that adopted by the  Michigan Department of Education and reproduced here in the Appendix. It proceeds from this start in the early grades to a stimulation of interest in junior high and a training in high school, not in the narrow restricted specialities, but rather in broad occupational clusters. Tools for increasing the effectiveness of such a program of occupational preparation include: (1) occupational guidance and testing centers, (2) on-the-job orientation of counselors, (3) advisory committees for vocational-technical programs, and (4) expanding the use of present vocational-technical facilities.

The survey estimated that over 111,000 persons were employed in the country's correctional institutions and agencies (excluding jails) and 68 percent of these were employed by institutions. These people administer  programs to an estimated 1,115,000 adult and juvenile offenders operating with an annual budget exceeding one billion dollars. Recommendations are given for recruitment, training, and inservice development of correctional employees. Numerous charts and tables are included in the report. (BC)",

Data were obtained from usable returns by 763 (59 percent) counselors. The problems were categorized into nine major categories (job preparation, personality variables, vocational behavior, school programs, discriminatory factors, family background, community factors, factors inherent in job, and military obligation), and 50 sub-categories. Problems enumerated by YOC counselors and by a purposive sample of vocational educators (Garbin, et al., 1967) have a correlation of .61 (Spearman) which increases the probability that these are real problems facing youth. Counselors recommended that  schools provide better occupational information, more vocational guidance, and additional courses teaching basic prevocational skills.

In 1953, public 2-year colleges in New York State were encouraged to get rid of their 1-year vocational curriculums and to confine themselves to 2-year curriculums to prepare technicians. But the 1963 Vocational Education Act seemed to be a clear mandate for 2-year colleges to undertake work of the less-than-2-year variety in vocational education and, in 1965, the State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees, on Chancellor Gould's recommendation, approved in principle expansion into sub-technical areas. The official position within SUNY since  then has been that vocational education must enjoy parity of esteem with university-parallel education and technical education in the public 2-year colleges. Vocational faculty and students can and must co-exist on the campuses. The teacher's relative status should be dependent upon his knowledge of his field and his teaching competence--no matter how either was acquired. The sons and daughters of all taxpayers must have equal treatment as students. And who is to say that the vocational program student will not return later to work toward an associate degree, a bachelor's degree, or even higher degrees? (JK)",

During the fall 1968 semester, 239 freshmen of five City University of New York (CUNY) colleges received 1,801 hours of assistance from student tutors drawn from CUNY. During the spring 1969 semester, 142 freshmen received 2,042 hours of tutoring. A coordinator employed part-time in each of the five colleges trained and guided the student tutors. Preliminary empirical assessment of the program, involving the use of a control group of freshmen of the year preceding the project and professional judgments led to conclusions including the following: (1) Tutoring appears to have a positive impact on the academic achievement of nursing  students, (2) The greater the extent and/or duration of the tutoring, the greater the impact, (3) Long-term tutoring tends to benefit all ability levels; short term tutoring benefits the better students to a greater degree, (4) The source of tutors is less important than their training and supervision, (6) Program implementation requires sustained work on the part of a professional person, and (7) Tutoring increases ego strength.

It was intended that vocational home economics teachers combine the objectives of the guide with their own class objectives, or in the absence of consumer education in the curriculum, use the guide for the initiation of a new program or unit of work. The guide was based on the results of a mailed questionnaire sent to all vocational home economics teachers in West Virginia during the 1968-69 spring semester. A total of 116 responses (69 percent) were returned from 168 vocational home economics teachers. The important findings in the study were: (1) Most vocational home economics teachers in West Virginia do not include consumer education in their programs as a separate unit  or course, (2) Most vocational home economics teachers were interested in developing the consumer education curriculum, and (3) A curriculum guide is needed to indicate subject matter to be taught in consumer education.

Respondents were 1968 New York State secondary agricultural graduates who had completed 2 years of farm production and management, conservation, agricultural mechanization, or ornamental horticulture, and their employers. Some findings were: (1) 41 percent of graduates were quickly employed, 30 percent entered college, 1 percent took other post secondary training, 27 percent entered military service,  1 percent were unemployed, (2) 53 percent of employed graduates worked in the area for which they were trained (the range was 63 percent for farm production and management graduates to 30 percent for graduates of some of the other areas), (3) Graduates found first-year employment primarily through use of informal job-seek methods, (4) Graduates received adequate training for the agricultural knowledges and abilities needed in their jobs, and (5) Most graduates had a positive image of farming and a slightly higher positive image of off-farm related agricultural industry.

Each participant submitted a projected plan for interagency cooperation and coordination in exploring community needs and  existing programs as a basis for initiating and/or expanding homemaker-home health aide services and training programs. Conclusions drawn from follow-up and evaluation indicate that the greatest progress as a result of the workshop was initiation of inter- and intra-agency dialogue and contacts.

For the purpose of this report, the small college library is one serving undergraduate instructional needs as distinguished from the university library, serving the interests of serious research. The first chapter of the report seeks to define clearly the relationship of library service to college instruction. This approach indicates the nature and magnitude of changes which have taken place in library service and demonstrates why the role of the library has become a central issue. The second chapter examines the nature of technology and its relation to library operation. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the nature of library  collections with a view to identifying some level of commonality of problems and collections, and to identify the advantages and disadvantages of major adaptations of technology. Chapters 5 and 6 look at special problems in the areas of bibliographic access and physical access. The report concludes with a summary which identifies areas requiring further investigation, and a series of recommendations. The primary recommendation of the report is the package library, built on the core of disciplines, and common to all colleges offering the same program. (Author/ON)",

Subjects were 79 4-year-olds representing a wide range of ability levels. Intervention effects were evaluated at the end of the preschool year and also, at the end of the kindergarten year. Follow-up data were collected at the end of first grade for three of the programs. Preliminary results were differential and encouraging for the more structured programs. The ameliorative preschool provided a framework for the subsequent investigation of related variables: effects of initiating the program with 3-year-old, low IQ  children, and the feasibility of using paraprofessional staff as teachers. Included in this report are studies undertaken to provide instructional programs for children under 3 years and to find techniques to train mothers in home intervention. (MS)",

The two groups represented extremes of social sensitivity: highly sensitive and least sensitive to the feelings of others. Teachers read aloud 10 short stories to which the students responded by writing an undirected response and by completing a questionnaire, a check list, and a special scale. Analysis of the students' responses revealed that adolescents tended to notice only the most obvious points of a story and to express superficial concepts; they did not welcome new values or concepts. Although the highly sensitive adolescents wrote more full responses, most students had difficulty  in expressing significant opinions about literature. Other data suggested that sex and socioeconomic status affected sensitivity but intelligence did not, and that the least sensitive adolescents were more concerned with money, clothes, and themselves, and tended to resist more strongly the controls of society. (A concluding section draws on the findings to make practical suggestions for the teaching of literature.) (LK)",

        "description":"The principal aims of this study were to identify, select, analyze, and describe educational programs for culturally disadvantaged children from preschool through grade 12 which had yielded measured benefits of cognitive achievement. A literature search (mainly through ERIC) and mail inquiries followed by telephone consultations constituted the identification and selection process for the programs. Sixteen programs finally selected (situated in 12 urban areas in eight states) were visited on site, and as a result, five programs were eliminated. This report thus contains the descriptions of the remaining 11 programs, all meeting the criteria that no program was included unless data available indicated that pupils in the program had achieved statistically significantly greater  gains on standardized tests than had controls, or had improved at a rate better than national norms. Programs described were mostly inner-city projects for black children, but two served mainly Mexican-Americans; descriptions relate to the nature, operation, and results of each program. The report also includes detailed descriptions of the methods and procedures employed in the study. For earlier studies of 21 similar programs in two sections, Parts I and II, see ED 023 776 and ED 023 777, respectively. Programs described in the present report are also individually reported; see UD 010 069 to-078, and 010 114. (RJ)",

The essential purposes of the model are (1) to  improve instruction and learning through procedures which emphasize individualization; (2) to improve the quantity and quality of meaningful personal contact between faculty and students; and (3) to utilize modern technology in the accomplishment of these ends. A major feature of the project is the cybernetic systems model designed to interrelate specified behavioral objectives with effective methods of achieving them and to enable continuing refinement and development of the program specifications during the process of implementation.

This makes evaluation impossible. Evaluation is sometimes a description of a program and often objectives are not stated in precise behavioral terms which would serve as a base for evaluation and which would dictate the program. The document recommends the creation of a viable system and the establishment of active leadership to direct the program. It presents four working papers which deal with the following aspects: an analysis of the situation as it exists, the proposal of a system for a state-wide Title 1 program, evaluation, and  an explanation on why and how the writer views the system as realistic and possible.

First, the listening area was surveyed to find how many senior citizens had radios at their disposal. Of 227 potential enrollees, 133 were initially enrolled in a regular listening program. Series of tapes for broadcasts were obtained from the Institute of Lifetime Learning, Long Beach, California, which specializes in preparing tapes for the aging. Six separate series of thirteen lessons each were presented through radio broadcasts, and then  reactions were solicited in informal interviews with the enrollees. Evaluative comments were not entirely favorable, and some of the listeners felt that the programs were not directed to their interest group. Reactions were favorable to a series on music and to a &quot;Talkback&quot; series (guest speakers who answered telephoned questions). The project was found to have significant positive impact, however, and proposals are laid forth for its continuance. (nl)",

The Law on the Unified Socialist Educational System, passed in 1965, introduced a comprehensive reorganization and standardization of educational and vocational training at all levels. The book contains details of early training efforts; some prerequisites for adult educators; 12 steps in a two-year plan for the folk high schools; specific steps for training adult educators in the upgrading system; the training of cultural workers; and the development of theory and research. The 12 steps include: knowledge of subject matter and of the foundations of scientific  socialism; continuing education; exchange of teachers and of teaching materials; and assistance to young instructors. Training for the upgrading system emphasizes systematic and historical adult education, specialized didactics and methodology of adult education, and research. The training of cultural workers focuses on an extensive five-year program, while the research section examines the state of research, which is at a rudimentary stage. (nl)",

Of students in two- and three-hour courses who submitted one lesson, over 70% went on to complete the course. Grade point averages (GPA) were not related to length of time taken to complete the course. The highest GPA's were earned by those who completed in one month; the next highest were earned by those who took over two years to complete the  course.

Problems most often noted on questionnaires had been lack of funds, revenue, and industry, followed by sanitation, streets and highways, water and sewers, and law enforcement. The followup survey covered such points as attendance patterns, program evaluation, participant satisfaction, and scheduling.  Observations and participant feedback suggested two major outcomes of the seminars: greater awareness by participants of the need for more seminar type training to upgrade their professional service; and increased understanding of the ramifications of, and opportunities presented by, problems that confront local officials.

The comparative few who recognized a need for inservice training stressed such concerns as courses in English, and adult education trends and innovations. In general, the most helpful program activities were use of audiovisual aids, blackboard work by teachers, classroom illustrations by teachers, and class discussions. Lectures, home work, and workbooks were of little use. The dropout rate was the leading problem. Teachers' suggestions for improving classes were few. Pretest and posttest results gave significant indication that adults are really learning. Moreover, in view of  the lack of testing tailored to adults, the extent of learning may have been underestimated. (ly)",

        "description":"This 1968 study explored role perceptions of junior Four H leaders and identified some factors in role performance. Hypotheses were tested relating to their role expectations, performance and self evaluation of preparedness for the role. Questionnaires were administered to 279 junior leaders, 121 adult leaders, and 36 Extension agents in 15 Tennessee counties. These were among the findings: (1) adult leaders felt that junior leaders should perform more tasks than Extension agents felt they should; (2) the three groups disagreed as to the relative importance of the five task groups, or roles, of junior leaders; (3) task expectations, task performance, and self perceived preparedness were significantly related, especially for number and frequency of tasks performed; (4) sex and  junior Four H club meeting attendance were significantly related to junior leaders' role perceptions; (5) high task performance and sense of preparedness were both related to such characteristics as membership in clubs other than Four H, attendance at Four H events, offices held in Four H, attendance at junior Four H meetings, time spent working with adult leaders, and parental involvement past or present.

Although there is an increase in the number of part time students at most campuses each year, in many instances evening credit courses are not offered in a pattern which will allow enrollees to make consistent progress toward an undergraduate degree. The state-operated campuses enrolled 1,758 students in the fall of 1968. There was a slight increase in off-campus credit enrollments during 1967 and 1968 due largely to a greater use of technology. In the fall of 1968, 982 students were enrolled for credit in the Independent Study (Correspondence) Program. Currently, new enrollments are being added at an approximate rate of 225 a month and in December, 1969, 4,821 students were  enrolled in this program at the 14 participating campuses. The first survey of non-credit programing in continuing education conducted in July 1968 for the 1967-68 academic year showed that 121,563 persons attended 1,786 short courses, institutes, and seminars. A similar study completed in July 1969 indicated that 2,439 short courses, institutes, and seminars were offered during the 1968-1969 academic year with 138,621 persons enrolled. (nl)",

Of the 352 randomly selected homes included in the sample, 268 returned completed questionnaires. Of the 268 72% selected one or more of the 41 activities listed. When asked to itemize academic credit courses desired, only 20% expressed an interest. The noncredit classes were identified under the headings of arts and crafts, sports, culture, and skills. The activities mentioned most frequently were bowling and knitting. Three out of every 10 respondents indicated that at least one adult in their family was interested in one or the other, or both  activities. Other instructional series desired by at least 20% of the families included Christmas decorations, flower arrangements, refinishing furniture, and upholstering furniture. The favorable response to the noncredit courses listed in the questionnaire served as an indicator of at least possible initial success with a planned on-going adult continuing education program. In addition, there seems to be sufficient enrollment predicted in a wide range of noncredit classes to justify establishing other courses. (author/nl)",

Data were collected from 52 senior nurses from Evansville, Indiana, and 43 from Indianapolis. All participants were administered the Civil Defense Adult Education Attitude Scale and the Civil Defense Knowledge Scale as a pre-test and post-test of attitudes and knowledge under investigation. The experimental group comprised the Evansville students who received the 12 hour PFS. They had never  participated in a Civil Defense course. Both scales were content validated through expert opinion, and construct validated empirically by using known populations. In addition, a measure of reliability was established for each scale. Differences in pre-test data were also compiled, tested, and evaluated. Prior to the treatment, both groups exhibited a favorable attitude toward Civil Defense adult education. Thus it appears that among the student nurses of this study, the PFS course was not necessary to bring about favorable changes. (author/nl)",

Background data were gathered by a structured questionnaire; unstructured interviews elicited what participants thought they had learned. Of the total sample, 91% perceived changes in their own behavior; 76% saw changes in knowledge, 62% in attitude, and 76% in practice. Over half perceived change in all three areas. The greatest change was perceived by those who were younger, married, had less education (academic and post basic nursing), less nursing experience, and were employed in the larger agencies. Little or no change was noted by those who had more education and experience  and were employed with smaller agencies. Learning correlated slightly with age, basic academic education, post basic nursing education, nursing experience, and size of employing agency. It was concluded that the institute was effective for the three kinds of learning provided that the credibility of respondents was acceptable. The evaluation method (with the above proviso) was adequate for indicating change, but not for showing relationships to certain socioeconomic data. (author/ly)",

The first half of the paper discusses several premises: The goal of evaluation is to use program judgments in the program decision making process. Criteria are essential to judgment and determining the type of criteria that is relevant is an important part of the evaluation process. Criteria may function at various levels of specificity. Effectiveness of evaluation rests mainly with the quality of the criteria used; and efficiency in evaluation is determined by the evaluator's competency in developing criteria. The second half of the paper asserts that criteria are not adequately understood and used. Reasons suggested for this include: (1) too narrow a concept of evaluation; (2)  too great an emphasis on information and program description; (3) the wish to avoid decision making; (4) the wish to escape challenge by avoiding subjectivity; and (5) poorly defined guides to data interpretation.

Utilizing Hall's Professionalization Scales and some background scales to measure attitudinal and structural attributes of professionalization, an analysis of variance technique and a chi square analysis were used to determine the difference between the extent of professionalization of three groups of administrators. Findings revealed no significant change over time between the three groups at the .05 significance level. The average scores in this study were higher than those reported in previous studies using the Professionalization Scales with other occupations. These  unexpected findings were viewed as attributable, at least in part, to characteristics of the field of higher adult education during the past decade which mitigated against further professionalization of the occupation. Using a supplementary questionnaire, additional comparisons were made between 93 respondents and a sample of the 143 non-respondents to the initial questionnaire. Differences were not significant.

Two problems are identified: the lack of theoretical framework in studying problems, and the limiting of statistical analysis to univariate techniques. The process of theory development is divided into: (a) definition of concepts; (b) establishment of variable relationships; (c) specification of causal ordering of variables; (d) identification or determination of relationships among variables within the same causal system; and (e) estimation of change. The use of regression analysis and models in the final phase is discussed, as is also functional path analysis to determine  whether the proposed set of interpretations is consistent throughout.

The population studied included 360 ABE participants and 34 teachers in North Carolina community colleges and technical institutes, and 30 nonparticipants. Before, and after about 60 hours of instruction, participants and controls were tested for educational achievement and for changes in internal-external control, anomia, work beliefs, and attitudes toward education, law and economic  conservatism. Preliminary examination of data shows gains and loss in achievement by both groups, positive and negative changes in self-concept, decrease in anomia, improved attitudes toward education and work, and improvement in internal-external control. Testing instruments were discovered to be not sufficiently precise for accurate measurement. It was concluded that a longitudinal study would be feasible if the inadequacies of current instrumentation can be corrected. (author/pt)",

        "description":"The objective of this study was to explicate the concept \"involvement\" so as to determine: (1) its range of meanings in both ordinary language and in the area of program development in adult education; and (2) how the range of meanings was used in empirical studies of a causal nature. The first task provided the basis for determining the internal validity of the concept (its meanings); the latter task, the external validity or relational character with other concepts. Linguistic analysis was used to provide a range of meanings in ordinary usage; then analysis was carried over to the uses of the concept in the professional literature of adult education. Secondly, the uses of the concept as found in empirical studies of the behavioral sciences were grouped according to common  criterion variables and studied to determine the validity of common trends. Two major senses of involvement were isolated: the minimal sense--physical/cognitive activity--and a strong sense--an affective relationship. Findings revealed that minimal sense of the concept had been widely used in postulated hypotheses; supported the minimal sense of involvement as related to positive affective changes, desired behavioral changes, and certain ability changes; and did not support relationship between involvement (minimal sense) and greater acquisition of information.

This essay suggests a rationale and strategy for developing a research based body of theory, indigenous to adult education and of practical utility to practitioners. Central to the reality upon which such theory must be constructed is a presupposition that an individual constructs meaning through an active process of interaction with others and directs his behavior accordingly.

(Of 638 farmers interviewed in 1962, 387 were still operating their farms in 1966.) The dependent variable was an index of 19 recommended farm practices, of which about half were being used in 1962. Twenty-one independent variables were used to measure social participation, personal characteristics, and structural factors of the farm operation. Statistical analysis in 1962 indicated that only four of these 24 variables (residence, farm machinery, participation in farm organizations, participation in agricultural extension programs) were significantly related to the dependent variable. In 1966, the mean index showed an increase of two practices.  Four independent variables (age, residence, farm machinery, participation in agricultural extension programs) proved significant in 1966, accounting for 45% of the explained variance in farm practices.

Modification scores differed significantly by information sources (status) and dogmatism. General tendencies suggest that high dogmatism subjects receiving information from a subordinate source changed their minds less; that they  make more modifications when a peer source is involved; and that more modifications were made by subjects receiving from a peer source, with high dogmatic subjects making slightly more such changes than low dogmatic subjects.

Achievement was based on levels of occupation, income, and education. A series of 17 questions covered peer relationships, determination of ability to learn, critical incidents in one's education, and other aspects of anxiety. Achievement correlated positively, and anxiety negatively, with levels of participation. Anxiety toward continuing education stemmed, not from the aging process as such, but from previous educational experiences. Men were more anxious over competition than were women. Participants retained a relatively high self-image of learning ability  and generalized their belief to the total elderly population, while nonparticipants were highly selective and unwilling to generalize. Nonparticipants considered student evaluation necessary but would not participate in programs using it. Participants considered evaluation unnecessary but would not hesitate to participate if it were included. (author/ly)",

The study was limited to the total population involved in one program (54) and their immediate reaction to that program. Methodology used was a combination of action research and field research. The instrument was developed around six factors: environment, content, program process, lecturer, moderator, and technical qualities of the ETN. Variables concerned with the various factors were interspersed and resulted in 48 items plus a 9-point scale for an overall assessment of the program. A four-point interval scale was used with each of the 48 variables. The instrument was open-ended, with provision for suggestions for  improvement. Subjective evaluative inference based on means and standard deviations indicated the overall program was somewhat better than a possible average but with room for improvement. A better approach to organization and a more careful analysis of the level of content could lead to increased effectiveness. The moderator should assume the role of group leader in an attempt to bring about more group interaction. (author/eb)",

There seems to be a need for bringing \"guided learning\" to the attention of those working in the field of adult education. The framework for identifying when an adult educator is guiding learning was developed, based on \"philosophical patterns\" which identify the basis for operationalizing the education process and on the \"operational pattern\" which identifies actual acts and moves on the part of the adult educator that indicate commitment to the construct of guided learning. It was developed in terms of a limited set of crucial criteria. Each criterion was then  defined in terms of conditions which must be met if it is present. It was apparent that commitment to guided learning was a matter of degree; therefore, most of the means of measurement have been developed in the form of a continuum.

Scores of adult non-academic students were compared with those of college students enrolled in English classes for the foreign born at San  Francisco State College. The new standardized tests are called EPT 100-200-300 forms A and B; each contains 50 items, takes a half hour, and provides a placement table.

Programing is a decision-making process. In a complex adult education organization, the process can be divided into eight phases: formulating the program framework; adapting this framework to the various levels of organization; organizing human resources at the operational level needed to plan a program; decision-making at the operational level; the planned program prospectus; the plan of work; implementing the plan; and program accomplishments. Inherent in the process are a number of interrelated steps which suggest tasks to be performed by individual(s) or groups. Performance of these  tasks may be influenced by individual characteristics and behavior, interaction within a group, and the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the group. The clarity with which the general social system is understood by those within the system has considerable bearing on the nature of program decisions made. (author/eb)",

At the same time that federal and other funding sources are placing increasing emphasis on evaluating on-going programs, action personnel are becoming more and more skeptical about the value of such research. Evidence of this skepticism can be found at any gathering of evaluators. Certainly, different frames of reference guide researchers and educational programers. However, in the long run, both are aiming at the same goal -- a more effective program. This suggests that there is enough common ground between researchers and programers to provide a basis for working together, and that some adequate compromise can be struck between the needs of research and those of education programs.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to measure the effectiveness of various newsletter formats in increasing knowledge among dairymen. The subject matter of the newsletter was harvesting, storing, and feeding of high-moisture corn. The universe of the study was the dairy farmers in seven counties who attended a five-week clinic relating to herd health and management. The dairymen in all counties took a pre-and post-test of multiple choice questions. The farmers in two counties served as a control group and did not receive newsletters. Four groups of dairymen selected at random in the other five counties received newsletters in one of the following formats: pictorial (one letter weekly for three weeks); outline (one letter weekly for three weeks); conventional paragraph (one letter  weekly for three weeks); and pictorial (combination of three letters received at one time). There was no significant difference in knowledge gained among dairy farmers receiving the newsletter with different formats. There was a significant difference between dairymen who received the letters and those who did not: the ones who received them had higher knowledge scores. Younger dairymen showed a higher gain than older ones. Other individual variables were not related to knowledge gained. (author/mf)",

Several chapters deal with available leisure and its use (including mass media, sports, and educational pursuits) in different segments of the population; folk schools, residential adult education, and the work of voluntary associations aimed at special interest groups; characteristics and achievements of cultural centers and boards; the preparation of cultural  workers; and inservice training for adult education. Consideration is also given to such aspects as neighborhood centers and community development; further education for out of school youth; publications, surveys, documentation, educational events, and other services of public bodies; and the role of physical education and sports.

This paper gives an outline of some of the salient structural features of these languages and reports on progress in the preparation of a computerized dictionary of the Jaqi languages presently being adapted for the computer at the University of Florida. Each item of the Jaqi languages is encoded according to a number of categories any one of which or any combination of which may then serve as indexers for machine printouts: machine item number, language name, entry, allomorphs, derivations, grammatical class or classes,  historical origin, dialect of item, source of information, English glosses, Spanish glosses, citations, dialectal and/or language cognates, coded dialect and/or language of cognates, reconstructed proto forms, variant spellings, date of entry, and name of transcriber. It is hoped that the dictionary will be useful as a source for bilingual dictionaries for Peace Corps or government use as well as for work in the reconstruction of Proto-Jaqi. Further plans include a computerized archive to include as much as possible of the structure of the Jaqi languages. (FWB)",

        "description":"Much work in computational linguistics, e.g. the preparation of concordances and text files, has dealt strictly with the surface of language, treating it as nothing more than strings of characters or phonemes. The \"classical\" scheme, developed as a result of dissatisfaction with the inability of such surface systems to deal with problems such as ambiguity, consists of surface processing, syntactic processing and semantic processing, with the object of obtaining an expression for the content of the input text; work with programming systems for generation of sentences with transformational grammar is representative of this tradition. It must be recognized, however, that the essential characteristic of language is its connection with information and that language is the external  manifestation of the human capacity to process symbols in such ways that information is retained. This capacity should be the object of linguistics, and rules of grammar should describe those \"action patterns\" which underlie human symbol processing. Recent work in applied computational linguistics recognizes the importance of this conception and should therefore lead to wider computer applications, perhaps even to real man-machine conversations and the concomitant use of the computer as an imaginative consultant for a wide range of problems.

A paramount purpose of an educational system is to make it possible for its graduates to take a place in society, which presupposes their being able to control effectively the language of that society. The teaching of English to speakers of other languages, and dialects, becomes a central responsibility of the American educational system; schools must be aware of the language or dialect background of their students and  make it possible for them to acquire the standard language as quickly as possible. This calls for ESOL and bilingual education. A child coming to school must be taught the standard language if he is to have access to the general culture and economy. At the same time, he has a right to be taught in his own language all the time he is learning enough English to handle the rest of the curriculum. Some communities may wish to maintain their own cultures and language; others may wish for a new blend of cultures by paralleling TESOL with TXSOE (teaching other languages to speakers of English).

To supply enthusiastic motivation is the first essential of all English teaching. Writing can best begin from individual personal experience rather than from the abstraction of an exercise to be corrected. Even students with the most mediocre natural gifts may be encouraged to write better than they otherwise would. The effectiveness of the method described in this guide is that it \"makes the Indian or Eskimo student recognize that English can be a vehicle for a much broader area of his experience than he has permitted it to embrace so far.\" Suggestions for  motivating individual student interest, topic selection, writing and rewriting practices are discussed by Terry Allen in the light of her lifetime of work in American Indian education.

        "description":"The writer introduces the idea of sociolinguistic competence, the ability of a speaker to produce and recognize an infinite number of inter-idiolectal code switches, and discusses two methods of dealing with such language variations: frequency analysis and implicational analysis. In frequency analysis, the method used by sociolinguists such as Labov and Wolfram, the linguistic data are correlated to non-linguistic data, resulting in a statement of the frequency with which a given linguistic form appears in a given non-linguistic context. Frequency analysis, in generalizing the empirical description of a corpus, deals with linguistic performance. Implicational analysis, on the other hand, &quot;attempts not to describe a set of speech acts but to model the idealized competence of the  persons involved in those speech acts.&quot; Variations are explained by a set of conditional statements of the form: If F1, then F2; if F2, then F3, etc. Implicational analysis is preferred to sociolinguistic work because implicational scales, having been structured without reference to non-linguistic data, permit the correlation of socio-economic and other contextual data to linguistic variation, continuously and without circularity of argument. The significance of the linearity of implicational scales and their place in a generative grammar are also discussed. (FWB)",

(These phonemes are among the most difficult for children to articulate.) Seventeen children from 3.3-5.1 years of age were tested on syllables formed by taking all combinations of the six fricatives in initial (CV) and final (VC) position with one of the vowels /a, i, aI/. Discrimination and articulation tests of this syllable set were then given. An audiovisual system was used to test discrimination. The fricatives were substantially more difficult to discriminate than the control items. Two contrasts, /v/ and voiced &quot;th&quot; and /f/ and unvoiced &quot;th&quot;, were particularly difficult. There were fewer errors on VC than CV pairs. No differences  were associated with the vowel, but there was some evidence that vowel duration was employed as a cue for discrimination of fricatives in final position. While there was a significant correlation between the number of discrimination and articulation errors per child, there was little evidence that articulation errors on specific phonemes were accompanied by discrimination errors on the same phonemes, and no evidence that the frequency of occurrence of specific phonemes in children's speech was substantially related to discrimination or articulation.

The author states her own conviction that language acquisition is different from language retention, that language acquisition is a non-unique process consisting of a multiplicity of devices, that language is essentially habit behavior, that phonology represents a separate language level, and that hearing is not conditioned by articulation. In considering various other theories of the child's acquisition of phonology, the author questions the theoretical foundations of much psycholinguistic research. She is especially concerned that psychological facts and measurements be kept separate from linguistic ones and warns against a tendency  which she finds among many researchers to identify method with subject: \"The fact that a linguist is able to organize his linguistic data into a coherent system does not necessarily mean that an infant acquires, stores or recalls these data in the same manner as evolved by the linguist.\" She feels that a great deal more research must be done and that much more empirical evidence, especially in the way of quantitative information, is needed before valid theories can be formed.

According to the author, it is very important that this kind of test be properly prepared, taking into consideration that the structured oral approach must use meaningful alternatives based on expressions already practiced in class. These tests are best administered with a tape recorder or a language laboratory to eliminate possible subjectivity in the teacher's voice, and are apparently most successful when the answer form is completion, single response, or  supplying a sentence to describe a situation. When using contrastive elements, it is best not to give widely varying alternatives; although three alternatives are preferable some structures will not permit this. The author further suggests ways of preparing the test script so it will be meaningful and ways of checking the reliability of the test itself. He emphasizes that the aural comprehension test cannot measure a student's speaking ability. (FB)",

The author points out that the tapes are ideal for the habituation type of learning (dialogs, memorization, repetition, etc.,) which is preliminary to the communication stage of language learning. He is mainly concerned with five types of habituation learning--dialogs, narratives, drills, quizzes and tests. He gives samples for each type of recorded practice (active and passive participation), illustrating the rationale for each procedure. He points out that being able to stop and repeat the recording also prevents monotony and fatigue for both the teacher and student. It is also easy to adapt the recorded drills for use as quizzes and tests. In his section on the  use of tape recordings for more advanced levels, the author discusses how the recorder can expand the student's exposure to different dialects and language styles. (FB)",

        "description":"Contending that language is the single greatest block to developing a deprived Hispano child's full learning potential, this primary teacher proposes a re-examination of reading readiness procedures at the K-3 level. She maintains that disadvantaged children are not non-verbal, as they are often mis-categorized, but have tremendous difficulty assimilating the middle-class learning structure, because they actually speak a \"poverty dialect,\" quite different from standard spoken English. Because of this, the traditional approach to teaching reading is fundamentally wrong on two counts: (1) the present curriculum does not provide for a transition program to bridge the formal language gap that exists initially between disadvantaged and middle-class children, and (2) teaching reading  before formal language usage establishes a substantial language barrier which inhibits learning in all areas. (Learning to read is actually the third step in language learning, and should only be attempted after the listening and speaking skills have been acquired.) Based on the assumption that pupils must be able to understand and speak formal standard English before they can profit from public school education, the author has developed a methodology called \"Formal Language Learning\" to help the pupil acquire formal spoken usage through functional activities.

The model underlying OST work assumes that an individual's intellect, at any given point in time, is the set of all information he has at his disposal at that point in time. The set of concepts an individual has at any point in time may radically change over time. The OST has reasonable face and construct validity; and yields scores that make a unique contribution to achievement score variance. The OST scores also reveal clear cut developmental differences that are at the same time both understandable and compatible with current theories of cognitive development. Because of its simplicity, and its inherent and nonthreatening appeal to children, there is the distinct possibility it may find  its way to applied diagnostic use in clinical assessment areas. Its heuristic character has already been demonstrated and its research possibilities are being considered. (KJ)",

Indications are that there was more growth shown by the experimental group above the natural maturation development as shown by the control group.

A four tiered effort is suggested in which each level successively comes closer to the problem of effectively using systems thought. First it calls for gaining sufficient familiarity with a systems perspective as a way of looking at things and thinking retrospectively and currently about problems of practice in systems terms. Second it calls for the fashioning of a systems approach out of the system perspective by identifying some of its critical elements and uniting these with a prospective stance and with concrete problems. At the third level it calls for divising and developing a set of procedures and techniques for systems analysis and systems design relative to  problems handled in social work. The fourth level calls for the setting forth of probationary conceptual imperatives to link the essentials into an intelligible whole. Attention is also directed at model construction as a necessary intellectual tool in using systems thought and the following practice models are identified: (1) existing system, (2) intersystem, and (3) revamped or new system.

The students, assigned to various treatment groups, consisted of 40 males and 27 females on academic probation. Six doctoral students served as the Efficient Study group leaders, and a counselor-structured, integrated didactic and experienced treatment approach was utilized. A slightly modified version of a semantic differential checklist developed by Fuhriman was used to measure client perceptions. Due to various analysis problems it was concluded that  only the client perceived dimensions of counselor optimism and responsibility were significantly related to counseling outcome.

The study focused on a teacher of 10th graders in five health and safety classes in a middle class high school. The students were randomly assigned to three treatment groups, each to be taught a specified unit. Group One received precise instructional objectives; Group Two was provided with vague instructional objectives, and Group Three was given a placebo in advance of instruction. A test was administered at the end of the unit to  evaluate achievement of material contained in the unit. The findings included that students receiving precise objectives prior to instruction demonstrated greater achievement. One main conclusion reached was that it is possible to enhance classroom achievement by using precise instructional objectives in advance of instruction with high school learners.

Questionnaires were completed by currently enrolled undergraduate students, their parents, and parents of freshmen planning to enroll at the University in the fall of 1969. Current student attitudes toward regulations, parental expectations for regulations and the level of preparation for self-direction and responsibility of prospective students were determined. Differences in response existed between parents and students in regard to freshmen housing, hours and visitation privileges. The findings indicate a need for flexibility in responding to the variation in the maturity levels of students. A variety of housing, more  effective programs for the inexperienced student and orienting parents toward a more realistic picture of student life are suggestions to combat current student and parental problems uncovered by the survey.

The monograph contains five sections: (1) ideas from the workshops, (2) the changing role of the counselor, (3) anticipation of students' needs, primarily black students; and (4) necessary improvements in student-counselor relationships, and (5) issues. The counselors were strongly urged to change their role to meet students' needs. Problems of the generation gap were considered and the counselor's responsibility to both the institution and the student as well as the counselor's use of  power were discussed. One-to-one counseling and the degree to which the counselors should be involved in shaping student behavior also received attention. (Author/MC)",

The first article discusses cognitive personality theory which maintains that all behavior is a judgmental process carried out upon stimuli which impinge upon the organism. Major issues in general behavior theory are presented followed by a discussion of how these issues might be regarded within a cognitive theory approach. The second paper brings to bear some of the recent conceptions and findings from the area of person perception to the understanding of perception of self with attention focused on ways in which such ideas can be relevant to the work of college counselors. The next paper deals with the application of some social learning concepts to an analysis of some  salient problems in our society. It is concerned with the following four areas in which our society has built into it serious culture conflicts: education, occupation, and recreation; love and marriage; friendship and social acceptance; and morality.

Some young people use drugs as a substitute for psychological or physical help or as a means to be \"in\". There are many other reasons for drug abuse depending on the predisposition and motives involved and these are summarized. To comprehend the present trend in the illicit use of drugs one needs to understand adolescent dynamics. Although they have physiologically acquired the capacities of adults they are socially treated as children and not allowed to demonstrate their independence in all spheres. Consequently much of the adolescents behavior is an expression of his effort to achieve some degree of freedom from parents. Todays young people are extremely uneasy in our achievement oriented  society and are trying to search for self discovery through involvement with drugs since our institutions are not solving their basic identity needs. Because of the deleterious effects of drugs on human beings and society we must find the solution to drug abuse. In most cases, drug users have deep emotional and psychological problems and thus should be helped instead of ostracized by the law and society. (RSM)",

Non-psychotic acting out characters and passive inadequate personalities participated, and discussion, role playing, and psychodrama were the techniques utilized. After one year the following changes were seen: (1) increased reliance on verbalization as an alternative to action; (2) a beginning awareness that rigid attitudes can be modified; (3) increased trust toward the therapists, (4) growing interest and consideration toward group members; (5) increased self-respect; and (6) more realistic super-ego attitudes. Various behavioral manifestations and changing attitudes gave rise to some theoretical constructs regarding dynamic configurations and therapeutic  results. It was presumed that passivity as well as destructive acting out behavior can be explained on the basis of a negative self-image defended against either by denial (of the need for or loss of gratification) and identication (with the aggressive \"bad\" introject or with the weak \"good\" introject. Therapeutic intervention amid at strengthening the \"good\" introject and weakening the \"bad\" introject resulted in the modification of the defense configuration and the liberation of mental energies formerly unavailable for constructive purposes.

Mental health is no longer the opposite of mental illness but now means human well-being. Consequently non-professionals, parents, teachers, and peers must be given rudimentary training enabling them to act as promoters of sound mental health practices and there must be community organization around mental and public health. In order to help larger numbers of people become mentally healthy,  mental health workers must share a set of action-oriented principles which provide the philosophical framework for meaningful mental health activities. These principles are based on movement from institutional violence to human service orientation, from hate to love, manipulation to honesty, dependency to independence, competition to incorporation, isolation to community, professionalism to involvement in social change, security orientation to risk orientation, and prevention of mental illness to promotion of mental health.

Co-therapists can interact on at least five occasions outside of the group, and all these interactions have an important effect on the growth and stability of the co-therapy relationship. Co-therapists should not be paired solely on the basis of personal friendship or prior professional acquaintance and factors such as age, sex, race, marital status, personality characteristics, interpersonal style, and the therapeutic situation should be given careful attention. As with many relationships the co-therapy dyad has a period of formation, a period of continued development, a period of stability, and a period of separation. If the co-therapy dyad  develops and operates effectively, the group will develop accordingly. Supervision of the co-therapists should be over a unit of two people, the whole of which is more important and more profound than its individual parts.

Each center is meant to offer its community consultation and education, however, its personnel is untrained and citizenry resistance monumental. Furthermore, the cause of mental illness in the ghetto, its prevention and treatment have not been clearly identified. Most specialists at the centers do not know what their out-center neighborhood task is. The staff usually consists of young graduates in psychology assisted by nurses, aids and inexperienced workers. Thus group therapy, the single most  important tool, can only be crudely adopted if at all. The author also discusses other side effects of untrained personnel. He notes that the suave treatment and approach used for the middle class is applied to the poor. Apathy and militancy of the community force the worker to deviate from his professionalism thus approaches which bring black and white together advocated.

Two types of health messages were delivered to a group of teenage camp counselors on the disease diabetes. Their attitudes toward the disease in terms of their perception of vulnerability to it, their perception of its severity, and their perception of the need for and benefits of tests for early detection of the disease were assessed. An optional opportunity to participate in a diagnostic test was then offered. Attitudes were reassessed three days later at which time the subjects could request additional educational materials about diabetes. The health educational materials were successful in immediately modifying general attitudes about diabetes, but not  successful in changing any of the underlying components. Only one component of attitude, the perception of vulnerability to diabetes, affected the decision to participate in the diabetes diagnostic test. The same attitude was also instrumental in affecting receptivity to new health educational materials. It is concluded that only through educational efforts commencing at an early age and directed at the underlying components of health attitudes can we hope to bring about desirable health behavior.

Field trips, career days, and viewing specifically constructed television programs were the experimental activities, while the control treatment consisted of the textbook approach to providing vocational information. The results were examined in an attempt to determine the effectiveness of the two treatments. They indicated that neither method was superior in helping the student learn the textbook material, modifying his attitude toward work, self and education and effecting his willingness to seek out or become involved with vocational information. However, open-ended responses showed that the experimental activities  were relatively more appealing to students. (Author/MC)",

        "description":"The counselor's dedication to human betterment makes him vulnerable to the influence of prevelant ideas about what the world needs, and therefore there are marked shifts from time to time in what counselors think they should be doing. In present times the dominant emphasis is on social reform and counselors are asking themselves whether their efforts ought to be directed toward changing social institutions and environments instead of toward helping individual clients. Although they should try to implement social reforms counselors should not repudiate the focus on individual lives that has characterized their past efforts. Evidence suggests that there is far more freedom of choice than ever before and the importance of choice as a basis for individual development has vastly  increased. To expand the area of individual freedom however without helping the individual plan within this enlarged domain is disabling as indicated by the phenomenon of student discontent. Thus if increase in personal freedom is the major social development of our time, to deal with it is the most \"humanitarian\" thing a counselor can do. (RSM)",

The data are based on the responses of 165 sixth graders from two school systems in southwestern New York State, who participated in a separate study involving programed learning and 77 sixth graders (40 boys and 37 girls in four sixth grade classes from the same schools as the programed group), who served as controls. Five tests were administered with two week intervals between administrations: (1) The TASC, (2) The Lie Scale for Children (LSC), (3) a verbal creativity battery composed of four subtests: imagination, flexibility, originality and  fluency; (4) the Lorge-Thorndike IQ Test, and (5) an achievement test specially constructed for the programed learning study to measure knowledge of the learning material taught in a programed booklet. The major finding of the study shows that when the predictive validities of the TASC and the adjusted test anxiety scale for children (a composite score of the LSC score and the TASC scale for children score) were compared against the academic criteria the adjusted test anxiety scale for children score resulted in substantial increases in prediction.

Emphasis is placed on today's youth who will be able to harness technology so that it enriches rather than threatens life. Thus the counselor's function is to help youth develop into adults who will be able to cope with the problems of society. Described is the type of person who should be a counselor and how he should be educated. The report lists four educational changes which should occur: (1) avoid preparing counselors for  settings which do not exist, (2) include major components in counselor education programs which deal with reality of the school where graduates will work, (3) develop professional skills not solely through textbooks but by practicing, and (4) use counselor education programs to serve as a model of teaching roles they recommend.

The author suggests that the counselor establish the image of a friend to communicate with the student. Two kinds of mental disorders which are often associated with suicide are described: (1) depressive states (manic-depressive psychoses, involutional melancholia, paranoid states, psychotic depressive reactions, depressive neurosis); and (2) schizophrenic reactions (paranoid, schizoaffective, catatonic).

The magnitude and variability of latency measurements were independent of training during acquisition, but both were reduced by the recall paradigm during overlearning. Latency was a function of number of response alternatives during acquisition and overlearning. During acquisition, prior to the trial of last error (TLE), latency remained constant and did not differ between correct and incorrect responses. There was a substantial drop in  latency following TLE. Latency, as a rote verbal task, may be a sensitive measure of strength of learning during the overlearning phase, but not during initial learning. (Author)",

One strategy to overcome this problem is to determine if similar conclusions are reached when the same dependent variable is manipulated by various investigators operating under different paradigms. This strategy is applied to the construct of verbal mediation. Three different paradigms are presented. Two major findings tend to recur: (1) overt verbal behavior appears to be correlated with various types of problem-solving behavior which continues to occur even after the verbal behavior has become internalized; and (2) there exists a  period when, although the appropriate verbal responses are in the individual's repertoire, they do not serve a mediating function. It is suggested that the theorist-researchers reviewed are dealing with basically the same phenomenon. Several generalizations concerning the development of the verbal mediation process are abstracted, and several implications for the area of education are discussed. (Author)",

        "description":"A major aspect of the problem of evaluation concerns the measurement of educational outcomes. Such measurement involves, first of all, an inference regarding what is being learned, retained, or transferred. A description is given of the operations which underlie such inferences. It is contended that educational measurement needs to concern itself with the distinction among a number of classes of learning outcomes, particularly verbal sequences, concepts and principles. Primary criteria in such measurement are considered to be distinctiveness and freedom from distortion. Procedures of laboratory psychologists are described in achieving these criteria in the measurement of such outcomes as conditioned responses, chains and multiple discriminations. Analogous procedures need to be  employed in designing items to measure concepts and principles with distinctiveness, and free from distortion. One technique described is two-stage measurement, in which the simpler outcome is measured first, then the more complex. (Author)",

The subjects were 88 elementary education majors at Towson State College, Baltimore, Maryland, randomly assigned to four treatments. Self-instructional material for the unit was developed based upon the learning hierarchy. The treatment material, consisting of ten activity booklets, was administered by the experimenter for eight consecutive class days. After completion of the unit, posttests were administered to compare the degree of learning and the amount of retention. The results do not substantiate the thesis that informing students of behavioral objectives and/or the learning hierarchy can  enhance their performance on an immediate achievement test. However, giving students statements and examples of behavioral objectives is an instructional method that will result in resistance to forgetting. (Author/EK)",

Four forms of a test item writing exercise sheet were randomly distributed, each asking for the production of eight sample test items, two for each specified topic. The subjects produced 16 items, to be used for seventh grade students. Two 16 item tests were constituted, one on subtraction and one on current events. The tests were administered to 51 junior high school students. Means and standard deviations of the items were computed, and analysis of variance for the subtest means was conducted for each replication. Significant differences (F=8.3, df=3, 12) were  observed for subtraction. For the current events data differences were not significant. Findings are limited by the number of items on each subtest. Further staff studied are investigating how to produce items truly congruent with objectives and how best to translate these findings into practical procedures for teacher. (Author/CJ)",

The pupils were given mental tests to measure the ability to understand the structure and direction of second order relationships and to reason a priori, even if the correct logical deduction is dissonant with experience. Physical growth was also assessed. Elaboration of parametric correlations indicated that substantial relations between physical and mental growth show up when season of birth is controlled by dichotomizing the sample into Winter and Summer born subjects. Applying a nonparametric data analysis, based on pairs matched closely for chronological  age and parental education, and using longitudinally assessed criteria of physiological maturation as independent variables, significant relationship between physiological maturation and mental growth were detected at all three socio-economic and educational levels. The findings indicate that pre-adolescence and early puberty are critical periods of maturationally determined acceleration in mental development, during which conspicuous progress is made in the ability of formal reasoning.

Through a search of the literature, visits to three school districts, and a conference with a nationally recognized consultant, recommendations were made. Pilot programs were suggested for selected Delaware school districts to test the feasibility of two rescheduled school year plans: (1) at the elementary level, an extended term of approximately 200 days for all students to give more flexibility in the instructional program and to improve pay and status for teachers; (2) at the secondary level, a voluntary summer session to increase educational opportunities for  students to make up work, accelerate their progress, or broaden their studies without the expense of revising school organization and curriculum. It was recommended that pilot projects be funded in equal amounts from State, ESEA Title III, and local sources. An annotated bibliography of 91 citations is included. (LN)",

The pamphlet documents court decisions that have established legal guidelines for desegregation and cites research that supports the basic premise that separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. The role of the community power structure in the desegregation process is discussed. An overview of the characteristics of culturally deprived children and a resume of the typical social-psychological environment of many Negro children are included. Extending this picture is information about a specific school population drawn from a previous study of a predominantly Negro elementary school. The conclusion presents some guidelines for action to  implement changes in schools on a broad and systematic basis. (MF)",

This approach attempts to adapt instruction to individual differences. Grouping principles include physical factors, social maturity and personality factors, mental maturity, academic status, and teacher personality within the teacher-pupil relationship. A comparative evaluation of a nongraded school organization was made within a specific elementary school district in Austin, Texas. Grades one through six were studied. The six major hypotheses tested were that there are important differences and similarities between experimental (nongraded) and control (graded) classes in (1) the distribution of teachers' instructional time; (2) the scope of instructional  resources used in reading, spelling, and arithmetic; (3) the formation, number, size, and achievement range of subgroups; (4) pupils' use of the centralized library; (5) children's school anxiety; and (6) children's achievement. The results were mixed although the data related to the fifth hypothesis did not verify the expectation of less anxiety. Instead, anxiety seems to increase over the school year in the nongraded program. (LN)",

When professional educators are coupled with a cluster of special interest groups (e.g., book publishers, realtors, landowners, politicians), they form interlocking subsystems that can be described as the \"Educational Complex.\" These interest groups often challenge one another for relative power. The concept of community control represents reform that would redistribute power outside the complex. The call for community control is interwoven in a revolutionary push by members of the Black City Reservation to determine their own destiny. The crisis in education is one of the community  questioning the relevancy of its own existence in the educational complex. Meaningful community control can only come if we (1) develop alternative measures to determine whether stated objectives are reached, (2) devise methods for students to exercise power, (3) redistribute economic power, (4) restructure the school-community relationship, (5) develop inservice strategies for teachers and paraprofessionals, and (6) develop processes for involving all persons concerned in planning and evaluating school programs.

The systems-oriented administrator is a change agent and innovative strategist who delegates responsibility for basic operations and places a premium on executive functions concerned with goals, planning, and coordination. Application of the systems approach to education includes development of alternative plans for optimum resource utilization, generation of models to clarify system relationships, and mastery of quantitative analytic techniques. Major components or subsystems include: (1) goals and priorities setting, (2)  resources, (3) control, (4) client service, (5) educational manpower development, (6) environment relations, and (7) student manpower reentry and retraining. Newer tools available to the systems-oriented educational administrator include techniques related to planning control (PERT and PPBS) and serendipity, the art of discovering and utilizing the unexpected.

        "description":"The findings of a ESEA Title III study designed to assess the feasibility and utility of the paraprofessional concept in education are presented. This study involved: (1) an observation and evaluation of existing paraprofessional programs, primarily in Wayne County Michigan; (2) a comprehensive study of the literature; (3) a review of relevant community college and university course offerings; (4) an examination of negotiated contracts that include paraprofessional provisions; and (5) an analysis of an interinstitutional training program for paraprofessionals. The findings of the study are presented in the form of answers to the following key questions: (1) At what point does the work of the paraprofessional conflict with the responsibilities of the school professional? (2) What  kinds of paraprofessional positions are currently held, and what additional positions are needed? (3) What types of training programs will produce desirable paraprofessional skills? and (4) What type of basic demonstration program would be of value to districts of different sizes and needs?

        "description":"Studies are reviewed showing that the social status of a high school has a small independent effect on the college intentions of its students, over and above the effects of their family status and mental ability. This finding is analyzed with data from the Educational Testing Service's 1955 sample of 35,330 students in 518 American high schools. College intentions of students were found to be an effect of the social class composition of the school rather than of formal features of the school organization. The positive effects of school status on college intentions are found to mask a negative effect--in schools with students of high average ability, students of any given ability and status are less likely to have college intentions, presumably because internal standards of  competition rise. When this hidden negative effect is held constant, the positive effect of school status on college intention increases. The conditions and mechanisms of the negative effect are considered.

The center's position is based on the conviction that early educational stimulation is a key to the solution of educational and social problems, and that there is a need for complete educational models rather than fragmented research and development projects. The focus of the center's programs is on the experimental Clayton County Early Elementary School, which enrolls 431 students, ages 3 to 8 years. The educational model is the result of knowledge-base development in the  center. Once established, the model goes through a series of regenerations as a result of continuing evaluation and feedback. Development depends largely on a systems approach backed by computer technology, with the advantage that a complete model is always available for dissemination. Present program projects call for a second model, involving a disadvantaged population, with work to begin in fiscal year 1971. (DE)",

Consensual judgment of change (by parents, schools, and staff) in school work, and in educational and behavioral  functioning indicated mild improvement in 60.9% of the cases and marked improvement in 16.2%, with girls showing more improvement (p less than .01).

Children high on PSF had better recall for novel information and were rated higher on curiosity by their teachers. Boys who were high on PSF show what Neumann and Helson have called a patriarchal pattern of intrusive, active, assertive personality characteristics. The pattern for girls was somewhat more subdued, but still suggested responsiveness to novelty and diversity of experience. PSF was associated  positively but weakly with IQ, was negligibly related to test anxiety, and was positively correlated with school achievement.

Associate teachers from the city schools worked with master teachers. Special admit students did relatively well; students as a whole were positive about the program; associate teachers were favorable, but wanted more contact with students and planning time with master teachers. Administrative evaluation suggested orientation for students  regarding norms, questioned locating the program on a college campus, and approved the modified admission policy and the problem emphasis in the curriculum.

Children were judged to underachieve when achievement measures in language or mathematics fell more than 10% below the expected level based on age, IQ, and grade placement. During the 3 year project, a screening program was developed and employed with 2,300 children. A novel remedial program was carried out for 156 children. Specialists in learning disabilities refined the screening diagnosis and developed teaching prescriptions for all students. Much of the teaching was carried out by teachers with minimal special training. The procedures developed  may be especially useful to districts initiating a learning disabilities program or one which is handicapped by lack of specially trained teachers. The report contains program description, measures of student performance, tables on incidence and types of learning disabilities, and suggestions for implementing a program. (Author/RJ)",

Results varied from year to year but there were no significant differences in IQ or motivation. Although all had losses in achievement test scores at the end of the 1st year, the  seminar group ranked first at the close of the program on every criterion measure variable, thus suggesting a differential response to the program.

College students were allowed 10 or 20 minutes or unlimited time to find ideas for product improvement problems. Results indicated that the only checklist which significantly stimulated productivity was composed of just seven general categories of solutions (e.g., change shape, change material). Another creative thinking technique, the morphological synthesis procedure (Allen, 1962), also significantly stimulated idea production, but a direct comparison with the brief checklist condition was not meaningful. Subjects provided with longer checklists, including Osborn's (1963) 73 idea spurring questions, performed no better than controls. With additional problem solving time,  rate of idea generation decreased but idea quality increased. Object complexity, manipulated in two timed studies, was not systematically related to product improvement scores, and instructional constraints to be original and be practical decreased idea frequency. It was thus concluded that creative output can be increased by teaching deliberate techniques for generating new combinations of ideas. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"On the basis of projections of the number of students that the six state institutions of higher education can expect to enroll during the period 1962-1972, analyses of physical facilities were made. Projected enrollments were translated into student credit hours since the need for facilities is related to the volume of instruction. The analyses included an inventory of existing facilities and a space utilization study. An implication of the study is that particular attention should be given to the expansion of facilities for advanced degrees as Ohio seems to lag behind other mid-western states in that respect.

Aesthetic judgments of the environment are related primarily to the physiological well-being of an individual and secondarily to his social experiences. Excessive loading of any one of the senses can prevent a balanced assessment of the environment. Therefore, the responsibility of architecture is to lighten the stresses of life, permitting man to focus his energies upon productive work. Several examples explain this basic premise--(1) the child in a learning environment, (2) the patient convalescing in a hospital, and (3) the surgeon in an operating room. (TC)",

In the light of this aim, basic plan designs are examined in terms of space and subsequent cost efficiency. The means for achieving the spatial arrangements recommended are examined from all aspects. Beginning with structure, comparisons are made between various systems. Interior elements, exterior elements, and mechanical equipment are similarly analyzed. Final recommendations are made for immediate solutions and long term  considerations. An appendix contains indexes enabling the cost criteria to be extended to other areas. (RS)",

        "description":"A three-year experimental study was conducted at Northern High School, Baltimore City Public Schools, to gain evidence indicating whether the use of programed instruction or the use of traditional instruction in high school mathematics resulted in greater mastery of subject matter, greater retention of subject matter, and better grades in first-year college mathematics courses. In addition, an investigation was made of the possibility of an association between instructional format and (1) certain mathematical concepts and skills and (2) various personality differences. Differences between the mean scores of the various criterion measures, adjusted for differential effects of mental ability by analysis of covariance, were, for the most part, in favor of the group receiving  conventional instruction. Some differences were statistically significant. No pattern of association emerged between personality factors and success with one or the other of the instructional formats. (Author/SP)",

After determining that the STS is representative of many broadcast instructional television agencies, a five-page questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1037 teachers whose school districts participated in STS. The sample provided 752 usable responses. Results showed that a majority (57.9 percent) of the respondents used the program series regularly (at least several times a semester), and that the average regular use of the program series was 1.8 program series per teacher per semester. Three conditions were found to be statistically associated with the number of series a teacher uses: the storage location of  the television set, the teacher's professional preparation, and the grade levels concerned.

In the past, the consequences of this have been sometimes scandalous, sometimes tragic. Science grows at a prodigious rate, and the situation today is dismal, the outlook for tomorrow too awful to contemplate unless the problem is confronted. Knowledge is communicated through a message. A message may do one or all of three things: inform, motivate, facilitate. The dissemination of a message is intertwined with the character of channels, knowledge producers, middlemen, audiences and systems. There are ten stages between a message and its ultimate effectiveness, and they are: awareness, attention, exposure,  comprehension, retention, motivation, pre-trial evaluation, trial, post-trial evaluation, and complete adoption. Thought that takes these considerations into account must be invested in messages if knowledge is to get quickly to the people who can utilize them. (GO)",

This is due, not so much to 'information apathy' on their part, as to faults inherent in information services as a whole. A formal information service may not come through at all. It is not capable of reaching behind a request to the real question that motivated it. By not being able to formulate answers in a way necessary to the researcher's logical momentum, the information service slows him down and may bring him to a standstill. All too often, a researcher's colleagues will fulfil these conditions--they tell him exactly what he needs to know to solve a problem, because they can grasp his problem and translate their answers in terms of that problem. The solution proposed is an information specialist who is a link  between a research effort and a mechanized information service. He must be part of the research team as a senior member--so that he may know all about the work being done--and he must understand how the research product is to be judged and by whom. It is predicted that this approach will accelerate research work as much as six times, and that this will be the trend in years to come. (GO)",

Upon completion of one year's study, student achievement was evaluated in four areas: listening comprehension, proficiency in reading, writing achievement, and speech production. At the end of the second year, student achievement was tested in the same four skill areas to evaluate progress over the normal span of time devoted to foreign language learning in secondary schools.

        "description":"The impetus for modifying or eliminating the A-F grading system has come primarily from students. Faculty reaction has been more one of bowing to pressure than that of a carefully considered response. Arguments for and against the traditional grading systems each have merit. It seems illogical, however, to repeat on the graduate level a grading system that has major shortcomings at the lower levels. The gold star in kindergarten and the A in college become ends in themselves. Students also confuse grades with emotional attachment--the teacher who likes you gives you an A. Thus, traditional grading practices have potential for corrupting the true purposes of education. A pass/withdraw system accompanied by substantive comments by the teacher may be an answer. The additional burden  this will place on the teacher and the administrative inconvenience it may cause are the price that will have to be accepted. \"Philosophy rather than procedure must rule the day.\" (AF)",

The focus is on state, rather than federal, subsidies and the undergraduate level. A study of the operation of the California higher education system indicates that income from poor and lower-middle income families is redistributed to upper-middle and high income families. These results hinge upon several parameters: the state tax structure, family income distribution of students enrolled in different schools, tuition charges, and full educational costs per student at different schools. In contrast to California, where subsidies tend to be proportional to family income, in Wisconsin, subsidies tend to be redistributive (or inversely related) to family income. Regardless of the  redistributive effect, the present system tends to penalize high school graduates who do not go to college, often those from modest income families, and those who go to private colleges. It also tends to subsidize students who don't need it, and discourages young people from pursuing non-subsidized programs more appropriate to their vocational interests. (AF)",

Creativity research has had an increasingly greater effect on pre-primary, primary and secondary education, and more and more students are prepared to do such research when they enter college. Studies indicate, however, that the creative student can find few outlets in the university and has a higher dropout rate than the non-creative student. Traditional tests, admission policies, and the awarding of scholarships and fellowships are all geared to the conventional student and tend to discriminate against the creative student, often a member of a minority group.

The results indicated that: 1) the estimated parental incomes of USC freshmen closely resembled those of freshmen included in the national university norms for Fall 1968; 2) the most important source of financial support for  USC freshmen, as well as freshmen at the national level, was family income; 3) USC freshmen were not as concerned about financing their education as were freshmen at other major universities; and 4) the greatest percentage of USC freshmen requesting financial aid came from families with annual incomes in the $10,000 - 14,999 range.

The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages, however. These include: the inaccuracy of traditional grading; its deleterious effect on the teaching situation, learning, and creativity; and its ineffectiveness in stabilizing the academic standards of the university and in motivating students. In addition, there is substantial evidence to indicate that grades badly serve the purpose of determining graduate admission; that  transferring and hiring can be done without grades, and that the grading system has no counterpart in real life. The author proposes consideration of several variations of the pass-fail system, or, as an alternative, a system of comprehensive examinations combined with written reports on the student. (AF)",

About two-thirds of the students reported plans to continue their education; significantly more boys and girls planned to do so; the majority of students planned to attend public institutions, and most planned to study in New York State; there was strong correlation between social class and college interest, and a close relationship between class rank and test scores. Parents exerted the greatest  influence upon the student's future plans, but more so on boys; girls tended to be more influenced by their peers. College-bound students received more individual counseling than those not planning to attend college; parents seemed somewhat more reluctant to assume financial obligations for their daughter's education than for their sons; and proximity to college did boost college-going rates.

        "description":"The Santa Cruz campus of the University of California has been using pass-fail grading coupled with written evaluations of the student's performance since it opened in 1965. The only exceptions to the pass-fail system are in nonintroductory undergraduate courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics in which students may select the letter grade option. The rationale is that the admissions policies of some graduate and professional schools discriminate against the student with no letter grades. The pass-fail system has been considered a success. It tends to base the educational experience more naturally on the subject matter and the needs of the student, rather than distort learning through over emphasis on the instructor as evaluator and on the competitive letter grade  he will award. It also bases the record of academic performance on the written evaluation of each instructor instead of on a single pseudo-quantitative letter. Two negative aspects of the pass-fail system are that there has been a steady increase in the number of courses that are so large that no evaluation is written, and that some graduate and professional schools have expressed difficulty in evaluating a Santa Cruz transcript.

        "description":"The challenge to university governance has become an issue of \"Anarchy or Hierarchy.\" Some students want the university to be a \"community\" with no distinctions in rank, status or authority among the various members. Yet the university is inherently a hierarchical institution that cannot avoid making judgments, and in making these judgments, the institution must apply \"reasoned elaboration,\" not hunches or intuition. Another challenge to the university is the impatience of the young with inaction, complexity, and doubt. The university must admit the weaknesses and shortcomings of its inheritance: that it is not the place for all people, that not all scholarship and learning are equally significant, and that reason is not the only clue to truth. But it must continue to assert that  impetuous action, conscious oversimplification, refusal to doubt, and the rejection of reason are enemies of the university. \"...if we are not to slip into a dark age of irrationality the universities must defend the ideal of objectivity.\" (AF)",

Information was also collected on high school protest participation and on the percentage of entering freshmen who estimated the chances were very good that they would participate in protest demonstrations. Although, compared to the 1968-1969 academic year, the  first half of the 1969-1970 academic year has been marked by relative campus calm, the potential for dissent and the degree of social concern have clearly been increasing among both sexes and in all types of institutions.

This report discusses in detail the process of clarifying these purposes and of securing support from interested parties; and it offers suggestions for the alleviation of the malaise which characterizes many of these colleges. The report is based on intensive study of 6 private liberal arts colleges, at which interviews were  conducted with presidents, and selected members of the faculty and student body.

Students tend to be suspicious of the preoccupation with \"efficiency and support\" and are asking that education justify itself in terms of its relevance to their growth as individuals and to the transformation of American society and culture. The third crisis is caused by black and other minority group students who are questioning both the process of university operations and its course of studies. To meet these crises, it is  important to seek a greater variety of means to meet more clearly stated ends. This means asking questions about the why's and how's of learning. (AF)",

The American university cannot be democratic if it is to be an  educational institution.

(1) If the input with respect to student ability is held constant, will identifiable groups of colleges have graduates showing greater gain in achievement than others? (2) Contingent on demonstrating differential gains between colleges, what are the characteristics of the most and least effective schools? The control variables were the verbal and mathematical scores of the SAT and the student's major field of study. The output performance variables were the area tests of the GRE Institutional Testing Program. The latter are considered achievement tests of institutional  effectiveness. Institutional resources were also considered. Most of the colleges in the sample were small and included many types of liberal arts institutions. Results indicated that 85% to 91% of the between college variance was predictable from student input. A small but significant proportion was predictable from income per student, the proportion of faculty with a doctorate, full time equivalent, and the interaction of these 3 variables for all but the GRE-Social Science.

The findings, based on information obtained from a sample survey of faculty and administration, analysis of documents, participant observation and intensive interviews, indicated that the normal, bureaucratic decision-making mechanisms break down when confronted by major external threats. Instead &quot;political&quot; processes take over, and major interest  groups largely determine policies.

It points out that any evaluation of higher education in America must deal with 3 fundamental problems: 1)diversity of objectives and functions across the full range of institutions of higher education; 2)differences between college environments; and 3)range of student abilities. A more subtle obstacle to effective evaluation has been the traditional concept of what evaluation actually is. Traditionally, institutional goals have been the object of evaluation, but it is more important to look at the consequences of particular politics or programs. Although &quot;control&quot; and &quot;focus&quot; have characterized the style of inquiry in the past, the investigator needs to be adventurous and explorative in order  to evaluate changing social and educational developments. &quot;Exploration&quot; involves searching, probing, and testing alternatives and interactions, but it also connotes a freedom to seek new methods and values ingenuity. A new model for evaluation programs sees the role of the evaluator as a social scientist rather than teacher, missionary, or reformer. Given this concept of evaluation, it is necessary to think about the content of evaluation in a broadly inclusive rather than restrictive fashion. The remainder of the report consists of a description of the methodological approaches of the Center. (DS)",

A phenomological approach--or, the idea that a person's actions and decisions reveal something about his personality--was used. Data for the study were derived from 2 Omnibus Personality Inventory (OPI) tests and a background questionnaire administered to all seniors. Five types of housing were considered: small houses (1 or 2 bedrooms); large houses (3 or more bedrooms); apartments; dormitories; and fraternity houses (men only). Among men, intellectually oriented individuals tended to live in large houses, while &quot;collegiate&quot; men tended to live in fraternity houses. Among women, esthetically  oriented individuals tended to live in small houses, although those living in large houses tended to be very self-expressive. Students living in other types of residences showed no distinctive personality characteristics as a group. Although the study revealed relationships between some personality variables and choices of residence among senior students, the authors urge readers not to generalize the findings at Davis to other campuses.

While none of these hypotheses was contradicted by the survey's findings, many of the variables the author felt to be particularly important in junior college bond elections had not been mentioned in the literature reviewed here. Some of the conclusions of the study were that the chances for  a successful bond election appear to decline as the voter turnout increases, and the strongest support for school bonds comes from parents of children in school and from new residents of the area. The amount of the bonds to be floated has little effect on the election's result, although the question of a tax increase may have significant effect.

        "description":"Three flexible scheduling plans were tried in order that firefighters could take regular college courses despite their 24 hours on the 24 off work schedule. Plan one scheduled the firefighters into a regular Monday-Wednesday-Friday class which they attended every other week, making up missed material outside of class. Plan two scheduled special 2-hour classes on every other Monday, Wednesday and Friday; and plan three scheduled firefighters into one Monday-Wednesday-Friday and one Tuesday-Thursday section of the same class on alternate weeks. Plan three drew the most favorable response from both students and teachers, as it provided a chance for the firefighters to take classes with regular students. If the number of firefighters desiring to take a particular class was  sufficiently large and the class materials were adaptable, plan two was also regarded as useful. (MC)",

Many class members were employed adults, including policemen and firefighters, who often missed off-campus tours and lectures. Tutor tapes were used to offset the problem of absenteeism. A student who had missed a museum tour, for example, could check out a multimedia pack at the college's Learning Resource Center. The pack consisted of a cassette tape recorder with earplug and shoulder strap, a map, a study guide, and a student reaction sheet. The student then could tour the museum at his own pace, listening to the recorded lecture. Further innovations in teaching the course are planned, including greater student involvement and  more audiovisual aids. (MS)",

A 10 per cent stratified random sample of students were administered Maslow's Security-Insecurity Inventory. No significant difference was found between ICC students and Maslow's norm population. No significant difference was found among the curriculum groups of business, health, technical, and agricultural students, or between transfer and terminal students. Day students, however, were found to differ at the .01 level of significance from night students. They showed less confidence, less stability, and a greater concern with self-identity in relation to present and future  worlds. The author stated that the insecure person tends to be more dogmatic, less effective in critical thinking, and less creative than the secure person. He recommended that student personnel workers facilitate security-need satisfaction by offering students a safe, confidential relationship with an understanding adult, and that instructors offer warm encouragement, success experiences, and increased individual attention to help aleviate students' feelings of insecurity.

The amount of library education was defined in terms of a Master's degree in library science for one group and an undergraduate minor or less for the second group. The performance on the job was defined in terms of the reader services developed by the librarian. A causal-comparative method of study was selected to determine the cause or causes responsible for the development of reader services in each of eight high school library programs. The librarians of four of these schools had master's degrees in library science, and the remaining four had the equivalent of  undergraduate minors in library science or less. The data for each school were collected by means of questionnaires, observation, and interviews. The data showed that, as a group, the librarians with more library education developed more extensive programs of reader services than did the group of librarians with less library education. The data showed the same pattern of differences in regard to the amounts of time the librarian spent on reader services and in the student and teacher use of the library. (Author/JB)",

The scope of work in the Republic of Indonesia included assessment of books and materials in the educational process; books used by individuals for the improvement of reading skills and for learning enrichment; books for technical and professional purposes; and books used in libraries and organized reference centers. This study was conducted in the midst of efforts that were being taken by the Government of Indonesia to rebuild that nation's shattered economy. Stringent reforms had begun to slow the inflation and ameliorate the problems which, in recent years, have distorted the Indonesian book market and book industry, as they have all other aspects of life. It was found that not  only is the nation far short of the reading materials needed to serve school-age children and out-of-school youth and adults, but enrollments are growing at a much faster rate than population--and the problems entailed in providing books for potential readers have increased, not stabilized. For the immediate future, Indonesia needs assistance from all book-oriented agencies in the outside world. This report identifies a number of priority needs, problems and opportunities--and suggests solutions within the framework of existing economic, technical, financial, and manpower limitations.

Study data were collected through: a review of  literature pertaining to library services to commuting students, interviews with public library directors in key areas and with a random selection of commuting students, and visits to small public libraries.

If nurses need this information, and if they are fulfilling this need,  they are utilizing sources other than those discussed in this study. It was concluded that before there can be more and better resources, nursing educators must know what kind of materials they would like to have available.

In two of these three groups, the mother was also involved in the program. The fourth group was for control. The diffusion effects studied were those that related to concepts (defined as knowledge that can be shown by matching, recognition, or identification behavior). The measurement instrument was the Basic Concept Test, whose content was drawn from the curriculum material used in the intervention program. It was hypothesized that the two groups having both sibling and maternal involvement would show greater conceptual development,  and that these groups would also have the information necessary to recognize and identify the test stimuli. Results from Orthogonal Comparisons supported both the hypotheses. Superior performance by the maternal involvement groups was recognized as a manifestation of a level of conceptual development directly associated with intra-family diffusion effects. Maximum intervention effects appear to result when mothers are involved in a program and vertical diffusion affects the younger siblings of children in the program. (MH)",

The failure of an initial attempt to teach the concepts \"fat\" and \"skinny\" led to a design of instructional procedures that would utilize a concept's name while trying to teach its semantic content. A study of variant procedures used to teach the concept \"round\" emphasized the importance of verbal representation, and a final experiment, designed to teach \"square,\" was performed to determine whether linguistic or concrete referential contexts were more important. The results supported the linguistic approach to semantics rather than the psychological: the relation of words to other words appears more crucial than the relation of  words to things. Preschool instructional approaches should consider the communicative context of experiences as well as children's direct experience with materials. (DR)",

        "description":"Educators have rationalized the traditional school starting age of 6 by saying that children have by then normally acquired sufficient muscular control and language ability to begin reading instruction. When it became apparent that many children did not begin to read at the supposedly proper time, further rationalizations developed concerning readiness and testing for readiness. This paper reports an Educational Testing Service study of attitudes toward readiness. A national sample of 250 first grade teachers judged the readiness of 7000 pupils, and indicated that only 60% of the children were ready for first grade in all or most respects. Teachers cited intellectual factors over nonintellectual factors 3 to 2. A committee of child development experts assessed major developmental  areas (sensory/motor, cognitive/intellectual, and social/personal) in terms of readiness and judged each area equally important. A second committee considered preschool objectives and added moral judgment and moral conduct to factors the other groups had felt were important. A fresh look should be taken at the purposes of early education and at the school starting age. Emphasis should be on fitting the school to the individual child, rather than the child to the school.

        "description":"To determine the antecedents of sucking in infants, the behavior of 24 infants from 48- to 60-hours-old was observed in relation to a sucking device. The device measured pressure and rate of sucking and delivered a controlled flow of nutrient. The interfeeding interval was varied among the experimental and control groups. Little sucking behavior was found in the first half hour after routine feeding, but sucking pressure quickly recovered in the first hour and sucking rate gradually reached its highest level by 3 hours after the meal. While a particular child's sucking pressure doesn't ever vary much, his sucking rate, and thus volume of nutrient consumed, is dependent on a variety of environmental factors, including interfeeding interval, obstetric sedation, level of  wakefulness, and type of nutrient. Knowledge concerning the factors influencing sucking rate should be applied to the problem of infants who fail to thrive on routine management. (MH)",

The rate of Environmental Force Units per minute for each child was figured, and analysis showed that middle urban children had the highest mean rates.

Available data appear to indicate that Head Start and other preschool programs have an immediate impact, but little is known about why, or under what circumstances optimum results may be obtained. Sustained gains are still being sought. Children who have not attended preschool programs tend to catch up in primary school with attenders, but little is known about why this happens. A planned variation study is in progress comparing children in  sponsored Head Start and sponsored Follow-Through classes and children attending &quot;regular&quot; Head Start and &quot;regular&quot; primary schools. Head Start evaluations have tried to locate program variations other than administrative which may affect child development. Considering the evidence now available, the assumptions on which Head Start was based still seem tenable.

One framework illustrated the relationships among learning objectives, learning variables, and the learning environments of home and school. The second framework organized parent involvement activities aimed at a reduction of parental alienation, an increase of  parent participation in class, and an application of classroom principles at home. The program, which involved demonstration, observation, and guided participation, was implemented by parent involvement coordinators who attended a 6-week summer training session and then returned to their communities to train family liaison workers.

Three groups of children were compared: A group of Negro English-speaking children, a group of Mexican-American children whose first language was Spanish (who were tested throughout the language program with the Schedule), and a second Mexican-American group who did not receive the schedule. The groups were compared for mastery of concepts in the language program and on the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Test to test for generalization of learning  effects. Results controlled for ethnic group support the hypothesis that improved learning may result from the use of the Schedule. An investigation of possible effects of nonreinforcement, using a specially devised criterion, revealed no effects. Informal observation suggested that the positive effects of the Schedule could well be due to the additional practice the children receiving it obtained. (DR)",

The sample was comprised of 57 Negro and 51 Latin-American parents. From the Parent Interview, which was administered to the female caretaker (usually the mother) of each child enrolled in the Head Start program both before and after the intervention had taken place, scales were constructed to measure the level of general optimism reported by each parent, and the aspiration level for the participating child reported by each parent. It was hypothesized that prior parental experience with Project Head Start, current parental experience with the program, and active parental participation in the  program would increase parental scores on the two scales. None of these hypotheses was confirmed. It was further predicted that children of parents who showed favorable changes on a scale would gain more from their own Head Start experiences, in terms of changes in the scores on the tests administered to them both before and after the program, than children of parents who showed unfavorable changes on that scale. This prediction was not confirmed. It was also hypothesized that Latin-American parents would show more favorable change on the scales than Negro parents; this hypothesis was not confirmed.

The experimental  group seemed to have a higher rate of gain than the control, but the difference was seldom significant.

N-length was defined as the number of nonreinforced trials spaced between reinforced trials and intertrial reinforcement (ITR), introduced between regularly scheduled trials. The experimental situation was a two-person, two-choice game in which each subject had control over the other player's gain and could choose either to cooperate or not to cooperate. The experiment consisted of two phases: the acquisition phase (defined as the first 30 cooperative responses), and the 30 trial extinction phase. The subjects were divided into five groups of 20 each. The first four groups received 50% partial  reinforcement for the first 30 responses and ITR in N-lengths of 1, 2, 3, and four. The fifth group received continuous or 100% reinforcement. The findings matched those of the previous study in that the 100% group was least resistant to extinction and the N1-length group was most resistant to extinction.

A second hypothesis stated that the placement of a textual description adjacent to a unitary complex science diagram generally will divert the learners' attention to the theoretically less effective unit, the textual description. Adjunct verbal questions relative to a prose criterion posttest were used to facilitate the learners' inspection behavior. Two hundred seven high school biology students constituted the sample used in the experiments. Five treatment groups were formed: (1) word (black and white, block) diagram, (2) word diagram with prose, (3) picture-word (colored, stylized) diagram, (4) picture-word diagram with prose, and  (5) prose. Four orthogonal comparisons of the means (p less than .05) supported the hypotheses. The word and picture-word science diagram treatments were independently more effective than a prose description and more effective than the multi-media or combination of the same diagram and prose. It was suggested that the effectiveness of certain multi-media science instructional presentations can result in learning interference. (Author/EB)",

ATI theory and research indicate that different effective instructional treatments tend to help some kinds of learners more than others. These findings have cost, facility, and personal implications for the design and implementations of science curriculums and the development of individualized instructional programs. Eighty-two high school science subjects were randomly assigned to a word or word-picture diagram (i.e., pathway or cyclic schema with adjunct questions) treatment. Multiple regression analysis of posttest scores  (predictors: verbal ability and pretest scores) supported the a priori hypothesis that low verbal subjects seemed to benefit from certain verbal and pictorial referents. Higher verbal ability subjects appeared to be less dependent on the investigated pictorial referent type in terms of the verbal (nonpictorial) criterion test. (Author/PEB)",

Responses of two matched groups of 19 students each, one from the United States and the other from Taiwan, were studied; students were given word association tests and a physics problem set and were asked to rank the level of importance of conceptual elements. Results of the analysis of characteristics of conceptual elements showed no significant differences for students within the same culture. The understandings of the concepts of weight and mass by the two groups were comparable, and the importance of problem-related conceptual elements was perceived similarly by both groups. Significant differences between groups were  found for the word association tests, with Taiwan students associating more physical science and problem-related conceptual elements with the stimulus words \"mass\" and \"weight.\" Findings also showed that Taiwan students were more influenced by the problem set, were less divergent in their responses to the stimulus work \"mass,\" and showed more memorization than did the students from the United States.

Most popular activities were identified in order as swimming, boating, fishing, waterskiing, sailing, and duck hunting. Location of participation in water-based recreational activity was determined and variables pertinent to particupation/non-participation were examined. Water quality evaluations by the students indicated that they seemed to be more concerned with the cosmetics of water quality (dead fish, unpleasant smell, and \"junk at the bottom\") than by harmful bacteria or chemicals in the water. The authors see the findings of the study as indicating that while students may be  concerned, they do not seem to exhibit a level of environmental knowledge beyond that of the rest of the population even though their schools had recently made intensive environmental education efforts.

The second-semester course represents a new approach, treating algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and calculus in a unified manner rather than as four separate sections. Fundamental notions of the subject are unified into a sequence of topics beginning with the consideration of the real number system and the algebraic operations. Emphasis is placed on the importance of being able to visualize and graphically represent  mathematical expressions. Ideas of algebra and geometry are presented in the study of linear, quadratic, and general polynomial functions. Permutations, combinations, and probability are treated as additional topics.

The Carroll model of school learning is a paradigm describing the degree of learning that occurs in a school setting as a function of time spent on a learning task divided by time needed for its mastery. Seventeen null hypotheses were investigated in the study which used a sample of 169 students enrolled in an algebra I unit focusing upon the four basic operations. Among the  major findings was that a high quality of instruction characterized by feedback/correction procedures fostered a significantly greater degree of learning among students and a significantly greater number of classes spent by students than did a low quality of instruction characterized by the absence of feedback/correction procedures. The Carroll model's hypothesized interaction between ability to understand instruction and quality of instruction relative to degree of learning was confirmed statistically. (Author/PEB)",

Integral powers of 2 and 3 were chosen as the mathematical content. Treatment 2 (T2) emphasized explicitly the structural properties in developing operations and algorithms and in manipulating isomorphisms, whereas T1 attempted a direct approach with no explicit emphasis on structural properties. Each of five teachers taught two sections of intact  eighth grade classes, using the T1 approach with one section and the T2 method with the other. An immediate posttest and a retention test two weeks later were given to students. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis were used on the data. Results showed that T2 was relatively superior to T1 in producing better performance on solving mathematical sentences of the form ab = x, ax = b, and xa = b, and on solving the same type of mathematical sentences in an isomorphic model. Better performance was associated with higher level of reflective intelligence in learning a second-order mathematical system. (DT)",

        "description":"Certification candidates from the University of Texas at Austin for the years from 1960-1971 were surveyed in an attempt to evaluate the quality of the mathematics teacher preparation program. A questionnaire was sent to 503 people; 300 replied. Findings showed that continuous teaching since certification was reported by 111 people and another 54 had taught almost continuously. Additional courses in a variety of fields had been taken by 168 respondents; 50 had completed a masters degree, 45 more were actively working toward the completion of a masters degree, 10 had achieved the doctorate, and 8 more were actively involved in a doctoral program. Reasons for leaving the teaching profession, opinions regarding the format for student teaching, present occupations other than  teaching, and teaching experience are tabulated. It was noted that 141 teachers began teaching in junior high school assignments. Comments on the teacher preparation program are summarized; there was an expressed need for practical courses in adolescent psychology, help in identifying learning disabilities, and more emphasis on the learning process. The most frequently mentioned request concerning methods courses was for a more practical approach. Earlier involvement in the public schools, more time in the schools, and more variety in the assignments were also requested. (DT)",

The study was part of a research program directed toward improving navigation techniques for low-level flight in Army aircraft and was made to assess the feasibility of visually estimating angles on a map in order to determine angles of drift. Eighteen subjects were randomly divided into a control group and two training groups. One group was trained using angles drawn on plain white cards and the other group used angles drawn on both cards and tactical maps. The groups estimated the size of angles ranging from 1 degree to 18 degrees. After training, it was found that the test performance of the two training groups on map items was significantly superior to test performance of the  control group; on card items there were no significant differences between the two training groups and the control group. There were no significant differences between the two training groups on either card items or map items. The authors conclude that visual estimation of angles on maps appears to be a feasible technique for determining angles of drift. (DT)",

Students learn particular logical and psychological processes with which to gain greater conscious control over themselves, their inter-personal relations, and their environment. A theoretical section briefly suggests why a period of drastic social change demands a curriculum more relevant to the concerns of students and presents an information processing model of man as the basis on which to develop such a curriculum. A rationale for teaching particular processes, as opposed to specific content, is developed and a model sequence is outlined, as is a model for teaching a particular lesson. Two courses built on these models are  described in detailed course outlines and lesson plans. A communications course concentrates on processes most important for personal and interpersonal growth. The content centers around the study of media -- print, films, sculpture and music -- and the study of group interaction. An urban affairs course concentrates on processes most important for social growth, with content focusing on the student's own neighborhood as a microcosm of his city. A self-evaluation survey and a bibliography on affective education are included. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"Ethnography as an inquiry process guided by a point of view rather than as a reporting process guided by a standard technique or set of techniques is the main point of this essay which suggests the application of Malinowski's theories and methods to an ethnology of the school, indicates reasons why traditional ethnography is inadequate to the study of schools, and locates the school as an institution within a larger societal context and the researcher as a member of that society. The first steps of a fieldwork inquiry process, as presented, require the statement of researchable question while keeping in mind the fact that what is commonplace to observers and to participants is nonetheless extraordinary and that what goes on in the school involves the interaction of individuals,  groups, and social units outside of the school. To exemplify the inquiry process the issue of ethnicity as a factor in a school ethnographic study is identified for research and amplified by questions pertinent to field research. (JH)",

The data are graphed by percent of teachers' responses at each grade level, by totals, and by regions. Interpretation of the data should take into account the little time available to teachers to familiarize themselves with and teach the units. The major hypotheses of this program are: (1) that teachers and students want educational materials that attempt to present controversial issues in the classroom, (2) that this practice has a generally favorable  effect on students, and (3) that it would not undermine students' respect for the American system or for reasonable rules and authority. The questionnaire covers the following: units and grades taught by each teacher, reactions to the teaching guide, opinions on content of an approach to materials, the student text, teachers' observations of student reactions and behavioral changes, changes in the students' relationships to authority figures and to school rules, and profiles of the teachers.

        "description":"Demand for courses in population problems has increased along with growing public awareness and concern for population-related matters. This paper describes an undergraduate classroom experience which provides an alternative approach to teaching population problems by replacing usual educational materials with selections from science fiction literature. A justification for the use of science fiction is that it coincides with one of the primary goals of sociology, the prediction and understanding of human behavior in its social context. A one-quarter, sophomore-level, introductory course is discussed in terms of student motivation, teacher objectives, and course structure. Course sections on growth, vital processes, and population policy rely on science fiction and traditional  readings, class presentations, and class discussion to indicate some of the wide-ranging relations that exist between population phenomena and the gamut of social-structural phenomena. Evaluation of the approach is positive as based on increased student interest and participation, even though the coverage of subject matter is somewhat reduced. A briefly annotated bibliography of science fiction and suggested testing options are appended. (Author/KSM)",

Tables reflect an attempt by the class, homogeneous and interracial in character, to explore their own perceptions, prejudices, and feelings centered around their differences in race. While several similar responses to those obtained with blacks and whites are contained, there are significant differences. The recognition that all minority groups are not the same and their problems are culturespecific is observed as crucial in  dealing with the white-Chicano and white-Chinese problems. The matrix of assumptions and behaviors of white, Chinese, and Chicano groups intersecting with assumptions and behaviors which block or facilitate authentic relations reveal the importance of the perception of minority group problems as those of a particular racial group, not just any nonwhite group.

        "description":"The Symposium on Population and Human Rights drew together 28 experts in various disciplines to formulate scientific opinion on the interrelationships between population and human rights and, more specifically, to provide inputs for the World Population Plan of Action. The symposium devoted its attention to the human rights standards which have a direct influence on the three main demographic variables of fertility, mortality, and migration. The symposium report contains a summary of the main conclusions reached during the week-long meeting. Areas of concensus for each of the demographic variables, including internal and international migration, are spelled out. Other sections present summaries of discussions on the implications of population trends for the formulation and  exercise of human rights; on roles of the community, state, and other institutions in safeguarding and promoting human rights in the light of population trends; and on the role of international organizations in formulating human rights connected with population matters. Annexes contain the agenda, list of participants, and a list of technical and background papers. (Author/KSM)",

        "author":["Sizer, Nancy F."],
        "description":"John Dewey's 2-year visit to China after World War I resulted in a continuing influence of his ideas on institutions and beliefs of modern Chinese education. Looked at against background of both traditional and Communist China, Dewey's ideas serve to illustrate the thesis that, while he is vilified, Deweyism is alive in Communist China and that his beliefs concerning individualism, democracy, moral persuasion, and theory vs. practice are still part of the Chinese philosophic concern. The current attempt of self-improvement in China is considered a central value in education. Dewey's idea of democracy is close to the Chinese tradition of government which relied more on the power of example and of persuasion than of force. From the point of view of the accountability of the regime  to popular opinion, it is seen that Chinese Communists draw on a political tradition altered by Dewey's notion of moral persuasion. Institutions which are most essentially Deweyan today are the half-work half-study or May 7 schools which stress practice over theory, reminding one of the progressive movement in education. Dewey's definitions of individualism, democracy, moral persuasion, and theory vs. practice are not accepted in China, but progressive educational theories are practiced extensively. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"Very little is taught about Asian Americans in United States' education institutions at any level of instruction. Evaluations of standard U.S. history and social studies textbooks since World War II show that most are inadequate in their coverage of minority groups to the extent that they have encouraged the perpetuation of negative stereotypes. Inaccurate vocabulary is encountered in materials, as is the casual lumping together of Asians in Asia and Asians in America. Significant historical episodes involving Asian Americans, relevant to all Americans, are still ignored by elementary and secondary courses on social studies and U.S. history. The emphasis of the American educational system on the Western and White-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant traditions is no longer acceptable. The  movement for fundamental changes in our educational process toward the goal of cultural pluralism has great potential. Serious consideration of the following is urged to remedy this situation: (1) expansion of bilingual programs and of foreign language programs in general; (2) more accurate representation of nonwestern civilizations; (3) more appropriate treatment of Asian American contributions to the development of the United States; (4) evaluation of instructional materials to rectify distortions or omission of the Asian American experience; and (5) support to study all Asian and Pacific Americans in educational institutions.

Cubberly, and his pietistic picture of the public school, with historical perspectives that relegate public education to being one of many educational functions in American culture and with the view that public schools &quot;miseducate&quot; the American people. Neither provides the constructive conceptual framework that modernization -- the accelerated interaction of long term trends such as urbanization, the centralizing power of the nation-state, and racial and ethnic integration -- does. Such a framework might be the first corrective for the revisionism of the 50's and 60's. The second, a re-examination of the role of organized schooling in social change, should focus on the institutional history of  education. The third requires a more sedulous view of the history of American education in comparative and international perspective as a phase of the modernization of Western civilization. The fourth corrective must be attention to the role of organized public education in building a political community in the United States, a traditional role for public education, but one long overlooked by educational historians.

        "description":"To show that there are crucial assumptions of the cognitive-developmental approach to moral education made about the nature of moral reasoning which may not be warranted, sixty public school students randomly selected from two middle schools and two high schools, were interviewed on twelve different dilemmas. Transcripts of the interviews, discussing three dilemmas within each of the four forms of moral reasoning, were scored and analyzed. Findings indicated that the cognitive-developmental claim of naturally occurring invariant development of stages of moral reasoning was confirmed for only three of the four forms of moral reasoning. Research raised the following questions about assumptions underlying Kohlberg's rationale: whether raising an individual's level of moral reasoning  on one form of reasoning produces a concomitant advancement in his reasoning on an alternate form of reasoning; and if Kohlberg's moral education program stimulates the key form of moral reasoning for moral action. The conclusion reached is that for a moral education program to be maximally effective, it ought to focus on naturally occurring situations within the life-space of the students and ask of them deliberation about their prospective behavior other than to exclusively form judgements about others behavior.

Intended for elementary and secondary level students, the project's main objectives are: (1) to improve student self-image and understanding; (2) to acquaint students with value clarification; and (3) to teach goal setting techniques. The program, designed by a group of professionals and interested citizens, consists of the development of classroom curriculum materials, analyzed and developed by educators, and the establishment of a teacher training program. A survey of teachers, parents, and students determines questions to which students need answers. Information which answers these questions is arranged into individualized programs and  packages called unipacs, which are made available to school and community. In an effort to share with others what they have learned, the project developers will visit and consult with individual school districts. Several available publications which treat the project are listed. The titles of the 29 unipacs with designated grade level are also listed. (Author/RM)",

Several ideals or models of community in the past and present are described. It is noted that the concept of community, while just coming into its own in education, still faces serious problems. Utilization of community resources is promoted as a new way to \"get it all together\" to improve education and society in general. New perspectives on education springing from the community are reviewed and a restructuring of decision-making processes is called for in order to make community involvement, control, and participation a reality. A discussion of the effects of the community school relationship on the traditional school model  and facilities is followed by an interview with an architect-planner who offers responses to the needs of teachers, children and parents to make the school a more humane place for learning as well as a community center. The concept of the year round school is elaborated in relation to better utilization of school facilities. Projects around the country are spotlighted to give an idea of what is happening, and where, in school community relations. A list of resources concludes the booklet. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"The literature on the behavior effects of videotaped playback reveals that little theoretical formulation has been offered to explain the positive results which have been reported. Two theoretical models are considered in regard to these results. The first, a reinforcement model, suggests that some behaviors are reinforced positively and some negatively during playback. The second model, derived from an attribution theory, suggests that videotaped playback introduces the perceptual bias of observers to the actor and augments his belief in personal causality. The two models make different predictions about the effects of playback over time. The reinforcement model predicts that the modification of behavior should increase as the number of playbacks increases. The attribution model  predicts an inverse relationship between exposure to playback and behavior change. These predictions were tested using small groups of elementary school children in social studies classes. Results indicated support for the attribution model for direct playback conditions and for the reinforcement model for vicarious (viewing of another group) playback conditions. Implications for both theory and practice are discussed. (Author/KSM)",

The report focuses on the teacher's role in the MACOS curriculum, specifically with expectations for performance and attitudinal factors of teacher behavior. The project attempted to identify behaviors, operationally defined, which constitute child-centered instruction; the problems associated with the evaluation of child-centered, nondirective, dialectical teaching; the instruments most effective and efficient for evaluating these behaviors; and the child-centered behaviors and attitudes exhibited by teachers of MACOS. The rationale, procedures,  and review of data-gathering instruments are followed by results and discussion. In summary, the instruments seem to constitute a promising battery for assessing the degree to which teachers adopt student-centered behaviors and attitudes as a result of teaching the MACOS curriculum. Appendices containing the instruments, base data, and quotes and drawings follow a bibliography. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"The contribution of sociologists to social action programs has been notable for being unnotable, with a few important exceptions. Yet the future and survival of sociology lies in moving sociology more obviously from the classroom to the world outside. Sociologists suffer from a restricted vision of what their discipline can do, which causes them to be preoccupied with theorizing and allows them to think of problems as potential journal articles. One reason for the failure of sociologists to have an impact on social action is that applied research, the generation of new information helpful in problem solving, as opposed to theoretical research, the testing of new theories, is lacking. Theory is useless without concrete knowledge of a community with which to work. Another reason is  that sociologists are not really professionally competent; they are unable to identify concrete manifestations in patterned social interaction. The fault is in the training which relies, for instance, on abstract definitions and descriptive accounts rather than use of the community as a laboratory. The emerging sub-discipline, the sociology of development, is one step, however, toward bringing about more effective sociologists for the good of the entire discipline. (Author/JH)",

Social power is the potential influence which an agent could exert over some person. The means for exercising that power could be in the form of any of six bases falling into the following categories: informational power, which is socially independent; coercion and reward, which are socially dependent on surveillance; and expert power, referent power, and legitimate power, which are socially dependent without surveillance. Various studies, such as a survey of the power husbands and wives use with respect to one another and a survey of the power students perceive as being exercised by their teachers and fellow students, are described to indicate the usefulness of the  power base concept. Recent directions and ideas for further research using the concept of social power are mentioned and include assigning attribution of causality for change and social power and relating the cause of change with the choice of base for its accomplishment.

Based on concepts from stage theory, the objectives of the classes are to increase the level of psychological maturity of the pupils while teaching particular psychological skills. The course is designed as a practicum and seminar experience in which listening skills and empathy responses are developed through actual peer counseling experience. Practicum sessions consist of sequential training in role playing exercises, examinations of counseling tapes, and counseling of high school peers. Seminar sessions include readings on communication and discussions of counseling films and tapes. Each of the class activities and writing assignments are  described. Statistical results from evaluations of skill development confirm counselors' and teachers' impressions of growth and maturity in participating students. It is felt that a series of complimentary courses using this intervention format could expand and enrich the standard academic subject-oriented teaching at the secondary level. (Author/KSM)",

Four major content changes include the trend away from expository history and toward the behavioral sciences, attention to the analysis of individual values, systematic and realistic study of public issues, and closer concern with local needs, resources, and problems. New instructional strategies emphasize experiential learning, the use of role-playing activities, group discussions, student selection of courses and assignments, and other inquiry oriented  activities. Representing these trends, the active school programs are described in terms of content, form, and implementation with names and addresses for further contact with the programs for interested readers.

In positing this new model of inquiry the assumption has been made that a pedagogical inquiry model need not necessarily be an accurate reflection of scientific inquiry. Two things must be expected of a pedagogical model: that it encourage students to make bold conjectures and to severely test these same conjectures. Problems with use of the hypothetical-deduction model, which represents science for most people and which is at the heart of all inquiry models advocated for classroom use, have to do with the nature of hypothesis formation, with the bias created by the hypothesis, and with  the easy acceptance of an hypothesis on the basis of any degree of confirmation. The multiple-competing hypothesis model meets the requirements for a pedagogical model through the formulation of several hypotheses which are mutually exclusive and which must be refuted by the student rather than proved.

This change, coupled with the fact that museum visitation is a highly social activity, raises some interesting possibilities for evaluation of learning in non-traditional environments. It also calls for an emphasis on the social learning basis behind the use of institutions like museums. To facilitate the awareness of these social learning potentials more information is needed on museums as institutions: how they reach and develop their audiences, the social nature of museum visiting, and socially based learning criteria for museum settings. In  addition, innovative strategies in evaluation and some kind of theoretical framework are needed. (Author)",

        "description":"This report is a synthesis of five research studies comparing the facilitative effects on learning of searching and reception modes of study. The following five studies are discussed: (1) J.R. Dale, the effects on achievement of using the forced inferential response mode in an intermediate grade population-geography unit; (2) D.D. Dumbleton, the effects of guided inquiry and expository materials on cognitive learning, retention, and transfer in a social studies unit for secondary level students; (3) R.P. Fishburne, a comparison of a programmed and a non-programmed text on evolution for the fifth grade; (4) J.C. Pelletti, the effects of graphic roles on learning geography materials in the middle grades; and (5) F. Thomas, the use of programmed instruction for teaching anthropology  in the fifth grade. The results of the studies show no significant difference in favor of reception over searching modes. Searching modes, however, are comparatively inefficient when time is a measured variable. The report suggests the need for more systematic research of teaching techniques in social studies which involve the examination of many variables such as learning task, and pupil and teacher aptitude and attitude. Also included is an historical explanation of the popularity of inquiry. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"An introduction to a symposium on the development of adolescent schooling is followed by one of several presentations concerning current thinking about the problems involved in developing experimenting schools. The paper elaborates the basic propositions about modernization, the process of school reform seen as a process of social learning, and the methods of evolutionary experimentation. It is proposed that the school as a whole, conceived as a developing social organism, be taken as an experimental proposition to be shaped and reformed through methods of evolutionary experimentation. The goal of this experimentation, and the criterion for it, is to discover and to operate schools which can facilitate learning by adolescents who are in charge of their own learning processes and  cope successfully with the problems and opportunities they confront. It is felt that modernization permits, as well as demands, that attemps be undertaken to learn what schools might become. In conclusion, it is noted that to discover how to make schooling facilitative and supportive of the development of the young, it is essential to consider school as an experimental proposition.

Data are gathered on child behavior and socialization practices from fifth, sixth, and seventh graders. Settings in the two major waves of field work completed are kibbutzim, cities, and moshavim. Instruments administered provided information on the behaviors of a child's socializing agents, on his commitment socially-sanctioned behaviors, and on his development of a social and work identity as opposed to a sense of alienation. The results contradict the beliefs that kibbutz parents offer little nurturance to their children, that the peer group is the child's major source of support on  the kibbutz, and that sex differences are uniformly of smaller magnitude on the kibbutz. Expected relationships borne out by the data are that kibbutz children are more independent of parents while children of Eastern origin exhibit less autonomy than those of Western background. Appendixes include a description of sample, and articles on testing for group differences, reactions to social pressure, and socialization of moral behavior in cross-cultural perspective.

At present, schools and the social studies profession are not providing children with a reasonably good guide to human culture. There are, however, a number of contributions that schools can make toward the three stated objectives, including furnishing an appropriate conceptual map of human culture which would tell students what culture is, where they can find it, and what they will see when they look at it, and how students relate to culture and how culture relates to their natural environment. This map  of culture would also illuminate the structure of the cultural universe, sensitize children to recognize the diversity of cultures in the world and in their everyday life, provide awareness that they and other human beings can be victims of culture, and prepare them for the solutions to transnationally shared problems.

Chapter one provides the framework on which the model was constructed and includes statistics for three major categories: public and private sectors; nursery, elementary, secondary, and college levels; and sex. Other variables considered include professional training, matrimonial status, age, experience, religious affiliation of  school, and type of region (urban or rural).

The first step was to identify the characteristics of the recreationists at the sites. Anyone engaging in any one of 27 different kinds of outdoor recreation activities was considered a recreationist. An economic model was developed that included two major limiting factors that influence recreationists to choose one site over another. These are the economic and leisure time factors. The purpose of the study was to determine, site by site, which recreational  activities should be encouraged and which should be discouraged. The results of the survey are reported in several tabulations, including a) characteristics of recreationists, b) inventory of facilities, c) investments of facilities, d) costs to recreationists, e) direct and indirect benefits, f) recreational values by activities, g) values based on changes and income and leisure time, and h) quality of site.

It is the responsibility of the physical education teacher and supervisor to develop community support for his program through various public relations efforts. Because students are the primary interface between a school program and the public, it is important that the physical education teacher establish a good relationship with his students. A goal-oriented program and the enthusiasm of students are the primary public relations tools of the physical education teacher and supervisor. Another important method of gaining public support is through the mass media--newspapers, radio, and TV. Reports of programs and the accomplishment of their  objectives are interesting and desirable news in most communities. A third way of promoting school physical education programs is through demonstrations and exhibitions of physical education activities, which have been found to draw approximately three adults for each pupil participant. Exhibitions can be demonstrations by a single school or competitions among schools in a city, county, or school district. (HMD)",

Analysis of covariance revealed a significant difference between the groups. Significant differences were found between both the 85 percent and 75 percent groups and the control. No significant differences were found between the 65 percent group and the control or between the 75 percent and the 85 percent group. Within the limitations of the study,  it was concluded that when comparing between training intensities while holding mechanical work constant, it is necessary to work at a minimum of 75 percent of heart rate maximum to elicit significant changes in oxygen intake maximum.

This report is an analysis of the paths by which individuals are attracted to, trained for, enter, and reenter the teaching profession. A review of previous analyses of the teacher market is followed by development of a theoretical model of occupational choice that identifies the influence of economic factors on an individual's career decision. The model is estimated cross-sectionally, using currently available data on teacher production rates by State. Results suggest that a) previous studies have overestimated the annual supplies of new teachers; b) the teacher surplus is likely to peak and then begin to decline in the near future; c) if anticipated declines materialize, the surplus  is likely to end in the early 1980s; and d) there is a distinct possibility that the system will \"overrespond\" to the surplus, in the sense that a significant teacher shortage will follow.

        "description":"As States move toward performance-based teacher education and certification, a determination of the function of the State must be made. Within the approved program approach, and along a continuum from decentralized control and decision making to centralized control, five models of certification can be identified: process, information, facilitation, guidelines, and prescriptive. In the process model, the State is to define the process for the development of teacher education programs, stating who is to be involved and the nature of their involvement. In the information model, the State's role is to maintain records, with local school teams conducting evaluation of potential teachers. In the facilitation model, the control is left to colleges, but their direction comes from the  State. The guidelines model calls for performance criteria to be stated in generic terms by the State agency and for the criteria to be further specified by the preparatory institution. In the prescriptive model, the State provides very specific performance criteria which are utilized by the colleges as objectives and evaluative criteria. Many States now operate in a manner similar to one of the described models. State certification agencies will adopt programs similar to one of these models according to their perception of their role in the teacher education and certification process. (HMD)",

SESIN activities include information search, analysis, collection, and retrieval services; instructional materials and media information; workshops and demonstrations; career-oriented consultations; dissemination of project literature; and resource and referral services. The SESIN service function is accomplished in three steps:  a) the student identifies and refines his information need with the assistance of an on-campus SESIN student representative, who b) transmits the request to the central SESIN offices, where c) relevant materials are gathered, packaged, and mailed directly to the student requester. Among the benefits derived from SESIN and similar operations are that campus resources are supplemented in a cost efficient manner; duplication of effort is minimized; systemwide fragmentation of teacher education is reduced; and information about student needs is generated from the service statistics of the operation.

The official generating force for the development of a plan for PBTE can come from legislatures, chief state school officers, or state education agencies. Legislated PBTE is least desirable because of the inflexibility of law. Goal statements should be conceptually broad while providing a rationale for PBTE through a statement of expected outcomes. The decision regarding  the amount of control to be exercised by the state is critical, because it will determine the amount and type of experimentation teacher preparation institutions will engage in. There are several models of the state function ranging from very tight control to very flexible guidance. Certification patterns are critical because of their implications for subsequent steps in the planning process. PBTE delivery systems must be devised for both pre- and in-service teacher education. Support mechanisms should be coordinated by a Competency Management Center. The management plan for PBTE implementation should be comprehensive, specific, and long-range. (HMD)",

        "description":"This speech focuses on the role that research and development can and will play in the planning and operation of teacher centers over the next few years. The speech is divided into three sections for the three critical issues that are discussed: a) issues concerning policy analysis related to teacher centers, b) issues in the development and operation of local teacher centers that relate to research and development, and c) issues concerning teacher centers as vehicles for research on teacher effectiveness. Specifically, the first section reviews the current teacher surplus, current staff sizes, and financial limitations in staffing. The second section stresses the need for some \"Vince Lombardis in Program Development\"; Lombardi's football success came from a careful analysis of  strategy--the efforts of his team, the opponent team, the weather, the press. Section 3 considers teacher centers as vehicles for discussing competencies which ought to be required for state certification. The author summarizes by expressing his view that in the future teacher centers will be involved in policy analysis and organization development and research issues, but not in the conduct of teacher effectiveness.

        "description":"This paper reports on a program to increase the effectiveness of English instruction with inner-city students involving the development of a systematic approach to classroom management. Implementation of the program included defining appropriate behavioral roles of teacher and students, providing positive consequences for appropriate student behaviors, maintaining accurate records of classroom behavior, and developing flexibility in managing classroom learning situations. The participants, 36 academic underachievers enrolled in two high school junior English classes, were asked to list behavior they considered inappropriate in the classroom and free time privileges they would enjoy. To decrease the high rate of inappropriate behavior, a system was established giving points for  specified in-class activities that could be exchanged for 10 minutes of free time. To increase communication skills, students were asked to respond to a variety of stimuli in written and verbalized form. Independent study was used as a motivational device and teaching aid. Most students quickly began working and maintained a high level of appropriate behavior throughout the study; there was an increase in class attendance; and students were willing to complete academic tasks. The authors conclude that this study demonstrates that a single classroom teacher, through the systematic use of a student-centered behavioral management program, can produce positive changes in the behavior of a class of underachieving students.

        "description":"In this project, the concept of pupil control ideology was studied as it applied to student teachers. Those students at Central Missouri State University who were completing their student teaching experience during the winter and spring terms of 1970 participated in the study. The two hypotheses tested were that a) there will be no significant difference in the mean scores of pupil control ideologies of student teachers from different socioeconomic backgrounds and b) there will be no significant change in the pupil control ideology of teachers in the primary grades group with respect to their pretest and posttest scores. The measurement instrument was the Pupil Control Ideology form. Within the limitations of the study, both null hypotheses were accepted. The findings suggest  that belief orientations that student teachers hold about pupil control are not influenced significantly by the effects of differing socioeconomic status and that the student teacher's perceptions of life in the classroom relative to pupil control and his actual experiences in the classroom are fairly congruent.

Among the conclusions drawn from the study are that (a) an issue-oriented classification of research simplifies prioritization  of research efforts because of its functional relationship to policy making; (b) both problem- and solution-oriented research is necessary, and it is the educational administrator who should decide priorities for solution-oriented research and take responsibility for its undertaking, while the academician researches problems; and (c) similarities of the patterns of the issues from country to country in Africa suggest that the problems of educational development are roughly equivalent throughout.

S. vary widely in size and structure. Funding patterns also differ from country to country: in England, centers are funded largely through local education agencies; in Japan, the Prefecture of Education provides most of the funding; and in the U. S., the U. S. Office of Education generally provides funds for the initiation of a center, while subsequent operation is  paid for by the state or local education agency. Some functional problems are common to teacher centers in all three countries: (a) how to encourage teachers to participate in the activities of the center; (b) how to remain responsive to teachers, while being supported by sources outside the teacher group; and (c) how to staff a teacher center.

The authors state as a guiding argument that while inmates are severely handicapped according to traditional academic measures, in terms of the current movement in education towards individualized instruction nowhere is there a more fertile ground for receptive students than in correctional institutions. The following problems are cited: the lack of programs to prepare inmates for socially constructive roles in communities; job discrimination against former inmates (the New Careers program for rehabilitated offenders is discussed as a solution for this); and the poverty background of many prisoners. The document reports specifically on work release programs; the prevention of  juvenile delinquency through education; vocational, career, and college programs; and the education and certification of teachers of inmates.

Such projects should be decided on after a study of the needs of the community. After a project is selected, all relevant information should be gathered and studied, objectives defined, school administrators and community leaders involved. In implementing the project, the teacher should be sure to provide initial direction to the students and ensure that emotional satisfaction attends each step of the project. The teacher should be considerate of other teachers' plans, keep permanent records, and secure appropriate publicity for the project. Evaluation of the  community service project should consist of interim and final reports that contain information of learning results achieved, the contribution made to the improvement of the community, and the group's procedures. One example of a successful project based on these guidelines is the Cash for Trash program at the State University of New York in Buffalo, in which students operate a recycling service that pays residents of the inner city for separated trash.

Field-based teacher education is defined as an on-site teacher education center in a school or group of schools that may be used for observing, practicing methodology, and learning and practicing methods on-site the entire year. The following generalizations are made concerning field-based teacher education programs. One, teacher education centers should be governed under a principle of \"shared sovereignity.\" Two, joint planning and goal setting by the college of education and participating schools must precede all field-based activities. Three, there must be an on-going means of reporting and evaluating. Four, undergraduates in the college of  education should have an extensive field-based experience. Five, students should experience a variety of ethnic and socioeconomic environments. Six, there is a need to review present faculty expectations regarding teaching load and responsibilities. Seven, in-service education must be an inherent component of any field-based program. Eight, the college of education must organize more effectively to meet in-service needs in areas such as instruction, curriculum, and program evaluation and research.

There are several aspects of a competency-based program to be considered in its evaluation. The first is whether or not there is a justifiable need for the specified competency. Secondly, the market, if any, must be identified. The testing of the program or specific competency must be considered to assure that the test population is comparable to the population for which the program is to be used. The program should be compared for effectiveness to the alternatives on the educational market. It must be tested over an extended period of time to determine its long-range impact. An evaluator of  competency-based programs must also determine if there are any undesirable side effects of the program and whether the process itself has any damaging attributes. It is also necessary to determine whether the positive results of a field test are actually due to the program or to some outside factor. After evaluation of all the aspects of the program and its development, the program as a whole must be considered in light of its cost to see if it is a cost effective improvement for the schools.

The measurement techniques used in the evaluation process were derived from operant conditioning. Effectiveness was judged in terms of the attainment by the pupils of teacher-specified objectives. The availability of a pupil behavior change measure for evaluating teaching effectiveness was illustrated in the context of an adjunct teacher training program. First, the teaching effectiveness of the instructors in the seminar portion of the adjunct program was assessed by measuring behavior change in the student teachers enrolled. Several of the student teachers were then evaluated in a similar manner during their student teaching experiences by  measuring behavior change in their deaf pupils. The data concerning changes in student teaching behavior during the instructional phase of the adjunct teaching program clearly demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the teaching procedures. Although the teaching procedures used were not effective, the use of the behavior change measure was well illustrated.

Summarizing, the author states that teachers can gain much intellectual satisfaction from using a  syntactical model of classroom situations to develop understanding of the concept of theory.

Through this cooperative effort, school staff were permitted to use Wheelock's library and resource center and to attend seminars and mini-workshops. The cooperating teacher received recognition not only as an educator of young children, but also as an educator of teachers. The Wheelock College Teacher Education program was strengthened by offering students opportunities to become more integrally involved in the school, its services, and its community, thereby developing a more realistic understanding of the teacher's role. The Teacher Education Centers provide opportunities for personal and professional renewal for both students and teachers  through: (a) opportunities for joint appointees of the college and the school to take sabbatical leave for study at the college, (b) participation by selected seniors in a productive work-study program, and (c) increased opportunity for support to teachers by the school and the college. Teacher Education Center students agreed that participation in the center helped them to become more attuned to children both in and out of school; that the college teacher was more accessible to them in the center; and that total immersion in the real work-world of the teacher was a beneficial learning experience.

Findings are based on parents' ratings on a self-administered and a trained interviewer-administered medical history of children, which were examined in the Health Examination Survey of 1963-65. A probability sample of 7,417 children was selected. Ninety-six percent of the sample examined were found to be closely representative with respect to age, sex, race, region, and other available demographic and socioeconomic variables. Included are data on key aspects of early development concerning general behavior, sleep and eating behavior, peer relations, behavior problems, the extent of responsibility  in the home, the extent of participation in organized activities, and general use of time. Whenever possible, comparison was made with findings from previous studies. (A 23-item bibliography and 3 tables are included.) (PD)",

Of the 1,143 questionnaires which were distributed, 69 percent were returned. A tabulation of responses to the questionnaire shows the following results: (a) 95 percent of responding institutions offer physical education programs for the general student, while 74 percent require physical education and 8 percent require physical education in some schools and departments; (b) in institutions where the physical education requirement has been eliminated, approximately 25 percent of the students elect to take physical education; (c) greater flexibility in physical education programs allows options for students and faculty with regard  to independent study, competency exams, the grading system, and general class routine; (d) there is an increasing tendency for these programs to be given for academic credit; (e) recreational activities continue to grow in prevalence while team sports show a decrease; (f) the majority of physical education courses are now coeducational; and (g) some institutions express satisfaction with the elimination of the required physical education citing improved programs and attitudes on the part of students who elect physical education. Responses are presented in two tables: one groups the institutions by size and compares results with those of similar studies, and the second groups institutions according to their affiliation and to whether or not the student body is male, female, or both.

The definition of the task should make provisions for listing the equipment, materials, and tools to be used and the external conditions affecting performance of the entire task. Definitions should also list the stages of performance of  the task and the various elements within each stage--an element being the basic skill level above that of fine motor skills. This task description is then analyzed for the requisite skills and knowledge, after which tasks can be organized for presentation to the student. To avoid repetition of skills and knowledge, similar tasks should be grouped, and the elements of tasks should be categorized according to their stages (preparation, execution, evaluation, and termination) to determine similarities of elements across tasks. In this manner, similar skills can be taught once. (HMD)",

        "description":"This interim evaluation of the Missouri Environmental Studies Approach (MESA) for the period July 1972-June 1973 measured attainment of three objectives, which state that (a) participating teachers will use Environmental Studies (ES) materials in their teaching as a result of two intensive workshops during the summer of 1972; (b) the teacher's role will change so that students will take more responsibility for learning, and the teacher will tend to use the open classroom approach; and (c) students will learn to use the total environment as resource material. The first objective, which was measured by the number of assignments teachers gave directly from, or modeled on, ES materials, was attained. The second objective was evaluated by an outside consultant who reported that  teachers' roles had indeed changed as a result of implementation of the Environmental Studies Approach. The third objective was measured by two tests: the &quot;About Me Test&quot; and the &quot;Positive-Negative Adjective List.&quot; The results of both of these tests showed that children's self-concept and self-esteem were improved. A national evaluator of the ES approach commented that MESA project results were more pronounced than the national results which showed that (a) students using ES learned more content pertaining to environment than control students and (b) ES materials fostered more decision making on the part of both students and teachers and helped to improve students' self-image.

Much of the research quoted stresses the need to consult teachers on their opinions of their educational needs. A study is described that assessed the current status and future directions for inservice activities as expressed by Massachusetts home economic teachers. The instrument used in the study was a questionnaire. Results and findings of the study are listed. It is concluded that: (a) much is to be gained by \"asking the teacher\" concerning the future of inservice activities and (b) the results of the Massachusetts study indicate the need for a greater variety of types and lengths of activities, for measures to increase teacher motivation for continuous  professional growth, and for more inservice programs offered for graduate credits.

        "description":"The basic movement pattern used in skilled individual rope jumping performance was determined and used as a model against which to evaluate the rope jumping form used by children at various levels of skills development. The techniques of adults and nursery school children were filmed and analyzed. The specific causes of unsuccessful attempts were identified tentatively and categorically. Performances which met an arbitrary minimal standard of success (two consecutive, continuous successful jumps) were analyzed to determine the general sequence of rope jumping movements and the changes in timing of arm-leg coordination as speed increased. From various levels of skill demonstrated by the children, it was possible to sort out changes in leg action, arm and hand movements, and  arm-leg coordination that seemed to represent developmental changes in rope jumping form. Despite the variety of style in leg movements and other aspects of form in the initial stages of skill development, the developmental movement patterns in rope jumping changed progressively to a narrowly singular one used in speed jumping.

Included are methods for selecting, combining, and developing evaluation measures, which are verified statistically by analyses of data collected from a stratified sample of approximately 4,500 children. A screening instrument to be utilized by classroom teachers in the identification of suspected deficiencies in P-M functioning was completed for an additional 1,803 children. A wide range of deficiencies in psycho-motor functioning were revealed in all grade levels examined. The pattern of incidence indicates that for a large number of children, continued improvement of P-M skills will not occur without intervention. On the  basis of this study three major areas of concern require further attention: (1) teacher education geared toward awareness and development of P-M functioning, (2) expansion of curriculum to include objectives, and (3) further development of test instruments and investigation of the P-M domain.

        "description":"The concept of scaled achievement tests is discussed and a method of selecting those items of a test that form the most scalable (i.e., having the highest coefficient of reproducibility) subset is presented. Sometimes called a monotonic-deterministic model, this type of test assumes that the test items may be sequentially ordered. To determine the probability of obtaining a given coefficient of reproducibility, two statistics are required: the expected value of the coefficient; and the standard error of the expected value. The procedures used to eliminate the items that do not fit the model are described by example. Tests were constructed to measure two skills, elementary addition and elementary subtraction, and were administered to pupils in grades 2-6. The resulting data were  statistically analyzed and a coefficient of reproducibility was calculated to determine how well the tests had been scaled. The tests were then administered to another sample. The results of the replication were much the same: internal consistency estimates of test reliability were almost identical for both tests. Most significantly, it was demonstrated that both of the hypothesized orderings of tasks were stable across samples. (Author/RC)",

Marked similarity among the original structure, the item-overlap-free structure, and the built-in structure was observed.

Two types of tables from this report should be most useful for educational evaluation studies. First are tables that show equivalent raw scores for individual pupils for each of the 28 pairs of reading comprehension and vocabulary tests. The structure of these tables is presented. A second set of equivalency tables, nearly identical in structure, shows equivalent raw-score means for schools, on each of the 28 pairs of tests. Separate tables are provided by the study for  individuals and groups of pupils in grades 4-6. To illustrate the use of the Anchor Test Study results in educational evaluations, four designs are considered. A second tool considered is sampling theory, not often used to advantage in educational evaluation. For studies that involve populations exceeding 300 units of analysis, both matrix sampling and respondent sampling should be considered. References are given for further discussions of these methods.

The results of this test indicate the level at which a pupil should begin the program, or if he should move directly into the basal reading program. Unit Assessment Cards are provided at the end of each lesson unit to check each pupil's ability to comprehend and produce the language structures developed  in the unit. Following the unit assessment, a unit review is conducted. This provides a basis for assigning further practice on unit objectives which pupils have not attained. The End of Program Test assesses the student's capability to retain the skills taught in the program. An important objective in the development of LCS has been to develop instructional assessment strategies and operational procedures that will help integrate the program into extant bicultural, bilingual programs.

Empirical research to support the content of the outline is elaborated in detail  in the succeeding section. Finally, a rationale for the use of a test-wiseness learning program to be used in the school is presented, and several possible procedures as to how such a program could be implemented are suggested.

The dimensions to be observed and measured in an assessment center program should stem from factors demonstrated to be inherent in job performance at the target level. Techniques generally used in assessment center programs such as the in-basket, the leaderless group discussion, techniques of group observation, management games, and role playing are described. The selection or development of these techniques depends on the time and resources available to the organization considering the use of the  Assessment Center Method. (BB)",

Four aspects of a discriminant analysis are considered. They are: (1) separation: determining intergroup significant differences in terms of group centroids, (i.e., mean vectors), (2) discrimination: studying group separation with respect to dimensions and to (discriminator) variable contribution to separation, (3) estimation: obtaining estimates of interpopulation distances (between centroids) and of degree of relationship between the response variables and group membership, and (4) classification: setting up rules of assigning an individual to one  of the predetermined exhaustive populations. Attention is given to the formal relationship between multiple regression analysis and two group discriminant analysis, as well as non-normal and incomplete data. Recommendations for reporting discriminant analysis results are given. A substantial list of references pertaining to discrimination and classification is supplied. (Author/RC)",

One hundred specific needs categorized under 10 priority general needs of the state's learners were identified through a survey resulting in the development of learner performance objectives for grades 4, 7, and 11. Behavioral expectations are listed for each grade. Tests were then selected for assessing learner needs in mathematics, reading, and physical education. The assessment program was systematically broadened to include more districts in the sample and will eventually assess progress toward the achievement of all the goals of education concerning the cognitive,  affective, and psychomotor needs of Kentucky school children which have been specified, published, and distributed statewide. Need areas are appearing after the fourth grade in certain reading and attitude areas. (Author/RC)",
