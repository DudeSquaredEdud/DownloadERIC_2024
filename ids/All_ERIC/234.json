Teachers and librarians across all grade levels and content areas were surveyed to learn about their skill levels, hardware and software application usage as well as selected technology infused student activities. A key finding indicates a need to initiate efforts to increase and expand the culture of technological innovation and elevate the knowledge and skills of AISD staff around instructional use of technology in student learning activities. Survey respondents were enthusiastic about learning new ways to integrate technology into instruction and reported a need to improve technology access in hardware and application options for use directly by students (i.e., more classroom sets of iPads or other tablets, additional licenses for software or electronic books). Results of the survey will be used in the districtwide technology integration planning process.",

        "author":["Candal, Cara Stillings"],
        "description":"Despite a strong track record of success and parent demand, charter school growth has slowed considerably in recent years in Massachusetts and nationwide. In the Commonwealth's large urban school districts--especially Boston--this lack of growth is attributable to charter school caps that prevent the state from authorizing new charter school seats. But some school districts in the Commonwealth have room to grow. They have space available for charter expansion under the state's net school spending (NSS) cap and demand for charter schools in the form of waiting lists. A number of those districts are in Gateway Cities, &quot;midsize urban centers that anchor regional economies around the state.&quot; The following paper provides data on the Gateway Cities with room to expand under the NSS cap. It also provides examples of how the politics of charter schooling-- both state and local--have prevented high quality operators from serving students and families who desire a charter school education. Finally, this paper concludes with recommendations to change state charter statute as well as processes and procedures related to charter school authorizing in the Commonwealth. These recommendations would make it more difficult for the state or any locality to deny families the charter school options they desire.",

        "description":"A growing body of research points to the substantial influence of principals on school conditions and students' learning. But how can principals learn to be good leaders? And are there professional learning strategies that make a difference in principal effectiveness? This study, which is part of a larger project synthesizing the research on principal learning, provides some new insight into these questions. Most studies of principal professional learning have examined the efficacy of particular programs rather than the mix of program features and experiences to which principals have had access. To begin to address this gap in the literature, the authors conducted a study of the relationship between principals' learning opportunities (both preservice preparation and in-service professional development) and key outcomes for the teachers and students in their schools. The authors examined both teacher retention and student achievement gains in English language arts and mathematics. This study offers a new perspective on the efficacy of professional learning by using detailed data from a large, representative sample of principals directly linked to individual-level information from the teachers and students in their schools.

To develop holistic review processes, admission professionals are changing the ways they structure applications for undergraduate admissions. This study examines how the Stephen M. Ross School of Business (Ross School) at the University of Michigan requests, collects, and reviews portfolios of student work along with traditional application materials. The first section presents the rationale for the new holistic review process, the second shares insights it provides the Ross School, and the third details how admission professionals at the Ross School built it. The case illuminates the use of student-generated portfolios as one possible model for other higher education systems seeking to evolve their holistic admission processes.",

        "description":"The negative societal or school-delivered messages that students can receive in relation to their race, ethnicity, gender or gender identity, language, immigration status, disability, age, or any other feature that is associated with social stigma can trigger social identity or stereotype threat. Such threat occurs when people feel they are at risk of being negatively judged in a situation because others associate their identity with undesirable characteristics. When social identity or stereotype threat has been triggered, it induces stress and impedes working memory and focus, leading to impaired performance on tests and other school tasks. In addition, students experiencing these threats often have a heightened assumption that they are uncared for or unwelcomed, causing many to disengage or disidentify with school settings. This report describes how practitioners can build inclusive and affirming school environments with keen attention to identity safety. Identity-safe learning settings aim to mitigate psychological threats to students and their multifaceted identities that could be triggered by negative messages, bullying, or marginalization while helping to nurture a positive sense of efficacy and engagement in learning. In using identity-safe teaching and learning practices, educators promote student achievement and attachments to school by creating a genuine sense of belonging and membership for each student.

        "title":"Managing for Results in America&apos;s Great City Schools 2022: Results from Fiscal Year 2020-21. A Report of the Performance Measurement and Benchmarking Project",
        "description":"In 2002 the Council of the Great City Schools and its members set out to develop performance measures that could be used to improve business operations in urban public school districts. The Council launched the Performance Measurement and Benchmarking Project to achieve these objectives. The purposes of the project were to: (1) Establish a common set of &quot;key performance indicators&quot; (KPIs) in a range of school operations, including business services, finances, human resources, and technology; (2) Use these KPIs to benchmark and compare the performance of the nation's largest urban public school systems; and (3) Use the results to improve operational performance in urban public schools. The teams leading the project's work have used a sophisticated approach to define, collect and validate school-system data. This process calls for each KPI to have a clearly defined purpose to justify its development, and extensive documentation of the &quot;metric definitions&quot; ensures that the expertise of the technical teams is fully captured. At the core of the methodology is the principle of &quot;continuous improvement.&quot; The teams are instructed to focus on operational indicators that can be &quot;benchmarked&quot; and are &quot;actionable,&quot; and thus can be strategically managed by setting improvement targets. Each page of this report shows detailed information for a single KPI measure. Sections include: (1) Accounts Payable; (2) Cash Management; (3) Compensation; (4) Financial Management; (5) Grants Management; (6) Procurement; (7) Risk Management; (8) Food Services; (9) Maintenance &amp; Operations; (10) Safety &amp; Security; (11) Transportation; (12) Human Resources; and (13) Information Technology.

Using the available cognitive and background data that were collected as part of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Skills (PIAAC), this report explores the links between the skills of American workers and a wide variety of labor market outcomes beyond earnings, including whether a person was employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force at the time of the PIAAC survey. Across each of these categories, in addition to skill levels, key background data were examined. For the employed population, for example, employment intensity, employer-provided training, occupation, and job satisfaction data were analyzed. For those who reported they were unemployed, the duration of unemployment and previous employment experiences was examined, whereas information on previous employment experiences was examined for those who reported that they were not in the labor force at the time of the PIAAC survey. The analysis in this paper reveals that these nonpecuniary labor market outcomes are also tightly bound to respondents' literacy and numeracy skills.

But what is unique in this report is that it also utilizes detailed data on skill use including the frequency with which respondents reported using reading, numeracy, and writing skills in their job. This study builds on the series' previous research on the effect of skills on the earnings of American workers by examining the use of workers' skills on the job as an additional determinant of the earnings of American workers (in addition to human capital--literacy proficiencies, education, work experience--and other factors that are known to affect earnings). The paper begins with a descriptive analysis of the link between reading skill use at work and the literacy proficiencies of workers. The authors explore differences in the literacy proficiencies (mean literacy scores and levels of literacy proficiencies) of workers in each quartile of the index of reading skill use at work, and conversely, the authors present the use of reading skills at work by the level of literacy proficiencies of workers. The descriptive section also explores the connection between the occupation of workers and their use of reading skills at work. Findings from multivariate regression analyses that explore the links between earnings and the use of reading skills at work, with regression controls for literacy proficiencies, educational attainment, work experience, occupation, and demographics are presented.

        "description":"Approximately 1.3 million K-12 public school students across the United States were identified as experiencing homelessness in 2019-20. In all cases, the stress, instability, trauma, and school mobility created by homelessness increase risks to physical, social, and emotional health and to educational engagement and achievement. Districts play an important role in creating environments and coordinating a set of supports that help these students overcome the challenges they face. However, districts face a number of challenges in identifying and serving students experiencing homelessness. The result is under-identification of students and insufficient support provided to students. This study examines how five school districts--Browning Public Schools, Cincinnati Public Schools, Polk County Public Schools, Santa Fe Public Schools, and Spokane Public Schools--work to serve students experiencing homelessness. The authors draw on interview data with homeless program staff, including coordinators, liaisons, and social workers, and budget data to describe how the districts identify and address the needs of students experiencing homelessness, how districts fund and staff their programs, and the challenges that districts confront in meeting the needs of students experiencing homelessness.

This report summarises the results of the survey on academic freedom, institutional autonomy and academic integrity conducted by ESU and financially supported by the Open Society Foundation.

        "description":"Reading and comprehending content area texts is important for academic and professional success as well as life skills necessary to maintain good health and quality lifestyle. Spanish speaking English language learners have shown poor performance on high-stakes assessments in reading comprehension. The number of Spanish speaking English learners (ELs) in our schools continues to increase at a fast pace, and therefore it is imperative that we address their reading comprehension needs swiftly and effectively. The text structure strategy has shown positive results on comprehension outcomes in many research studies with students at Grades 2, 4, 5, and 7. This study is the first implementation of instruction about the text structure strategy expressly designed to accommodate the linguistic and comprehension needs of Spanish speaking ELs in Grades 4 and 5. Strategy instruction on the Web for English Learners (SWELL) was designed to deliver instruction about the text structure strategy to Spanish speaker English learners. A randomized controlled study with pre and post-tests was conducted with 14 classrooms at fourth-grade and 17 classrooms at fifth-grade in high poverty schools where over 85% of students were Spanish speaking bilinguals or ELs. Analysis of data using multi-level models show moderate to large-effects favoring the students in the SWELL classrooms over the business as usual control classrooms on important measures such as a standardized reading comprehension test and main idea and cloze tasks. This research has practical implications for the use of web-based tools to provide high-quality and supportive instruction to improve Spanish speaking ELs reading comprehension skills.

As research has shown that continuous enrollment throughout the year increases college persistence and completion, the summer Pell (SP) program was added during the summer of 2009 and allowed eligible low-income students to receive an additional grant for summer tuition and eligible costs. The SP was eliminated in 2011 and then restored in 2017. Using administrative data on community college students in New York City, our difference-indifferences analysis results from both periods show that SP-eligible students had a higher retention rate in the fall of the second year, had higher associate and bachelor's degree attainment rates, and had higher earnings gains up to nine years from college entry compared to SP-ineligible students. Heterogeneous analysis indicates that the SP benefits were driven by Black students and older students.",

Theoretically, competition for students might lead to competition for effective and diverse teaching faculties. This study assesses how competition from school choice relates to the distribution of teacher characteristics across school contexts, exploiting within-school temporal variation in exposure to competition from school choice -- both charter schooling and inter-district school choice. I also test whether the relationship between school choice and teacher characteristics differs between charter schools and traditional public schools, or in areas with less restrictive collective bargaining agreements. Using student- and teacher-level data from 2012-13 to 2018-19, I find that growth in choice-based competition was associated with changes in the teacher workforce that were primarily positive (e.g., an increase in teacher experience and the proportion of teachers with at least a master's degree) and primarily occurring in charter schools, with very little indication of larger systemic effects in the TPS sector.",

        "description":"Over the last five years, Puerto Rico has faced fiscal and economic disruptions, demographic shifts, hurricanes and earthquakes, governance challenges, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While most of these conditions are not new to Puerto Rico, the intersection of all these challenges created a nexus for institutional resilience and efforts. This brief is the second phase of a multi-tiered project--the first of which was an environmental scan of conditions and context of the population, K-12 educational pipeline, higher education, and workforce in Puerto Rico that &quot;Excelencia&quot; published in 2021. While this brief is not meant to be exhaustive of the experiences of institutions and students in Puerto Rico, it is indicative in a broader sense of institutional resilience and transformation to meet their mission and goals to serve their communities with a quality education. &quot;Excelencia&quot; in Education engaged five Puerto Rican HSIs in a series of interviews to learn more about their efforts in resilience in the last five years: (1) Inter American University of Puerto Rico-Arecibo; (2) Universidad Ana G. Méndez-Gurabo; (3) University of Puerto Rico-Mayagüez; (4) University of Puerto Rico-Río Piedras; and (5) University of Puerto Rico-Utuado.

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted every aspect of education in the state and across the nation, irrevocably impacting the lives of students, families, and educators like no crisis before it. Educators, families, and leaders responded to the crisis with extraordinary resilience. In the face of an unprecedented threat to public health, the state leveraged stay-at-home orders to limit the spread of COVID-19 and prevent as many deaths as possible. Programs and schools leapt to launch online programs, to provide emotional and material support to students and, later, to reopen with new safety protocols. Students and families navigated virtual services and remote learning, even while grieving for loved ones lost to the pandemic and grappling with job loss, illness, and isolation. This report outlines the impact this global event has had on Illinois learners from early childhood education through higher education. The report also highlights a few of the valiant efforts of state and local leaders, who worked to address critical issues--expanding access to laptops, finding ways to expand internet and broadband access, taking steps to stabilize the state's system of early childhood education and care, and investing in efforts to support staff and student wellbeing.

Data is presented at national and state levels, and because out-of-school suspensions are concentrated in secondary schools, state-level findings are focused on secondary school students. The factors associated with the use of suspension is also described. The report expands on work the Learning Policy Institute (LPI) previously supported documenting the prevalence and impact of exclusionary discipline. In addition, this report is part of LPI's &quot;Inequitable Opportunity to Learn&quot; series, which uses the CRDC data to understand the extent to which historically underserved students experience inequities in their opportunities to learn--including who teaches them, what they are taught, and how they are treated. The report describes suspension rates and gaps at the national level and state levels. It then describes factors that influence the use of suspensions and disparities in suspension rates and concludes with recommendations for policymakers.

        "description":"Research suggests that math anxiety correlates directly with individuals' views of mathematics-related experiences. Research also suggests that math anxiety may begin in early elementary grades and remain into adulthood. This study examined how teachers' experiences, perceptions, and mathematics confidence levels influence mathematics instruction. To understand teachers' perceptions of mathematics, the researcher used a qualitative phenomenological approach to probe into their earliest memories of mathematics before entering school and their experiences during formal education. Seven 5th-grade teachers with two to fourteen years of experience agreed to participate in the study. The participants responded to ten open-ended questions focused on mathematics instruction and seven interview questions examining participants 'experiences with mathematics. The researcher also observed mathematics instruction in each teacher's classroom. The results indicated that teachers recalled fond early memories of mathematics and felt reasonably confident about their math instruction. Some teachers struggled with mathematics as elementary students, while others excelled. The majority of participants completed the basic requirements for mathematics in high school. Most teachers did not engage in a mathematics methods course focused on standards-based elementary mathematics. Teachers' weak areas in mathematics corresponded with similar studies regarding complex mathematics topics. Several key components of mathematics instruction were absent during observations. Future research may need to increase the number of observations and the sample size.",

        "description":"Anxiety has a significant effect on oral communication, particularly when it occurs in the form of a public address. The quality of a public academic speaker's oral presentation may highly be determined by a variety of emotive elements. However, this has received much too little attention in the realm of academic dissertation oral defense presentations, despite the fact that this process may be incredibly nerve-wracking for both novice and experienced postgraduates, EFL learners in particular. In the current study, 68 Chinese EFL Ph.D. candidates consented to complete a revamped version of the Personal Report of Public Speaking Anxiety (PRPSA). Chinese EFL postgraduates reported an average high level of public speaking anxiety (X=4.34) during their doctoral dissertation defense presentations, as measured by three categorical variables: public speaking apprehension (X=4.40), self-behavior management (X=4.35), and fear of negative evaluation (X=4.26). Throughout Ph.D. candidate participants' dissertation defense, fifteen anxiety-related questionnaire items were recognized to be the most anxiety-provoking conditions in terms of public speaking anxiety. In addition, differences in gender and graduate study specialization were not significantly associated with Chinese EFL Ph.D. candidates' experiences with public speaking anxiety. Despite the findings, research has revealed that Ph.D. candidates in English as a Foreign Language from China exhibit statistically significant levels of anxiety related to public speaking, and as a result, pedagogical recommendations have been proposed.",

        "description":"Intense Internet use, which disrupts people's daily routine responsibilities and disrupts the quality of life, points to the problem of Internet addiction (IA). This problem is more common among youngsters. Especially university students who move away from family surveillance and have more access to the Internet are in the high risk group. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate their IA status and its relationship to perception of the Internet. It was designed as a correlational survey research. The sample was composed of 143 students studying at Suleyman Demirel University in Isparta, Turkey. The data were collected through a questionnaire form and analyzed using statistical techniques. The findings showed that 2.8% of the participants were Internet addicts and 29.4% were in the risky group with regards to IA. According ANOVA results, the level of IA did not change significantly across class level, but it changed significantly by gender, with a higher rate for male students. Correlation analysis revealed that IA was not related to age, but was significantly associated with Internet perception. IA was negatively associated with perceiving the internet as a &quot;communication tool&quot; and &quot;source of information&quot; and positively with perceiving it as &quot;dangerous&quot;.

        "description":"This study proposal will provide a theoretical framework based on persuasive communication theories for educators seeking to make their curriculum more gender inclusive for contemporary school settings. The authors argue that too many U.S. public schools lack educational materials for young students in health classes about the value of understanding and respecting gender diversity and all individuals on the gender spectrum (i.e., nonbinary gender, gender fluid, transgender, cisgender, agender, etc.). On the whole, a majority of educators may agree that health/sex education classes in both elementary and middle schools should require some gender diversity instruction, since it could conceivably be one of the most important ways that these institutions can help students to establish early on positive relationships with their own bodies and healthy, constructive attitudes towards their peers' self-identifications. Yet, the reality is that very few states require institutions to provide this type of health-related information beyond the standard binary gender anatomy, physiology, and reproductive history (Leins, 2019; Laslett, 1989). Therefore, this communication-based proposal is focused on the twin goals of awareness and implementation of age-appropriate course materials for educators working with children in the 5-7 age range on topics surrounding a greater understanding and respect for gender diversity in oneself and others. A process model approach that reaches these young learners before they form strict binary gender views and stereotypes can help educators working with vulnerable school-aged children in the gender minority (Cross &amp; Madson, 1997). Relevant qualitative theories include Weinstein and Sandman's Precaution Adoption Process Model, McGuire's Persuasive Communication Model, and Bertalanffy's System Theory (Schiavo, 2014; Bertalanffy, 2015).

        "description":"Approximately 4.2 million youth and young adults experience homelessness on their own every year. These young people -- referred to as &quot;unaccompanied homeless youth&quot; under federal education law -- face unique barriers to accessing and completing higher education. Unaccompanied homeless youth are not living with, or supported by, a parent or guardian, and cannot obtain parental income information. Therefore, under the Higher Education Act, they are considered independent students and do not need to provide a parent's signature or information about parental income on the FAFSA. Youth face barriers to higher education, including burdensome financial aid program rules that have made it more difficult for these youth to obtain federal financial assistance for college. These barriers were exacerbated by the pandemic, which brought disruption, isolation, and more economic hardship and trauma. This report examines recently released 2020- 2021 federal data that help illustrate the impact of the pandemic on FAFSA completion for youth experiencing homelessness and youth with experience in foster care.",

The research is a quantitative study carried out in a relational survey model. The sample consists of 293 participants. The data of the research were analyzed using the Jamovi 1.6.12 statistical software program. It was determined that the participants' mean score for the risk-taking dimension was high, and the mean score for the life satisfaction scale was found to be in the moderate level range. There was no significant difference in the branch variable in the scores of the participants regarding the risk-taking dimension while there was a significant difference in terms of gender and doing sport variables. According to the life satisfaction scale, there was no significant difference in terms of gender and branch variables, on the other hand; there was a significant difference in terms of doing sport variables. It was found that there was a significant relationship between the participants' risk-taking factor and their life satisfaction levels and that the risk-taking dimension was a significant predictor of the participants' life satisfaction. Conducting this research based on a current topic makes it significant. It is anticipated that the results of this research will contribute significantly to researchers in the field to pave the way for conducting new studies. [For the full proceedings, see ED626585.]",

Findings showed that consistent Zearn Math users grew an additional 14.6 scale score points on the state's standardized assessment; the equivalent of 1.3 years of learning as compared to non-users. Consistent Zearn Math users who started below standards grew an additional 20.9 scale points, in comparison to non-users who lost 4.4 scale score points; the equivalent of an additional 2.1 years of learning. Consistent Zearn Math users were also more likely to improve their Achievement Level and had a larger increase in the percent of students meeting standards.

In this process, the assessment process, which is one of the most important steps of education and teaching activities, started to be applied as online exams. In addition to being compulsory during epidemic periods, the fact that it has various advantages such as reducing costs, suitability for new teaching approaches, preparing a large pool of questions, being time and place independent has led to an increase in the use of online exams. In addition to the advantages that online exams have due to their structure, they have also brought some disadvantages. Some limitations arising from the lack of synonymous proctors during the exam are among these disadvantages. There are a number of digital proctoring tools developed to reduce this limitation. These tools aim to increase exam security by recording the movements of students during the exam process. In this study, information was given about the add-ons used to make online exams safer and more reliable, and a general evaluation was made about the add-ons to provide in-depth knowledge to online exam practitioners.

        "description":"Experiential learning is critical to a smooth transition from higher education to the workforce. Work-based college courses, such as internships and practicums, may be useful in facilitating this transition. This paper applies an innovative text mining technique to identify and analyze work-based courses from transcript data. The paper examines patterns and post-degree labor market outcomes of taking work-based courses at two-year and four-year colleges in a large public college system. Findings show that approximately 15% of enrollees and 30% of graduates took a work-based course in the six years after college entry. Students typically earned credits from work-based courses, and they typically took the courses in later years of their programs. Moreover, work-based coursetaking varied largely across fields of study as well as colleges. While there was no significant racial disparity, female students, students who were younger at enrollment, and U.S.-born students were more likely to take the courses than their counterparts. Results show a positive association between work-based coursetaking in college and the probability of being employed after degree completion among both two-year and four-year degree completers, a positive association with post-degree earnings among four-year completers, and a negative association with post-degree earnings among two-year completers.",

During the implementation of the project, its goals were expanded psycho-pedagogically in a local school. The goal was to develop students' thinking while maintaining their health. To achieve this goal, changes were made in the learning process: (1) The purpose of training was replaced by the purpose of learning; (2) Active training was replaced by constructive learning; (3) The structure of the knowledge of programs is based on a complete and fuzzy model; and (4) Tasks that ensure the operational development of student thinking, price criteria were created to measure the level of development.

        "description":"In the United States, Black male students graduate at a significantly lower rate than other student groups, with 38.6% of Black males graduating in six years from four-year institutions and just 21% when time is reduced to four years. This qualitative action research case study used a focus group interview with six participants to understand the factors related to Black male student retention and graduation at Lincoln Prairie University (LPU) (pseudonym), a private, predominantly White Midwestern institution. The study also sought to determine what actions LPU could take to increase the retention and graduation rates of its Black male students. Past research pointed to several factors that had both positive and negative influences on Black male student retention, including campus climate, feelings of isolation, racism and microaggressions, academic performance, the availability of financial assistance, and peer and mentor support systems. The campus climate theoretical framework was used to organize this study and connect it to existing literature. Findings suggest that when campus administrators understand their campus climate and continually improve campus operations, Black male students can persist to graduation. The findings also point to the importance of fully supporting Black male students on campus by making them feel heard, seen, and included and limiting racism and microaggressions. With the appropriate levels of academic and social support, a healthy campus climate, and a constantly improving campus, Black male students can achieve academic success, be retained from year to year, and ultimately graduate. To improve retention and graduation rates, campus administrators should focus on increasing the diversity of campus employees, supporting open and honest conversations about racial issues, and using all available resources to promote Black activities on campus.",

Past federal administrations and congresses, recognizing their critical role in addressing inequality, often acted to address disparities and violations of students' civil rights that had been left unresolved by states and districts. In addition to legislation, presidential administrations have several other tools at their disposal that allow them to play a significant role in ameliorating educational inequalities. These include issuing federal guidance, regulations, and statements of administration policy, as well as use of an administration's investigative powers, data collection and dissemination, and budgetary requests. The extent to which administrations have chosen to leverage these opportunities to advance civil rights has changed over time. Some administrations have chosen to take strong action not only to enforce protection under the law, but also to prevent instances of discrimination from arising. The Obama administration issued guidance on civil rights and school discipline that described how schools can meet their legal obligations under federal law to administer student discipline without discriminating against students on the basis of race, color, or national origin, which the Trump administration chose to rescind. This report examines how this shift in the federal role in education could affect protections of students' civil rights in the area of school discipline. The report discusses the underlying research that has been used to inform and identify best practices for supporting student behavior and achievement and keeping schools safe, the progress that has been made using research-based best practices, and the consequences of the administration's decision to roll back this guidance for productive approaches to school discipline.",

        "description":"Educational leaders need to be able to make outstanding decisions for planning, organizing and directing others. Herein, we discuss the impact of educational leadership in developing structural plans, cultural diversity, curriculum standards, and faculty engagement. Cultural diversity remains as an unresolved issue, but student's negative attitudes associated with their differences in background and culture can be overcome with a proactive structure (prevention rather than cure!). University leaders should seek better learning environments through diversification to foster collaboration, creativity, equality, and innovation. Pre-planned curriculum standards and class outlines are critical to have a high quality education. A research-based and/or a coursework-based program can be carefully chosen according to the student's needs (interests) prior to the implementation of such planned standards. Well-established standards must be periodically assessed to achieve expected outcomes. Approachable, honest, caring, inspirational, and respectful leaders promote faculty engagement to incorporate their experiences. The strategy of &quot;telling benefits&quot; and &quot;speaking academic&quot; are useful and effective to engage faculty in the ongoing activities and assessments. The leadership plan and the role of leaders must be both utilized to identify the deficiencies and the interests of current students; hence, achieving the educational organization's mission, intended goals, and student success from the engagement.

Thus, competition and competitiveness in the field of higher education at the national and international levels have prompted Moroccan universities to integrate evaluation into their continuous improvement process through strategic projects, cooperative or even voluntary initiatives, either partially or for the whole university, covering all domains or focusing on specific ones. The National Agency for Evaluation and Quality Assurance of Higher Education and Scientific Research (ANEAQ) is an autonomous instance in charge of evaluating the higher education system to guarantee its quality. Its field of action covers all national institutions and training programs. Despite this enormous scope of action and the difficulties encountered, it has been able to promote a quality culture and harmonize the practice of institutional evaluation through the implementation of the national reference system covering all the institution's activities. This article highlights the importance of evaluation and quality assurance in the Moroccan higher education sector, explores the scope of action and the role played by ANEAQ, and provides some ways for improving the evaluation process.

Mobility programs are designed to strengthen the dimension and quality of the Higher Education, to encourage transnational cooperation between Universities, to improve transparency and academic recognition of studies and qualifications. The objective of this paper is to present a report on the evolution of mobility of the FMUC undergraduate students in the period between 2009 and 2019. A descriptive report was carried out. During this last decade, the FMUC has dealt with mobility applications from 1,500 incoming and 1,350 outgoing students to attend both classes and clinical traineeships as part of their Master's Degrees in Medicine. In the academic year 2015-2016 there was an increase in the number of applications, coinciding with the introduction of clinical internships in hospitals. The top countries where the FMUC sent students (538); and from where it received students (978) were, Italy, Spain and Brazil. In Portugal, the FMUC is one of the main medical schools with the largest number of students attending mobility programs, which has contributed to fostering the internationalization of undergraduate medical students' training.

This report uses the most recent CRDC data from 2017-18. The CRDC includes data on a variety of information sources pertaining to school resources and student experiences, including student access to advanced courses in mathematics and science. These data are reported overall and disaggregated, including by race/ethnicity. They shed light on the extent to which inequities in opportunities to learn exist at the school level--and how these differentials produce disparities at the state and national levels. To examine historically underserved students' access to advanced courses, this report documents the extent to which high schools serving large percentages of students of color and students from low-income families offer Algebra II, Advanced Math, Calculus, Chemistry, and Physics courses. The report also compares these course offerings to those at schools with lower percentages of these students. This analysis, which includes national and state information, demonstrates that schools with high proportions of students of color and students from low-income families are less likely to offer the advanced mathematics and science courses needed to prepare for a college and career path. The report concludes with policy recommendations for closing achievement gaps in advanced mathematics and science course offerings.

        "description":"Many early care and education (ECE) institutions--including Head Start, state quality rating and improvement systems (QRIS), and school district pre-K programs--use classroom quality observations in their quality improvement or monitoring processes. As many states expand their ECE programs, they grapple with questions about how best to use data from quality observations, which are typically conducted once a year at most. This brief presents results from a study that examined levels and patterns of change in classroom quality over a school year, and the way those changes vary by different quality dimensions. The study is based on data from the Expanding Children's Early Learning (ExCEL) Quality project, which assessed two different approaches to improving classroom quality. The findings suggest that practitioners and policymakers should carefully consider the timing and number of quality ratings when making decisions about how to improve programs and monitor processes. This brief examines how biweekly ratings by teachers' coaches of three dimensions of classroom quality--structural, interactional, and instructional quality--changed over the course of the study (which occurred from September 2019 through March 2020). It addresses two research questions: (1) How do different dimensions of quality change over time? and (2) How do changes in the three dimensions of quality differ based on the curricular and professional development approach? The larger ExCEL Quality study was designed to examine how curriculum combined with professional development helps teachers improve classroom quality and maximize improvements in children's outcomes.",

        "description":"Homelessness is a traumatic experience with long-term consequences, particularly for infants and toddlers in their most critical stages of development. Yet homelessness among young children is hidden. Lack of shelter, fear of having children removed from parental custody, and restrictive eligibility criteria for housing programs mean that most young children experiencing homelessness stay in places that are not easily identified. To date, the only data on the number of young children experiencing homelessness is from the U.S. Department of Education, which estimates that approximately 1.3 million children under the age of six experienced homelessness in 2018-2019. However, these data are not disaggregated by age, and, therefore, the prevalence of homelessness amongst the very youngest -- infants and toddlers -- has thus far been unknown. In order to prevent longer term impacts, awareness and action must be increased to support expecting parents, as well as infants and toddlers experiencing homelessness. A first step in doing so is understanding the prevalence of homelessness in this age range, and the gaps in their access to high-quality early learning programs. This report describes the prevalence of homelessness among infants and toddlers in twenty states that have formed broad-based coalitions to move prenatal-to-3 priorities forward; gaps in access to early learning programs; and recommendations for increasing enrollment and support.",

        "description":"Even before the coronavirus pandemic began, policymakers, businesses, and workforce advocates were already recognizing that workers were not being replaced by robots, but rather, being called upon to work hand-in-glove with rapidly evolving technology. When the pandemic struck, millions of U.S. companies hustled to change how they did business. Nearly every worker suddenly had to contend with new digital demands -- even those in frontline, essential roles. The impact of the digital skill divide became more acute, weighing disproportionately on workers of color and smaller businesses struggling to survive a tumultuous economy. Now -- as leaders design labor market policies to drive a thriving and inclusive economy -- it is imperative to understand this digital transformation. This report takes a first-ever look at the demand for digital skills in the U.S. economy, as measured by a dataset of 43 million &quot;Help Wanted&quot; ads posted during 2021. The findings in this analysis are unequivocal: (1) there is overwhelming demand for digital skills in the labor market; (2) many workers have not had sufficient opportunity to build such skills; (3) public investments in workforce development and education are especially vital; (4) closing the digital skill divide has major payoffs for businesses; and (5) closing the digital skill divide can also generate economic benefits for individual workers and the broader economy.

A purpose of the surgical patient examination is making of early, correct and precise individual diagnosis, and, based on it, effective and timely rendering of medical care via either pharmacologic nonsurgical methods or surgical intervention. Making a diagnosis is the most important task of the diagnostic and treatment process; solution of this task includes creative analysis of the disease clinical course, formulation of the provisional diagnosis and following determination of the additional examination methods scopes and diagnostic algorithm. From a formal aspect, diagnosis is based on the nosological principle and has to contain the name of a certain disease or injury according to the accepted nomenclature and classification of diseases; it is of importance to medical statistical goals and scientific research. Assessment of the findings of additional methods of examination in the aggregate with clinical signs allows carrying out of differentiation of similar diseases and gives an opportunity to make a clinical (final) diagnosis and define treatment approach.

        "description":"Charter schools are funded and governed by public agencies but operated by private organizations under government contracts. As private organizations, charter schools have more autonomy over their operations than traditional public schools. Charter school teachers typically do not work under collective bargaining units or have tenure protections, which gives charter leaders more authority over personnel decisions. Also, charter schools do not have &quot;attendance zones,&quot; so families can choose the school that best meets their needs regardless of where they live. Charter schools now represent 7% of national school enrollment and rising. In a growing number of cities, this number is well above 40%. The debate over the rise of charter schools has focused on only some of the ways in which charter schools affect children. In this study, the authors assess the total effect charter schools have on student outcomes nationwide, including not only students attending charter schools but also indirect effects on students attending nearby public schools.

The launch of 12-year Basic Education Curriculum and the emergence of the educational innovation industry arouse the awareness of project-based competency-oriented curriculum design. Introducing design thinking into the educational field has received significant attention in recent years owing to the fact that the characteristics of design thinking track with a similar vision of the &quot;core competency&quot; listed in the 12-year Basic Education Curriculum, including emphasizing on exploring and doing, interdisciplinary integration, and the real-world scenario. This research takes the &quot;Campus Ambassador Program&quot; held by Design for Change Taiwan (DFC Taiwan), an educational innovation organization, as a case study. The method of semi-constructed in-depth interview is selected to gather the information from the student teachers of the program's participants as well as the staffs of DFC Taiwan who are responsible for this program, in order to know the effectiveness of the student teachers' design thinking education program.

Tuition and fee rates in the region appear to have stabilized over the past decade after significant increases that occurred during the Great Recession and, as noted above, when adjusting for inflation, average tuition and fee rates at public two- and four-year institutions in the region have decreased between 2012-13 and 2022-23. This trend has become even more noticeable over the past two years as higher education institutions and systems have been reluctant to increase rates amidst the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic and as inflation has increased across the economy.

        "description":"Economic downturns, like a global pandemic, magnify the need for timely, accurate, and complete data that policymakers need to make data-informed decisions that will help workers, businesses, and their communities recover. Good data helps to better understand what's working and what's not in terms of creating greater access to workforce investments and in reporting the measurable economic gains of skills training programs that advance career pathways, build wealth, and expand the well-being of workers. Well-designed data systems, too, are crucial to track progress toward closing equity gaps. Postsecondary education and training have become essential to the economic mobility of working adults of color, immigrants, and workers with a high school diploma or less. State leaders have recognized the critical importance of postsecondary attainment in meeting equity and economic goals. Credentials are a key component of state postsecondary attainment goals and economic recovery responses, helping workers earning low wages transition into better jobs in expanding sectors and serving to reconnect them to further postsecondary education and training opportunities. States have made significant advances in data sharing and use, transparency and reporting, data governance, and using their data systems to build knowledge about which credentials have value for workers and businesses. These developments help workers save time and money, make it easier for businesses to identify talent and address emerging skill needs, and help states know how to invest limited resources in high-quality skills training programs to maximize equitable outcomes. This issue brief outlines emerging and innovative data approaches that states have identified and implemented to better connect individuals with the education, skills training, and other supports needed to close equity gaps. The brief identifies timely opportunities for policymakers and advocates to foster the development of effective approaches and speed up the adoption of innovative strategies.",

The study identified four key findings that can inform future research: (1) Advising policies, practices, and programs often focused on the first year of college, with the intent of setting students up for success at entry; (2) College administrators reported using different types of strategies for supporting students in the face of time and resource constraints; (3) College administrators reported using a combination of light-touch strategies (such as nudging) and more intensive strategies (such as proactive advising) to support students' progress through college; and (4) Increasingly, and especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, colleges have recognized the importance of meeting students' basic needs. College administrators can use the findings from this study to learn about approaches to advising other colleges are using, and the successes and challenges of implementation, and researchers who study advising and other student success initiatives can use the findings from this study to identify directions for future research.

        "description":"For more than a decade, academics and education policy experts have raised concerns about a widespread shortage of teachers in the United States. The first wave of warnings came in response to the drastic cuts in state and local spending on education following the Great Recession. In this report, the authors use data from a wide range of sources to document the size and scope of the teacher shortage. The data show that the teacher shortage is both widespread and acute across several dimensions, from subject matter specialties to school poverty status. The authors also review data that point to the two most important drivers of the shortage: (1) the declining compensation in the teaching profession relative to other occupations that employ college graduates; and (2) and the increasingly stressful work environment teachers face, a long-standing reality that has been greatly exacerbated by COVID-19. The key finding is that the current shortage is generally &quot;not&quot; the result of an insufficient number of potentially qualified teachers. The shortage is, instead, a shortfall in the number of qualified teachers &quot;willing to work at current wages and under current working conditions.&quot; The combination of substandard teacher compensation and highly stressful working conditions has, in recent decades, made teaching a much less attractive profession than alternatives available to workers with college degrees.",

This significant funding gap increases the likelihood that many children and youth experiencing homelessness will not be identified, and even in cases where they are identified, that they will not receive the educational protections and services that can stabilize their education and their lives. Ensuring access to these supports is an important part of creating a school system that meets the needs of all of the nation's children and youth.

        "description":"In the summer of 2022, the Center on Reinventing Public Education convened a panel of education and youth development experts to take stock of recent efforts to address students' mental health and well-being and to reestablish core elements of social and emotional learning (SEL) in schools. The panel agreed that the pandemic's impact has been complex, but that there have been few dynamic and collaborative efforts to address it. While the experts recognized the tremendous demands placed on teachers to address students' academic as well as social and emotional needs, they noted that the kind of innovation they called for in 2021 (e.g., new kinds of learning environments, partnerships, and funding models for mental health and social skill development) had yet to materialize. The panelists arrived at three calls to action that reflect the challenges and opportunities young people are facing. Specifically, they call for policymakers and advocates to: (1) Embrace technological innovations that can improve student well-being while still honoring the fundamental need for human relationships; (2) Overcome turf wars and divisions; embrace &quot;big tent&quot; thinking for social and emotional development and well-being support; and (3) Build new, integrated monitoring and response systems to address the urgent needs of young people.",

        "description":"For-profit colleges' have generated regulatory scrutiny and litigation because of their recruitment tactics, graduation rates, costs and loan default rates. Compared to public higher education institutions, for-profit colleges have been criticized for being more expensive with similar or worse job market outcomes for graduates, who tend to be left with higher debt. They enroll relatively high proportions of Black and Latino students, but too often leave those students in debt and without degrees. This research explores the experiences and perspectives of for-profit college attendees based on a representative survey of 595 alumni, currently enrolled students, and non-completers fielded from March 17 to May 31, 2022, and focus groups with those populations. The research includes a comparison sample of 406 students currently enrolled at public community colleges, which tend to serve populations similar to those of for-profit colleges.",

The study also looked at the difficulties they encountered and how Filipino teachers overcome them to continue to give their students a high-quality education. A qualitative phenomenological research approach with theory generating was employed for this investigation. According to the themes that emerged, the Filipino teachers' lived experiences revolved around the difficulties they faced while teaching outside the country; teachers struggled to manage students' behavior while being away from their families. Teachers developed coping mechanisms in order to adapt to the new eco-ecological set-up and maintain a sound mindset in order to enjoy teaching on the island. It was also revealed that teachers were subjected to close administrative supervision, that they had a minimal workload and were well compensated. Despite this, Filipino teachers in the US Virgin Islands adapted to the major crisis and even used it to grow and develop as educators. In terms of findings, the New-Ecological Acclimatization theory was developed.",

        "description":"The State of West Virginia is adopting the teacher residency model as the primary pathway to teacher certification in the state. By the fall of 2024, all educator preparation programs (EPPs) in the state must implement the West Virginia Residency Model (WVRM) for earning certification in all undergraduate licensure areas. However, implementing the year-long clinical experience required by the WVRM involves some additional costs, such as the payment of stipends to teacher residents during their residency year, not found with the former one-semester student teaching model. The purpose of this report is to provide a review of the literature and a scan of other states' policies and practices regarding sustainably funding these additional costs of teacher residencies. The study consisted of an extensive literature review of both peer-reviewed journal articles and reports produced by education policy organizations, residency support organizations such as the National Center for Teacher Residencies, and established residency programs such as the Boston Teacher Residency program; a brief assessment of teacher residency program support policies in other states; and interviews with leaders from six West Virginia EPPs and three school districts on the costs of their participation in the WVRM. The purpose of these interviews was to collect information on the design of the residency programs in these EPPs and their partner school districts; what, if any, additional costs were incurred by implementing and operating the residency program in comparison to their traditional student teaching programs; and the current sources of funding used to support their residency efforts. The literature review identified five sustainability strategies, including: (1) identifying opportunities for raising new revenues; (2) reallocating existing resources; (3) reducing the cost of the WVRM; (4) finding cost savings in other operational areas and reinvesting these to support the WVRM; and (5) cost sharing between the state, EPPs, and partner school districts.",

        "description":"In every classroom across our great state--from Monroe to Manistee and Mt. Pleasant to Marquette--every Michigan student deserves access and opportunity to the educational resources and support to realize a bright future. Yet for too long, Michigan's education system has served as an engine of inequality when it should be providing opportunities for all students to achieve at high levels. Our state's longstanding inequalities were compounded further over the last three years as students, families, educators and communities faced unprecedented educational challenges amid the COVID-19 pandemic. And though many states--even those that were among the top-performing before the pandemic--lost ground, we now know that students in Michigan, a state that was not systemically well-positioned before COVID-19, fared worse than many states during the pandemic. Indeed, Michigan's unprecedented challenges now need an equally unprecedented response to ensure that all children have the opportunity to catch up and accelerate. Coupled with an unprecedented opportunity of unspent federal COVID-19 relief funding, we believe the time is now for Michigan to change its trajectory. Over the last six months, our research, data and policy team dug into the data, conducted new research and analyses and looked across the nation for educational recovery best practices for our 2023 State of Michigan Education Report: Beyond the Pandemic. In the following pages, we present The Opportunity 10--10 research-based steps that Michigan must take now to make our state a Top 10 Education State by 2030, one of our organization's goals. The recommendations include the need for urgent investments in educational recovery, a fair system of school funding, honesty about students' performance, a strong system of fiscal transparency and accountability for spending, as well as other strategies that have shown to be impactful for students, especially the most underserved, in leading education states. In this report, Beyond the Pandemic, our researchers delve into each of these areas.

        "description":"The annual community college tuition and fees report provides information about tuition and fees charged at each of Iowa's 15 community colleges. This report also provides trends in tuition and fees among Iowa's community colleges, sources of general operating revenue and comparisons among states and institutions. For fiscal year (FY) 2023, average in-state tuition for students attending Iowa's community colleges is $191.18 per credit hour, a 3.7 percent increase from last year, and average mandatory fees are $14.90 per credit hour, up 0.2 percent from last year. Therefore, the average total in-state cost of enrollment (tuition plus fees) is $206.08 per credit hour, which represents a 3.4 percent increase from last year. Tuition and fees accounted for approximately 46.6 percent of community colleges' unrestricted operating revenue during FY 2021, the latest year for which data are available. Nationally, provisional data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) suggest that Iowa's in-state cost of enrollment in FY 2021 (the latest year available) ranked in the 90th percentile. This indicates that Iowa's average cost of enrollment is greater than or equal to 90 percent of community colleges in the nation. Regionally, Iowa had the second highest average cost of in-state enrollment in the region ($5,593.06), following South Dakota ($6,895.00). IPEDS data also suggest that the average total in-state enrollment cost at Iowa's community colleges was 14.1 percent higher than the regional average ($4,903.67) during FY 2021. Iowa Code stipulates that the highest tuition charged by Iowa's community colleges must be less than the lowest tuition charged at Iowa's public universities. In FY 2023, the highest community college in-state tuition for 24 credit hours ($4,896.00) is 39.6 percent less than the lowest public university in-state tuition for the same number of credit hours ($8,112.00).

        "description":"Given that teachers are critical to creating safe and supportive learning environments, it is essential to better understand how K-12 educators are being prepared in their teacher education programs to address LGBTQ issues and topics in curriculum and instruction, and the needs of LGBTQ students. Thus, the current study examines the state of teacher education programs in regard to LGBTQ-inclusive practices and preparation. As there is a lack of national research examining LGBTQ-inclusive teaching in teacher education programs, we undertook the &quot;Educating Educators: Knowledge, Beliefs, and Practice of Teacher Educators on LGBTQ Issues&quot; report to examine teacher educators' (or those who teach courses in colleges and universities that prepare pre-service educators) perspectives and experiences regarding their LGBTQ-related work. &quot;Educating Educators: Knowledge, Beliefs, and Practices of Teacher Educators on LGBTQ Issues&quot; examines: (1) Teacher educators' attitudes and beliefs about the inclusion of LGBTQ issues in their teacher education courses; (2) How teacher educators were prepared in their training to include LGBTQ people and issues in their work as teacher educators; (3) The LGBTQ-inclusive practices teacher educators engage in in their teaching; (4) The barriers faced in engaging in LGBTQ-inclusive teaching practices; and (5) Factors that lead to more inclusion of LGBTQ-related content in teacher educators' teaching practice.",

        "description":"In this ever-changing work environment, the value of a graduate business degree is increasingly questioned. In response, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC) conducted a longitudinal study of over 3,600 individuals around the world from their first consideration of business school to successful graduation. Participants' survey responses from before and after their graduate management education (GME) experience detail that candidates are mostly motivated to pursue GME for career advancement, personal growth, and better financial outcomes. Group differences in candidates' motivation and views of GME exist by gender, region, and race/ethnicity. Results confirm the strong positive value of GME across demographic groups and geographic regions. Understanding differences in candidates' motivation and expectations for GME enables schools to make more informed decisions when tailoring the content of their programs and recruitment strategies to attract talents that best fit the missions of their programs. This research addresses the following questions: (1) What motivates the pursuit of a graduate business degree?; (2) Does the pursuit of GME help candidates achieve personal, professional, and financial goals?; (3) Do candidates of different backgrounds experience the value of GME differently?; and (4) How do candidates assess the value of their business school journeys?

        "description":"Games are highly appreciated by the population, so due to the COVID-19 pandemic confinement we decided to carry out an Internet research of several games, in order to use them for the assimilation of new words of Biochemical students. Games found in puzzle books allow the stimulation of memory, reasoning and other brain capacities, such as keeping us out of stress and improving our knowledge. For this reason, we thought that they could be interesting for relieving students of the stress of confinement, and at the same time allowing to learn Biochemical words with those games. Games found in puzzle books are based on two types of problems, based in numbers or in letters. Among the games based in numbers, the most frequent include sudokus, suzenjou, kakuros, arithmograms; while those based in letters include crosswords, self-defined, and games of words or letters. We decided to perform various puzzles based on letters, and the easiest to implement were those based on words and syllables games. The simplest word games are based on searching within a set of words, those that have some part in common. In this sense, we invented rhyming games, in which words ended in -ine (frequent ending of amino acids, nitrogenous bases, nucleosides and some proteins), in -ose (frequent ending in carbohydrates), or in -ic / -ate (frequent termination of fatty acids and other intermediate acids of metabolism, or of their corresponding salts). Thus, the students were able to observe these characteristics in the nomenclature. On the other hand, incomplete word games allow you to fill in the names of the metabolites using groups of letters to choose from. Our proposal includes various word games that we can apply to the Biochemistry course so that students remember them. [For the full proceedings, see ED626668.]",

        "description":"Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is a term used to describe policies and programs that promote the representation and participation of different groups of individuals, including people of different ages, races and ethnicities, abilities and disabilities, genders, religions, cultures, and sexual orientations. Diversity, as it relates to a group or persons, or a community of people, is identified by various characteristics. This includes distinctions of social orientation and class, and cultural identity. When equity is present within a group, the result is equal access enjoyed by everyone; this includes equal opportunities as well as the potential for advancements. The American Council on Education (ACE) argues that the objectives of DEI initiatives have been voiced actively for years, targeting inequities in education. However, the global crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, the systemic racism in America, and the race-based inequities in higher education--have converged to create a critical mass and sharpen the demand for more effective approaches to address the DEI needs at the university and college levels. This paper will offer a research-based examination of these principles, and how they can and are being applied in university classrooms to ensure equity standards in learning opportunities.

        "description":"The need for an effective communication between scientific research and society is widely known to the broadest scientific community, and the sad times we are living in make it even clearer. At the same time, the need of establishing long-term structural connections between the worlds of research and that of education and scientific communication can open the way to new market opportunities. This led us to develop a cooperative society, academic spinoff of university of Calabria, named &quot;Missione al Cubo&quot; (mission cubed), evocative of both the &quot;third mission&quot; and the &quot;cubes&quot;, the buildings of University of Calabria. The cooperative aims at operating in the market sectors at the interface between research and society. In this interface region, the spinoff will interact on one side with universities and research centers developing educational, cultural and entertainment activities directly derived from their scientific research conducted. On the other side of the interface, the cooperative will distribute the products and services generated by the interaction with research environments in a large market, consisting of schools of all levels, local administrations, museums, science communication centers. We believe that there is a large market space for a whole series of products and services conceived to create a solid and lasting interface between scientific research and the public, at both the local and global level. This market space can offer interesting opportunities of self-entrepreneurship for young physicists with strong communication skills and rich research experience.

        "description":"This manuscript reports the results of two pilot studies that investigated the views of international cohorts of teacher educators regarding the efficacy of the flipped classroom paradigm in K-12 schools. A void in the literature addressed by each pilot study was the relevance of flipped classrooms to student subgroups requiring specialized instruction (e.g., students with disabilities). In the first study 107 teacher educators (58% response rate) from 38 countries completed a 12-item survey designed to determine their views on the efficacy of flipped classrooms. Respondents reported flipped classrooms are efficacious for elementary and secondary students, as well as those who are culturally and linguistically diverse -- particularly with respect to teaching complex subjects (e.g., science). Conversely, respondents reported the paradigm is inappropriate for students with disabilities, and that noteworthy barriers (e.g., a digital divide) impede its use with students in impoverished rural communities. In the second study 104 teacher educators (61% response rate) from 33 countries completed a 10-item survey designed to determine their views about the appropriateness of the flipped classroom paradigm for students with learning and/or behavioral challenges. Both studies are a measure of the paradigm's face validity, particularly with respect to certain student subgroups. [For the full proceedings, see ED626668.]",

        "description":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of many people around the world. However, college-age students have been identified as a population whose lives have been particularly disrupted (Browning, et al., 2021; Madrigal &amp; Blevins, 2021), thus placing higher education institutions in a position where they need to find ways to support their students. One way that American universities have attempted to help support their students is through the use of increased communications. The present study examined the effects of university communications on student resilience and engagement. A total of 148 students at a small, private, Midwestern university completed an online survey in which they rated university communications in terms of thoroughness, helpfulness, and thoughtfulness and responded to questions regarding their resilience and engagement. University communication did not significantly relate to resilience; however, communication did significantly predict student engagement, with communication thoughtfulness being the key predictor. Implications for universities are discussed. [For the full proceedings, see ED626668.]",

Much of the data is disaggregated by race/ethnicity, sex, disability, and whether students are English learners. OCR relies on CRDC data to investigate complaints alleging discrimination, determine whether civil rights laws have been violated, initiate proactive compliance reviews, and provide policy guidance and technical assistance to education institutions, parents, students, and communities. The purpose of this document is to serve as a supplemental resource to the &quot;Forum Guide to Reporting Civil Rights Data&quot; (ED590424) by recommending best practices for state education agencies (SEAs) that support their local education agencies (LEAs') reporting of civil rights data to ED.",

Educators have recorded many mixed results about the effectiveness of this method to achieve superior concept retention in students. Although there has been lot of research published about flipped learning, very little is known how this method affects the learning of Chemistry among middle school students. This study was conducted in two Science classrooms with 3 blocks each over a period of three consecutive days. A total of 122 students took part in this study where 75 students were taught using flipped learning approach whereas 47 students were exposed to traditional method. The students were given pre-test one day before the lesson and taught the next day using the respective teaching methods followed with a post-test on the third day. Findings demonstrate that the average post-test scores for students in flipped learning were higher as compared to traditional method. Additionally, at the end of the study, the students with flipped learning shared their perceptions about the approach. [For the full proceedings, see ED626668.]",

The study group of the study consists of 40 teachers working in public schools in a province of Turkey during the 2021- 2022 academic year. The data of the study were collected by interview method. The interview data were analyzed using content analysis, one of the qualitative data analysis methods. According to these results obtained from the research, the teachers stated that the experiences learned submerged in nature and the environment will increase the students' learning by doing and experiencing the most, develop high-level thinking skills, concretize their learning, increase the adaptation of the students to the society and the social environment, and protect the students from possible negative interactions caused by technology. The results obtained from the research, teachers said that there should be a course in nature and environmental education programs, that the activities in nature and environmental education programs cannot be fully implemented due to seasonal and geographical locations, that teachers neglect or overlook the activities related to nature and environment in the education programs due to the anxiety of preparing the students for the exam, but that flexibility should be provided to the teachers in the application of such subjects in the education programs. Other results obtained from the research, it is possible to say that the activities that teachers recommend as activities related to nature and the environment in their curriculum include learning by doing and experiencing, require practical and practical skills, consist of activities to develop students' problem-solving skills, and encourage cooperative learning.

This study aimed to investigate, explore, understand, and offer a voice to the students directly affected by ADHD. The framework for the research was based on Ryan and Deci's (2000) Theory of Self-determination. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight students currently enrolled at Northeastern University pursuing an undergraduate degree who disclosed to the Disabilities Resource Center that they had been diagnosed with ADHD. The data were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Findings include early diagnosis and identification as an essential factor in an individual's growth and academic success and the influence of their support systems on their self-awareness and self-confidence. Also, balancing both internal and external motivation for college students with ADHD was essential to their well-being and effectiveness in a college setting. With little research conducted on college students with ADHD, this research provides the potential for further research to enhance faculty preparation and address conditions or disorders.

The last time USDA fully updated school meal standards was in 2012. Research on the impact of those changes found that the nutritional quality of school meals increased by 41%, fruit, vegetable, and whole grain consumption increased, and obesity prevalence for children in poverty came in 47% lower than expected in 2018. Every five years, USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) update the &quot;Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs),&quot; which recommend what Americans should eat to meet nutrient needs, promote health, and prevent disease based on the most recent nutrition science. In an effort to align the standards for school meals with the DGAs, the proposed rule is suggesting changes to four main components of school meals: (1) added sugars; (2) milk; (3) sodium; and (4) whole grains.",

        "description":"The aim of the study is to examine the problems of the Turkish education system in terms of the elements of the education programs. This research was carried out according to the case study model, which is one of the qualitative research methods. The data of the study were collected through face-to-face interviews conducted through a semi-structured interview form with 50 teachers who work in various branches in public schools in the city center of Erzurum in the spring semester of the 2021-2022 academic year and who voluntarily supported the research. The data obtained in the study were interpreted by conducting content analysis. According to these results obtained from the research, it is possible to say that the problems experienced by the teachers in the context of reaching the goals of the Turkish education system are due to the exam-oriented education approach, the fact that the goals are not compatible with daily life, the lack of application direction, consisting mostly of theory-based information, and the low motivation of the students in the lessons. The results obtained from the research, it is seen that the problems experienced by the teachers in order to realize the content of the education in the Turkish education system arise from the inconsistency of course hours and the intensity of the subjects, the transition gaps between the subjects and the disconnections between the subjects and the applied activities. Other results obtained from the research, they stated that the problems experienced by the teachers in terms of the educational situations of the Turkish education system stemmed from the fact that the students did not participate in the lesson actively, and therefore, the teachers could not get enough feedback from the students in the educational environment.

This paper presents the attitudes of high school students towards the context of learning the language, addressed by two scales, according to International Attitude Motivation Test Battery, (Gardner, 2004): foreign language teacher evaluation and foreign language class evaluation. It also aims to find the variances of students' attitudes according to three groups of schools: urban public high school, rural public high school and non-public high school. The subjects in this research are N=1800 high school students from five main districts in Albania, by a random sample selection method. The analysis of descriptive statistics for mean values, frequencies of the variable &quot;attitudes&quot; and a two-way ANOVAs procedure to investigate for the variances of attitudes between the groups of schools. It resulted that from a Likert scale from 1-6, the mean value for the variable of attitudes was M=4.5, revealing that high school students have positive attitudes towards English language learning context, though not very highly positive. The research also found significant statistical differences of attitudes between the groups of schools at the value: p = 0.000 so p&lt;0.05, F (2.1798) = 7.789. However the differences between the groups were very low. Post Hoc Tukey HSD procedure found that variances of attitudes for the urban public high school and rural public high school were at the value: 0.19161, p=0.00; for the urban public high school and non-public high school the difference was: 0.00426, p=1 and for the rural public high school and non-public high school the difference was: -0.14846, p=0.09. However, these results are significant only for the groups of urban public high school and rural public high school, p = 0.00, p &lt;0.05. [For the full proceedings, see ED626668.]",

Starting with an examination of traditional grading practices, the author moves on to explore contract grading as an alternative to the free-market, capitalistic approach to higher education in the United States and its apparent ultimate goal of maintaining/exacerbating the nation's class boundaries and current unequal distribution of wealth and power. The author's use of contract grading as a vehicle for the exploration of the systemic forces at play in United States higher education symbolizes the implied thesis of the essay--the primacy of traditional grading as the sole means to evaluate student learning is evidence of majoritarian America's almost pathological quest to maintain the unequal and inequitable distribution of and access to wealth and influence within American society by reducing educational attainment to a mere means of production, the relative value of which is maintained by limiting the supply of educated individuals; thus, contract grading is itself a means to a very different sort of end: the fair and equitable recomposition of American society.",

These trends have had a profound impact on the survival and growth of universities. First, universities need to shoulder the knowledge creation work in many fields related to human survival and development in the era of the knowledge economy. Secondly, they must adapt to the influence of the technological revolution on human knowledge acquisition methods and change traditions. I will further explore the new requirements for talents in the new era and adjust our talent training concepts, values and models. How universities respond to challenges through operational changes and explore new models of higher education in line with social development in the new era is a topic that universities worldwide need to think about. The study aims to create an effective model to improve the interaction between the lectures and seminars objectives and activities based on CDIO standards 3 and 8. The integrated curriculum and active learning are crucial for improving future students' engineers' skills. Consequently, students will participate efficiently in the learning process. The study will focus on the concept of a &quot;student-centered&quot; learning environment based on the active learning model by using the research to create a compelling student engagement in the learning process. The positioning, goals, and learning model of the work promotes the improvement of the student's engagement and learning mode in this context, pays attention to the course-student interaction in the process, stimulates students' learning initiative, and promotes the teaching reform of participating colleges. The study aims to Increase the students' work and outcome towards creative results. [For the full proceedings, see ED626668.]",

        "description":"&quot;Children's Budget 2022&quot; finds that the share of federal spending on children climbed to a historic 11.98% of the U.S. budget in FY 2022, producing remarkable declines in child poverty, hunger and the rate of children without health insurance. The report finds that the share of U.S. domestic and international spending on children rose 21% over the last five years, making up 11.98% of all federal spending in FY 2022 (11.88% for domestic, 0.10% for international). This share stands in stark contrast to pre-pandemic investments when the total share of federal spending on children was only 7.55% of the federal budget. Congress, however, has begun backing off these investments, with inflation-adjusted dollars for children dropping nearly 17% between FY 2021 and FY 2022. The report tracks federal spending in roughly 250 domestic and international programs. This year for the first time First Focus on Children began to track outlays that protect children from the impact of climate change, air pollution, toxic substances, pesticides, and other areas of environmental health.

The main aim of this research is to determine the effects of multimodal representations on students' science learning. Quasi-experimental with pre-test and post-test design was used in this study. This study was conducted with total of 35 students that were 7th graders of a public middle school located in Istanbul province in Turkey. Experimental group (n=19) was taught science lessons according to multimodal representations. They performed writing tasks by using multimodal representations. Control group (n=16) was taught science lessons according to National Ministry of Education's existing program. The data was gathered by Science Achievement Test that was used as a pre-test and post-test. Results of the study indicated that there is a meaningful difference between pretests and posttests of science achievement test scores in both experimental and control group. Thus, findings supported that teaching science to students with multimodal representations contributed to their science learning. [For the full proceedings, see ED626668.]",

        "author":["Atilgan, Davut"],
        "description":"Competition refers to a phenomenon that can affect and direct observable human behaviour. Competitiveness can be a triggering factor in achieving success and focusing on the target. The individual competitiveness scale can provide an opportunity to observe and evaluate students participating in various competitions within the scope of exams. This study seeks to examine the individual competitiveness perceptions of the students who take special talent exams according to some demographic variables. This quantitative study was carried out in a descriptive survey model. The sample of the study consists of 218 students who participated in the special talent exams held in September 2021 at Kahramanmaras Sutçu Imam University Faculty of Sports Sciences. Data were analysed using the statistical software program Jamovi 1.6.12. Arithmetic mean and standard deviation values were determined for data analysis while t-Test and One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were used to determine the differentiation status of participant views in terms of demographic variables, and Post-Hoc tests were used to determine the groups with difference for the significant F value. As a result of the research, it was observed that there were significant relationships between the participants' Individual Competitiveness Scale and the CPT (Core Proficiency Test/Exam) score, age, sports branch and weekly work-out variables according to the &quot;Enjoyment of Competition&quot; sub-scale. According to the ' Competition Avoidance' sub-scale, there were significant relationships in terms of the CPT score, age, and weekly work-out number variables and that there was no significant relationship in terms of sports branch variable. As a result, students' individual competitiveness perceptions were determined in terms of different variables. [For the full proceedings, see ED626668.]",

The lockdown also compromised the ability of educational institutions to support social-emotional learning (SEL). The educational institutions stumble upon many challenges during that period as the semester continued while the students and teachers didn't arrive to the institution. This qualitative phenomenological study analyzed seven interviews in the interpretive approach of pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers learned via the Book Creator, which is a digital platform for creating and sharing digital books. Therefore, we asked: What characteristics of social-emotional learning were expressed, according to pre-service teachers' perception who used Book Creator? The findings indicate three themes: social learning, ethics in learning and humanistic assessment. The students indicated that proper use of the Book Creator can bridge the complexity of teaching and learning during the pandemic and integrate the social-emotional learning principles while emphasizing the importance of ethics in learning.

A good supervision program involves a relationship that depends on certain circumstances, frameworks, prior experiences of supervisors, personalities of supervisors and doctoral students, etc. The supervision relationship requires a holistic approach that needs to be rethought from the perspective of intersectionality, as the perception of supervision tasks by supervisors and doctoral students is generally inadequate. This study aims to examine intersectionality in doctoral supervision in terms of the interrelatedness of inequalities based on identities such as gender, epistemology, culture, class, and sexual orientation from the perspective of supervisors. The goal is to provide an objective look at the complex scene of doctoral supervision today. A conceptual framework is presented to demonstrate the intersectional perspective in relation to the interrelationship of inequalities in the process of doctoral supervision.

        "author":["Elonge, Michael N."],
        "description":"A major challenge in economics and financial education is frequently the attempt to explain the disparities in household consumption spending. Household income determines the quality and quantity of goods and services that a household could consume. The amount of income available to a household is a major determinant of the disparities in household consumption spending. Although the role of income in household consumption spending is widely documented, other economic factors also contribute to the disparities such as accumulated wealth, price, taste, and preference of the household. Interestingly, these economic factors or economic knowledge are learnable and acquired from basic economic education. Consequently, this paper assumes that basic economic education knowledge predicts household consumption spending disparities. A presurvey of 120 out of 150 individuals participating in professional development training indicated that they have difficulties living financially well as compared to some of their friends with the same or less salaries and similar family responsibilities. After participating in basic economics education classes, a post-survey from the same participants was analyzed using SPSS multiple regression. The result from the data analysis and the progressions of the paper revealed that economic education significantly predicts household consumption spending disparities.

        "description":"Use of force by police are gaining deserved attention and scrutiny. Citizens wonder if police use of force is always proportional and necessary. Even though police organizations routinely train officers on proper use of force, how can the public know if use of force policies and training procedures adequately address use of force? With this manuscript, a longitudinal examination of policy instruction on use of deadly force by police begins. Two central questions endured: how do retired officers perceive the effectiveness of deadly force training and how do retired officers perceive training on critical thinking and discretion? Through the course of interviews with retired officers, themes such as, enhanced training, critical thinking development, and proper use of discretion appeared. These areas emerged as most important in avoiding improper use of deadly force by police. We conclude that reality-based training, evidence-based critical thinking skills, and development of proper discretion are advised to maximize proper use of force by police and gain citizens' confidence that force used is defensible and supportable.

        "description":"When too much visual stimuli is present, the phenomenon of clutter is known to degrade an individual's perception across a variety of domains, ranging from completing search tasks incorrectly, to decreasing reading speed when letters are too close together. However, research is lacking as to whether the negative effects of clutter impact learning when too many words are visible at any one given time. Furthermore, colour has been implicated in affecting clutter. Thus, the present study created a recognition experiment whereby 42 participants had to learn target words that were presented in black or red font and positioned amongst no clutter, clutter words (distractor words surrounded the target), and clutter non-words (sequence of random letters surrounded the target). Results found that words learned in isolation were identified faster and significantly more accurately than words learned in both forms of clutter. Although red target words did not eliminate the negative effects of clutter, red words did show a trend towards higher accuracy of recognition compared to black words. These results would appear to be explained by existing clutter theories that state the limits of attentional resources and short-term memory cannot process excess visual stimuli. These findings have real-world implications for establishing optimal reading formats to improve learning.",

And in accordance with the results, it was necessary to justify the choice of methods for management and content of information security training in order to minimize the negative impact on the psychological state of a child of middle school age. The purpose of the research is to determine the impact of educational elements from a specific subject area related to information security guaranteeing on the level of anxiety of secondary schools students. The authors identified the need to assess the level of anxiety of students while studying aspects of information security in a particular subject area and proposed tools for tracking the level of anxiety. In the middle school, during the formation of a comprehensive idea of professional activities in the field of information security, especially at the pre-profile stage, an approach that forms the basis for the formation of the content of information security training is substantiated. It combines the knowledge from a wide range of different sciences for teaching secondary school students. The study shows that the level of situational anxiety of secondary school students while studying aspects of information security in a particular subject area can increase due to the natural reaction of the body, adapting to new potential threats for it. It was experimentally established that the level of personal anxiety as a result of assimilation of new knowledge about information security did not change both before studying the educational elements of information security in a particular subject area, and after studying them.",

The study compares a guided arrangement with worked examples to an exploratory learning scenario. Leading questions for the design of the study and analysis are as follows: Does the guided group develop more tasks? Does the explorative group test more functionalities of the digital workbench? Does the guided group report lower cognitive load and a more positive attitude toward the workbench? The analysis of the elements created within the workbench reveals that the guided group was able to develop more tasks, while there was no difference in quality. The data show that the explorative group was able to test more functionalities; however, the difference was not significant. The results of the questionnaire show that the overall cognitive load also did not differ significantly. There are differences in the scales, which are discussed more deeply in this article. Regarding the further use of the digital workbench , both groups report a positive attitude. It can be concluded that learning to use a new digital environment for developing examination tasks should be supported; however, the form of guidance can be subject to further investigation.",

In this paper, we develop and trial a tagset for the characteristics of university students' self-set goals. The novelty of this approach consists in using data-driven, non-exclusive tags, rather than theory-derived, exclusive categories, on the basis of freely formulated goals in natural language. A 400-goal sample out of the 2,262 educational goals collected from 732 students at three universities was used to develop a tagset of six metatags and 28 tags. Six coders independently assigned tags to the collected goals. Based on these tag assignments (n = 376,458), Krippendorff's [alpha] was used to approximate intercoder reliability. Surprising intercoder agreement scores are discussed. Further, relative frequencies for each of the tags were calculated. These point to relevant aspects of students' motivations. The tagged dataset may serve as input for AI-powered study assistant systems, whilst the tagset itself may be used in future studies to gain further insights into university students' study motivations.",

        "author":["Jost, Patrick"],
        "description":"Exploratory learning has become a widely applied, pedagogical concept. One approach to encourage exploratory knowledge creation are situated game experiences. Putting learners in quest-based environments can thereby support engagement through exploration and at the same time, allow for a variety of supportive learning strategies. However, examination of progress and investigation of success or motivational factors remain challenging in exploratory pedagogy. Evaluation in learning quests can interrupt the flow experience that supports engaging and successful learning in exploratory environments. This paper presents an approach for unobtrusive dialogic investigation in quest-based learning environments. Building on the results of an existing exploratory game quest to raise privacy awareness, the study conducts a dual between-subjects investigation to identify the motives of sharing fake news. The study, therefore, extends a mini-quest with a character to build a dialogic investigation for evaluating the intentions behind sharing of fake headlines. Concurrently, the impact on perception of flow and the robustness of the suggested dialogic inquiry is assessed by comparison to the prior non-dialogic evaluation. The results of the experiment with participating educators and students (N = 92) from two European universities confirm students more likely share fake news than educators and suggests hedonic rather than pragmatic motives as drivers of the sharing decision. The dialogic investigation with the mini-quest shows that students perceive fake news headlines as significantly funnier than educators while also spending less time reflecting if they are real or fake. Flow experience did not improve significantly by changing to dialogic questioning. However, positive tendencies in all flow sub-measures indicate that adding a character and inquiring with dialogue rather supports than breaks the sense fluency in exploratory learning quests. Implications for the design of analytical mini-quests as well as further research directions are outlined conclusively.",

Starting from a literature review, we formulate a dual quantitative model of an on-line collaboration knowledge building (OCKB) that described these communicative functions, and aim to validate this model in a computer science topic related OCKB with a total of n=44 participants. Corpuses are collected for manual dialog act coding and communicative function variable calculations. A regression analysis failed to provide for the hypothesized model on seven of the eight tests on the basis of quantitative data. Findings suggest the imperative communication function best explain the assessment results statistically alone and in some significance in combination with some of the other communicative functions.",

        "description":"Simulation-based learning environments are used extensively to support learning in complex business systems. Nevertheless, studies show that subjects have great difficulty in understanding and managing dynamic systems, mainly due to cognitive processing difficulties. Previous research has addressed some aspects of model transparency and instructional strategy and produced inconclusive results about their impact on learning effectiveness. This study explores the learning and performance effects of using transparent simulations (that is, showing users the internal structure of models) and applying structural and behavioural debriefings focussed respectively on the critical variables and relations and on the relation between model structure, patterns of actions, and system behaviour. We present a set of hypotheses about the influence of the model transparency and debriefing conditions on participants' performance and comprehension of the system dynamics. In a simulation experiment, participants interacted with a system dynamics model, representing the growth of a business venture. Participants provided with the more transparent strategy and exposed to structure and behavioural debriefings achieved higher performance and demonstrated better comprehension of the model dynamics. However, our findings indicate that while these conditions are beneficial for understanding the business system dynamics, making only the simulator transparent, even combined with structural debriefing, is more limited in its effect. Three out of the six hypotheses were confirmed. Structural debriefing (in conjunction with model transparency) positively influences performance, behavioural debriefing (combined with model transparency) positively influences both model dynamics comprehension and performance.",

Due to crisis, face-to-face learning process was changed with Emergency Remote Teaching. In this article we approached the case study for university education, on the use of learning platforms, to increase reflective learning, critical reflection and concrete action of students in real life which are clear elements of transformative learning and related to the new educational paradigm -- paragogy (peer-learning). In order to have a significant outcome of our proposed solutions, we proceed in two-steps. Firstly, we detail and test some of the existing e-learning tools (platforms), and secondly, based on a focus-group experience with groups of students enrolled in computer-science Bachelor degree, we propose adapted solutions for online learning and teaching for the next academic year.",

The results indicated that these learners had good experiences with the metacognitive listening practice, especially in terms of dependability, novelty, and stimulation. The good experiences may be due to their perceived development of listening comprehension, listening strategies, and the involvement of video listening materials.

A total of 88 freshmen participated in the study by attending a two-week thinking skills course provided by the researchers. The CM-ES translated and modified from the Academic Emotion Scale of Govaerts and Grégoire (2008) was used to collect the students' emotions of concept mapping. A five-dimensional scale, including &quot;frustration,&quot; &quot;anxiety,&quot; &quot;shame,&quot; &quot;enjoyment,&quot; and &quot;hope,&quot; was obtained through exploratory factor analysis, and Cronbach's reliability coefficient indicates good reliability and validity of CM-ES. The result shows that the emotion of the students' concept mapping is relatively positive. The development of the CM-ES provides the researchers and educators with an effective tool to measure the emotion of concept mapping and helps researchers understand students' emotions when using concept maps.",

Firstly, we investigated whether the use of problem-based projects supported students in implementing different cryptography algorithms as part of a group assignment. Secondly, we determined to which extent the use of problem-based projects enhanced students' self-directed learning. A qualitative methodology was followed. A cohort of 21 honours students enrolled for this elective course in Information Security. Students worked mainly in small groups of two on a project. Data collection involved completion of open-ended questions regarding information security and students' previous experiences in problem-based environments, completion of project sheets and narrative reflections regarding their project work. The data were manually coded to identify certain patterns of meaning. Results showed that problem-based projects provided opportunities for learning 'useful things in life' and strengthened team members' knowledge and skills. Problem-based projects served as a catalyst for enhancing students' self-directed learning in this Information Security course, which is beneficial for addressing real-life scenarios in the Information Technology profession. Additionally, an integrated model for self-directed learning skill development in a problem-based context was proposed.",

The results reveal two students' opposite experiences. While one struggled to get acquainted with the task and the associated programming activity, the other was able to handle and solve the task using computational thinking (CT) and programming skills very easily.

Jigsaw is a collaborative inquiry-based learning technique that works by dividing the learning material into different tasks and the class into different groups. What set out to be a controlled experiment in increasing motivation and participation through collaboration, turned into a much more complex scenario due to the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, which gave us some interesting results to report. We have seen more positive results this year than the last: the number of students that felt that Jigsaw requires more effort than traditional methods has fallen, they consistently thought that Jigsaw improved teamwork, and they felt they have learned more from their expert peers as the experiment advanced. Some of the results may be due to the confinement forcing people stay indoors, with no social outings and fewer distractions--so more time to study. Another factor that may be relevant are the implicit expectations that were set by the confinement about distance learning and the need to cooperate.",

When campuses were closed around the world in the spring of 2020, it was not possible for students to access the computer labs nor the robotics equipment that was traditionally used to facilitate the instruction of robotics programming units. This paper presents a design research project in which two secondary institutions in Canada and Turkey collaborated to teach computer science and robotics programming, specifically reinforcement learning, through the use of an online simulation environment. The two student cohorts in the study both were successful in developing reinforcement learning models for autonomous vehicles, despite not having any prior experience in machine learning nor artificial intelligence. The implications of this work are that physical robotics kits and dedicated robotics spaces are not essential to the teaching of programming and robotics. This is especially relevant to marginalized communities that do not have the resources to support robotics instruction, further exacerbating the digital divide.",

It also has an impact on learning process which may not work properly. Damage to learning infrastructure, loss of student interest and motivation, and limited human resources after a disaster may be the factors that determine how quickly the community can rise up and recover from this situation. This study aims to create an adaptive post-disaster learning model that can be used to maintain the learning process optimally. The study employed qualitative research method with a research and development model. Observation activities, semi-structured interviews, and focus group discussions were conducted on a group of respondents consistent with the characteristics of the study. The results show that the post-disaster learning model should focus on existing resources in evacuee camps (local wisdom). This learning model can be achieved through optimizing existing teaching materials in the affected areas or by carrying out social fun activities while maintaining the achievement of learner's competence in certain subjects. Thus, this study provides an initial framework for explaining a suitable learning model that can be used in disaster-stricken areas.",

The study was conducted on 53 university students to identify the factors that affected metacognition changes in terms of their awareness and behavior dimensions when using the LAD. In terms of results, first, the students' perception of visual attraction for the LAD, and behaviors related to reflection such as deleting annotations they had previously added, positively affected the changes in the &quot;knowledge of cognition&quot; dimension of metacognition. Second, students' perception of behavioral changes by using the LAD had positive effects on the &quot;regulation of cognition&quot; dimension of metacognition.

This may be the case in other vocational training centres. Thus, this study examined the influence of English as a Second Language on trainees' academic performance at Eenhana Vocational Training Centre in Namibia. The study, therefore, tried to answer these questions; (a) What factors in English influence trainees' academic performance? (b) How did the influence of English as a Second Language and medium of instruction affect other subjects? (c) How did the trainees comprehend their academic work? '.This is a qualitative study which used the snowball sampling method to select 5 trainers and 10 trainees as participants.'. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews, participants observations and document examinations. Narrative and thematic analysis were used in analyzing data. The study revealed that the performance of trainees in their academic work is determined by their ability to understand English as a Second Language. Their proficiency level in English influences how best or poorly they can perform in their academic work. It was also found that trainees who have poor English language proficiency find it difficult to understand their subjects content and also performing their best in academic work, while those who are good at the language perform well academically as they can understand what they are learning and they can handle the assessment activities appropriately. The study will inform the Higher Education policymakers, trainers, and trainees as it enhances an understanding of the influences of English as a medium of instruction on other subjects for them to employ the best teaching and learning strategies such as Access or bridging courses to improve the problem caused by the language barrier.",

Millions of students receive school-based health services, and for many students, schools are their first and only option to receive health care. State policymakers have a lot to consider in this policy area, including funding, workforce needs and coordination of efforts across agencies. State leaders are not only enabling health services to be offered in schools but working to ensure equitable access to those services for students who may otherwise struggle to receive them.

It is important that young people acquire language skills at school, especially during secondary schools, so as not to be penalized at university or when looking for work. However, English is one of the most difficult subjects for students and remedial work interventions are often necessary. In this, but also in general in teaching and learning English, technologies can offer important support. The University of Turin has designed and implemented innovative methodologies for remedial work, based on the use of an integrated Digital Learning Environment. The context of this research is an interactive online course for the remedial work of English which involved 11 classes of a secondary school for a total of 265 students. Our research questions concerning the design and implementation of activities and resources to involve students and what utility and interest they have induced in students. To answer the research questions, the paths on the platform and the activities and resources created by the tutors were analyzed. To understand if students and teachers appreciated the remedial work path and if they considered it useful, their answers to the final questionnaire, completed at the end of the remedial work path, were analyzed.",

In particular, augmented reality as a multimedia learning environment has been found to be potentially more effective than learning using traditional methods, such as paper-based textbooks. According to the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, it can help reduce the extraneous cognitive load and improve learning by employing the spatial continuity principle. In this paper, the impact of the spatial continuity principle on the augmented reality learning system was tested by comparing the cognitive load and learning performance of two separate learning systems. The experimental results showed that the explanation integration system, which applies the principle of spatial continuity to the augmented reality learning system, was more effective in terms of knowledge retention. However, the results on the cognitive load contrasted previous research findings on the spatial continuity principle approach, as no differences were found in the extraneous cognitive load of the learners in the two systems.",

Distributed Practice (DP) and Retrieval Practice (RP) are evidence-based practices that have shown to lead to efficient and durable learning. Studies investigating Distributed Retrieval Practice (DRP), a combination of the two evidence-based practices, have found positive effects of DRP on university student learning of anatomy and vocabulary items. As CT is considered to be a complex thinking skill, one that is acquired over time with practice, we investigated whether DRP had durable effects on primary student learning of CT concepts. We conducted a quasi-experimental study involving 20 primary school students between 11 and 12 years of age. The students participated in 6 weekly sessions on CT and completed two tests -- one at the end of the fifth session (immediate) and the other a week later (delayed). At the end of each of the first 4 sessions, students performed DRP by completing a class-wide review quiz consisting of 5 multiple-choice questions. The results of the study show that students attained higher scores on the delayed test (72.6% ± 19.2) in comparison to the immediate test (67.9% ± 20.7). However, the difference in scores was not significant. The results suggest that DRP may play a role in helping students overcome the natural decay of memory, however, studies with a larger sample size are required. Further, this study demonstrates that DRP can be applied in an authentic classroom environment that involves primary school student learning of a complex subject such as CT.",

        "description":"To examine the appropriate information disclosure method of noise as the final goal, we firstly set the goal to grasp the degree of understanding of the dB values of the sound sources among people other than acoustic experts. In this paper, first, in order to measure the degree of understanding of the dB in university students without expert knowledge, we developed a loudness chart kit and evaluated the understanding of loudness in the classes. As a result, they commonly regarded the sound volumes of the rocket and the take-off of the airplanes as first or second loudest, but the subjective ranks of other sound sources were completely different among them. Some of the students who seem to have no knowledge at all about the sound source answered unreality values entirely. Furthermore, since the university class was brought online due to the influence of the new coronavirus, we developed an online version of this teaching material. In the future, we will measure the changes in the evaluated dBs after learning the dB values. Then, we also accumulate more data about the differences of the understanding degree in dB values among the individual characteristics including their university, nationality, and whether they are environmental officials, to discuss the diagnostic criteria of the volume of the sound. Moreover, we will discuss how to learn a sense of loudness and dB. This reports on the online version of the teaching materials developed as university class are now online due to the impact of the novel coronavirus.",

In this paper, in order to help teachers improve lessons and teaching materials, and to help students review their own learning attitude, we propose functions for retrospective review. We focus on unfocused time, page transitions, number of keyboard operations and number of mouse clicks to extract the learning attitude of each student during the class. This function divides student's learning attitude into five categories, i.e. following the class and concentrated on it, following but not concentrated, jumping ahead, falling behind, and not participating. The system also provides visualization of changes in learning attitude during the class. It can be used for teacher's and students' retrospective review after the lecture.",

One of the possibilities of achieving this goal is co-teaching and its forms, which are constantly evolving. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of approaches not only to the actual implementation of co-teaching, but also to the whole process of preparation in order to evaluate the experience gained in a number of researches already carried out, in the form of an overview study. An inductive thematic analysis of published articles in 2005-2020, with a predominance of attention for the period 2019 and 2020, was used in 16 databases such as ERIC, Scopus®, Complementary Index, etc. As a result, 19 articles were finally included in the analysis of the issues examined. Inductive thematic analysis identified six themes: (1) &quot;co-teaching effectiveness&quot;, (2) &quot;problems and obstacles&quot;, (3) &quot;methods of and with co-teaching&quot;, (4) &quot;teachers' roles and relationships&quot;, (5) &quot;teachers' cooperation&quot;, and (6) &quot;special educational needs&quot; (SEN). The scoping review study covers the theoretical basis of co-teaching issues, the results of research surveys or experiments on the procedures, advantages or barriers of various co-teaching models. The study serves as a basic framework supporting the creation and application of a virtual component as a new part of the educational method of co-teaching solved by the TACR project.",

The university strategy of Orient@mente first started in 2014 and, after six years of deployment of the online platform, it has collected many data from students that were interested in starting a university course. The natural comparison and correlation analysis juxtapose the academic results of students who practice self-assessment in Orient@mente with the other university students. The measurable that we considered in this comparison is the average number of ECTS acquired during the first year, since this is a number that is considered for the university evaluation system -- stakeholders in particular check the number of students who obtain more than 40 first-year ECTS. According to specific rules, we put together dataset from different origins, the platform logs, and users with the university record system. The results of this analysis, presented in this work, confirm the positive impact of Orient@mente on students, with statistical significance.",

PISA 2018 data which has been released are used for research development purposes. The data were taken from questionnaires who were answered by 15th -year-students of 80 countries. The data consist of 612.004 international students and 12.098 Indonesian students. The results of the Analysis of Variance states that there was a significant difference (P &lt;0,000) of students' perceptions of reading objectives among students in countries which have above and below the average score of the OECD. While based on the analysis of Rasch Model, the reliability of Indonesian students was 0.36 while international data 0.51. Although they both are low, the reliability of Indonesian students is lower. The study concludes that the most students' states both (upper and below group) &quot;Disagree&quot; if the purpose of reading is only to fulfill obligations, merely hobbies, and spend time.

In our previous work, we have designed a learning model and a cognitive tool named iLSB to support learners in expanding the initial question into sub-questions so as to deepen and widen their investigation, and in creating their own learning scenario. The learning model consists of two processes of &quot;knowledge construction&quot; and &quot;knowledge linearization&quot;. Learners are expected to construct knowledge using iLSB in the former process, and to linearize their knowledge to prepare a paper for report on their investigation in the latter process In this paper, we focus on how to help learners to make a summary of the paper by means of graphic organizers, which embed five types of information structure in expository text. This paper demonstrates how iLSB allows learners to build text structure of a summary with graphic organizers. We also report a case study whose purpose was to assess the effectiveness of it. The results suggest that graphic organizers function effectively as a scaffold for building comprehensive summary with fewer efforts.",

        "description":"For more than 25 years, thousands of colleges and universities have used the Ruffalo Noel Levitz (RNL) Satisfaction-Priorities Surveys to assess their students, strengthen the student experience, increase student success and completion, and prioritize campus planning initiatives. The surveys are valued so highly because they reveal where institutions are succeeding and where they should focus their attention and resources. By asking students to rate their satisfaction and priorities, campuses can quickly uncover strengths and challenges. The RNL surveys take a comprehensive look at the student experience, asking students for their feedback on issues inside and outside the classroom, and then provide peer institution benchmarks for specific student groups. This year's national report reflects cumulative data for three academic years: 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22, with the majority of the responses collected following the onset of the pandemic in the spring of 2020. In addition, this report looks at the overall satisfaction scores by academic year for the most recent five-year trends to provide a better understanding of how perceptions have shifted in recent years. It also examines how institutions are performing on high priority items to show which institution types are meeting or failing to meet student expectations. Finally, the report takes a deeper dive into satisfaction levels for items related to the important category of campus climate to see how institutions are performing.

        "description":"Online learning, hybrid learning, correspondence education, hyflex learning, blended learning, and distance education are terms that have been used by institutions, scholars, policymakers, accreditors, and more to describe the variety of course delivery options that are available today. These terms may often be used interchangeably or in ways that conflate their meaning. This creates a lack of clarity and understanding. The definitions of these terms have important policy implications as institutions must manage multiple and sometimes conflicting definitions and interpretations from regulators and accreditors. This paper reviews the definitions of just one of these terms, &quot;distance education,&quot; as it is the most commonly used in policy references. The purpose of this review is to highlight the challenges and risks associated with navigating multiple sources of &quot;distance education&quot; definitions in policy. There are an increasing number of terms (e.g., hybrid, blended, hyflex) used to describe the use of digital instructional tools. The focus on the definitional difficulties in policies for this one term serves as an indicator of how difficult oversight and compliance can become when additional terms come into play.

        "description":"For more than 70 years, the federal government has supported efforts to improve adult literacy and other basic skills. Many adults need help with basic skills like reading, writing, mathematics, and English proficiency to succeed in the American workforce. Congress has long provided resources to help individuals address these educational challenges, most recently through Title II of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) of 2014. But WIOA includes new requirements and incentives to strengthen the link between adult education and the overall workforce development system, to move adults into and along a career pathway. This report from a national evaluation of Title II examines the extent to which local adult education providers' instructional approaches and coordination with other agencies reflect this link and highlights the challenges providers experience in collecting related performance data. The report describes providers' reported experiences in program year 2018-19, the first year when the more than 1,600 providers receiving federal Title II funds were expected to operate under WIOA's rules and before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted provider operations.

        "description":"The role of school leader is increasingly complex, and the impact of the pandemic made these jobs almost impossible at times. Principal burnout is often high, and morale is often low. Retaining and supporting strong principals, who have a measurable impact on the success of their students, is a priority for the field. This case study describes how Granite School District used one strategy -- transforming the principal supervisor role -- to both improve principal skills and deepen these leaders' commitment to staying in their roles. Granite made a massive shift in the principal supervisor role from one focused on compliance to one focused on coaching. This case study describes the ideological and cultural shifts that were necessary -- as well as the positive impact they had on both educators and students. Districts which are facing increased turnover should seriously consider lowering their supervisor-principal ratios and providing their supervisors with the training to recraft their roles into ones that are focused more on the support that principals need and deserve and less on accountability. All districts should take stock of their principals' intentions to leave or stay -- and then take action to retain talent in this critical role.",

Results indicated improvements in overall school-wide implementation of restorative consequences, and gains in teacher use of existing discipline approaches as well as restorative practices. Results also indicated increases in early adopters' confidence level with motivating students and engaging them in appropriate behavior across the duration of the study. Challenges associated with implementation included aligning administrative commitment to restorative practices with individual teachers willingness to change classroom practices, allocating sufficient time for changing policies and practices and overcoming logistical challenges to maximize coaching benefits. Finally, we discuss our field test findings within the current recommendations for advancing the evidence-base supporting restorative practices in schools.

This guidebook is built on early lessons of bridge programs in Illinois. It is designed as a resource for those who want to develop a new bridge program or strengthen or expand an existing one. This guidebook is intended for program directors, deans, curriculum developers, instructors, career development staff, and support services staff in adult education, career and technical education, developmental education, occupational training, employment, and social services who may be based at community colleges, community-based organizations, workforce agencies, social service organizations, employer associations, and even individual employers. Public and private funders, four-year colleges, advocacy organizations, elected officials, and others who work with low-skilled adults may also find it useful. This guidebook is comprehensive and concrete, including basics, strategies, examples, and worksheets. It is organized to help new programs to anticipate essential steps and to help those who need &quot;just in time information&quot; for redesigning a program or improving a particular program element. Recognizing that bridge programs take a long time to develop, get right, and sustain, this guidebook also includes tips for the continuous improvements required to get the right population, adequate funding, best outcomes, and to adapt to changing contexts to sustain the effort.

In the early 20th century, as this country witnessed expanded growth and tremendous work opportunities, it became apparent that in order to have a productive workforce and economic stability, the language needs of so many arriving immigrants would need to be met in order for them to assimilate into the culture of this country. This paper s is a history of federal legislation and efforts to improve adult education in the United States--a history that may offer some insight and direction in years to come. In the following chapters, this paper discusses the evolution of the Federal Government's role in promoting adult education by placing major legislation, and significant amendments to that legislation, into historical, economic, and social contexts.

        "description":"The education students deserve starts with great and diverse teachers. But while many states have made impressive progress on diversifying the teacher workforce, that progress could be at risk. This is because school districts commonly use seniority--&quot;Last In, First Out,&quot; or LIFO--to determine which teachers to lay off. But LIFO is not colorblind: Early-career teachers are more likely to identify as people of color, and thus most likely to be let go. This report, written with Educators for Excellence, explores the potential impact of LIFO in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes analysis of new state teacher workforce data, as well as specific ideas for how states and districts can replace LIFO with policies that protect teachers of color. &quot;So All Students Thrive&quot; shows the urgent need to retain these educators and offers solutions for making sure our schools do so. Our students' futures depend on it. [This report was produced with Educators for Excellence.]",

        "description":"The Biden Administration expects to resettle 95,000 Afghan evacuees in communities across the United States by September 2022. Some evacuees come to the United States with strong English proficiency and years of experience working as entrepreneurs or community leaders or for the United States military. Others, especially women, have had limited opportunities to achieve an education or learn English. City governments and resettlement agencies cannot respond to these diverse needs on their own. Because of this, the State Department launched a partnership with the nonprofit Welcome.US to coordinate the resettlement efforts to meet these disparate needs and encourage groups working with Afghan evacuees to think creatively about how they can channel their unique skills and resources to help our new Afghan neighbors.",

Disrupted learning, sometimes stretching for two years, forced many students off track and behind academically. Leaders are now faced an unprecedented need to make smart investments with federal relief funds in efforts that accelerate student learning. District leaders should move quickly and thoughtfully to effectively spend the $190 billion in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) grant money to help students. This report offers the following policy recommendations from the George W. Bush Institute: (1) Focus on strategies that create more time for instruction; (2) Give decision-making power to those closest to students; (3) Invest in the educators needed to lead; (4) Strengthen governance to ensure strong implementation; and (5) Prepare for transparent decision-making and progress reporting.",

This is true in a normal school year, and it is even more critical now because of the pandemic's massive disruption of schooling for the Nation's young people. The following policy recommendations from the George W. Bush Institute are presented for educational accountability: (1) Administer state annual exams and disseminate results; (2) Double down on rigor and high expectations for students; (3) Provide parents with clear, actionable information about state test results; (4) Make state annual exams the cornerstone of state accountability systems; and (5) Align federal pandemic relief to accelerate student learning.",

Nearly half of all households are experiencing acute food insecurity, maternal and infant mortality rates are rising quickly, and 97% of families are at risk of dropping below the poverty line. Most concerning is the intentional and vicious erasure of women and girls from public life by the Taliban, especially the ban on girls' access to secondary education and the rapid deterioration of education quality across the country. What is happening to the women and girls of Afghanistan creates not simply a moral imperative, but a growing threat to regional and even global peace, prosperity, and security. Dire as the situation may be, it is not hopeless. This report discusses steps the United States and allies can take, along with civil society and others, to mitigate the suffering of Afghan women and girls and provide opportunities in an otherwise bleak situation.",

Food, affordable housing, transportation, and childcare are central conditions for learning. Yet with stagnant incomes, rising tuition and living costs, and insufficient support from financial aid and the social safety net, approximately one in two community college students struggle to afford these basic needs. Additionally, as many as one in five experience homelessness. The College Housing Assistance Program (CHAP), operated by the Tacoma Housing Authority (THA) and Tacoma Community College (TCC), is at the forefront of the nationwide fight to ameliorate homelessness among college students. CHAP is one of the country's first partnerships between a housing authority and a community college and offers a unique model. In contrast to other programs such as student-run shelters, rapid-rehousing, and college-owned affordable apartments, CHAP utilizes government-subsidized housing assistance to provide housing to homeless and near-homeless community college students. This report offers the initial lessons learned from the first external evaluation of CHAP. Successful program implementation is crucial to providing benefits for students, and can be especially challenging in housing programs. We therefore focus on how students experienced the program, where they faced barriers, and where they found support. It is too early in the evaluation process to draw conclusions about the program's efficacy; these are short-term insights.",

However, existing barriers to enrollment for prospective students pose equity gaps in college access and success, particularly for Black college aspirants. In Florida, racial and ethnic disparities in college enrollment contribute to disparities in educational attainment. Only 31% of Black Floridians hold a college degree. This report examines the attainment gap by exploring various factors contributing to Florida college applicants' decisions to enroll. This paper uses survey and enrollment information from two Florida community colleges (Hillsborough Community College and Miami Dade College) to identify factors related to college applicants' enrollment decisions. In the summer of 2021, nearly 15,000 applicants to the two colleges were surveyed about their pre-college experiences, and roughly 1,200 responded, resulting in a response rate of 8%. Of the respondents, 997 applicants identified as Black (i.e., African American, Black Hispanic, African, or West Indian/Caribbean).",

While college students are too often dismissed as a privileged and healthy part of the population, researchers increasingly observe housing insecurity among college students. This problem worsened during the pandemic, underscoring the link between housing, employment, mental health, and wellness. Housing is of particular importance as a critical basic need for today's undergraduate students. The study takes place before and during the ongoing pandemic, thus providing a unique opportunity to understand the short-term impacts of housing on belongingness, mental health, and academic outcomes for the five cohorts studied. This research was conducted with these questions in mind: (1) Does this scholarship influence student well-being as measured by belongingness, mental health, and/or financial wellness?; and (2) Does the provision of a housing scholarship have an impact on student retention or completion? Findings from the study suggest that rent-free community housing supports provide greater financial well-being, mental health, and postsecondary educational impacts.",

Descriptive survey has been used in present study. Using Information Blank, the primary information about student enrolment was gathered from the Chief and Zonal Educational offices of district Ganderbal. Percentage statistics was used to analyse the data. Statistical results were visualised through tables and bar graphs. The study revealed that tribals constitute 31.37% and 27.74% of aggregate Grade VI and Grade VIII enrolment respectively. The aggregate retention rate of district Ganderbal at Upper Primary stage of education was low (88.62%) while as that of tribal children also low (78.83%). The gaps/disparity between aggregate and tribal GRR were found. Gender disparity in GRR were observed in GRR of district Ganderbal. At upper primary stage, girls had low GRR (76.08%) than boys (81.48%), and tribal girls have lowest compared to boys (aggregate &amp; tribal). Zonal disparity in GRR was observed in district Ganderbal. Zone Hariganwan had lowest GRR (Tribal and Overall) compared to zone, Kangan, Ganderbal and Tullamulla at upper primary stage.",

This brief examines whether and how social and emotional skills were connected to students' experiences of exclusionary discipline. Exclusionary discipline, or disciplinary actions that remove students from a traditional classroom, included in-school suspension, out of school suspension, and referral to an alternative education program. Among the sampled students under study, 15-year-old Black and Hispanic students disproportionally experienced exclusionary discipline. Therefore, this brief focused on these student groups. It was found that students who self-reported higher levels of self-control or persistence were less likely to experience exclusionary discipline, whereas students who self-reported higher levels of assertiveness were more likely to experience exclusionary discipline.

Over 6,000 10- and 15-year-old students from 119 HISD campuses were selected to participate in SSES in the fall of 2019. In addition, their selected teachers were surveyed to complement student ratings and provide more information on how students were perceived. This brief examines to what extent teacher ratings of students' SE skills agree with or differ from student self-ratings. Social and emotional (SE) skills refer to the process by which children acquire and effectively apply the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions (OECD 2015). Examining commonalities and differences between students' self-ratings and teachers' ratings of students' SE skills could provide opportunities for teacher professional development and school curricular support around SE skill development. This study found that about half of teachers' ratings matched with students' self-ratings. Compared to other SE skills, the lowest level of student-teacher rating agreement was identified in Trust and Stress Resistance, whereas the highest level of agreement was found in Cooperation. After accounting for a variety of student, teacher and school characteristics, age cohort and course grades were the factors that more consistently help explain agreement in student-teacher rating.

        "description":"For many students, transportation presents a barrier to college completion. In 2020-21, the average commuter student could expect to spend nearly one-fifth of their total living expenses on transportation costs. Transportation programs have the potential to offer students some relief--and help them reach college graduation--yet more rigorous research on these programs' benefits is needed. This brief provides results from a quasi-experimental study on the impact of transportation supports on short- and longer-term academic outcomes for community college students at Rio Hondo College. Established in 2016 as a partnership between the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Agency (LA Metro) and participating area colleges and universities, including Rio Hondo College, the Universal College Student Transit Pass (U-Pass) provides college students with deeply discounted transit fares. Findings from this study suggest that transportation supports like U-Pass offer a promising strategy for increasing the likelihood that students will: (1) remain enrolled one semester and one year later; (2) complete a greater number of credits; and (3) earn a credential. While more research on similar programs is needed, these findings suggest that free- and reduced-cost transit fares could play a critical role in helping students earn college credentials.",

        "description":"Community colleges have started to support students' basic needs in multiple ways. Campus-based hubs offering services like public benefits access, emergency aid, food pantries and case management have become increasingly popular. However, limited evidence exists on whether connecting with these hubs improves academic success. The Advocacy and Resource Center (ARC) at Amarillo College (AC) in Texas is a well-established example of how a college can care for its students. In 2018, The Hope Center published a detailed case study of the college's approach to AC's &quot;culture of caring&quot; embodied by the ARC. At the time, the ARC served 13% of Amarillo College students, well short of the estimated two-thirds who endured basic needs insecurity. This report details the partnership with the college to conduct an evaluation advancing two institutional goals: (1) Increase utilization of the ARC, particularly among students most at risk of leaving college, with a low-cost technology-enabled approach; and (2) Estimate the academic impacts of connecting students to the ARC. The authors identified students who might benefit from the ARC: those from low-income households and those enrolled in developmental education coursework. Placement in developmental education signals insufficient K-12 preparation and/or gaps in enrollment, both of which are associated with poverty. The authors targeted personalized emails to a randomly selected group of these students informing them of and inviting them to the ARC for support. These emails had positive impacts on students at AC: (1) Rates of visiting the ARC more than doubled from 22% to 56%; and (2) Developmental education students were 20% more likely to pass developmental education courses, a crucial milestone. However, the authors did not find clear evidence that nudged students completed more credits, received higher grades, or passed other courses at higher rates. While they saw promising trends regarding retention and graduation, that may be due to chance.",

        "description":"As the coronavirus pandemic ravaged communities, cities, and countries in 2020, colleges and universities faced a unique emergency. Millions of students were struggling to meet their basic needs, and institutional emergency aid funds were rapidly running out. For the first time in history, Congress responded by authorizing billions of dollars in emergency aid to try and quickly alleviate hardships. Legislators created a separate funding stream, distinct from standard financial aid programs that required extensive means-testing and other red tape. Their goal was to act decisively and to allow flexibility, responses consistent with the urgent demands of an emergency. Colleges and universities shared that desire, but their challenges were unprecedented, in both scope and scale. Effective emergency response requires agility, capacity, and speed. No institution had ever developed a plan for anything of the magnitude of the crisis confronting them. Addressing a few emergencies a week might have been possible with pre-pandemic approaches, but addressing hundreds a day was not. This report shows how colleges and universities met the challenge, drawing on a year of surveys and focus groups, fielded and conducted by The Hope Center and DVP-Praxis, that reflect the views of institutional leaders and students from coast to coast. The results offer valuable insights that should shape the future of emergency aid and student support. While the onset of the pandemic was unprecedented, its ongoing health concerns and the looming consequences of climate change ensure that knowing how to deliver emergency aid at scale will be essential to the well-being of future students. With these lessons in mind, everyone can be better prepared and ready to respond. [Additional funding for this report was provided by the Farrar and Alline Ford Brown Foundation.]",

        "description":"As the youth mentoring field has expanded and diversified in America over the last 30-plus years, many adults who care about getting these valuable relationships to more young people have asked questions about the scope and scale of mentoring in American society. In 2014, MENTOR first started to examine these societal level trends in a seminal research study that resulted in a report called &quot;The Mentoring Effect,&quot; a first-of-its-kind attempt to capture the prevalence of both program-provided and naturally occurring mentoring relationships for America's youth. Needless to say, this research was highly illuminating as to who in society was receiving mentoring, what they were getting out of those relationships, and where there were critical gaps that needed filling. The years since that report have seen tremendous turmoil and changes in American life. Thus, MENTOR thought that the time was right to take a fresh look at some of these topics and to dig a bit deeper into the mentoring relationships that young people experience and the ways in which those relationships supported personal development and growth. MENTOR launched this research project with four core goals in mind: (1) Taking a fresh look at the mentoring &quot;gap&quot;; (2) Creating understanding about the growth of the mentoring movement over time; (3) Deepening the understanding of the value of mentoring on all American lives; and (4) Examining the things mentors do that young people find valuable.

        "description":"Structural equation modeling (SEM) has been deemed as a proper method when variables contain measurement errors. In contrast, path analysis with composite-scores is preferred for prediction and diagnosis of individuals. While path analysis with composite-scores has been criticized for yielding biased parameter estimates, recent literature pointed out that the population values of parameters in a latent-variable model depend on artificially assigned scales. Consequently, bias in parameter estimates is not a well-grounded concept for models involving latent constructs. This article compares path analysis with composite-scores against SEM with respect to effect size and statistical power in testing the significance of the path coefficients, via the z- or t-statistics. The data come from many sources with various models that are substantively determined. Results show that SEM is not as powerful as path analysis even with equally-weighted-composites. But path analysis with Bartlett-factor- scores and the partial-least-squares approach to SEM perform the best with respect to effect size and power.

However, there is a widespread concern over the rising costs of higher education which threaten every student desiring to enter college and pre-empted them to discontinue their studies. This renders higher education unaffordable for many students and their families. This phenomenon if not properly addressed may hamper the growth and development of the society. Therefore, state involvement and support is central to promoting college education affordability. This study examines the city government's initiative in establishing a local higher educational institution as an answer to the concern of rising cost of tertiary education. It was a scheme designed to manifest the city government's sincere effort in assuming its accountability as guardian of social services for the people. Further, the study also included the accessibility dimension by examining the socio-economic status of students' parents who are admitted to enroll in the local university. The tuition fee subsidy and related assistance to the local university and its constituencies are likewise included in the discussion of this paper.",

Twenty-five (25) pupils are in the experimental group and the rest of the 25 pupils under the control group. The researcher conducted a pre-test before giving the strategic intervention material and a post-test after the experimental group used it. Analysis revealed the weighted mean of 9.16 of the experimental group was higher than the mean of the control group which is 3.72 in the pretest. Posttest mean of the experimental group increased and became 12.28 which is greater than the 4.6 mean of the control group. The mean gain of the experimental group is very high compared to the mean of the control group. The t-ratio is 1.71 which means that there is a significant difference between the mean of the control and experimental group. The twenty-five (25) grade six pupils used the RIMAP for three months.

We hypothesize that students using the two versions of Rimac will learn similarly but that students who use the version that adaptively decomposes a step will learn more efficiently. Our initial results suggest support for our hypothesis but the sample size for the experiment is still small and we are continuing to collect more student interactions with the two versions of the system.",

Student veterans are typically older, married, have families and financial obligations, and often either serve as a caregiver or are being treated for a personal disability. Leaders and administrators at institutions of higher learning have an opportunity to demonstrate that student veterans are social assets to the higher education community and beyond. In this report, the Veteran Higher Education Task Force discusses six key policy recommendations to hone institutional policies that best serve and support student veterans and the military-affiliated community.

        "description":"The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) might seem something very distant from the world of schools: a theme that is far from today's reality, especially when the education and training system is committed to tackling the problems associated with the pandemic situation. However, the impact that AI is producing in various areas of our life also requires reflection on the world of education and training. Research and education policies are therefore required to direct education to prepare students for technological challenges, enabling schools and teachers to guide innovation. It is necessary to train teachers not only on the theoretical contents inherent to these themes, but also and above all on the planning of didactic activities to adopt innovative educational approaches. The context of this research is the immersive 3-hour workshop on the theme &quot;Mathematics and AI&quot; which involved 52 teachers from all over Italy from primary to secondary school. The research questions are: What is the current teaching practice in schools in Italy in terms of AI? Which characteristics should be emphasized, and which aspects should be favored in the planning of didactic activities by school teachers? To answer the research questions, we analyzed teachers' responses to the initial questionnaire before the workshop and to the final questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Key findings show that teachers do not treat AI-related topics too much with their classes while being aware of the importance of recognizing and understanding AI.",

        "description":"Due to COVID-19 pandemic, educational departments such schools, colleges, and universities have been experiencing significant disruptions. All teaching and learning activities of face-to-face learning have switched to online learning. This study provides a systemic review of the literature with the aim to investigate the effectiveness, challenges, learning tools, and suggestions in EFL online learning based on an analysis of 40 published article journal from 2019 to 2022. This study has not yet been reviewed in the literature as part of a systematic review of studies. This study is based on Kitchenman's (2009) systemic literature review (SLR) approach, which allows it to gather data from a variety of sources. The dataset has been collected from SCOPUS databases. These data were analysed using Creswell's (2012) content analysis. The research findings revealed that all e-learning tools (e.g., &quot;Voki,&quot; &quot;LMS 'TES Blended Space',&quot; &quot;Pigai,&quot; &quot;Zoom meeting&quot; etc) used by universities teachers were very effective and beneficials for learners. However, some challenges were also identified during learning activities such as students lack of learning climate, poor internet connections, financial problems, technical problems, students' demotivation etc. Thus, the research findings suggested three aspects should be considered, namely a) having extensive and high-quality online resource access, b) using online resources on a regular basis, and (c) not only students but also teachers are being trained to use ICTs-in. In addition, teachers need to keep working on reinforcing the connection between digital technology and education meanwhile students need to made aware that it is acceptable to use digital media even it the most formal of educational settings. To summarize, this study suggests that once the COVID-19 pandemic is ended, the use of technology integration on online learning in EFL classrooms can be extended for equitable quality education for students.",

In this paper, we perform analysis regarding clicks to an online course in Mathematics, aimed at allowing students to follow courses at a distance, both before and after enrolling at University. We used clustering techniques on students learning behavior, which have been defined for this research as visualizations of activities and resources of the course, to detect differences on students' grade according to their online learning behavior. Our results show that students tend to proceed on the course in both activities and resources. There is no correlation between participation and course grades, even if the most active students show higher scores. Moreover, patterns differ significantly according to the degree program of each student, showing the importance of tailored path.",

About 30,000 students (14 years old) took part in the study. Information and Communication Literacy is considered as the ability to use digital technologies to search, manage, integrate, evaluate and create information. It is one of the key competencies that all of basic school graduates should obtain. As the availability of digital technologies grows, the gap in the ability of students to use them productively becomes more and more noticeable. The study identifies the actual students' information and communication competencies deficits at the stage of middle school completion. Performance-based online Information and Communication Literacy test (ICL-test) was the main research tool of the study. An attempt was made to determine to what extent the level of students' ICC is related to the work of the school, and to what extent it depends on the extracurricular environment. The results of the study indicate a strong connection between the ICC of ninth graders and their out-of-school environment and a weak connection with the work of the school. The reasons for the insufficient level of the ICC in a significant part of the graduates of the basic school are discussed and recommendations for its increase are proposed. It was found that ICL-test is a reliable online instrument to measure students' information and communication competence.",

        "description":"Virtual universities have developed considerably over the past decade, particularly on the African continent. They provide a way to deal with the considerable need to educate a large young population, but the lack of physical space can be a drawback that prevents students from succeeding and increasing dropout compared to a more traditional face-to-face university. To limit these issues, some virtual universities have been opening Open Digital Spaces (ODS) to complement the virtual space and offer students a place where to work and solve pedagogical, technical or administrative issues. However, it is unclear how students actually make use of these ODS and which uses can be beneficial or detrimental to their success and limit dropout. In this paper we lead an exploratory study of the results of a large-scale digital survey in a major African Virtual University (N=2392 answers) to identify factors in the use of Open Digital Spaces (ODS) that have an impact on students' success and dropout. We analyzed the data using multiple Chi-Square tests of independence. Results indicate that students who visit ODSs more during the 2 weeks before an exam or only when it is mandatory are statistically less likely to succeed, contrary to students who come to work in groups or for the internet access who are more likely to succeed. Conversely, students who do not see the value of ODSs for learning and who visit only when mandatory are more likely to dropout, contrary to students who come when they have a pedagogical need or to work in groups who are less likely to dropout. Some factors particularly impact first year university students, highlighting the need to make them understand which use of the ODS are relevant to increase their chances to graduate.",

        "description":"This paper deals with a solution allowing digital universities to extend the functionalities of their distance learning platform to offer a secure solution for the dematerialization of assessments. Currently we are witnessing the rise of digital universities, this is the case in Africa, particularly in Senegal. We are witnessing strong growth in the number of students, in a context of extension and diversification of training offers. This is the case of the Virtual University of Senegal (UVS), the number of students has increased from 2,000 students in 2013, the year of its creation, to 50,000 in 2021. It offers 13 licenses and 30 courses of training. With these large numbers, the organization of assessments in these universities becomes more and more tedious. Taking the example of the UVS with 50,000 students and 30 training courses, we will have to deploy millions of exams copies due to one copy per candidate. These universities have digital campuses (connected campuses) or Open Digital Spaces (ENO) which make it possible to organize face-to-face evaluations on the table. This organization has several disadvantages, on the one hand, the management of the proofs and the correction of the copies require the mobilization of human and financial resources; on the other hand, the risks of errors, reports and authenticity of the notes. In this article, we propose a secure system for managing online assessments in digital universities based on LMS Moodle, SEB and remote monitoring with the JITSI video conferencing system. The solution will allow universities to optimize human and financial resources and make assessment results more reliable.",

The research has been consisted of the quantitative indicators analysis within the e-learning system for the time period of several academic years (before and during the pandemic) and based on the survey on students EQF level 7 who already had some previous experience in e-learning at higher education level before situation with pandemic. The results indicate that students perceived very little increase in the quantity and quality of the learning materials. The research indicated a need for wider and further institutional support for teachers and students. The institutional support should encourage teachers in their motivation for achieving quality in e-learning performance regarding instructional design and also by building up their digital competences. The results have also pointed the fact that the models from the traditional environment, such as Course Quality Management model should be adapted and integrated in the e-learning environment in order to maintain quality assurance in e-learning performance.",

        "description":"In this paper, we present didactical, technical, and interaction design aspects of a learning environment for training academic text reading skills in higher education that is currently being developed. The concept is built on experience gained from a gamified learning environment for academic abilities in the domain of German orthography standards. It uses spaced repetition for skill training instead of just memorizing facts and maintains user models that allow for adaptive task selection using expert-designed skill lists and task-skill allocations. Gamification components such as levels and ranks have been incorporated to boost motivation. Only 19% of users (n=121) ceased using the application when they reached the minimum obligatory goal in homework assignments, indicating that the motivational effects work for the target group. The foundation for transferring these experiences to a new domain is laid by analyzing academic reading skills and competencies to be trained. In the design phase, task categories, interface mockups, and gamification mechanisms for the envisioned web application have been sketched, and it will now be implemented as an open-source application.",

This insight lead to the approach to structure the field of physical computing systems with the overall goal to make it easier for teachers to improve their lectures due integrating physical computing systems into computer science education. The aim of this paper is to structure the field, to find categories and to show how existing devices can be integrated into the founded structure.",

Since the online classes are not in-person condition, it is difficult for a teacher to monitor the learners. In the field of distance education, the need to support learner's concentration has been identified. More effective methods adapted to online classes in universities should be discussed. In this paper, we focus on the teacher's and learners' attention to the material in online real-time classes. We then propose a system that provides feedback on the differences in learners' gaze in order to improve the followability of learners. The proposed system assumes an online environment using Microsoft Teams PowerPointLive and acquires the &quot;gazing point&quot; at every slide-material and &quot;page change history&quot; of the teacher and learners. The results of using the proposed system suggest that it can improve the learner's followability to the teacher.",

A learner model with learning history and its effectiveness plays a significant role in supporting a learner's understanding of their strengths and weaknesses of their way of learning in order to make proper adjustments for improvement. Nowadays, learners have been engaging in online learning frequently and intensely, leaving behind tremendous learning history data that contain informative insights about the learners' learning patterns. This paper proposed a method for developing learner models by applying the Markov chain to learning history data. Our method transforms individual learners' resource use data in a learning course into a large amount of resource use sequences, then develops a Markov learner model, and generates the resource use steady state for each learner. The resource use density, the resource steady state, and the assessment scores of individual learners tell their learning patterns and the effectiveness of the learning patterns. From the Markov learner model, we generate a learner profile for describing learning patterns and an index for measuring the strength of learning habits of the learner. We verified our method by applying it to each course in the OULAD dataset to predict the learning performance using the index. The preliminary results gain up to 97% accuracy on the pass/fail prediction problem.",

Today, universities need to be prepared to offer young people education that makes them competitive in these new working conditions. When considering development of the education, they shall understand necessity of changing both content and form of the studies. As today's youth grow in an era of digital technologies and is dwelling in a virtual environment, they increasingly are demanding flexible study format that complies with their usual habitat. Therefore, the main task of universities and other higher educational establishments at this time of change is to develop intellectual skills, exploratory research attitudes and build ICT skills in a new specialist. Mathematical study programs and didactics need to be improved on the basis of ICT (paying more attention to the application of mathematics, including using ICT), creating modern technology-based learning materials and ensuring the Internet access. In order to increase students' responsibility for the learning process and to promote the ability to independently acquire knowledge, skills and abilities, it is necessary to create the preconditions for self-directed learning in higher education institutions, that is, students themselves participating in setting the purpose of studies, planning the acquisition of the subject, presentations, and evaluating their work together by agreeing on final assessment with the assessment of peers and teachers. As known, e-studies and self-assessment tests are the basis of self-directed learning. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to determine the use of various e-study materials in the learning of a mathematics course, as well as the importance of tests in the self-assessment of mathematical knowledge and skills. The findings of this study include the analysis of the usage of e-study materials and tests for assessing students' mathematical knowledge and skills, as well as determination of the importance of self-assessment tests in the learning of a mathematics course, based on the students' opinion.",

This vision was acknowledged by UNESCO and it was one of the main motives for introducing Open Educational Resources (OER) in 2002. Over the last two decades, OER have made a positive impact on spreading quality educational information. However, the lack of experience in using and practicing OER is one of the common reasons why people have difficulties utilizing OER without violating copyright laws. To overcome this problem, a workshop concept was designed in order to qualify educators for OER. As part of the workshops, a digital educational game has been developed to elevate the participants' motivation and engagement. The game covers all basic aspects of the OER cycle (creating, editing, using, and distributing OER) and is designed to be played within the practical sessions. By implementing this game and utilizing the concept of Game-based Learning (GBL), we wanted to provide an interactive learning environment to practice OER and motivate learners to explore the OER world.

The HEIs in the UAE have implemented e-learning solutions developed in Western countries. When these e-learning solutions are used without any cultural pedagogical consideration, they are creating inequitable learning conditions for UAE students. This case study aimed to investigate the role of the western-oriented culture e-learning pedagogy on the adoption of e-learning among UAE female students. Data was collected qualitatively from interviews with colleagues who are using western-oriented cultural pedagogies in their e-learning classes. A pattern matching technique was used to analyse the collected data. The cultural constructs of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) were used as a lens to guide this study. The findings revealed the impact of the western-oriented pedagogy of Blackboard Learn (BBLearn) on the slow adoption of e-learning in the researchers' department.

Based on the ICAP (Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive) framework and research on social robot roles, we have developed eight vignettes describing scenarios for the use of social robots in higher education, e.g., teaching assistant. Students in an introductory university course completed the vignettes; they answered questions based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), as well as on their ethical approval. Drawing from a sample of N = 361 students, we carried out confirmatory factor analysis. In line with the conceptual basis, eight scenarios can be described. Overall, students do not accept social robots as presenters; however, the assessment of other roles, such as teaching assistant, is positive. By means of a latent profile analysis, we were able to identify four profiles that may be meaningful from a conceptual point of view. One profile is particularly noteworthy. It comprises students who accept social robots not as a means of instruction, e.g., as a tutor, but as a tool, e.g., to promote computational thinking.",

Data of the study stems from gaming sessions in which teams of 5-7 students worked in a virtual learning environment and steered their simulation companies' supply chain in real-time. Students' reflection assignments were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Our results show that during the sessions students encountered communication challenges, collaboration challenges, organizing challenges and skills and competence issues. As all these are typical for modern dispersed collaborative work, we can state that the game-based course of this study provided the students with opportunities to rehearse and solve these challenges in a virtual working context.

        "author":["Sonderegger, Stefan"],
        "description":"The use of social robots in education is a growing area of research and the potential future applications are various. However, the conversational models behind current social robots and chatbot systems often rely on rule-based and retrieval-based methods. This limits the social robot to predefined responses and topics, thus hindering it from fluent communication and interaction. Generative language models such as GPT-3 could be beneficial in this context, e.g. for an improved conversation and open-ended question answering. This article presents an approach to utilizing generative language models to enhance interactive learning with educational social robots. The proposed model combines the technological possibilities of generative language models with the educational tasks of a social robot in the role of a tutor and learning partner. The implementation of the model in practice is illustrated by means of a use case consisting of different learning scenarios. The social robot generates explanations, questions, corrections, and answers based on the pre-trained GPT-3 model. By exploring the potential of generative language models for interactive learning with social robots on different levels of abstraction, the paper also aims to contribute to an understanding of the future relevance and possibilities that generative language models bring into education and educational technologies in general.",

        "description":"Educational chatbots promise many benefits for teaching and learning. Although chatbot use cases in this research field are rapidly growing, most studies focus on individual users rather than on collaborative group settings. To address this issue, this paper investigates how chatbot-mediated learning can be designed to foster middle school students in team-based assignments. Using an educational design research approach, quality indicators of educational chatbots were derived from the literature, which served as a guideline for the development of the chatbot Tubo (meaning tutoring bot). Tubo is part of a web-based team learning environment in which students can chat with each other and collaboratively work on their group assignments. As a team member and tutor of each group, Tubo guides the students through the learning journey by different scaffolding elements and helps with content-related questions the students have. As part of a first design cycle, the chatbot application was tested with a school class of a technical vocational school in Switzerland. The received feedback suggests that the approach of team-based learning with chatbots has a lot of potential from the students' and teachers' point of view. However, the role distribution of the individual group members may have to be further specified to address the different needs of autonomous as well as more control-oriented students.",

        "author":["Burkhard, Michael"],
        "description":"Due to the advances of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing, new kinds of Internet-based writing tools have emerged. Among other things, these AI-powered writing tools can be used by students for text translation, to improve spelling or for rewriting and summarizing texts. On the one hand, they can provide detailed recommendations for the adaptation of text elements within seconds. On the other hand, they also produce inconsistencies and errors, that students might not be aware of. How to deal with these tools in an educational context is a difficult question. Since writing tools are usually used unsupervised and without further instructions, students may need guidance from the teacher in interacting with those tools, to prevent the risk of misapplication. To better understand this underlying issue, the paper at hand uses survey data of 365 freshmen students to describe and analyze student perceptions of AI-powered writing tools. Regarding AI-powered writing tools, different student types were identified by using the k-means clustering method. The results suggest that students have different attitudes towards AI-powered writing tools. Some students may use them in an unreflective, non-sceptical way, which can lead to (un)voluntary plagiarism. Other students may not use writing tools at all, partly because they are sceptic, but also because they may lack meaningful learning strategies in general (course repeaters). Depending on the different student types, individualized teaching strategies might be helpful to promote or urge caution in the use of these tools.",

This kind of ontology design facilitates the ontology extension and merging when concepts of other programming languages are added in the future. This ontology could be used to not only provide a guideline for any research work focusing on computational thinking education but also describe the common concept of visual programming tools and existing programming languages.

A potential effect of this could be the introduction and use of games in classrooms. This study looks at the possibility of adapting various domains of knowledge into digital games referred to as serious games. The implementation of serious games within teaching may help keep certain students engaged with the content being presented and create further interest in the topic. However, before reaching this stage the means to transform these knowledge domains into serious games must be studied. This is done by focusing on three fields: gamification, ludology, and pedagogy. Through the use of a literature analysis, both a literature review and a focus on previous implementations, several key principles for the design of a serious game were identified, namely reflection, feedback, a story-based environment, and thorough structuring of content. These principles stem from the design choices of the previous implementations and pedagogical theories -- Merrill's First Principles and the ARCS model. The aim of the study is to investigate the possibility of using digital games as a means to encourage learning in teaching environments.",

          "Zualkernan, Imran"],
        "description":"Systematic classroom observation is often used in evaluating and enhancing the quality of classroom instruction. However, classroom observation can potentially suffer from human bias. In addition, the traditional classroom observation is too expensive for resource-constrained environments (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central Asia). A cost-effective automation of classroom observation could potentially enhance both quality and resolution of feedback to the teacher, and hence potentially result in enhancing quality of instruction. Audio-based automatic classroom observation using supervised deep learning techniques has yielded good results in limited contexts. However, one challenge when using supervised techniques is the high cost of collecting and labelling the classroom audio data. One solution for such data-starved scenarios is to use semi-supervised learning (SSL) which requires significantly lesser data and labels. This paper explores an audio-adaptation of the state-of-the-art SSL FixMatch algorithm to automate classroom observation. An adaptation of the FixMatch algorithm was proposed to automate the coding for the Stallings class observation system. The proposed system was trained on classroom audio data collected in the wild. The supervised approach had an F1-score of 0.83 on 100% labeled data. The proposed FixMatch adaptation achieved an impressive F1-score of 0.81 on 20% labeled data, 0.79 on 15% labeled data, 0.76 on 10% labeled data, and 0.72 using only 5% of labeled data. This suggests that algorithms like FixMatch that use consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling have a great potential for being used to automate classroom observation using a small labelled set of audio snippets.",

        "description":"Digital Study Assistants (DSA) are an emerging type of software that combines web-based software architectures, various data sources, and algorithms from artificial intelligence (AI) to assist learners in improving their learning-related behaviors. In this paper, we summarize the implementation and results of a field study with a DSA for hierarchical goal-setting (HGS) at the Bremen, Hannover, and Osnabrück universities from November 2021 to April 2022. The results show that 70% of students in the sample chose to get digital assistance for educational goal-setting, which is the highest interest rate among the nine assistance functions available. Of the 290 students who chose to use the assistant, only 10 completed the full assistive intervention, which equals only 3.4%. We conclude that we should improve the usability and user experience and reduce the interaction costs of the intervention.",

Digital Stories (DSs) with their multimodal features enable teachers to meet the needs of 21st century digital native students when learning a foreign language. Thus, the study aims to investigate the beliefs, attitudes and experiences of 75 prospective English teachers of Uludag University ELT department about the creation and using child-appropriate digital stories to teach English to young learners (YLs). The data were collected through a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire with 26 items and the Cronbach alpha of the items was 0.87. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted with 10 participants to delve into the results obtained from the questionnaire. The descriptive analysis of the questionnaire revealed that nearly all of the participants agreed that digital stories should be used to take children's attention easily, better learn a foreign language, increase YLs' motivation, change the dynamics of the traditional classrooms, and keep YLs' attention throughout the lesson. However, based on their own experience in creating a child-appropriate digital story, nearly half of them reported that it was not easy to create an effective DS without being educated.",

Survey model was adopted, and the &quot;Scale of School Administrators' Level of Using Scientific Problem-Solving Processes and Techniques in Organisational Problems&quot; developed by Sagir and Göksoy (2011: 1-11) in 5-point Likert type was used as the data-gathering instrument. The scale was adapted to the Kirklareli sample and the Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was 0,95. According to the findings, the inspectors stated that school administrators differed in their level of using scientific problem solving techniques in terms of various variables. In overall, the inspectors indicated that school administrators properly defined the organisational problems they encountered, but did not apply the solutions developed to solve these problems. The study suggests that in-service training should be organised to enable administrators to use the necessary techniques to solve organisational problems, and policies including requiring them to do a master's degree in areas that focus on these issues should be developed to enhance administrator effectiveness.",

The class-learning object was the dual-storage model of human memory. The simulation results showed anomalous results that differed from intuitive predictions. The results were also inconsistent with the results of prior human experiments. Analysis of reports submitted by 15 participants revealed that they focused on the anomalous results emerging in the simulation results and examined them based on the dual-storage model theory. On the basis of these results, future directions for this practice are discussed.",

        "description":"E-tutorial learning aids as worked examples and hints have been established as effective instructional formats in problem-solving practices. However, less is known about variations in the use of learning aids across individuals at different stages in their learning process in student-centred learning contexts. This study investigates different profiles of students' learning behaviors based on clustering students' use of worked examples and hints in subsequent learning phases in a naturalistic setting. In a blended instructional format, the study was conducted on 1,072 students over an eight-week introductory mathematics course. By explicitly differentiating between learning to prepare a tutorial session, the first phase, learning to prepare a quiz session, the second phase, and learning to prepare the final exam as third phase, this study aims to contribute to the call for more temporality in learning analytics applications. Our study finds three profiles of learning that differ in the intensity and timing of the use of learning aids. Moreover, different profiles come with different learning dispositions, such as epistemic and activity learning emotions.",

In this study, we call the describing models &quot;UML programming.&quot; In this paper, we show an educational UML programming environment for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) related subjects (especially for Technology or Engineering) in schools, which are able to apply from elementary school to university. At first, we explain why, what, and how doing the UML programming. In this study, we use a state machine diagram for UML programming. To draw this model, the students just put some states in rectangular shape and transitions in arrow shape. Two types of educational model notations in state machine diagram are introduced. Then, some advanced functions of the SRPS are described. They are an educational model editor, and management of users, learning tasks and models submitted by students. Next, two case studies with the SRPS are shown. One case study is adopted to the summer camp for 5th- and 6th-grade students. The participants were 20 students and were engaged in 4 hours workshop. We used a car-type robot with two DC motors, a one-touch sensor, and one infrared sensor connected to a micro:bit. The other case study is a formal technology class at one Japanese public junior high school. One teacher and five classes worked on UML programming for traffic lights. Each class had 20 9th-grade students. One student at this school was given a traffic light robot with three Light-emitting diode (LED) lights, a one-touch sensor, and one infrared sensor connected to a micro:bit. Finally, on the basis of these two case studies using our environment, we discuss the potential for innovative STEAM education with UML programming.",

To address this issue, vocalization strategy, in which students listen to the sounds of words and memorize them aloud, is considered a useful learning strategy, and has been reported to influence performance in English language learning. Many studies have shown that metacognition promotes the use of this strategy. In this study, we developed an English vocabulary learning support system using dictation-type speech recognition technology and evaluated whether it activates learners' metacognition and promotes the use of vocalization strategies.",

        "description":"When examinees perceive a test as low stakes, it is logical to assume that some of them will not put out their maximum effort. This condition makes the validity of the test results more complicated. Although many studies have investigated motivational fluctuation across tests during a testing session, only a small number of studies have investigated motivational fluctuation across items within a single test. This study aims to examine the pattern of test-taking effort across items in cognitive ability tests when items are presented in a random order manner. Response Time Effort (RTE) was used as a measure of test-taking effort. This measure calculates the proportion of rapid responses in the test based on the response times for each item. Data from 213 university students completing the inductive reasoning test was examined using latent class analysis. The results suggested that examinees in low-stakes testing have different patterns of effort across items. Examinees who consistently provided a high level of effort across items had higher test performance, test-taking engagement, and RTE. Item position and item difficulty are also correlated negatively with test-taking effort. Implications of these results for researchers and practitioners are discussed.",

        "author":["Mulders, Miriam"],
        "description":"Theoretical background: Learning in virtual realities (VR) has become increasingly important. In this context, VR appears to be particularly conducive to affective learning objectives, such as perspective-taking in VR actors. Previous research has often focused on investigating cause-effect relationships that focus on the direct effects of different VR visualization technologies on learning outcomes. Little research has been conducted on more complex constellations of learning-related variables. Therefore, the present study aims at elaborating a research design that can be used to investigate both the direct effects of VR visualization technologies as well as the mediating effects of learning process variables latent in VR. For this purpose, the research design will be experimentally tested by comparing head-mounted display (HMD)-based VR with laptop-based VR with respect to the intended learning objectives, and controlling for influences by underlying learning processes (here: the experience of flow within VR). Methods: 132 students of grades eight and nine were recruited. The subjects were assigned to experimental conditions (HMD vs. laptop). The VR content dealt with the exploration of the hiding place of Anne Frank at the time of World War II in Amsterdam. Questionnaires were used to collect several data including sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge gain, perspective-taking, subjective evaluation, and the learning process variable flow. Results: A significant main effect for the variable VR visualization technology was uncovered averaged across all learning indicators. However, a superiority of HMD-based VR was found for the two evaluative indicators and also for the affective learning indicator. For the cognitive learning indicator, the effect was reverse. More relevant than unidirectional relationships are the mediating effects. Mediating effects through the experience of flow were discovered several times. Thus, the experience of flow within VR can significantly explain the cause-effect relationships between VR visualization technology and learning outcomes, even if, for the most part, only effects for evaluative indicators could be determined. Conclusion: The present study was able to exemplify that the investigation of complex interaction structures of VR visualization technologies and learning process variables can make a large contribution to the understanding of learning in VR environments. Advantages of HMD-based VR over laptop-based VR with respect to some learning indicators were uncovered. The significant findings of the mediation analyses point to the fact that the direct effects of VR visualization technologies on parameters of learning can be significantly explained by learning process variables such as flow experience and are systematically overestimated if such learning processes are not taken into account.",

        "description":"An accurate global assessment of gifted children is essential to provide them with educational and counseling programs tailored to their strengths and vulnerabilities. Without neglecting the fundamental role of social-emotional skills on individual well-being and academic success, it is essential to shedding light on the attentional profile of intellectually gifted children. In this regard, findings from empirical studies are not always consistent. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the relationship between the cognitive profile of fifteen gifted children (mean age 9.6 years; SD 2.3), as described through the main WISC-IV indexes (IVE, IRP, IML, IVE, FSIQ), and their attentional profile assessed through AULA, an innovative VR-based ecological assessment tool that evaluates attention and inhibitory control. These first findings highlighted the correlation between intelligence and attention and provided indications for educational interventions. Therefore it is crucial to use innovative and highly ecological assessment tools to engage the IGen gifted learners. In this regard, researchers have recently developed and tested new tools that employ virtual reality (VR) to assess EFs (Climent et al. , 2010; Rizzo et al., 2006). VR-based assessment tools allow children to interact dynamically with realistic scenarios and situations that reproduce aspects of their everyday life. The present study aimed to explore the correlation between the cognitive profile of gifted students, as measured by the WISC-IV paper-and-pencil test, and their attentional profile assessed through AULA, an innovative virtual reality-based attention assessment tool. A previous study by Diaz-Orueta et al. (2014) explored the correlation between WISC-IV indices in a sample of averaged cognitive ability learners diagnosed with ADHD, demonstrating the reliability of the VR-based attention assessment tool in discriminating clinical subjects. To our knowledge, no studies have yet been conducted analysing the attentional profile of gifted children using a VR-based attention assessment tool. Therefore, we expect to provide valuable new information on the peculiar attentional functioning of gifted children.",

Through the administration of self-report questionnaires, the perception of smartphone distraction, smartphone problematic use, phubbing, and cognitive failures were surveyed. Two hundred and twenty subjects took part in the research. The participants, aged between 18 and 57, were divided by generation Z, Y and Z, according to Ristiyono, classification (2022). Data analysis was carried out through the application of Spearman's rho was used to analyze correlations between subscales. The Kruskal-Wallis test was invectively used to analyze differences between participants. The results confirm our hypotheses showing positive correlations between perceptions of smartphone distraction, phubbing behavior, smartphone problematic use, and cognitive failures, and a significant difference was found between generations in perceptions of all variables considered. Generation Z (18-26 years) shows the highest scores in almost all subscales examined.",

        "description":"Children's ability to discriminate nonsymbolic number (e.g. the number of items in a set) is a commonly studied predictor of later math skills. Number discrimination improves throughout development, but what drives this improvement is unclear. Competing theories suggest it may be due to a sharpening numerical representation or an improved ability to pay attention to number and filter out non-numerical information. We investigate this issue by studying change in children's performance (N = 65) on a nonsymbolic number comparison task, where children decide which of two dot arrays has more dots, from the middle to the end of 1st grade (Mean age at Time 1 = 6.85 years old). In this task, visual properties of the dots arrays such as surface area are either congruent (the more numerous array has more surface area) or incongruent. Children rely more on executive functions during incongruent trials, so improvements in each congruency condition provide information about the underlying cognitive mechanisms. We found that accuracy rates increased similarly for both conditions, indicating a sharpening sense of numerical magnitude, not simply improved attention to the numerical task dimension. Symbolic number skills predicted change in congruent trials, but executive function did not predict change in either condition. No factor predicted change in math achievement. Together, these findings suggest that nonsymbolic number processing undergoes development related to existing symbolic number skills, development that appears not to be driving math gains during this period.

Studies such as this evaluation of a loose implementation under realistic conditions are important to curriculum developers' understanding of how evidence-based programs and tools work under a variety of implementation scenarios. In this quasi-experimental study, first-grade students (n = 253) in ten schools were assigned to treatment (n = 154) or control (n = 99). Rather than randomly assigning students, schools assigned those students most at risk to treatment and, typically, those less at risk to control. School staff administered pre and post assessments and led Fusion sessions approximately 30 minutes per day, three days per week. The intervention resulted in a significant positive effect on a researcher-developed first grade math measure. The implementation of Fusion and feedback from school staff provided insights to guide the curriculum development process.

This study investigated &quot;practice-based evidence&quot; (Green, 2008) of interventionists' actual use of explicit mathematics instruction, a well-established EBP. Specifically, this study analyzed direct observation data collected in a federally funded efficacy trial involving a Tier 2 first-grade mathematics intervention to examine whether the quantity and quality of explicit mathematics instruction was associated with the mathematics outcomes of 470 first-grade students with or at risk for mathematics learning disabilities. Associations between group-level pretreatment skill levels and the quality and quantity of explicit mathematics instructional practices used in the intervention were also explored. Findings suggested significant associations between positive gains in student mathematics outcomes and (a) lower rates of incorrectly answered mathematics-focused questions, and (b) the rate in which interventionists delivered group-level practice opportunities and offered academic feedback. Significant associations were also found between initial student mathematics performance and rates of student errors and the quality of explicit instruction. Implications for using direct observation to document enacted EBPs are discussed. [This paper was published in &quot;Journal of Learning Disabilities&quot; v54 n1 p20-35 Jan-Feb 2021 (EJ1279319).]",

Yet, recent research shows female teachers earn less than their male peers after controlling for experience, education, and school characteristics. Building on this literature, this paper examines teacher salaries to provide empirical evidence of the extent of gender wage gaps in the teaching profession and the sources of those gaps. Using data from two waves of the National Teacher and Principal Survey, we show that on average male teachers have an advantage of over $700 in base pay and of $1,500 in supplemental compensation, compared to female teachers with similar characteristics and in similar contexts. Additionally, our estimations indicate that male teachers are both more likely to take on extra duties and receive compensation for those activities than female teachers, and the gap increases when schools have a male principal. Finally, an analysis of wage gaps across collective bargaining contexts suggests that wage gaps are positive for both base pay and extra duties, though the magnitudes of each vary across different CBA contexts. Our results provide insight into teacher compensation policies.",

Many states have adapted to these developments and established an online learning platform in order to carry out the training and development activities of civil servants. The Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye Human Resources Office has established the Distance Learning Gate (DLG) platform in order to carry out educational activities. In this study, learning preferences of adult learners were determined in order to improve the relevant online learning environment and to structure appropriate trainings for public personnel. For this purpose, the training preferences of adult learners were determined according to their title groups and education levels. The participants of the research consisted of 4864 civil servants who received training from the DLG platform. According to the results, it was determined that adult learners preferred personal development training the most and professional development training in the last place. It is seen that the servants in the service title group that watched the most training in all categories according to the title groups. It is seen that the groups that received the least education are the senior manager and manager title group. On the other hand, it has been determined that the number of adult learners' training and the education categories differ according to the education level. According to the findings, it is seen that those who watched the most education are adults at the compulsory primary education level, while those who watched the least education are those who are at the graduate level. This research includes the first phase of a series of research and a design-based research. As a first step, the training preferences of adult learners were determined. In the next stage, a recommendation system will be integrated into the DLG platform based on the determined profiles.",

        "description":"Background: Research trials of early intervention (EI) programs for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) generally demonstrate medium-to-large gains, on average, compared with &quot;treatment as usual,&quot; in different developmental domains. Almost all children with ASD receive their treatment through community-based services, however, and studies suggest that evidence-based interventions rarely make their way into community practice. Understanding the effectiveness of community-based EI and factors associated with these effects is the first step in developing strategies for wide-scale implementation of effective EI. Methods: Studies of community-based EI for children with ASD were identified through a systematic search. Changes in cognitive, communication, social, and adaptive functioning from pre-treatment to post-treatment were assessed using standardized mean gain scores. Effect sizes were estimated using random effects models. Moderators of interest included type of community EI program, year of publication, intervention duration, and sample selection. Moderator effects were assessed using analysis of variance of mixed-effects models and meta-regression analyses. Results: Forty-six groups from 33 studies met inclusion criteria (1713 participants, mean age 37.4 months, 81.1% male). There were small but statistically significant gains in each of the four domains. Hedges's g ranged from 0.21 for adaptive behavior to 0.32 for communication outcomes, after removing outliers and correcting for publication bias. EI programs associated with universities and hospitals were superior, on average, to other community EI programs for cognitive and adaptive behavior outcomes. Intervention duration was negatively associated with effect sizes for communication and adaptive behavior outcomes. Conclusions: These results indicate that there remains a large gap between outcomes observed in community settings and those reported in efficacy trials.

        "description":"Learning analytics includes interventions that will support learning and improve learning environments. Despite the fact that learning analytics is a promising field of study, the lack of empirical evidence on the effects of learning analytics-based interventions has been widely addressed in recent years. In this context, insights validated by experimental studies may play a crucial role. Therefore, there is a need for a report describing the methodological aspects and effects of current experimental interventions based on learning analytics. This systematic review provides an in-depth examination of learning analytics research that reports experimental findings to evaluate learning analytics-based interventions. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 protocol provided the basis for the work of this systematic review. This review contained 52 papers that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that student-facing dashboards are the most common learning analytics-based intervention. Evidence from how user data is handled for interventions demonstrates that the most common method is the distillation of data for human judgment. This study confirms that a significant proportion of experimental studies employing learning analytics interventions have demonstrated significant effects on learning outcomes. The effectiveness of learning analytics-based interventions is also addressed in this review in terms of motivation, engagement, and system usage behaviors. The findings of this study will contribute to the literature in terms of describing the experimentally validated findings of learning analytics-based interventions in depth.",

In the context of explicit mathematics instruction, practice facilitates systematic opportunities for students with mathematics difficulties (MD) to learn new mathematics content and apply such knowledge and skills to novel mathematics problems. This study explored whether there is an optimal amount of student practice that teachers should provide in core mathematics instruction to maximize the mathematics achievement of kindergarten students with MD, a so called &quot;Goldilocks effect,&quot; as opposed to simply &quot;more is better.&quot; Results from observation data collected in a large-scale efficacy trial supported the latter rather than the former. Specifically, we found that three individual practice opportunities for every explicit teacher demonstration of mathematical content was associated with increased mathematics achievement for students with MD relative to fewer practice opportunities. Implications for facilitating frequent student practice opportunities during core mathematics instruction and designing professional development for teachers who work with students with MD are discussed.

This study investigated the extent to which observed components of explicit mathematics instruction explained why students' initial mathematics achievement was previously found to moderate the treatment impact of an empirically validated, core kindergarten mathematics program. Instructional components examined were: (1) teacher demonstrations and explanations of mathematical concepts; (2) group and individual student practice opportunities; and (3) teacher-delivered academic feedback. Findings suggest that the rate in which teachers facilitated individual student practice opportunities during core mathematics instruction explained the program's differential effectiveness. Implications in terms of differentiating practice opportunities for at-risk learners and utilizing classroom observation data to test potential mediating variables of academic interventions are discussed.

This study utilized observation data from a multi-year efficacy trial to examine the longitudinal effect of a core kindergarten mathematics program on the use of explicit mathematics instruction among two distinct groups of teachers: one group that used standard practices in Year-1 of the efficacy trial and the core program in Year-2, and a second group that used the core program in both years. Targeted teaching practices consisted of teacher models, student practice opportunities, and teacher-provided academic feedback. Implementation of the program in Year-2 was found to increase the mean rates of teaching practices of teachers who used standard teaching practices in Year-1. Effect sizes are also suggestive of a positive impact of a second year of implementation with the core program. Implications for designing explicit mathematics programs and investigating evidence-based practices in future research are discussed.

The findings detailed in this report are based on responses from a total of 9,839 individuals surveyed between January and December 2019. Survey respondents represent demand for various MBA and business master's &quot;program categories,&quot; including full-time MBA, professional MBA, executive MBA, and business master's programs. Each program category contains specific &quot;program types.&quot; For example, full-time MBA programs include full-time one-year and full-time two-year MBA programs. Professional MBA programs include part-time, flexible, and online MBA programs. Business master's programs include Master in Management, Master of Finance, Master of Data Analytics, and Master of Accounting, among others. The results of this survey do not necessarily reflect a statistically representative sample of the global prospective student population. Rather, the results reflect responses from prospective students who register on mba.com. Because of this limitation, the results of this research study should not be used to generalize about the global prospective student population, but rather the mba.com registrant population.

This study explores the mobile technology acceptance, among nursing students at selected educational institutions in South India. Materials and Methods: Quantitative cross-sectional descriptive design. First-year 176 B.Sc. nursing students who underwent blended learning were selected by the purposive sampling method. The tool &quot;Technology Acceptance Model&quot; was used to collect responses. Bivariate analysis was used to determine the relationship between the demographic and study-related variables with the mobile technology acceptance using SPSS version 25.0. Results: The majority 73.9% of the students belonged to the age group of 18-19 years, females 76.7% and, 98.9% were unmarried. Among the constructs of TAM, a mean (SD) value of 22.08 (2.26) was found for material (mobile device audio/video) characteristics the mean (SD) value was 22.08 (2.26), attitude about use 17.58 (1.95), behavioral intention 17.46 (1.78) and system characteristics 17.21 (2.27). The mobile technology acceptance revealed that 126 (71.6%) strongly agreed, 49 (27.8%) agreed, and 1 (0.6%) was neutral with a mean (SD) of 105.19 (8.68), respectively. A positive correlation was found between the system characteristics, material characteristics, perceived ease to use, perceived usefulness, attitude about the use, behavioral intention with a P value &lt;0.001. There was a statistically significant association between Mobile technology acceptance and time spent by the students for independent studies shown the Chi-square value of 12.7, with P value &lt;0.05. Conclusion: Nursing students had a positive acceptance and behavior toward smartphone use.",

        "author":["Polat, Murat"],
        "description":"This research focuses on better understanding the nature of pre-service teachers' four-frame leadership orientations. As it is known, the phenomenon of leadership still continues to be a research topic in the field of educational administration. But, these studies carried out on teachers and school administrators. As future teachers and school administrators, research on the leadership orientations of teacher candidates is less. Therefore, this study wants to investigate the multidimensional leadership orientations of teacher candidates and propose a model. The research is a quantitative relational survey study. Convenient sampling technique was used in the research. Participants n=278 [173 female; 105 male] are teacher candidates. At the end of the research; It revealed that the multi-directional leadership orientations of the teacher candidates were generally at a high level, but there was no significant difference in gender and grade level variables. On the other hand, it can said that the human resource leadership orientations of teacher candidates have a significant and small difference in favor of female teacher candidates (Glass'd=-0.15; p&lt;0.05). Also, PLS-SEM structural model analysis revealed that pre-service teachers' human resource leadership and political leadership orientations predicted structural leadership tendencies with a significant partial mediation effect in the charismatic leadership dimension. Based on the findings of this study, teacher education and the development of four-frame leadership programs can be considered. As a result, teacher candidates' multifaceted leadership potential can be supported and developed. [This paper was presented as an online presentation at the VIII.

In 2020, more than 300,000 women worked in the trades--the largest number ever. Yet while their numbers are growing, women still make up fewer than one in twenty of workers in construction occupations. This report draws on the voices and experiences of 2,635 tradeswomen and non-binary tradespeople who answered the 2021 Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR) Tradeswomen's Retention and Advancement Survey. The report discusses what factors help and hinder tradeswomen's advancement in the trades, describes what it is like to be a parent in the trades, and reports on the perspectives of women apprentices. The report highlights changes that are required to help the construction industry build and sustain a skilled workforce that reflects the population of the 21st century.",

They are often a steppingstone to career advancement and economic security for parents and their children. This brief provides an analysis of the experiences of student parents enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College, highlighting barriers and obstacles to degree attainment, and an in-depth analysis of how wrap-around services provided by the Family Resource Center improve outcomes. Barriers include family and academic stressors; lack of high quality, reliable child care; and juggling family financial obligations and the cost of tuition, among others. This brief's overarching goals are to: (1) Provide baseline information and data on the experiences of student parents enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College; (2) Understand the role the Family Resource Center plays in helping students succeed; and (3) Provide recommendations and strategies to strengthen services and fill gaps for student parents.

        "description":"An ongoing struggle for affordable housing in Southern California has led many predominately White, middle, and upper middle- class families to seek home ownership in divested urban communities. This phenomenon, known as gentrification, can benefit a community by increasing property values, but often comes at a cost to longstanding, Black and Brown residents of the neighborhood. Prior research has identified areas of harm including residential displacement, declining enrollment, and segregation of neighborhood schools. This qualitative case study addressed two questions: the impact of gentrification on the Black and Brown students attending the neighborhood school; and the strategies needed to balance competing interests between gentrifiers and longstanding families. The study's findings made it abundantly clear that inequitable district and site- based policies combined with White families' self- serving interests adversely affect the minority student experience. Operating as a counterweight to the harm, interview and observation data suggested that mindful school leadership and uniting parent interests played an integral role in establishing equitable practices, policies, and access. Moreover, the data showed that the probability of leader reflectiveness and mindfulness was intensified when school leadership and active parents were themselves people of color. The implications of the study may help shape district and school policies in communities experiencing gentrification.",

The College and Career Learning Model (CCLM) provides programs with a framework for students to attend college and gain many critical college and career skills without segregated courses.

        "description":"In Chicago, despite an increase in high school graduates and college enrollment, only one in four community college students graduate within three years. COVID-19 exacerbated longstanding barriers to college success faced by students from low-income backgrounds, as well as for Black, Latino, and Indigenous students. Without proactive interventions and intentionally designed wraparound supports or comprehensive approaches to student success (CASS) support services, equity gaps in college completion and postsecondary outcomes will persist. Strong cross-sector partnerships, adequate funding, and policy enhancements are necessary to expand equitable access to high-quality comprehensive supports that get more students to degree completion. The City Colleges of Chicago (City Colleges) and nonprofit partner, One Million Degrees (OMD), provide one compelling partnership model for overcoming these barriers. Instead of seeing low completion rates as evidence that college is not for everyone, City Colleges, OMD, and their partners are considering the factors causing students to stop out. They are also scaling up support to ensure students complete college no matter their race, ethnicity, or economic background.",

        "description":"Districts and schools that implement programs related to student well-being, academic, and life skill development (WALSD) improve school climate, academics, and discipline (Kendziora &amp; Yoder, 2016). The programs also have significant effects on how students function in school and work as well as their emotional and mental health, even into adulthood (Hawkins et al., 2005). Supporting a positive instructional environment where students can learn and practice well-being, academic, and life skills is a process, not a program. It is important to align and integrate efforts across districts and within schools to allow continuous growth among students and school community members. Collaboratively developing, managing, and supporting a WALSD vision builds ownership and ensures that WALSD programs and practices align with the district's system efforts. This self-assessment can help districts identify areas of growth and success while undertaking or expanding whole child supports across their systems. It is intended to be used by district teams to guide reflection and engage in collaborative planning.",

When students fail to complete their FAFSA application, they are less likely to enroll or complete a credential, leaving tens of millions of federal resources for students on the table. Boosting FAFSA completion rates in Michigan is integral in reducing out-of-pocket costs for all Michiganders looking to improve their job eligibility and lifetime earnings. As one of the core priorities of TICAS Michigan and community partners across the state, it is crucial that any implementation of a state-wide mandate of FAFSA completion as a high school graduation requirement removes potential barriers and unintended consequences for outgoing high school graduates. TICAS Michigan's analysis compiles key feedback from community partners across the state to provide insights and student-centered recommendations to help guide policy discussions on solutions to improving Michigan's FAFSA completion rates.",

TICAS' analysis found that students who attended colleges that serve greater shares of students of color earn less in income 10 years after graduation than their peers who attended colleges with fewer shares of students of color.

It starts with ensuring students have what they need to get their foot in the door. But right now, fewer students are choosing a college path (whether that's a workforce or industry credential or a two- or four-year degree), and the state's college-going rate is dropping. Just over half (53 percent) of Indiana's high school graduating class of 2020 chose to go to college--a drop from 65 percent five years ago. While Indiana's statewide completion rates continue to improve across all campus types, the completion rate is not nearly robust enough to provide the workforce Indiana requires. Changing this trend will require an all-hands effort to ensure students see the value of pursuing education beyond high school, as well as making sure they're successful in their pursuit. The Commission is committed to working closely with Indiana's higher education institutions, community, economic, and philanthropic organizations, and state lawmakers to stem the college-going decline and increase the state's educational attainment.

Within this outcome-focused landscape, IPSE program staff and administrators are largely unified in their aim to to purposefully support students toward positive postschool outcomes like employment and community integration. There is a growing momentum for IPSE programs to align with career and technical education opportunities to help students with ID attain industry recognized credentials (IRC).

        "description":"&quot;The Status of Women in North Carolina: Poverty and Opportunity&quot; is the final publication in a four-part series of publications on women's status in North Carolina. The report builds on the Institute for Women's Policy Research's &quot;Status of Women in the States&quot; initiative, which has sought to measure women's economic, social, and political progress at the state and federal levels. This report provides data and analysis on several aspects of North Carolina women in the areas of poverty, economic security, access to opportunities, and support that helps women and families achieve economic stability. This report also examines data on topics such as poverty by household type, home ownership and houselessness, the number of public assistance recipients, and the impact of the pandemic on women in North Carolina. Each of these indicators are key components of poverty and opportunities for North Carolina women. Without adequate education, public support, or opportunities for advancement and entrepreneurship, women and families are more likely to face conditions of poverty. Throughout this report, data are analyzed by counties in North Carolina (when available) and disaggregated by racial and ethnic groups. The final installment in a series of four publications, this report provides data and policy recommendations to improve the status of women in North Carolina--with a focus on poverty and opportunity. The first three reports focused on employment and earnings, health and wellness, and political participation. This series aims to provide critical data that can help build economic security and overall well-being among women in North Carolina. The reports serve as a resource that may be used to make data-driven decisions about how to shape public policies, prioritize investments, and set programmatic goals to improve the lives of women and families. This Poverty and Opportunity report highlights the status of women at the intersections of health, financial well-being, and education. These factors play a major role in determining the overall economic security of women and their families.

The report presents data on voter registration and turnout, representation of women at the state and federal levels in elected positions, and state-based institutional resources for women. It examines how women fare on these indicators of women's status, the progress women have made and where it has stalled, and how racial and ethnic disparities compound gender disparities in specific forms of political participation. In addition to the data presented, the report presents profiles of five North Carolina women who either hold elected or appointed positions or work as organizational advocates.

While poor health can negatively affect employment opportunities, educational attainment, and financial security, good health allows women to meet their economic and educational goals and flourish in the other areas of their lives. Multiple factors, including genetics, behavior, access to health care--including reproductive health care--access to healthy food, and quality and safe housing contribute to the health and wellness of women. This report provides information on the health, well-being, and reproductive rights of women in North Carolina, including differences by race and ethnicity and by county where data are available. &quot;The Status of Women in North Carolina: Health &amp; Wellness&quot; analyzes data on women's health, including chronic disease, physical health, sexual health, access to reproductive health services, and experiences of sexual assault and intimate partner violence. The report identifies changes in women's health since the publication of the Institute for Women's Policy Research's (IWPR) 2013 &quot;Status of Women in North Carolina&quot; report and concludes with recommendations for policymakers, public health officials, advocates, and philanthropists.

Thus, we explored how working conditions relate to the quality of special educators' reading instruction in upper-elementary, self-contained classes for students with EBD. Using mixed methods to examine video observations of reading instruction and varied data sources on working conditions, we found that special educators who provided stronger instruction had a partner coleading their program, and consistent paraprofessionals, with time and support for training. Partners and paraprofessionals, together, protected special educators' instruction time. Other conditions (i.e., material resources, role differentiation, role conceptions, planning time) emerged as potentially important, but evidence was less robust. Results indicate partners and paraprofessionals may be important forms of collegial support. These findings have important implication for improving the quality of instruction in self-contained settings for students with EBD.

These grantees created or expanded inclusive higher education programs, enrolling 4,279 students with intellectual disability (ID) on 103 college or university campuses in 31 states. This Fast Fact provides an executive summary of the findings shared in the Annual Report of the Cohort 2 TPSID Model Demonstration Projects (Year Five 2019-2020). In mid-March of 2020, the emergence of COVID-19 throughout the United States led to changes in the implementation of services in most institutions of higher education, including those involved in TPSID projects. Throughout this summary, the authors reflect on the impact the pandemic had on students attending TPSIDs.

Research Methods: This research was conducted using a case study method and the data were obtained through semi-structured face-to-face interviews consisting of open-ended questions. In this study, 30 teachers, of whom 15 were classroom teachers and 15 were preschool teachers participated. The obtained data were analysed using a content analysis method. Findings: Findings obtained in this study showed that students' attitudes towards mathematics were high. However, teachers faced difficulties in teaching abstract topics in maths and they suggested that music could have positive effects on mathematics lessons. Results indicated that most teachers used music in mathematics lessons yet did not consider themselves competent to utilize music in mathematics lessons. Implications for Research and Practice: Findings obtained in this study suggest that the use of music in mathematics teaching has positive contributions concerning motivation, permanence, participation in class and the elimination of prejudices and negative attitudes towards the lesson. It is suggested that courses, in-service training and seminars for the use of music in mathematics courses can be organized. Finally, mathematics teaching activities with music can be designed and applied, and whether these activities affect students' attitudes and achievement can be investigated by experimental methods.",

But by a variety of measures, Americans question whether the benefits of college are worth the cost. This report summarizes findings from a nationally representative survey of 1,662 adult Americans 18 years and older. The survey was designed by Public Agenda, fielded May 3-6, 2022, by Ipsos. Public Agenda conducted three demographically diverse online focus groups in January 2022. The sample was randomly drawn from Ipsos' online panel, partner online panel sources, and &quot;river&quot; sampling. Post-hoc weights were made to the population characteristics on gender, age, race/ethnicity, region, and education. Findings from the research include: (1) Strong cross-partisan, cross-racial majorities believe that higher education can benefit working adults. The consensus is weaker on how much it benefits the economy overall or our democracy, but when people focus on their states, more are confident about the economic benefits of higher education; (2) While recognizing its potential benefits, many Americans question whether a college education is worth it; (3) Very strong cross-partisan and cross-racial majorities agree on a broad range of approaches to making public higher education more affordable; (4) There is surprising cross-partisan and cross-racial agreement on state investments to support Black and Latino students as well as low-income students; and (5) When people know what they are paying for, substantially more are willing to invest in public higher education.

Congress established the Teacher and School Leader (TSL) Incentive competitive grant program in 2015 to help address this goal, providing financial support to selected school districts to improve their systems for hiring, supporting, and retaining educators, particularly in high-need schools. Grantees can use TSL funds flexibly, for either or both of the two main components of those systems: basic infrastructure for generating and managing data, and a set of strategies that use these data to improve their educator workforce. However, the TSL program requires applicants to already be using two specific data-driven strategies that research has shown to be promising: performance-based compensation and personalized support and feedback to educators. As part of the 2017 competition, the program also incentivized the use of grant funds to address equity and educator diversity. With those initial 3-year grants having now drawn to a close, this report provides the first comprehensive review of the activities 2017 TSL grantee districts prioritized with their TSL funds, and how well these activities aligned with the key aspects of the program.

The publication lists the funding amounts by the sources of funding and by the university disciplines receiving the funding. It is designed for use by state policy makers, the educational community, economic developers, and the general public as a resource to: (1) Assist in developing strong legislative funding support for research; (2) Improve the regional, national, and international image of Mississippi universities as research institutions; (3) Encourage continued and expanded external funding support for state university research and sponsored programs, and (4) Enhance further development of technology transfer and practical applications of research which impact the state's economy. The Research Catalog includes only external awards and non-appropriated state awards for research and sponsored programs. External funds for student financial aid are not included in the totals. The external resources identified in the &quot;Research Catalog&quot; are an indication of the national competitiveness of the universities in the state of Mississippi and of the quality research and sponsored programs they conduct. These resources provide essential funds to the state's public universities which strengthen the research, teaching, and service missions of the universities.

        "description":"Concern about the negative impact of the digital world on young people has increased in recent years (see, e.g., Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport [DCMS], 2021; United Nations, 2021). A growing body of research explores aspects of young people's online lives and mental wellbeing (see, e.g., Kandola et al., 2021, Kelly et al., 2018, Orben &amp; Przybylski, 2019). To date, however, fewer studies have examined the relationship between literacy and critical digital literacy engagement and wellbeing. This report presents findings from a survey exploring young people's attitudes and behaviours when navigating online environments. The survey's design was informed by a review of the literature, focus group discussions with young people, and interviews with academic and industry experts, and it reached 7,494 young people aged 11 to 16 in late 2021. Findings indicate that high literacy engagement is associated with better critical digital literacy attitudes and behaviours. In turn, compared with young people with low critical digital literacy engagement, nearly three times as many young people with high critical digital literacy had high mental wellbeing (11.6% vs 30.2%). Such findings suggest that young people with low literacy engagement are at risk of missing out in the digital age, and that supporting young people to develop confident, critical approaches to reading, writing and communicating both on and offline may have the potential to support wellbeing. This is likely to be of growing importance as our dependence on digital forms of communication increases. We would like to thank The Sir Halley Stewart Trust for their support for this project, which we believe is particularly timely in helping support effective digital engagement alongside the changes in regulation anticipated in the Online Safety Bill.

To better support new and experienced coaches, Jobs for the Future (JFF), Community College Research Initiatives (CCRI), and Achieving the Dream created a comprehensive set of tools and resources, the SSCN Coaching Toolbox. The tools are shared through SSCN Coaching Program trainings and professional development sessions and webinars, online through JFF and CCRI websites, and by peer sharing among coaches. In the current phase of the SSCN Coaching Program, supported by Ascendium Education Group, JFF and CCRI partnered with grantee Centers in California, Michigan, New York, and Oregon to further support their coaching programs and gather data on how coaching catalyzes institutional change.

In the most recent phase of work, supported by Ascendium Education Group, Jobs for the Future (JFF) and Community College Research Initiatives (CCRI) engaged with grantee Centers in four states--California, Michigan, New York, and Oregon--to build the evidence base around institutional coaching. This brief summarizes what was learned and is drawn from interviews and focus groups with Center leadership, college administrators and staff members, and the coaches themselves. Through their conversations, the authors identified 10 common ways that coaching makes a difference for the people and institutions engaged in supporting guided pathways and other student success initiatives.",

However studies suggest these reforms have produced, at best, mixed results (Fullan, 2011; Taylor &amp; Tyler, 2012; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2015) and did little to close racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps (Reardon et al., 2013). Through a review of scientific studies of teaching strategies in classrooms with diverse learners, a team at McREL International has discovered (or perhaps re-discovered) that best first instruction has tremendous impact on student learning--equivalent to months or years of additional learning while closing achievement gaps. The white paper defines what is best first instruction and creates a framework for implementation in a classroom. For a more in-depth presentation and analysis of the review, McREL with ASCD published the book &quot;The New Classroom Instruction That Works: The Best Research-Based Strategies for Increasing Student Achievement&quot; (ED624202).",

Although it has been an important part of Western law since the ancient Greeks, guardianship has not garnered the attention of policymakers and disability rights advocates the way other issues have. Guardianship is a creature of state law, with a federal footprint that has historically been fairly small. However, guardianship has a profound impact on the people subject to it, as well as on their families and communities. The existence of a process through which an adult can essentially be found legally incapable of making decisions for themselves and another adult appointed to make decisions on behalf of that individual raises fundamental civil rights issues that are deserving of thorough examination. Additionally, the increase in the number of older Americans as the baby-boom generation enters retirement and growing concern over elder abuse has increased the level of interest in this topic among federal policymakers.",

        "description":"The National Literacy Trust has been annually surveying children and young people about their reading enjoyment, attitudes and practices since 2005. More recently, the annual survey has also allowed researchers to explore children and young people's reading engagement before, during and after educational disruption relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, having reached a 15-year low just before the first lockdown in spring 2020, the percentage of children and young people who said they enjoyed reading increased to its second highest point since they started asking this question during the lockdown. Children's comments suggested that simply having extra time to read had (re)engaged many of them with reading for pleasure. However this report shows that any gains made in terms of children and young people's reading engagement during the early part of the pandemic had completely eroded by early 2022. Indeed, fewer children and young people enjoyed reading and read in their free time in 2022 compared with the previous two years, and many of the years before. This is particularly the case for children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and, within this group, for boys. The study builds on previous findings and highlights findings from the annual literacy survey, which was conducted between January and the end of March 2022. 70,403 children and young people aged 5 to 18 from 327 schools in England, Scotland and Wales participated in this online survey.",

        "description":"During the pandemic-related school closures and lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, listening to stories, whether through audiobooks or podcasts, was a lifeline for many children and adults (see Best &amp; Clark, 2020 and Best, Clark, Perry &amp; Riad, 2022). Around this time, the National Literacy Trust also began asking children and young people about their listening habits and attitudes to listening to audio in the Annual Literacy Survey. 2022 was the third year that such questions were asked, and this report explores how listening habits have developed post-lockdown. In this report, the authors explore how trends are reflected in the views and behaviours of children and young people. This year the authors also found that reading (Cole, Brown, Clark &amp; Picton, 2022) and writing (Clark, Lant &amp; Riad, 2022) enjoyment were down from 2021, so they were keen to see how the provision of audio might help promote engagement with stories in other areas. The authors asked three key questions: whether they enjoy listening, how frequently they listen, and what formats they listen to -- referring specifically to audiobooks and podcasts. It is important to note that this is the first time they have not issued separate reports about audiobooks and podcasts, but rather looked at attitudes to hearing stories across different formats. The authors focus primarily on those who enjoy listening, rather than those who say they listen to a specific format.",

The Department accomplishes its mission and the related strategic goals and objectives by administering programs that range from preschool education through postdoctoral research; enforcing civil rights laws to provide equal access and treatment; and supporting research that examines ways that states, schools, districts, and postsecondary institutions can improve America's education system. As evidenced by the information contained in this AFR, the Department has demonstrated that it is a good steward of financial resources and has put in place well-controlled and well-managed business and financial management systems, processes, and practices. The AFR is divided into four sections. The Management's Discussion and Analysis section provides provides information about the Department's mission and organizational structure as well as its high-level performance results, financial highlights, management assurances regarding internal controls, and forward-looking information. The Financial Section provides provides a message from the chief financial officer, the financial statements and notes, required supplementary information, and the report from the independent auditors. The Other Information section provides the Office of Inspector General's Management and Performance Challenges for FY 2023, a summary of financial statement audit and management assurances, &quot;Payment Integrity Information Act&quot; reporting details, civil monetary penalty adjustment for inflation, &quot;Grants Oversight and New Efficiency Act of 2016&quot; and grant closeout process reporting, and the FY 2021 Climate Adaptation Plan. Finally, the Appendices section provides a listing of selected Department web links, education resources, and a glossary of acronyms and abbreviations.

A through-year assessment program is: (1) Administered in multiple distinct sessions during a school year; and (2) Intended to support (a) the production and use of a summative determination, and (b) one additional aim. More than a dozen states are designing, piloting, or implementing versions of this assessment model to replace their current end-of-year summative test for accountability. As an organization that advises states on assessment and accountability, we understand the complexities of these kinds of assessment models. Through-year programs may provide a number of benefits, but these potential benefits must be clearly articulated and evaluated in light of their required trade-offs. The authors urge states to proceed with caution. This paper outlines ten interrelated considerations for states exploring through-year designs for their federally mandated state assessment program.",

        "description":"The Commission on Fake News and the Teaching of Critical Literacy Skills, run by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Literacy and the National Literacy Trust, as well as partners Facebook, First News and The Day, has gathered a wealth of evidence over the past year on the impact of fake news on children and young people, as well as the skills children need to be able to spot it. This report details the findings of the Commission's primary, secondary and teachers surveys about fake news, includes submissions from our call for written evidence and outlines the Commission's recommendations for specific action areas for government, schools, families, media organisations, commercial and third sector organisations and young people. Key findings include: (1) Only 2% of children have the critical literacy skills they need to tell if a news story is real or fake; (2) Half of children (49.9%) are worried about not being able to spot fake news; (3) Two-thirds of children (60.6%) now trust the news less as a result of fake news; (4) Two-thirds of teachers (60.9%) believe fake news is harming children's well-being, increasing their anxiety levels; and (5) Half of teachers (53.5%) believe that the national curriculum does not equip children with the literacy skills they need to identify fake news.

The purpose of this document is to provide details regarding the research supporting development of the screener and directing interested readers to references for more information. The development of the screening tool was guided by two research questions focusing on assessment literacy content specifications for teachers and leaders, as well as implementation features of professional learning programs: (1) What is the foundational content knowledge and skills K-12 educators (teachers and leaders) need to be considered 'assessment literate' based on the research literature and experts in the field? and (2) What is best practice in implementation of in-service K-12 educator professional development according to reviews of the body of recent literature?",

        "description":"Passed in 2001, the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) codified the use of educational accountability systems that rely on largely quantitative measures -- standardized tests, especially -- to assess student learning outcomes, rank order districts and schools according to these outcomes, and prescribe sanctions for schools and districts not meeting achievement targets. At the same time, American public schools have rapidly resegregated (Frankenberg et al., 2019) since reaching the height of statistical desegregation in 1988 (Orfield et al., 2014). A 2022 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that more than one-third of all K-12 public school students attend a school where at least 75 percent of the enrollment comes from the same racial background. This brief examines recent empirical research to consider what, if any, relationship exists between systems of accountability and the persistence of school segregation. It attempts to answer the following questions: (1) What does empirical evidence suggest about the relationship between contemporary accountability systems and trends in school segregation? and (2) How, if at all, might accountability systems be refined in order to contribute constructively to real integration?",

        "description":"Each year, the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs (NASSGAP) completes a survey regarding state-funded expenditures for postsecondary student financial aid. This report provides data regarding state-funded expenditures for student financial aid and illustrates the extent of efforts made by the states to assist postsecondary students. Information in this report is based on academic year 2020-21 data from the 52nd Annual NASSGAP survey. Data highlights include: (1) In the 2020-21 academic year, the states awarded almost $14.8 billion in total state funded student financial aid, a slight decrease about 0.1 percent in nominal terms and about 1.3 percent in constant dollar terms from the $14.8 billion in aid awarded in 2019-20; (2) The majority of state aid (87 percent) remains in the form of grants. In 2020-21, about 4.1 million grant awards were made representing about 12.9 billion in need and nonneed-based grant aid. This represents a decrease of about 0.4 percent from the $12.95 billion in grants awarded in 2019-20. Of the grant money awarded in 2020-21, about 73 percent was need-based and about 27 percent was nonneed-based, a breakout consistent with historical data; (3) Funding for undergraduate need-based grant aid decreased slightly nationwide from $9.3 billion in 2019-20 to about $9.15 billion in 2020-21, a change of about 1.8 percent in nominal terms; (4) Eight states (California, Texas, New York, Washington, New Jersey, Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania) collectively again awarded about 6.3 billion in undergraduate need-based grant aid, accounting for about 69 percent of all aid of this type; and (5) States provided about $1.8 billion in nongrant student aid, including loans, loan assumptions, conditional grants, work-study, and tuition waivers. Tuition waivers represented about 51 percent of nongrant aid.

        "description":"There have been many meaningful studies over the last quarter century that have explored how young people build critical consciousness, how mentors and other caring adults can support that process, and the benefits that young people experience when they build their sociopolitical understanding and work to make the world around them a better place. This content summarizes the relevant theory and scholarship to date on these topics -- a body of work that is still somewhat in its infancy. The critical mentoring scholarship to date offers many relevant theories and research findings that can compliment elder/practitioner wisdom and support the development of effective programs and mentoring relationships for young people.

        "description":"In early 2023, 85.6% of parents reported being worried about the cost-of-living crisis, and, as a consequence, they cut back on energy, food, gas and electricity. While parents recognised the many benefits of reading for their children's learning and well-being, household budgets were under pressure: 1 in 5 (20.0%) were buying fewer books for their children, especially those families who were struggling financially as a result of the cost-of-living crisis. The cost-of-living crisis is affecting household finances across income brackets, with many parents and carers struggling financially under the current circumstances. This report explores the impact of cost-of-living pressures on children and young people's access to reading resources and support at home.",

In addition to many people struggling with low literacy skills, the report also showed that there are also many negative perceptions around, and attitudes towards, literacy.

        "description":"This study examined why some seniors attending Early College High Schools did not plan to continue their education at a 4-year college immediately after graduation despite attending schools designed to provide coordinated academic and social supports with the expectation that all students would continue their education. Most students in our study (75%) did plan to continue their education at a 4-year college immediately after graduation. For the remaining students, we used cluster analysis to identify four distinct groups of non-college bound students. These groups were evaluated based on background characteristics, perceived opportunities and barriers, and schooling experiences. Results indicate that non-college bound students are diverse in their reasons for not continuing their education at a 4-year program and that any reform efforts designed to personalize opportunities and supports for these students must take into account how combinations of perceived opportunities and barriers shape their postsecondary decisions.

This study addresses the use of Yammer in facilitating communication and collaboration among project teams in an upper-level marketing course.

This experimental study investigated whether an objectivist-based teaching strategy or a constructivist-based teaching strategy yields greater achievement scores for adult students learning mathematics at a distance. A pretest-posttest control-group design was used, with a sample of 35 students. Two researcher-made test instruments, consisting of  multiple-choice and brief constructed response/extended constructed response (BRC/ECR) items, were used to measure students&apos; understanding of mathematics topics  both before and after the teaching intervention. While the results of t-tests and ANCOVA showed no statistically significant difference in achievement scores between the groups, the findings indicate that both teaching strategies are viable in the distance learning mathematics classroom.",

This paper illustrates how students in an Algebra II class had opportunities to develop their reasoning and sense making skills while discussing a problem about piecewise linear functions in small groups. In particular, students displayed a capacity for provoking each other to extend their prior knowledge, for making use of multiple representations, and for making connections with their non-mathematical prior experiences. We discuss the teacher's work in encouraging specific reasoning skills to support individual groups' work on the problem. We argue that a teacher's implementation of tasks that allow students the autonomy to work productively and promote student discussions of a problem can provide an avenue through which students in algebra may develop their reasoning and sense making skills.",

        "description":"In an age when reform is based on standards and instruction is based on research, this article gives practical advice for how mathematics teachers can analyze errors in student problems to create interventions that aid not only the individual's development, but the entire class's as well. By learning how to correct mathematics students' misconceptions, rather than their mistakes, teachers have the potential to both target more students and increase those students' conceptual understanding of the topic at hand. From the post-test scores on the Common/Habitual Algebra Student Misconceptions--Function Families (CHASM), a tool used to assess teachers' function family content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge that was given after a three-day, overnight professional development workshop, teachers averaged a 43% improvement in their ability to identify the common misconceptions present in students' scenario test example problems and in creating suitable interventions for that misconception. This article (a) highlights the results found from ten Algebra teachers' use of this pedagogical skill after a three-day overnight workshop entitled Teaching Algebra Concepts through Technology (TACT[superscript 2]), (b) identifies and categorizes misconceptions, and (c) provides pedagogical intervention support for correcting misconceptions rather than errors. As one teacher commented, &quot;A minor (pedagogical) tweak resulted in a major revelation.&quot;",

        "description":"Computational estimation is an important skill necessary for students' mathematical development. Students who can estimate well for computations rely on an understanding of many mathematical topics, including a strong number sense, which facilitates understanding the mathematical operations and contextual evidence within a problem. In turn, good estimation skills improve students' ability to do exact computations and help them determine the reasonableness of their solutions. There exists research regarding estimation, its significance, and some of the possible estimation strategies (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000; Sowder &amp; Wheeler, 1989; Van de Walle, Karp, &amp; Bay-Williams, 2010). While this research exists, it does not adequately address the particular ways students understand and perform estimations. In this study, we asked middle school students to answer both written and oral problems, which suggested the use of estimation. Our findings contribute to a more comprehensive definition of computational estimation and its strategies by presenting student examples. These student examples serve as a model for identifying the significance of computational estimation and its link to other conceptual mathematical knowledge.",

With several thousand Doctoral Community Network users, it was not known to what extent digital immigrants had embraced the technology. A study of 988 users determined that digital  immigrants used the Doctoral Community Network more often and for a larger variety of  purposes than digital natives did. Specifically, digital immigrants log-on more frequently, view leadership content at higher rates, read more blogs, use more doctoral community network research resources, and send and receive more peer messages than digital natives do. This research supports existing literature that found that digital immigrants possess higher levels of social reliance than digital natives while contradicting other literature that found that digital natives tend to use the internet for social networking and blog diaries at higher rates.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine educators' continuous partial attention. In line with this purpose, the research data were collected from 109 educators in higher education from different age groups and from four different countries with the use of a questionnaire made up of two sections and seven questions. The findings obtained in the study revealed that the educators' Continuous Partial Attention did not significantly differ with respect to their technology use efficacies, their ages or their countries. In addition, it was found out that the educators' Continuous Partial Attention differed statistically significantly depending on the fields they worked in. Based on this, it could be stated that educators working in the field of educational technologies encounter with Continuous Partial Attention more frequently than educators working in other fields.

The results of the data analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between student age and student preference for certain types of online learning activities. Older students in the study indicated a much stronger preference for videos of the professor lecturing, while younger students tended to prefer more interactive learning strategies. Focus group comments from the older students provide insights into some of the reasons why they found watching video lectures to be helpful for their learning, and comments from younger students illustrate how they learn best in online courses.

One key feature of research in these areas is Citation Analysis, a rather intricate operational feature available in modern indexes such as Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO. This paper reviews the recent extant research on bibliometrics within the context of citation analysis. Particular focus is on empirical studies, review essays, and critical commentaries on citation-based metrics across interdisciplinary academic areas. Research that relates to the interface between citation analysis and applications in higher education is discussed. Some of the attributes and limitations of citation operations of contemporary databases that offer citation searching or cited reference data are presented. This review concludes that: a) citation-based results can vary largely and contingent on academic discipline or specialty area, b) databases, that offer citation options, rely on idiosyncratic  methods, coverage, and transparency of functions, c) despite initial concerns, research from open access journals is being cited in traditional periodicals, and d) the field of bibliometrics is rather perplex with regard to functionality and research is advancing at an exponential pace.

One should also understand how technology is created, how it works, how it shapes society, and how society shapes technology. This study was designed to gauge the ability of a single-semester course to raise students' technological literacy as well as gains in student perceptions of the importance of technology education in the K-12 curriculum.  The STEM 110T course, &quot;Technology and Your World,&quot; was developed through the Department of Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Professional Studies as part of Old Dominion University's (ODU), VA, USA, Lower Division General Education requirement. The purpose of this study was to verify that the STEM 110T course is developing technological competencies outlined by the &quot;Standards for Technological Literacy.&quot;  A pre-post survey study was conducted during the spring 2012 semester at ODU to assess gains in the technological literacy of students enrolled in the STEM 110T course.  At the beginning of the spring 2012 semester, a total of 287 students were enrolled in the STEM 110T course. To ensure a high return rate, surveying took place in each of the STEM 110T classes during the first and last weeks of the semester. The survey instrument used in this study asked perception questions instead of knowledge questions. In total, 230 pre-surveys were completed and returned at the start of the semester and 204 post-surveys at the end, giving return rates of 93% and 84%, respectively. A paired samples t-test was run on the mean scores from the Likert scale questions to determine if there were significant differences between the STEM 110T students' pre- and post-survey responses.  Questions in the survey directed at assessing the students' concept of technology showed that completing the STEM 110T course was positively correlated with their concept of technology. The results from this study may aid other institutions interested in developing courses that are specifically designed to raise technological literacy. Efforts should be made to include content that emphasizes the global impact of technological literacy and the need to understand how it was developed, how it works, and how it shapes society and individuals.",

In Study I, which was carried out in 2004, 157 teachers participated (women &quot;N&quot; = 8). In Study II, which was conducted in 2011, 109 teachers participated (women &quot;N&quot; = 6). The statistical data processing software SPSS 18.0 was used to process the survey data; descriptive statistics and t-tests were applied. The questionnaire is based on a survey used by Aki Rasinen, from &quot;In Search of Curriculum Elements for Finnish General Education Schools&quot; (2000), which was translated into Estonian with certain modifications added. The results revealed that the change toward higher satisfaction was the most apparent in the case of several characteristics. The study shows that during the observed period, the physical learning environment of Technology Education improved slightly in Estonia. Modern study aids are increasingly used in schools, including computer-run workbenches and corresponding programs, etc. However, modernising and developing the physical environment of Technology Education should be an ongoing objective, and means should be found to improve the physical environment of Technology Education in order to teach students using modern technology.",

Participants included practicing teachers and graduate assistants who represented a variety of learning environments and experiences. The study was framed by a set of overarching questions and utilized a variety of data sets, which were collected throughout the study. These included survey data on use of Web 2.0 tools, participant-designed classroom Wikis, instructional  materials for language learning, regular education teachers, ESL teachers, and resources for administrators and community stakeholders. Analysis employed the Constant Comparative process and Grounded Theory. Findings indicate several hindrances as well as benefits to using Wikis in the PreK-higher education environment. Participants emerged as content creators and  modeled the process for their ESL students.",

        "description":"During the last ten years, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) has ensured that educators at every level focus on accountability, use scientifically-based research, be data driven, and use standardized tests in an effort to improve student learning. Love it or hate it, NCLB has been the catalyst for huge changes in the world of education from kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12). Based on new reform models, some researchers have found that too many students enrolled in K-12 classrooms do not achieve at levels necessary to be globally competitive. New policies, expectations, and accountability measures have changed the way teachers teach and students learn. Any discussion of technology and engineering literacy must start with a clear idea of exactly what technology and engineering literacy means. That, in turn, requires clear definitions of technology. The use of technology has become more prevalent in schools and has been shown to facilitate student learning objectives. There is substantial evidence that incorporating technology, of any kind, in the classroom as an instructional tool enhances student learning and educational outcomes. The researchers' identified one problem, a lack of focus and inability of middle school students to follow instructions at the beginning of class during courses taught at a high-needs urban middle school of over 1,100 students. A concurrent triangulation mixed method action research design was then developed based on questions for mixed methods study. The key elements of this study included a hands-on, problem-solving, STEM activity, written instructions either read by a classroom teacher or delivered through video, an observation checklist, a two-question survey, and seven interview questions asked of a focus group. Although this research indicates that video instruction better engaged students, given that technology and its accessibility continue to advance and change, educators will be challenged not only to keep pace but also to ensure that they stay abreast of the latest technological developments and use them as learning tools.",

        "description":"Enrollment in technology education at the college level has been declining, so it is becoming essential for technology teacher educators to investigate ways to increase the enrollment in their programs. Technology teacher educators are exploring the extent to which distance-learning technologies such as video modeling can be used by industrial and technical teacher education faculty. They are researching which point of view--reportorial, subjective, or objective--better promotes content understanding and learning for hands-on activities in a technology education and industrial technology context. The intention of this study is to add to the body of knowledge on effective video modelling procedures and, in particular, the point of view used when recording instructional videos. Video modeling can be described as a technique used to model a target skill by another individual whose actions and language are videotaped. While most of the video instruction literature relates to research in special education (specifically autism), its applicability to groups of college students in the field of industrial and technology education seems like a perfect fit. In particular, the study compared the objective, subjective, and reportorial points of view. It was found that the objective view (face to face) and the reportorial view (shot next to the instructor's head) both provided statistically significant higher scores than the subjective view (shot from where the students are standing). In addition, the researchers are interested in further exploring the optimal point of view. By understanding the optimal point of view for distance learning in technology education and industrial technology, distance instruction can be enhanced through the use of recorded or live video feeds.",

        "description":"To help the United States stay globally competitive in terms of innovation and invention, the teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has become a priority in P-12 education today. As the need for students to become stronger in STEM grows, so does the need for well-qualified STEM teachers who understand what is needed to develop relevant and high-quality STEM programs. Professional development (PD) can offer opportunities for those involved in the teaching of STEM to learn how to effectively integrate various instructional approaches, including &quot;engineering design&quot; into their teaching and learning environments. Professional development is important to STEM education, especially in the areas of technology and engineering. If engineering is to be recognized as an integral part of science, technology, and math education, stakeholders, organizations and/or people directly involved have to share the burden of responsibility for these ideas to become reality. The authors describe a series of PD activities sponsored by the National Center for Engineering and Technology Education (NCETE) in 2005-2006. These activities steered a number of research efforts at various universities including: California State University, Los Angeles (CSULA); University of Wisconsin-Stout; Brigham Young University; and the University of North Carolina A&amp;T. The purpose of these activities was related to the identification of core engineering concepts, the production of logic models of effective PD, and the development of successive engineering design challenges. As a result of the university studies, those who develop STEM PD offered the following recommendations: (1) Provide a Supportive PD Environment; (2) Provide an Exemplar Engineering Design Challenge; (3) Provide Training on Managing Group Projects and Evaluating Student Contributions; (4) Developers of STEM PD Should Consider Standards-Based Pressures that Impact STEM Learning; (5) STEM PD Should Train Teachers How to Develop Their Own Standards-Based, Engineering Design Challenges; and (6) STEM PD Should Train Teachers How to Integrate STEM Concepts into Their Instructional Materials. The authors conclude with a description of recent pushes in the U.S. to infuse engineering design into science, math, and technology education. The preparation of teachers with the ability to develop relevant and high quality STEM programs becomes vital to these efforts. Given that teachers have a direct influence over student learning, it is important to invest the necessary resources to help teachers provide the best quality STEM education for their students.",

        "description":"According to No Child Left Behind (NCLB), the definition of a highly qualified teacher includes three components: obtaining a bachelor's degree; having full licensure as defined by the state; and demonstrating competency, as defined by the state, in each subject taught (U.S. Department of Education, 2004). However, NCLB does not specifically include career and technical education, of which technology education is a part. Due to the difficulty of filling all teaching positions with highly qualified teachers, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction instituted an alternative licensure program established to allow individuals without an education degree from a university-based teacher preparation program to transfer their skills from the workplace into the classroom. This has caused some concern about the effectiveness of the alternatively licensed teachers. Some educators feel that an alternatively licensed teacher does not have the necessary understanding of pedagogical theories and practices they would obtain when completing a traditional education program. A quasi-experiment was designed to determine if there was a significant difference in teacher effectiveness when comparing alternatively licensed and traditionally licensed high school technology education teachers. The methodology was designed to use both a quantitative and qualitative approach to utilize triangulation. A series of research questions were presented and by comparing test results, the students' time on task, and qualitative data, a conclusion can be drawn as to whether or not there are any differences in alternatively licensed technology education teachers and traditionally licensed technology education teachers. By using the methodology in this study, the researcher was able to provide evidence that there may not be any statistically significant differences between alternatively licensed and traditionally licensed technology education teachers in North Carolina.",

Both teachers use weekly lab exercises and experiments as formative assessments. In their middle school classrooms, children are engaged and eager to learn. As students walk into Mr. Smith's classroom, a prescribed, step-by-step procedure of the day's experiment is found at each lab station. Only 60 feet down the hallway, students in Ms. D'Amico's class arrive to find only the materials for the day's experiment and a lab rubric at each lab table. In this classroom, students are expected to design their own experiment using materials they choose from the lab table. In this article, the author contrasts the traditional approach to science lab activities that Mr. Smith uses with the inquiry-oriented approach Ms. D'Amico uses. He describes in detail the way Ms. D'Amico implements an inquiry-oriented lab in her classroom and illustrates how teachers can prepare students for standardized assessments while still creating meaningful lessons with real-world connections.

A combination of economic anxiety, aggressive advertising, ubiquitous ratings, and verbal vagueness has led to an emphasis on the external aspects of success--money, status, and appearance. Ranking is especially important. A \"successful school\" (in education discussion and reporting) is one that has raised test scores; a \"successful teacher\" or \"successful reform\" has done likewise. A \"successful student\" has earned high grades, landed a job with a high salary, or both. In research studies, newspaper articles, and general education discussions, there is far more talk of achievement than of the actual stuff that gets achieved. In this article, the author contends that such talk has resulted in a cult of success that, in its preoccupation with image, money, and power, has distorted what it really means to succeed.

        "author":["Senechal, Diana"],
        "description":"There is only one practice of solitude: to make a choice and carry it out well. The particulars assemble around this simple principle. One may later regret the choice; one may end up reversing or abandoning it. The choice may consist of doing nothing or refraining from a decision until the time is right. But no matter what it entails, one must entrust oneself to it in order to see it clearly. The practice of solitude requires education and experience. None of the choices of solitude can be made without insight, if they are to be made well. Many practices of solitude can be conveyed only through example. Teachers who practice their subjects--who think about them and work on them in their own time--can show students a way of life. They need not \"model\" for the students in any canned way; their very conduct is a model. When teachers read a poem aloud or present a mathematical proof, their tone conveys whether they have thought about it at length, played with it, argued about it, and more. Students will likewise learn from the teachers' handling of conflicts that arise in class and in school. But there is more to the practice of solitude than simply doing something well or working toward good performance. The person who shapes something is also shaped. People think of \"character building\" as something that takes place outside, in the world, but much of it happens in private. Reading, playing an instrument, memorizing the elements, all of this makes a person just a little different from before. Seeing the world a little differently, he is slightly altered in turn. All he needs to do is honor this new shape, not apologize for it, not slur its syllables. It is possible, even with abundant foibles, to live up to the way one sees the world. People learn, over time, what they will not and cannot do, what they will not and cannot give up. Sometimes the practice of solitude comes down to a simple \"no.\" That \"no\" protects all sorts of other possibilities. It guards a life. (Contains 5 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Teachers' unions are under unprecedented bipartisan attack. The drumbeat is relentless, from governors in Wisconsin and Ohio to the film directors of \"Waiting for 'Superman'\" and \"The Lottery\"; from new lobbying groups like Michelle Rhee's StudentsFirst and Wall Street's Democrats for Education Reform to political columnists such as Jonathan Alter and George Will; from new books like political scientist Terry Moe's \"Special Interest\" and entrepreneurial writer Steven Brill's \"Class Warfare\" to even, at times, members of the Obama administration. The consistent message is that teachers' unions are the central impediment to educational progress in the United States. Part of the assault is unsurprising given its partisan origins. Republicans have long been critical, going back to at least 1996. What is new and particularly disturbing is that partisan Republicans are now joined by many liberals and Democrats in attacking teachers' unions. The critics' contentions, which the author sums up as collective bargaining and teachers' unions being undemocratic and bad for schoolchildren, have no real empirical support. Democratic societies throughout the world recognize the basic right of employees to band together to pursue their interests and secure a decent standard of living, whether in the private or public sector. Collective bargaining is important in a democracy, not only to advance individual interests, but to give unions the power to serve as a countervailing force against big business and big government. Moreover, there is no strong evidence that unions reduce overall educational outcomes or are at \"the heart\" of the education problems. The author contends that if collective bargaining were really a terrible practice for education, people would see stellar results in the grand experiments without it: the American South and the charter school arena.

        "description":"This author contends that contemporary issues classes no longer have currency, as standardized test results are the litmus test for education. In many schools, students are isolated from firsthand accounts and formal study of events that textbooks will one day proclaim as defining experiences of their generation. According to Doyle, schools tend not to teach many, perhaps most, headline-making problems: climate change, debt crises, the national and international polarization of wealth, revolutions in the Middle East, and oil dependence. Students can graduate from many, perhaps most, high schools today and remain tragically naive about the public history of their own times. Convinced that it is important for schools to reflect the history-making events of modern times, Doyle, feeling a bit like an &quot;insurgent,&quot; slips these lessons into his classes &quot;covertly,&quot; so as not to raise accusations about deviating from the official curricular script. He states his belief that it would be a mistake to reduce education merely to test success, job training, or the pursuit of high-status college admission. Schools must connect with life beyond the classroom, and public education properly done has to prepare students for citizenship in a democratic society. But with the national fixation on standards and test scores, massive teacher layoffs, and a growing preference for merit pay based on test results, the author contends that teaching about current events, specifically today's wars, demands furtiveness.",

But children are growing up in a world in which environmental toxins are ubiquitous. Measurable levels of hundreds of man-made chemicals are routinely found in the bodies of all Americans, including newborns. Infants are exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls, lead, and mercury in the womb and through breast milk. Baby bottles and toys have been found to contain phthalates, bisphenol A, and lead, all toxins that have been linked to reproductive and developmental disorders. As harmful elements detected in everyday household items increase, rates of chronic disease have also risen sharply--and these conditions are now the leading causes of childhood illness and death. Responsibility for developing strong environmental policies does not rest with government alone. Other organizations--including schools--also should have carefully developed policies to ensure that they provide clean and safe environments. Teachers and administrators can serve as advocates for children by identifying and addressing environmental hazards in schools. This article highlights common environmental problems in the school setting--lead, pesticides, mercury, arsenic, outdoor and indoor air pollution, mold, asbestos, radon, bisphenol A/phthalates, and polychlorinated biphenyls--and identifies steps teachers and administrators can take to prevent or minimize exposure to these problems.

        "author":["Fitzhugh, Will"],
        "description":"Many elementary teachers teach students to write, but this writing tends to focus only on students writing about themselves or writing short stories. Because students do not spend enough time in the early grades reading nonfiction in science and history, they lack the knowledge--of both content and the nature of nonfiction writing--necessary to undertake research papers in middle and high school. To really teach students how to write, educators must give them examples of good writing found in nonfiction books and require students to read them, not skim them, cover to cover. Reading nonfiction contributes powerfully to the knowledge that students need in order to read more difficult material--the kind they will surely face in college. But more importantly, the work of writing a research paper will lead students to read more and become more knowledgeable in the process. As any good writer knows, the best writing emerges from a rich store of knowledge that the author is trying to pass on. Without that knowledge and the motivation to share it, all the literacy strategies in the world will not make much difference. In this article, the author suggests that schools start assigning a page per year: each first-grader would be required to write a one-page paper on a subject other than himself or herself, with at least one source. At least one page and one source would be added each year to the required academic writing, so that fifth-graders, for example, would have to write a five-page paper with five sources, ninth-graders would have to write a nine-page paper with nine sources, and so on, until each and every high school senior could be asked to prepare a 12-page history research paper with 12 sources. Such a plan would gradually prepare students for future academic writing and could also reduce the need for remedial instruction in writing (and perhaps in remedial reading as well) when students enroll in college. The author contends that if school districts adopted such a plan, it would not take high school teachers nearly as much time as it does now to teach students to write history research papers; students could draw on the knowledge they gained in previous grades to distinguish between primary and secondary sources, formulate an argument or a narrative based on those sources, develop a bibliography, and write and revise numerous drafts.

A 5-item Likert scale was created from this instrument by first adding a &quot;3 = neutral/undecided&quot; option and also by adding five negatively-worded items to the instrument. The instrument was piloted with 20 participants. The Cronbach's alpha for this pilot study was 0.87. The instrument was subsequently used in a large research study, and the Cronbach's alpha was found to be 0.88. This yielded an instrument that showed strong internal consistency.",

They want children to succeed in school, fulfill their dreams, and take this country to new heights. To get them there, parents know children need plenty of healthy food and exercise to help get them ready to learn. But parents know that's often easier said than done. That is why in 2010, Let's Move!, a nationwide initiative with a simple goal: to end childhood obesity within a generation, was launched.

But bullying is rarely so obvious these days. The most common forms of bullying can go unnoticed, and can do far more lasting damage. This fact presents a challenge to parents and educators working to create a bully-free environment in their schools. Fortunately, there are concrete, effective steps parents and educators can take to prevent bullying--and prevention is the best solution. In this article, the author stresses that adults must create school, community, and home environments where there is respect and acceptance of all people. When a school is defined by respect and acceptance, it is difficult for bullying to take root and flourish.",

An adjunct to the National Standards is the &quot;Assessment Guide&quot;. This guide is a great place to start to help families and schools determine how well they are meeting the Standards by offering indicators of family engagement. While each of the standards forms a critical component in a comprehensive family-engagement program, many schools still struggle with the implementation of Standard 5: Sharing power. In this article, the author describes the characteristics of Standard 5 and discusses how PTAs can use the &quot;Assessment Guide&quot; to help schools identify how well they are sharing power and then work with them to develop strategies to devise means to better share power with families.

        "description":"For the past 10 years, schools have been required by the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act-No Child Left Behind (ESEA-NCLB) to develop meaningful family engagement practices that provide welcoming environments to parents. However, for parents who have had negative experiences in school, either as a student or through interacting with their child's teacher and school staff, feeling truly comfortable and welcome may not come easy. Schools themselves often do not know how to change ingrained patterns that may have excluded parents. Work must be done in teacher preparation programs to determine how best to encourage positive relationships and provide education students with appropriate instruction in parent engagement. A trusting relationship can be built through effective school-to-home and home-to-school communication on all matters, both positive and negative. The communication should not end with parent-teacher conferences, newsletters, or greetings at the school door, but also should include engagement of parents and families in school planning. However, the actual process of parent engagement can be as diverse as the populations who attend public schools; therefore, there is no \"one size fits all\" answer. In this article, the authors discuss what parents and PTA leaders can do to improve current parent engagement practices.",

The conventions offer numerous workshops to attend, leadership training, and networking with other members across the state and the country to share best practices and solve problems. Building local-state PTA relationships is especially important to the mutual goal of empowering families in all the states to help children succeed.",

        "description":"The ecological impact of colonialism is inextricable from empire building, industrialism, large-scale deforestation, and agriculture. Not long ago one could safely drink from nearly every lake, river, stream, and spring, and one could hunt animals as a part of intact ecosystems. Today's world is very different. Colonization alters the reality through one's language and sense of place. Learning the history of the Saugeen Ojibway or the Algonquins, referring to the area as the Saugeen rather than the Bruce Peninsula, and learning how one can assist these nations' reparations is one way of decolonizing the language and sense of place. Decolonizing people's minds has a lot to do with outdoor education work, which has deep roots in ecology and bioregionalism. The author shares some thoughts on non-native participation in decolonization work. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

Across Canada there are dozens of camps that have supported &quot;Indian&quot; assemblies in the past, but a select few still do. Most organizations abandoned them during the 1960s or changed focus to themes that do not risk racist interpretation. This trend outlines the struggle camps have faced to appropriately represent the culture of the First Nations at events--a struggle or, better yet, a challenge people at TSC have just begun to accept. As a long-term camper and senior staff member last summer, the author had the opportunity to participate in reviving the program and observing the progress and obstacles that evolved.",

        "author":["Lowan, Greg"],
        "description":"Metis scholar Catherine Richardson introduced the concept of the &quot;Third Space&quot; as the existentially blended territory of a Metis mentality. She compared this to the &quot;First Space&quot; of the dominant Euro-Canadian society and the &quot;Second Space&quot; of colonially subjugated Aboriginal peoples. However, during a recent conference presentation, one audience member astutely pointed out that the First Space on Turtle Island was, in fact, Aboriginal, followed by the European Second Space, which resulted in the Third Space of the Metis. The Third Space is a place where Western, Aboriginal, and other cultural beliefs, philosophies, values, and knowledge intersect, cohabit, and intermingle. Concepts such as the Third Space, healing the split head, Two-Eyed Seeing, and metis provide a compelling theoretical basis for exploring intercultural environmental ethics and education. The author uses the term &quot;ecological metissage&quot; to collectively describe these concepts. Ecological metissage denotes a blending of two or more ecological world views in personal identity, philosophy, and practice. The author explores examples of ecological metissage in practice.

It begins to ask questions about where the idea of health comes from, what it means to different people in different places and why it should matter. As society has been increasingly confronted with the realities of a more economically and technologically driven global society, health has evolved from the human sciences into new spheres, such as politics, economics, popular culture, commerce, and religion, where it has arguably taken on new meanings. The full story of health is the unfolding journey of an idea and how this idea is changing the way people think, feel, and act in today's context. The perspective of health the author presents in this article emerges from her own experiences over the last 31 years. This journey is worth exploring because, as she argues, it coincides with the evolution of ideas about health, from a reductive approach to an emerging approach that embraces health in a \"whole\"istic way.",

As an ecological educator who is passionate about living in a respectful relationship with the land and who has spent the past year studying yoga intensively, the author sought to bridge these two worlds by asking, \"How can the practice of hatha yoga aid in the development of ecological consciousness?\" The practice of hatha yoga is well known for its ability to help with relaxation, stress reduction, and the development of strength and flexibility. It is also an incredibly powerful practice for aligning body and mind, and increasing awareness of both the physical body and the inner self. Many of the various hatha yoga asanas, or poses, mimic natural landforms and creatures, and physically capture the essence of central quality of each through posture and movement. In this article, the author discusses how to use the body to interpret the teachings of the land. By positioning the body in various asanas and using awareness of the breath to align the mind with the body, it becomes possible to access the unique teachings of each of the various elements of the natural environment.",

This author believes that fishing can aid in fostering a certain ethical view of the environment. It  allows participants to carry themselves into the world in a creative way that not only foregrounds Indigenous ways of knowing but also allows for a certain connection to be made with nature. Because fishing can be both a meditative practice and one of subsistence, it might prove valuable to the fostering of connection to the natural world and to alternative ways of knowing for students. Granted, fishing is only one of these opportunities and may not be for everyone. The author challenges readers to find something in their own community that engages students in the environment for a specific purpose and recognizes alternative ways of knowing.

Aspects of nature, such as mother earth, can be used as symbols of feminine energy and have been honoured by many communities globally as vessels for healing.

The students become certified in the use of GPS and in map and compass work, and earn accreditation in chain saw use, ORCA Tripping I, Basic Flatwater, Basic Kayaking, WHIMIS, Skidder/Cutter operator's license, Pleasure Craft operator's card and Wilderness First Aid.  They have used these skills to fundraise for the program, for example by cutting trees  for a local home. Students also engage in a two-week co-op placement with local municipalities and tourism businesses to prepare for work in the growing eco-tourism  sector. Finally, the program integrates elements common to many four-credit semester Outdoor Education programs, including cross-country and downhill skiing, fitness, and a culminating canoe trip. The program also has the support of local Aboriginal professionals, and includes a weekly sharing circle led by a certified addictions counsellor. (Contains 2 footnotes.)",

        "description":"In this article, the author stresses the danger of losing the concept of education in favour of lower notions of instruction and training. By \"training\" he means a process that suggests the acquisition of skills and the enhancing of performance capacities. By \"instruction\" he means learning facts and new information--the results of retention. Too often, states McKernan, even those in universities confuse training and instruction with pure \"education.\" Traditional (basic) research, what may be thought of as \"blue sky\" inquiry in the human and social sciences, is being viewed as inappropriate in favour of applied scientific \"evidence-based\" research methodologies where grant money is being currently channeled. The problem is that the grey philistines who are \"running\" the colleges and universities claim, falsely, to be businessmen running enterprises that will bring greater economic growth and riches through applied research--not \"blue sky\" inquiry. The author believes that there are very real possibilities that education can be reclaimed from these \"grey philistines and merchants of managerialism.\" The idea of a university is that it is a community of scholars having a discourse, using a variety of research methods \"appropriate to their discipline\" to advance knowledge, to contribute to searching for truth through inquiry, to conduct teaching of this knowledge and these methods, so that students can get into perspective the knowledge that  they \"do not yet possess\" and to offer service to the university and the community.

        "description":"George Brown College is among the leaders in the interprofessional health-care education movement in Canada. Interprofessional Education (IPE) and Collaborative Practice occur &quot;when students from two or more professions learn about, from and with each other to enable effective collaboration and improve health outcomes.&quot; According to the World Health Organization document (WHO, 2010), Interprofessional education is a necessary step in preparing a collaborative practice-ready health workforce that is better prepared to respond to local health needs. George Brown provides undergraduate and post-graduate training programs for health professionals, community service workers and others including early childhood educators. The Division of Community Services and Health Sciences has embedded the IPE principles into their working relationships and have begun sharing and collaborating across the various programs. In the College system, there are always competing needs for resources. The Division of Community Services and Health Sciences of George Brown College has succeeded in embracing the strategic business planning process utilizing the fundamental tenets of interprofessionalism. In this paper, the authors will illustrate the way in which they place IPE at the forefront of their planning and will reinforce to the reader the richness in professional diversity of their team and consequently the dynamic approach to their very robust business plan.",

        "description":"This paper examines the theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) as the most viable and effective platform for 21st century educational and instructional methodologies based on the understanding of the value of diversity in today's classrooms and educational institutions, the unique qualities and characteristics of individual learners, the opportunities that arise from applying the ideas of multiple intelligences, the need for flexibility and adaptation in a global society, and the increasing demand for accountability at all levels of education. Several definitions of intelligence are presented and the author examines the theories of Sternberg and Goleman as supportive of the philosophy of multiple intelligences being the most effective for 21st century educational and curricular platform. The author sees the value of MI theory as broad enough to facilitate 21st century understanding of education and intelligence in so much as diversity and technology have fueled changes in the definitions and requirements of individuals with regard to pedagogy. In putting forth a strong argument of multiple intelligences (MI) being a strong platform for effective educational and instructional methodologies in 21st century classrooms and schools, the author also examines opposing views and attempts to counteract such with supporting literature, examples, and ideas.

In this article, the author looks at some of the ways that learning about the brain translates to an enhanced understanding of what faculty can do. The author hopes that this article will (1) make clear that there is a need for educators to learn more about the brain; (2) provide some resources to support them in further independent learning about the topic; and (3) make the case that the work involved in learning about the brain is time well spent.

College and university administrators as well as individual faculty must recognize that the solutions call for systemic changes that address both the learning culture and adopt effective learning strategies. Key practices that may be used by faculty to foster effective learning of passive, disaffected students are developing a shared vision, articulating well defined academic proficiency, formative assessment, and multiple instructional methods.

        "description":"Midway High School is a school that would like to be able to claim itself &quot;a restorative school&quot;, though its journey is just beginning. It is a mid-decile, urban, co-educational New Zealand secondary school of approximately 970 students. The school draws a wide range of students with approximately 40 per cent NZ European, 27 per cent Pasifika, 26 per cent Maori and 7 per cent Asian and other. Midway High School is part of the new wave of change in education and through its restorative practices is focussing on building relationships and community. The school embarked on a three year restorative practices development in 2009. This article presents the results of a study of teachers' responses to an extended professional development innovation. Although it is clear that the project has not been uniformly successful in all its aspects, and in spite of the fact that the evidence of four teachers from a staff of seventy is not a huge sample, the authors believe that there is enough evidence offered to suggest that the project is achieving many of the goals of what might be termed a &quot;restorative classroom practice&quot;. The participating teachers felt that class meeting participation had improved their relationships with their students and felt that the atmosphere in the classroom was calmer, more relaxed/relaxing. The teachers also perceived that the class meetings had a beneficial effect on the quality and output of students' work, noticing more student participation in asking questions, revising properly and homework completion. The professional development project at Midway High School represents a considerable commitment in time, resources, and energy from a significant proportion of the staff. Features that would count as innovative in the project include the expectation of reflection on the part of both staff and students, in the presence of one another. The authors believe the process is unique in its explicit mix of discipline and therapeutic or group processes, combined with the use of de-constructive questioning and reflection.",

        "description":"New Zealand is going through a major educational shift. It has just brought in a new curriculum that focuses on students, rather than content, as the centre of learning. New Zealand has an increasingly multi-cultural and diverse population and this is reflected in some of the complexities confronting education. Suspensions and exclusions of young people escalated through the 1990s, prompting the Ministry of Education to put in a concerted effort to reduce these rates. At the same time, the country is striving to improve educational outcomes and build its population's capacity to learn and develop together in a peaceful and productive manner. But while it has a progressive and exciting new curriculum, it is questionable whether this can be implemented in what is best described as a traditional, at times punitive, education system. The study reported here suggests that there may be a place for restorative practice in the teaching of the new curriculum and, in fact, a key role in developing key competencies, which are a cornerstone of the new curriculum. If students have increased competency in relating to others and contributing and participating, the values of the new curriculum will become more of a reality. To achieve this educators must provide forums that will allow students to think, practise, develop opinions and, above all, care about these values themselves. This study has shown that it is possible to create the conditions where such social learning can occur through the use of intentionally shaped and focused class meetings.

        "description":"Clearly, low performing, and especially failing schools, are a high priority concern for policy makers. And it is evident that fundamental systemic changes are necessary. The authors contend that it is essential that policy makers move to a three-component framework for turning around, transforming, and continuously improving schools. The third component will provide a unifying concept and an umbrella under which districts and schools can weave together all interventions specifically intended to address barriers to learning and teaching and re-engage disconnected students. There is, however, inadequate research and no consensus about a policy and practice blueprint and roadmap to guide such changes. Given all the uncertainties associated with turning around, transforming, and continuously improving schools, it is essential to keep analyzing deficiencies in proposed blueprints and roadmaps. Such analyses are especially important with respect to improving low performing schools. The authors begin their analysis with a discussion of the lenses through which systemic problems are viewed by policy makers in the USA and use the school turnaround models the Obama administration has adopted to illustrate the dilemma confronting efforts to enable equity of opportunity. Then, they broaden the analysis to include current priorities for the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act as outlined in the US Department of Education's &quot;A Blueprint for Reform.&quot; Their findings highlight the ongoing marginalization of practices for directly addressing barriers to learning and teaching and reengaging disconnected students. The findings also raise the question of whether this marginalization characterizes reform efforts in other countries. (Contains 5 exhibits.)",

The Rural Alaska Mentoring Project (RAMP) provides school-based E-mentoring services to 164 high-needs students in grades 4 through 8 in Alaska's most remote schools, with a special focus on high-needs students who are at the greatest risk of dropping out of school. The E-mentoring program is run through the District's Social Work Department. Mentoring is one of 15 &quot;Effective Strategies&quot; advocated by the NDPC to help solve the dropout problem in schools, as well as help promote peer support, social competence, self-determination, and leadership skills. The rural Yup'ik Eskimo villages in the LKSD have been particularly vulnerable to high school dropout and the resulting negative effects that include high incidences of truancy, teen pregnancy, drug use/abuse, and suicide. Obviously, due to the time and distance issues between the remote villages, face-to-face mentoring and peer support is problematic. Using a computer-mediated process to communicate with one another eliminates the time and distance barrier.",

        "description":"Chinese parenting emphasises parents' responsibility in training and governing children's appropriate and expected behaviors, including good academic performance. As reflected by the Attendance Ordinance and the strong involvement of parents in children's study, there is continuous emphasis on parental responsibility in children's education in contemporary Hong Kong. Children dropping out of school could predict stressful parental experiences. However, no exploration on parents' experiences has ever been made in the Chinese context. In response to the identified knowledge gap, a qualitative study was conducted. The study included a focus group interview with five parents and two individual interviews with another two parents. There were six mothers and one father. Four mothers were full-time housewives with two of them relying on welfare, while the other three participating parents had full-time employment. The age of the participating parents ranged from 42 to 48. Their education level ranged from illiterate to bachelor degree. The age of their children ranged from 12 to 15. The qualitative interviews were audio-taped, and the transcribed verbatim was used for data analysis. This article discusses the identified experiences and perspectives of the parents. The analyses indicated that the dropping-out behavior of children brought shame, guilt and a strong sense of incompetence to the parents. Furthermore, children's dropping-out behaviors have added much pressure and tension to the family relationship, which may lead to negative family dynamics. These findings call for strong support for parents when working with school dropouts. More systemic interventions are also necessary to address the family dynamics and the needs of the family as a whole. (Contains 1 note.)",

Material and methods: A cohort (n = 1100) of students attending B.S. or M.S. courses at 6 university schools in Warsaw were studied by applying questionnaire techniques. The questions pertained to participation in competitive sports and in recreational motor activities throughout the last year. Results: 8% of all students participated in competitive sports, 5% were members of college athletic clubs. Over 90% of students declared practicing leisure motor activities regularly (53%), seasonally (29%) or occasionally (11%). Most differences were related to the study year, 2nd year students being more active than their 4th year mates. Conclusions: Higher engagement of 2nd than of 4th year students in motor activities may result from obligatory, curricular physical education activities. Academic communities ought to undertake substantial effort towards shaping continuous health-directed habits of students. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Results: Competition, contest, victory and beating own benchmark were the important factors for male students. The female students preferred external adequacy and others' opinion. They believed in the importance of healthy living, physical strength and sports give them better appearance. The motivational factors had more importance amongst active than inactive youths. Young active students believed that sport performance would guide them to success.

        "description":"Study aim: To assess the level of self-handicapping tendency, competitive anxiety (trait) and social support within groups of young male and female athletes, as well as to determine the relationships between those variables. Material and methods: A group of 75 athletes (46 male football players and 29 female volleyball players) from Sport Mastery School in Lodz, aged 16-19 years, participated in the study. Three questionnaires were administered: Anticipative Strategy of Self-Esteem Protection Scale (ASO) to measure self-handicapping tendency, Social Support Scale (SWS) and Reactions to Competition (RnW), in order to measure the competition-related anxiety (trait). Results: Female athletes attained significantly higher scores in ASO and RnW while male players perceived their social support higher than girls. No significant correlations between self-handicapping and anxiety were found. Most of the observed relationships between self-handicapping and social support were negative, like those between anxiety and social support. Conclusions: It is advisable to work with young athletes on eliminating self-handicapping activities and replacing them with other, more efficient, ways of coping with anxiety. Social support (adequate to the athlete's needs) might be crucial in that proceeding. The hypothesis of relationship between sport competitive anxiety and self-handicapping was not confirmed, maybe due to the relatively small number of subjects. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Material and methods: All female students of officer and non-commissioned officer Military Academies (16 each) were studied in 2009. Two questionnaires were applied in the study: IPAQ (short) for assessing the level of physical activity of the respondents and a specially designed questionnaire for assessing social situation, perceived health and pro-health behaviours. Results: The influence of the society on the respondents' decision to join the army is significantly higher among NCOS students than in the group of OS respondents (p less than 0.05). OS students perceive their health better than their NCOS mates (p less than 0.05). Among students' pro-health behaviours that were assessed in the research, the most advantageously presented is their physical activity. NCOS students are more resilient mentally (p less than 0.01), yet their inclination to make use of health service is much lower (p less than 0.01). Conclusions: The modern educational trends in health promotion call for modifying the existing military school curricula by including health education issues so that the superiors acquire not only commanding skills but become also exemplary health educators.

In addition to discussing the benefits of the process approach to writing, this article illustrates how teachers can take advantage of some of the latest Internet technology to promote writing tasks in the ESL/EFL classroom. Two specific lessons that were applied in an advanced skills-integrated English course exemplify how to supplement regular classroom activities with the interactive and multimodal features of two online social media platforms--a blog and a Ning network. The activities described in this article exemplify how web-based social networking tools offer excellent opportunities to conduct the pre-writing, drafting, peer review, and revising steps of the writing process. In addition to developing important writing and other skills in English and learning to work collaboratively on projects, using the Internet for ESL/EFL instruction also advances students' digital literacy. When writing about topics that are relevant to their needs and interests, students are apt to respond enthusiastically and work collaboratively to craft written work in the types of genres that will benefit them in their academic pursuits and subsequent careers.

According to the American Sportfishing Association, fishing is a hobby pursued by some 40 million Americans, including more than 8 million youngsters between the ages of 6 and 15. Part of fishing's appeal is that it is accessible to all ages and every pocketbook. Any youngster with a stick, string, and hook, and some wriggly worms for bait, can try his or her luck in the local stream or pond. Serious fishermen, on the other hand, can easily invest thousands of dollars in boats and specialized fishing gear with which to pursue their favorite kind of fishing. Most sport fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks, and a wide variety of baits and lures. Specific kinds of fishing most popular in the United States include: (1) Bass fishing; (2) Fly fishing; (3) Deep sea fishing; and (4) Ice fishing.",

        "author":["Horn, Bradley"],
        "description":"Content-based instruction (CBI) is not a new term for foreign language teachers. By some accounts, CBI has been employed since the ancient Akkadians adopted Sumerian as the medium of instruction to educate their young in science and religion (Mehisto, Frigols, and Marsh 2008, 9). In the modern era, content-based approaches to language instruction have been employed in various forms since at least the 1960s, when Canadian language educators began teaching academic content in French to English mother-tongue children (Stoller 2008). Yet a large proportion of today's teachers of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) have never had the opportunity to try out CBI in their own classrooms--and many of these teachers may lack key professional knowledge and skills that are critical to successful CBI teaching. The purpose of this article is to consider ways that language-teacher education programs can better prepare future CBI teachers. After providing a brief rationale for why CBI approaches are particularly relevant in the 21st century, the author considers the competencies and skills that the language teachers of tomorrow will need to effectively integrate content and language instruction in their courses.",

Considering the inherent difficulty of the speaking skill, this is understandable. Learners often prefer to interact socially in their native language, allowing them to more effectively express a full range of ideas. In this article, the author discusses Eyes on English, a schoolwide campaign she developed to promote the use of English. This article presents the rationale for implementing Eyes on English and describes how it can help teachers increase English usage through an activity that is practical, fun, and easy to implement.",

        "description":"While Americans are as eager as ever to beautify their homes and yards with attractive landscaping, more and more gardeners are looking to the practical aspects of gardening--raising plants for food and choosing easy-care ornamental plants that are friendly to the environment. For some gardeners, raising their own food is a lifestyle choice. With doctors and the government urging consumption of fruits and vegetables to combat obesity and lower the risk of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, some people see the backyard garden as a short route to healthier eating. An added advantage is that homegrown food is of superior quality. Fruits and vegetables that ripen on the vine taste better than those that are artificially ripened and spend weeks in shipment before they reach the table. While commercially grown produce is often contaminated with unknown amounts of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, gardeners can guarantee the safety of what they grow themselves. Gardeners today are eager to work with nature instead of trying to master it. As they pursue their hobby, they seek practices and products that leave a minimal imprint upon the environment. Eco-friendly gardeners are especially interested in: (1) Less lawn; (2) Native plants; (3) Water conservation; (4) Chemical-free gardening; and (5) Attracting wildlife.",

In order to create harmonious language learning classrooms, teachers must first reduce anxiety, stress, and negative competition amongst their learners. In addition, teachers need to accept their learners for what and who they are. Teachers who teach in harmonious learning classes respect their students' different language learning styles and emphasize a healthy intellectual and emotional attitude toward one's self and others. One way to promote mentally, emotionally, and physically balanced learners is through the use of yoga. She suggests that by utilizing simple yoga poses in English language lessons, teachers can teach various aspects of the English language in a fun and nonthreatening way. With this approach, learners use their bodies to learn, practice, and anchor the language being taught at the same time as they reduce anxiety and help care for mind, body, and spirit.",

The first activity is part of a lesson that involves writing letters to introduce oneself to a group of beginning learners. The second activity, targeted at advanced teenage learners, demonstrates how an \"epistolary story\"--a story told by a series of diary entries, letters, or other types of writing--can encourage creative writing and language improvement.

        "author":["Sommerfeld, Amanda"],
        "description":"Against the backdrop of traditional measures of college readiness (i.e., high school GPA, standardized test scores, and high school rank), the consideration of \"non-cognitive\" factors marked a significant departure when they were first discussed as integral aspects of college success. Used to refer to any characteristic, ability or disposition that was theorized to affect college success or retention, the term \"non-cognitive\" became a kind of a catchall for any variables beyond those \"cognitive\" or \"intellectual\" variables listed above. However, the term \"non-cognitive\" is now and has always been a misnomer, used to refer to a vast array of constructs, many of which reflect cognitive process. Now, this could be considered simply a semantic issue; \"non-cognitive,\" \"dispositional\" or \"non-academic,\" what difference does it make if there is shared understanding of what the term refers to? The problem is that there isn't shared understanding and as a result this essential area of study has been compromised by critiques and misunderstandings, causing not only confusion about how these factors affect college readiness, but also general skepticism about their utility in predicting college success. It seems, then, that for more transparent discourses to take place about the multifaceted nature of college readiness, this crucial area of research must be recast, enhancing the clarity of the field in order to provide a linguistic grounding for future research. With this in mind, as a preliminary step the author proposes that \"non-cognitive\" be replaced with the more appropriate \"non-academic\" term, thereby elucidating the true distinction that researchers are making between various contributing factors to college preparation and success.

A statistical analysis of selected university admission criteria reveals specific examples of gender inequity that result from the differential validity of the SAT.

        "description":"School-age populations in many nations are becoming increasingly diverse (in terms of languages, countries of origin, ethnicity, faith traditions and so on) especially in low socio-economic communities where recent arrivals tend to be accommodated. In Australian classrooms, it is not unusual for a single classroom to include children who speak many different languages. Their family trajectories to their current dwellings and lifeworlds may be very different from each other. Catastrophic weather events and other disasters change the very landscapes in which families and teachers work. At the same time, what constitutes literacy continues to evolve as new technologies and communication media enable different forms of meaning-making. Yet simultaneously, what counts as literacy is increasingly &quot;fixed&quot; by the normative demands of high-stakes, standardised tests. This paper employs Hilary Janks' (2010) synthesis model of critical literacy to explore some of the risk and possibilities for innovative and equitable pedagogy inherent in this contemporary demographic, policy and practice mix.

        "description":"Curriculum guidelines, including the emergent Australian curriculum (Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority [ACARA], 2009-10), indicate expectations that teachers will support their students' interpretation and creation of multimodal texts. However, English curriculum guidelines are yet to advise on a detailed metalanguage to support teacher and student discussion of the meaning-making dimensions of multimodal texts. Theoretical work on the development of multimodal metalanguage is in its early stages, lacking ready application for use in diverse classroom contexts. This article reports on research into applications of a framework designed to help teachers add depth and breadth to teaching and learning about multimodal meanings through development of a metalanguage (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, 2000). While application of this framework in middle-years classrooms was initially found to be problematic, working in collaboration with teachers this framework was adapted and enriched for classroom use. This resulted in a refined framework which can be used in classrooms for stimulating metalanguage to describe multimodal texts. (Contains 6 tables and 5 footnotes.)",

        "description":"New Zealand students in the middle and upper school achieve better results in reading than they do in writing. This claim is evident in national assessment data reporting on students' literacy achievement. Research findings also state that teachers report a lack of confidence when teaching writing. Drawing on the National Writing Project developed in the USA, a team of researchers from the University of Waikato (New Zealand) and teachers from primary and secondary schools in the region collaborated to &quot;talk&quot; and &quot;do&quot; writing by building a community of practice. The effects of writing workshop experiences and the transformation this has on teachers' professional identities, self-efficacy, and their students' learning provided the research focus. This paper draws mostly on data collected during the first cycle of the two-year project. It discusses the influence of peer group response--a case study teacher's workshop experiences that transformed her professional identity, building her confidence and deepening her understandings of self as writer and ultimately transforming this expertise into her writing classroom practice.

        "description":"Conceptual Blending Theory (CBT) (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 2002), a cognitive theory of human processes of innovation, can be productively used alongside critical literacy approaches, for the analysis of how teachers and learners draw selectively, transformatively and purposively from aspects of the mass media. While numerous studies have pointed to the complexity of the relationship between globalised mass media forms and local cultures, highlighting intricate bi-directional flows of influence, there is still much to be learned of the nature of individual take-up of the global within the local, particularly with respect to youth in school settings. CBT offers a set of tools with which to peel open certain pedagogic processes and products, gaining a clearer vision of parts of their components and inner workings. In this paper I analyse qualitative data showing how one South African English teacher and a group of her Grade 10 learners draw from mass media genres of advertising, infomercials, talk shows and popular music, and blend these with elements of local culture and pedagogic genres, in order to meet their specific, localised communicative purposes. In the light of this analysis, I also consider implications for the use of mass media genres and products within English education, for the promotion of critical media literacy amongst learners.

This is in response to the need for increased engagement and educational success for all learners. I argue that there is need to support teachers who are willing to take on this complex task by providing examples of ways culturally relevant teaching can be implemented in their classrooms. I present the common elements of culturally relevant pedagogy and critical literacy through performance poetry in a grade 12 English class. I conclude with a discussion of the complexities of this kind of teaching praxis and what might be some insights not only for English teachers, but educators who are seeking to find ways of better understanding how to implement culturally relevant practices in their classrooms.

A total of 142 teachers were involved in the study and about three to eight teachers from each university were grouped and assigned a virtual classroom in Nicenet's Internet Classroom Assistant (&quot;www.nicenet.org&quot;) where online discussions took place. Each group's main task was to produce an online newsletter that highlights three major topics--project work in TESOL, linguistics in language teaching and learner strategies. A qualitative study was then carried out to identify the teachers' meaningful experiences in the project and how it had enriched their professional development. The data obtained from the teachers' reflective reports indicates four main facets of meaningful professional development experiences--envisioning of professional development, gaining and enhancing skills, sharing and exchanging, and socialising.

Two experiments were set up in two public primary schools. Two groups of 6th grade students participated in each experiment. The first group was taught three 80-minute Science lessons through the medium of L2 English, while the second group was taught the same content through the medium of L1 Greek. The outcomes demonstrated a significant effect of CLIL (p= 0.001) on L2 vocabulary knowledge of the experimental groups, which outperformed the control groups that were not exposed to CLIL. A significant effect (p= 0.000) of treatment on content knowledge was shown for both experimental and control groups. Observation of three video-taped Science lessons provided more information about the learning processes allowing benefits for CLIL students. Avenues for further related research are discussed.

        "description":"The present study investigates learning gains resulting from collaborative consciousness-raising (CR) tasks. For this purpose, text reconstruction and text repair tasks, two varieties of CR, were adapted from previous CR studies and administered to EAL (English as an Additional Language) learners in a women's university in South Korea. We implemented a pre-test, post-test and delayed-test design, with each dyadic CR task measuring student knowledge of different grammatical elements of English. The participants were shown to make learning gains resulting from text repair tasks, but not from their text reconstruction counterparts. These findings suggest that text repair tasks may be pedagogically preferable to text reconstruction, when promoting focus on form and dyadic discussion of specific linguistic aspects of the target language. This article ends with a brief summary of considerations from social learning theory that can aid the teacher in promoting collaborative behaviour during pair work and how CR tasks can be adapted for various learning groups.

We build on Macrorie's (1988) I-Search paper, drawing on affordances of Web 2.0 technologies and culture, to initiate the iSearch 2.0 process. iSearch 2.0 consists of four phases: 1) messing about and trying on questions; 2) exploring and expanding the edge of knowledge; 3) publication; and 4) reflection and self-assessment. This new academic research and writing process makes it possible for students to investigate and try out possible research topics, actively participate in the social construction of knowledge, trace sources efficiently, create meaningful products, and distribute information (regarding both the process and products of research) widely. iSearch 2.0 allows students to receive feedback from broad publics during the process of research and also to utilise multiple methods and compositional modes for self-reflection. Assessment strategies for iSearch 2.0 can incorporate interest communities outside the school and should consider the process and products of inquiry. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

How might these technologies and practices be changing the understandings and usage of texts and literacies of the children who enter into classroom spaces? What transformative possibilities might these home technology practices announce for teaching and learning within classroom environments? In both Canadian and Australian curriculum documents, as well as in OECD reports, the need to develop innovative approaches to educational practices and the inclusion of digital technologies is acknowledged as necessary in facing 21st century challenges. We provide examples linking to media news stories in both countries, addressing the use of touch-screen technologies in schooling and examine how these presentations are very different from the practices we have observed in our homes, where the children have relative openness and freedoms with their device usage. Within the article we demonstrate, using media links and images, the ways in which our own children have begun to navigate digital devices and texts and to create new sorts of narratives that open possibilities for literacies in multiple ways, as \"creators\", \"designers\", and experts. We argue that, once translated into classroom practice, technological tools tend to be \"domesticated\" by practices that resist the transformative affordances of these tools, and may even provide barriers to student engagement and practice. Finally, we conclude the article by making some practical suggestions for creating opportunities for transformative technology use in education. (Contains 3 figures and 2 footnotes.)",

First, in response to the fiscal crises that began in the late 1970s, universities have increasingly turned to the private sector for financial support as federal and state funding has been reduced. Second, universities have become progressively more market-driven, and so, commercialized. In this context, departments in the arts and humanities are often accused of losing their intellectual anchors. Third, students' intentions for the bachelor of arts degree have simultaneously shifted from developing intellectual qualities and a philosophy of life to that of preparing for economic security. As a consequence of the changing definitions of liberal arts education, subjects in the arts and humanities will have to reconsider their missions and curricular practices in order to attract students and remain relevant.

        "description":"This paper tells the story of a researcher's analysis process that became a journey to an unfamiliar place and, ultimately, to a new way of conceiving analysis and a new way of seeing--at least, new to the author as researcher. The study was an analysis of interview data gleaned from a series of conversations about what it is to be a musician. She had interviewed about forty highly accomplished professional musicians inviting them to talk about their musicianship and how they think they learned what they know--from whom, under what circumstances, and at what points in their lives. From transcription and analysis of the transcripts and recordings, a wide range of themes had emerged, reflecting visions of musicianship, the nature of participants' music learning experiences, and insight into their musical lives. In this paper, the author explores one of these themes: the physical nature of musical knowing and experience. She had invited each musician to engage in an open-ended, semi-structured interview lasting two to three hours. Most participants were Western art musicians: (1) performers; (2) conductors; (3) composers; (4) teachers; and (5) scholars. Several were professional jazz musicians. Some of the art musicians also had extensive experience with other genres, often jazz or rock, and in a few cases, non-Western music or American folk music. (Contains 7 footnotes and 1 figure.)",

The study provides a descriptive account of classroom practice in creative arts education through the employment of a quantitative methodology. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to teachers as the sole data collection instrument and analysed to identify innovative classroom practices that anticipate the needs and challenges of creative arts education and the young people it serves. A significant gap in the literature regarding the nature of creative arts education classroom practice was identified. The criticality that such a description of current practice be produced is asserted, with a view towards illuminating current classroom practices and working towards improved models and practices of creative arts education in K-6 classrooms.

        "description":"Engagement has been studied as a multidimensional construct consisting of three subtypes: behavioral, cognitive, and emotional (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004). Among these, behavioral engagement has received the most and emotional engagement, the least attention (Fredricks et al., 2004). The current study thus aimed to examine the relationship between lecturer-student interaction, emotional engagement (specifically affective reactions expressed within the classroom), and academic outcomes (such as, student achievement and learning) in a sample of 140 undergraduate psychology students (M = 24, F = 116). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the experimental conditions (i.e., good vs. poor lecturer-student interaction) and completed the Lecturer-Student Interaction (LSI) questionnaire, Class-related Emotions Questionnaire (CEQ), Perception of Learning (POL) Questionnaire, and two measures of academic achievement. Individuals who shared a good interaction with their lecturer reported higher levels of emotional engagement compared to those who shared poor interactions with their lecturers. In addition, while emotional engagement failed to mediate the pathway between lecturer-student interaction and academic achievement, it was found to partially mediate lecturer-student interaction and student learning. The present findings highlight the significance of emotional engagement in enhancing learning outcomes in students. (Contains 4 figures and 2 tables.)",

Through a UDL lens, learner variability is anticipated and considered as a strength in the instructional planning process. The present study examined the reflective practice of one faculty member as she applied the UDL framework to her graduate class. Study participants were engaged in action research that both explored the faculty's use of the UDL framework to design and deliver an introductory graduate research methods course and, student perspectives of the application of this approach. Both faculty and student responses were favorable towards the implementation of the UDL instructional practice. Results suggest that when faculty use the UDL framework to help design courses, goals are more clearly aligned with instructional practices; there is a positive relationship to student interest and engagement; and students are positively engaged in the course.

        "description":"Misconceptions about psychology are prevalent among introductory students. Just how prevalent and what can be done to change these misconceptions depends on valid methods of assessment. The most common method of assessment, the true/false questionnaire, is problematic. The present study compared true/false with forced choice formats to determine whether the formats give different estimates of student misconceptions. Introductory psychology students (N = 165) answered 39 misconceptions in both the true/false and forced choice formats. Students differed in accuracy when assessed with the different formats, with 33.05% accuracy for true/false and 41.29% accuracy for forced choice. In the analyses of individual items we observed that some items did not differ in level of accuracy across formats and other items did differ. We conclude that the true/false method of assessing misconceptions may overestimate students' level of misconception and recommend continued attention to how researchers assess misconceptions.

All students took the same examination on the material at the end of the course and again 18 months later. There were no differences in the course examination or course grades but grade distributions differed; TBL grades were more widely distributed and female TBL students outperformed male TBL students.

Participants were graduate students (N =16) enrolled in a curriculum and instruction in physical education course at a major university in the southwest United States. The course's service-learning component provided graduate students opportunities to teach physical activity to Hispanic-American and African-American children from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. Participant's described their experiences through weekly reflections and discussions. Content analysis of data sources indicated that participation in the service-learning program strengthened graduate student's efficacy for teaching, contributed to their acquisition of varied teaching strategies, and enhanced graduate students understanding of children living in low-income, minority households. Findings suggest service-learning can be a valuable pedagogy to infuse into graduate teacher education programs. (Contains 2 figures and 1 table.)",

        "description":"The assessment of student learning in general education courses is of critical importance in higher education. This study examines the utility of a writing assignment (application essays) in a basic communication course as an effective assessment tool. The authors conducted a content analysis of student portfolios to determine the extent to which application essays provide evidence of student learning in the basic course. The present study extends the findings from recent assessment efforts (Jones, Simonds, & Hunt, 2005) to explore types of mass media events students address in application essays and assess the revisions made to the assignment based on findings from Jones et al. (2005). Results reveal (a) the various communication events that students write about in application essays, (b) the communication concepts that students address, (c) that students typically, but not always, make appropriate connections when they write application essays, and (d) after revising the assignment based upon data from recent assessment efforts, more students made appropriate connections between the communication event and concept. Implications for classroom pedagogy and course management are discussed. (Contains 5 tables.)",

Naturopathic education has shifted from apprenticeship style with a charismatic teacher, to several private colleges offering advanced diplomas/degrees with Government accreditation, and into the university system. In the university context, reflective practice and scholarship have been key to effective responses to change. These changes include the introduction of new models of technology and delivery, access to greater resources and collegial networks and adoption of innovative teaching approaches; all of which have had a significant impact on a developing pedagogy in naturopathy. Utilising a ethnographic methodology, interviews were conducted with ten naturopathy lecturers to investigate their scholarly reflective approaches to decision making and pedagogy. Some of the changes to academic practice within this context and the innovations arising are discussed. These innovations, whilst increasingly common in higher education, are new pedagogical approaches within the contexts of naturopathy, a discipline that traditionally has sat outside formal learning structures.",

        "description":"Promoting sustainability and dealing with complex environmental problems like climate change demand a citizenry with considerable scientific and quantitative literacy. In particular, students in the STEM disciplines of (biophysical) science, technology, engineering, and mathematics need to develop interdisciplinary skills that help them understand the social dynamics of environmental problems and solutions. To this end, this study examines how participation in a semester-long inquiry-based learning project that involves sociological research on climate change beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors enhances the scientific and quantitative literacies of STEM students. The results suggest that participation in a sociological inquiry-based learning project helps STEM students to (a) improve their knowledge of scientific and statistical principles and processes, (b) hone their scientific research skills, and (c) gain respect for sociology specifically and social science more generally. While the inquiry-based learning project described here deals with climate change, educators can adapt it to deal with other environmental social science research topics (e.g., water use, energy conservation, food security, sustainability).

Teaching self-efficacy, an instructor's belief in his or her ability to teach students in a specific context, can help to predict teaching behavior and student achievement, and can be used as a measure of graduate students' development as instructors. An instrument measuring teaching self-efficacy of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) was developed from a general university faculty teaching instrument to the specific teaching context of STEM GTAs. Construct and face validity, measurement reliability, and factor structure of the instrument were determined from survey data of 253 STEM GTAs at six universities. STEM GTA teaching self-efficacy correlated to various measures of GTA professional development and teaching experience. Implications and applications for faculty involved in GTA professional development, supervision, and research are discussed. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

An important part of that transition has been a growing emphasis on improving program quality. Many communities around the country have begun to create site-level continuous improvement models. Aligned performance measures help program administrators evaluate the quality of young people's experience and give them a framework for improvement. The authors' study looks at how participation in a continuous quality improvement initiative produces higher-quality practice in Rhode Island's afterschool community by fostering change in program management practices. Among other findings, the authors discovered that quality improvement begins with program managers, who then lead the process of change. (Contains 1 figure and 1 note.)",

        "description":"Self-esteem has been problematic for researchers because it is complex, stable, and hard to measure. When assessing the self-esteem of out-of-school time (OST) program participants, some researchers may think their instruments will not detect changes, either because the program does not last long enough to make a difference or because self-esteem is multidimensional and difficult to change. Some may respond to high-stakes testing and the pressure to demonstrate program outcomes by assessing concepts or behaviors with the strongest potential to show change, regardless of how they fit with program objectives. These responses can create a chasm between practitioners and researchers. Practitioners see firsthand that participants change how they feel about themselves, but researchers either have trouble capturing this phenomenon or are substituting other attributes for self-esteem. This article attempts to address these gaps by reviewing research about self-esteem and adolescent girls, presenting findings from a study exploring girls' experiences in a sports-based youth development program, and attempting to engage practitioners and researchers in new conversations about self-esteem and how they assess it.

        "description":"Dramatic changes in the labor market in the United States over the past 50 years have raised tremendous concern that many of the nation's youth are unprepared for the labor force. Policymakers and youth advocates are looking for strategies to improve the education system so that fewer youth drop out of high school and more have the skills and knowledge they need to contribute to the global economy. Initiatives such as Ready by 21 at the Forum for Youth Investment and the Mott Foundation's New Day for Learning highlight the importance of bringing together schools, workforce development programs, and out-of-school time (OST) programs to support youth to be successful in young adulthood. This article draws from several disciplines to integrate what is and is not known about engaging youth in career programming during OST. The authors begin by describing the challenges youth face as they transition into the labor market and the difficulties facing schools and higher education. They then juxtapose research on the potential for OST programs to support career development against evaluation research showing the challenges of changing long-term labor market outcomes. Next, they take a program-level approach to understanding OST career programming. They draw from their own study of 30 OST programs serving primarily low-income middle and high school youth to show the ways OST programs are currently supporting career development. They discuss some of the challenges of career programming and highlight how programs are overcoming these challenges. Their concluding discussion draws both from their own study and from the literature on education, workforce development, and OST programming to show how several OST programs are using scaffolding, in which youth move from lower-level experiences to more challenging ones, to keep youth engaged and progressing.

Programs that fully include children with special needs are less available for school-age children and adolescents than for younger children, and finding appropriate placements for older youth or children with severe disabilities is particularly challenging. Most research on inclusion of children with special needs has centered on preschool childcare programs or school classrooms. In these settings, research has demonstrated positive outcomes for children with and without disabilities. Based on this premise that inclusion is beneficial for children with and without special needs, the authors' study explored the role of OST providers in successfully supporting youth with special needs. Their survey of OST administrators and staff shows that professional development can influence providers' willingness and ability to include children with special needs in their programs.

        "description":"The author is a site manager employed by a small community-based organization (CBO) that provides afterschool programming at a number of school-based sites scattered throughout southern King County in Washington State. As such, he belongs to one-half of the afterschool youth development (AYD) workforce: the (for the most part) full-time, salaried site managers and coordinators who supervise the other half of the AYD workforce--the part-time hourly workers who make up the bulk of front-line staffs. One of his greatest challenges as a site manager has been attracting and retaining part-time staff who can be relied on to deliver the high-quality programming the funders expect and students deserve. He used the opportunity of a long-term action research writing project to climb out of the trenches of direct service, take a good look around at the current landscape, and gather information that might help him address the difficulties he was facing as a site manager. His research has left him with the realization that the high level of turnover typical for part-time AYD workers represents a systemic challenge to the entire field. His interviews with colleagues, combined with a review of published literature on the subject, have generated several recommendations, such as hiring staff already working in the school building, encouraging university teaching programs to include AYD and OST internships as part of their required coursework, and concentrating the scarce professional development resources on full-time staffers rather than part-time workers. The author describes the benefits and challenges of quality staffing and suggests that educators should provide as many training opportunities for front-line workers as time and resources will allow.

        "description":"As framed by national education policy priorities, the dominant metaphor describing participation and achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a &quot;pipeline.&quot; The STEM workforce requires a &quot;pipeline&quot; of future scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. This pipeline begins in childhood and carries students through high school, college, and master's degrees, ending with a doctorate and a career in a STEM discipline. In this metaphor, students have a single path: they must develop an interest in STEM by middle school, choose particular courses in high school, and continue consistently and progressively with STEM study in college in order to end with a degree and career in STEM. The disproportionate exit from participation in STEM by minorities and girls throughout school and college, resulting in their underrepresentation in STEM careers, is referred to as the &quot;leaky pipeline.&quot; Empowering underrepresented groups to pursue STEM interests is less a matter of repairing a &quot;leaky pipeline&quot; than of building pathways for meaningful participation. Moving beyond the pipeline is not only necessary for program design; it is an imperative for educational equity. Changing the metaphor from a pipeline to pathway transforms the purpose of the educational effort: rather than an endeavor in which students' experiences support STEM academic and workforce outcomes, STEM experiences are put to work in the service of youth development.

        "description":"An innovative reading comprehension curriculum that recruits social cognition in the teaching of visualizing, making inferences, and literature concepts was created, thereby achieving the first aim of the research. The Reading Rangers (RR) program was based on three research-based learning principles that were relied on in converting reading comprehension to a social domain. The RR curriculum was designed to capitalize on the social reasoning strengths of low-income children that have been identified in the cognitive-developmental literature. The second research aim entailed implementing this curriculum within a low-income urban school and comparing its effectiveness to an established reading comprehension curriculum already being used in the district. The finding that the Reading Rangers curriculum was more effective than the district program in facilitating students' use/production of strategies is particularly noteworthy, as production is considered a higher-level cognitive skill than recognition. This result is even more striking when considering the short duration of instruction, which was just twelve days. It is encouraging that the Reading Rangers curriculum proved to be effective in teaching reading comprehension strategy use to urban, low-income children. The current findings are consistent with other research that has shown positive effects on learning from educational practices that build upon children's social cognitive strengths. Given the persistence of the income-achievement gap and the preliminary success of this curriculum, building on social cognitive strengths in urban classrooms may be a promising approach for boosting low-income students' reading achievement.",

        "description":"Research shows the strong correlation between expectations and student achievement across different disciplines. However, little research has been conducted regarding the role of discipline specific classroom expectations in student academic achievement. This multiple instrumental case study discusses expectations in two rural Spanish high school classrooms in which teachers produced the highest achieving students. The data was collected through classroom observations, one-on-one audiotaped interviews with teachers and exploration of instructional materials. The study provides insights about the role of expectations in foreign language classrooms and offers examples of foreign language pedagogical practices that reflect high expectations. The study concludes that expectations shape the learning process in Spanish high school classrooms and contribute to high student achievement. Foreign language educators, faculty of teacher preparation programs, employees of professional development institutes, administrators and state teacher education policy makers will benefit from findings of the study by receiving a better understanding of the role of expectations in the foreign language classroom.",

        "description":"This paper reports on the first stage of a meta-study conducted by the authors on primary research published during the last thirty years that focused on discovering the experiences of students learning qualitative research. The authors carried out a meta-analysis of the findings of students' experiences learning qualitative research included in twenty-five published articles. Using constructivist grounded theory to analyze the experience of those seeking to learn qualitative research, including factors that appear to support or interfere with their learning experiences, the authors identified three key dimensions of qualitative research students' learning experiences--affective, cognitive, and experiential. Based on this analysis, the authors developed a grounded theory of qualitative research education. This theory suggests that students' learning experiences will be enhanced through the implementation of an inductive approach to qualitative research education that incorporates experiential learning early in the learning experience. This paper reports these findings, presents this grounded theory of inductive qualitative research education, and discusses the implications of the findings of this meta-analysis for those teaching and researching qualitative research.

        "description":"Distance education is often hailed as the answer to the worlds problems of educational provision particularly in the developing countries of which African governments are no exception. Distance education has been used for both pre-service and in-service education, and at most levels of education. However, other than the structural differences between the distance education system and the conventional educational system, there is an economic dimension too. Claims are made that distance education can improve the access to, and the quality of, educational provision at a lower unit cost. It is in this vein that a case study was undertaken in order to make a comparative analysis of the financial operations of the two education systems--distance education and conventional education--of Nkrumah College of Education of Kabwe, Zambia. The study captured the views and experiences of respondents and analysed numerical figures. In order to achieve the above stated objectives, the sampled respondents and documents were drawn from the two systems of Nkrumah College of Education. Primary information was gathered from the accounting staff and administrators of Nkrumah College of Education, using a self-designed questionnaire and interview schedule. Secondary information was obtained from documentary analysis of the financial records of Nkrumah College of Education. It was found that the unit cost, i.e. cost per graduate was lower in the distance education system than in the conventional education system. With regard to funding of the two systems, this study established that student fees were the sole source of finances for the distance education system whilst the conventional system was financed by various sources other than student fees: grants from the government, private sector/NGOs, international funding agencies, and from sale of materials and services. The study also established that the government did not fund the distance education system at NCE; rather the distance learners financed the entire operations of the distance education system. Arising from the findings of this study, various recommendations have been made, including the need for the government to offer some funding to the distance education system so that student fees may not be beyond the reach of the neediest for whom the distance education system is mainly intended.

        "author":["Dzakiria, Hisham"],
        "description":"Open Distance Learning (ODL) provides learners with the greatest possible control over time, place and pace of education. The educational delivery of ODL has improved greatly over the years with growing number of students continuously enrolling into various ODL programs globally. ODL however does come with issues and problems. Loss of student motivation due to the lack of learning interaction with peers, tutors and computer skills are some possible to ODL. Interaction is a fundamental instructional component to ODL. It is the most challenging element to build into an ODL system and delivery that fit-all-learner needs and requirements. The level of interactivity within the interaction triads from student-to-student, student-to-tutor, and student-to-interface (technology) has a major impact on the quality of ODL programs and its educational experience. Research studies on interactivity show that learners have a real need to make connections with their peers, tutors and the technology use in their pursue for learning, and this research reports similar findings. This article is based on a qualitative research investigating issues of learning interaction in ODL of eight adult learners in the state of Perlis, Malaysia. The study findings supported the widely held belief that a high level of interaction is desirable in ODL environment (Anderson, 2003; Tinto, 2002; Dzakiria, 2008; Dzakiria &amp; Idrus, 2003; Rumble, 2000; Walker, 2002) and positively affects the learning experiences. In order to improve ODL experience, this research suggests that all-important stakeholders in ODL must improve the provision of interaction and interactivity.",

        "description":"Over the past several years, the admissions officer has been confronted with a situation that does not fit into the scheme of his normal operations--namely, the admission of foreign students. Often, because it has not been in the order of things, he has delegated this \"irksome\" problem to some \"lowly\" assistant or to the interested professor who at one time volunteered to assist on the occasional application from abroad. These applications continue to come and will increase in number--perhaps beyond the present expectations. Many administrators and faculty members express affirmative interest in having foreign students simply to provide an international flavor or color to their campuses. In this paper, the author proposes that each college and university undertake a self-evaluation of its resources in order to determine if and how it can educate foreign students. The institution must also decide on the extent of its investment toward international exchange either alone or in cooperation with other institutions. In order to provide a basis for even making this investment, the author will discuss several reasons why foreign students should be accepted and enrolled. By pooling resources and sharing ideas, both locally and nationally, colleges will best be able to initiate and carry out international student programs most appropriate and beneficial to them.",

Some of the most notable trends distinguishing the past from the present are highlighted. Forty-five years ago, Dremuk's article emphasized the importance of institutional commitment to international educational exchange while expressing concerns regarding different dimensions of institutional readiness. Key issues of institutions' ability to recruit, retain and graduate international students persist. In fact, the challenges identified in Dremuk's article have become even more pronounced in this larger context of global competition for international students. The most pressing challenges are: (1) Socioeconomic diversity; (2) Lack of diversity in institutions where international students study; (3) Knowledge base of admission professionals; and (4) Intercultural competence. The changing landscape of international educational exchange calls for US institutions to consider a holistic, strategic approach to international enrollment management. Such an approach includes strategic recruitment, admission, retention, graduation, and reentry of international students.",

        "description":"In this article, the author talks about the cultural bind on the American male. The process starts with conception. If the spermatozoid that fertilizes the egg contains only X chromosomes a girl will be produced. If a single Y chromosome out of the 24 produced by the father is included, the baby will be a boy. From this point on the girls have a pronounced genetic edge on the boys in many ways. Not only is the infant mortality rate higher among boy babies, but the girls will have, in the main, a longer life expectancy. Most of them will survive their husbands. The boys will be sick more frequently and they are prone to many more diseases. On psychological tests, as a group, girls always score higher in the verbal section than do boys; the boys do correspondingly better on the use of mathematical symbols. This is an invariant sex difference. And people must note that college admissions officers invariably give more weight in their indexes to the verbal score when predicting academic achievement in the college program. The author illustrates the \"sex gap\" on college admissions by creating a story, which could be a true one. The author believes that there is enough data to indicate the \"sex-gap\" as a national phenomenon. It is not restricted to any one school district or section of the country. Studies are now in progress which, to date, have maintained the same male-female achievements ratios in college as pertain to high schools.",

        "description":"The development of college admissions requirements during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was basically the story of the admission policies and practices at Harvard College. Candidates for admission were examined on their ability to read and translate Latin and Greek, and a careful check was made of their character and background. With the exception of changes in the content of the subjects required for entrance, requirements for admission to American colleges and universities changed little during the 1800's. Studies conducted during the 1900's revealed that changes in admission requirements were in the direction of greater insistence upon the completion of a four-year high school course and greater flexibility in admission standards. The trend during the 1930's and 1940's was for colleges to accept secondary school graduates on the basis of ability rather than subjects studied. The decade 1949-1959 witnessed an increased interest in standardized examinations sponsored by regional or national associations. The most apparent development in college admissions during the decade of the 60's was the growing emphasis placed upon environmental and nonintellective factors in the admission process. Many colleges became increasingly aware of the need to broaden their view of the admission process in order to ensure that the full range of talent that an institution is capable of developing is properly represented in the student body.",

Now, 40 years and more than 150 articles later, he is grateful to the Editorial Committee for the opportunity to look back. Fortunately, he wrote about the history of college admission requirements, rather than attempting to foretell the future. While examining the past may have been easier than predicting what would lie ahead, he believed then and he believes now that admission counselors benefit from reflecting on their historical roots. An appreciation of how admission practices evolved provides an essential historical context for more properly evaluating contemporary thought and practice (and for better anticipating the future). With so many names, dates and organizations to keep up with, it is understandable why admission counselors sometimes lose their historical perspective. Plus, the press of day-to-day job demands makes it easy for counselors to neglect to take time away from the present to reflect on the past. Nonetheless, it continues to be the author's hope that by better understanding their professional history, admission counselors will be able to chart a clearer course for the future.",

        "author":["Pope, Loren"],
        "description":"The four college years is the last important developmental period of a young person's life, and what happens then can and often does have substantial consequences. He can be awakened and fired up to develop himself and his talents, he can plod through largely untouched or unenlightened, he can be frustrated and turned off, he can transfer, or he can drop out. What happens to the majority is one of the last three. Aside from acquiring the credentials, the place where a person goes to college can make a vast difference in his life. A college education is also the most expensive product--aside from a house--that a parent can buy. How do intelligent students and their parents arrive at their decisions in making this costly and important purchase? Do they do some probing consumer research? Do they sample and test the merchandise? No. And unfortunately there is no Ralph Nader; indeed there is no consumer research available to the public in this vital field. There is much objective data in directories, but few guiding clues to reveal the hundreds of obvious or subtle differences in ambience, values, or character among colleges of the same level. For the parents or the student to fill the information credibility gap themselves would require more time and work than they could reasonably afford. The result is that the American family relies chiefly on the pig-in-a-poke plan of college selection, which is based on twenty myths that profoundly influence millions of college choices. On the whole, it is such bad consumerism that fewer than 40 percent of this fall's freshman class will still be in the same colleges on cap-and-gown day four years hence. These myths constitute a body of dogma accepted as gospel by the able and the mediocre student alike. This article discusses these myths, along with the reality on each, and offers some tips at the end on how not to let them jinx one's college choice.",

At that time, a college education was considered expensive, yet as is true now, education was seen as the doorway to economic opportunity. One perceptive observer of those times was Loren Pope, already an icon in college admission, who would later become the author of \"Colleges That Change Lives.\" It was in this climate that Pope wrote an insightful article for the Journal, \"20 Myths That Can Jinx Your College Choice.\" In his critique he addressed what he believed were the great untruths or exaggerations of his era. In some of his analysis, he was ahead of his time, in some he was off target, as he could never have foreseen the path college admission would follow. Pope dedicated his life to empowering students, parents and professionals. He believed college, in America, is the great equalizer. He embraced such themes as, \"One size cannot fit all\" students and that there is room for both the big and small schools. During his lifetime Loren Pope influenced not just a generation of guidance counselors and admission professionals; he made a difference.",

        "author":["Haines, Richard W."],
        "description":"Your name: F. Stanley Gogettum. Your job: Director of Admissions. Your institution: floundering University. Like all good admissions directors, you constantly ask yourself about your work and its effectiveness. Should you continue high school visits? Should you use Student Search Service, or maybe an unscreened (but perhaps cheaper) &quot;commercial&quot; mailing list? What about &quot;merit&quot; scholarships, as opposed to those based on financial need? What about &quot;you&quot;--might your president consider replacing you with an &quot;admissions takeover&quot; company? Are your recruitment techniques perceived by others as ethical and professional? What do your colleagues at other institutions think about some of the things you do? What do secondary school counselors think? In one state, Pennsylvania, some answers are not necessarily valid for other states, but they may be instructive to admissions officers everywhere. They derive from a Recruitment Practices Survey conducted by the Admissions Practices and Procedures (AP&amp;P) Committee of the Pennsylvania ACAC in the spring of 1974. The Recruitment Practices Survey was an extensive questionnaire sent to all PACAC member institutions. Its purpose was to elicit reactions of member professionals to various college recruitment techniques. Each institution (secondary school or college/university) was asked to indicate the degree to which its guidance or admissions staff approved of sixty-four different recruitment techniques. This article provides some interesting and useful answers which can help guide the admissions officer in his day-to-day work, and in his efforts to influence recruitment policy development within his institution.",

        "description":"What the author found most surprising about Richard Haines' survey on 1974 recruitment practices was that the major issues are still relevant. His main points about recruitment, college and counselor interaction, and the need for better information still resonate as the profession consistently calls for clarity and transparency in the college admission process. The recruitment questions of \"Does it work?\" and \"Does it matter?\" posed 37 years ago still resound, as recruitment professionals constantly strive to meet institutional expectations and priorities while performing a meaningful service to students and families. These constant pressures, and the need to allow professional ethics to guide one's actions, have led to the complete overhaul of the Statement of Principles of Good Practice (SPGP). While the SPGP has dramatically changed, the need for ethics has not. The spirited discussions between high schools and colleges are a practice that remains as compelling and energizing in 1974 as it does in 2012. Indeed, the nature of that discussion defines NACAC's distinction as the network of professionals to best serve students and families.",

But they do not like to think of themselves as businessmen, concerned with selling, and few of them indeed have thought directly and hard about the ethical constraints on marketing in higher education; that is, about marketing ethics. In this article, the author wants to discuss a series of ethical problems in marketing higher education that are less obvious but no less real and perhaps more compelling. The author believes that the reputation of higher education, damaged as it is by the turmoil of the past decade, the erosion of standards, and the rise of a faculty unionism that places the teaching of classes about third--behind economic self-interest and personal self dramatization--is based precisely on the assumption that academics maintain high standards and maintain principles even when it may be inconvenient to do so. If teachers and administrators abandon the principles of academic integrity--without a public declaration announcing the fact--they shall be engaging in a very serious piece of marketing fraud. They shall certainly be found out at length, and they may expect that retribution will follow, partially in the form of boycott and partially in the form of control. Both are in the air even now: they have had their warning.",

        "description":"This article is a response to John Silber's article, \"Marketing Higher Education: The Survival Value of Integrity.\" Silber speaks to the very heart of the academy about its integrity and ethics, and does so in timeless fashion through the decades to the current era. In his introduction, he characterizes the \"business of education\" as inevitable and necessary in spite of how the academy decries terms, such as \"sales\" and \"marketing.\" Using the vehicle of the admission office, Silber tackles everything from privilege to open admission and gives more than a little ink to the consequences of offering admission to \"those who are almost certain to end in utter failure.\" He warns of the \"cultural drift of the age\" wherein higher education was being renamed as \"postsecondary\" education: an era marked by what he saw as the watering down of the curriculum in some of America's best and most emulated universities. Perhaps the issues and rancor surrounding the rankings publications of this age are symptomatic of the \"cultural drift\" Silber decries. Silber had strong opinions about the issues of his day, surrounding what he saw as the erosion of standards in the curriculum, the oversimplification of admission standards without understanding the importance of true preparation for higher education, and the rise of economic self-interest in both institutions and faculty. Perhaps one should hark back to Silber's advice in what some might see as an unusual spate of optimism from this outspoken critic of and advocate for higher education. If academics maintain their integrity, they shall have grounds for optimism that they will weather the storms of criticism and the fierceness of scrutiny that seem to define this age.",

        "description":"The young people who are coming into school are not lacking in intelligence, are not lacking in intellectual capability, but are lacking in the capability of paying attention, and the capability of reading. And to a large degree, they are inadequately taught because in many instances they are taught by teachers who themselves leave much to be desired. Undoubtedly, somebody from the teaching profession is going to say, &quot;What a terrible way to talk! There are a lot of very good teachers out there who are dedicated and committed to teaching, and are par excellence.&quot; And the author says, &quot;Hurray!&quot; But he wants to add that he thinks they are the problem to a large degree. It seems to him that the good teachers ought to be invading the professional organizations and making sure those professional organizations do not become agencies that protect incompetence. When he looks at the Teachers Unions of the United States, the author sees union after union that is protecting incompetent teachers. He doesn't think tenure should protect some people who shouldn't be protected. There's another thing. This is an age in which commitment has died. The author happens to be one who believes in commitment to a large degree and he worries about a society that is devoid of commitment. It is about time that admissions counselors challenge their faculty. The real challenge of the teaching profession is not to take a kid with an IQ of 150 and a College Board score and verbal of 750 and tell him that he can be a genius. The challenge is taking a student with 450 College Boards and making him believe that he can be a scholar, that he can be a first-rate student, and that he can achieve and be somebody. These are challenging days requiring a new kind of education relevant to the needs of these pressing years, and requiring a new kind of educator who is willing to accept the challenge of average students who want to do great things. This is a period when people have to be taught to love beyond the level of romanticism and understand the nature of commitment to higher values, to lofty goals from whence comes identity, purpose, and meaning. It is almost too great a task, but unfortunately it is a task that no one can avoid.",

Today that certainty is greatly diminished and many young people are asking whether or not a college education is a good investment of time and money. The author senses a hunger among young people for a politics of hope and a growing desire to make their lives count for something good in the world. Teaching at an Evangelical school, the author senses that there are more and more students who are questioning the goals prescribed by a consumeristic culture and aspiring to careers that are marked by altruism. As he visits secular campuses, he finds the same kind of altruistic enthusiasm. Students are spending spring breaks in community service projects, such as building houses for the poor with Habitat for Humanity. This growing commitment to service has become so noticeable that many college admission counselors are learning that recruiting students by telling them about their school's involvement in community service programs is a must. These developments should be inspiring for educators to make teaching more than just vocational training to enable students to get the credentials for climbing the ladder of socioeconomic success. Their mission--should they choose to accept it--is to define for a new generation that hungers for meaning how education can enable them to do with their lives that which provides lasting significance.",

        "description":"Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans are entitled to equal access to all institutions of higher education. Ensuring greater access and participation by minorities in higher education is one of the most practical ways of moving America closer to the ideal of equal opportunity, which is the actualization of the American dream. American higher education can play a more active role in making this ideal a reality. Now is the time for all institutions of higher learning to prepare, implement, and improve plans to more effectively educate, and not simply school, increasing numbers of minority students. As the gatekeepers of American higher education, the members of NACAC are ideally positioned to help meet the challenge related to achieving equity with excellence. As individuals, NACAC members control recruitment and exercise influence on retention and graduation of minority students. Both individually and collectively, members can strengthen their roles in these areas by establishing and supporting strategies that have proven to be effective and to enhance academic quality for minority students. To meet this challenge, four objectives must be reached. First, it is essential that college admission counselors improve their lines of communication with high school students, parents, counselors, and teachers. A second objective that must be met if institutions are to produce more minority college graduates is that admission standards must be broadened. The third objective that must be met to improve minority participation in higher education relates to testing. Finally, the minority communities must accept responsibility for ensuring that more students are taught the discipline and self-sacrifice that is instrumental in achieving personal success.",

        "description":"This paper is a response to Steven R. Antonoff's article, \"Educational Consulting: A Focus for the Profession.\" More than 20 years ago, when this article first appeared in \"The Journal of College Admission,\" \"for profit counselors\" (as they were then called by NACAC) were not welcome partners. It was acceptable practice to publicly denigrate the motivation, training and ethics of such independent practitioners publicly at conferences, and deny them the ability to hold leadership positions in many regional associations for college admission counseling (ACACs). In that context, Antonoff's 1989 article was a genuine breakthrough, as NACAC's decision to publish the piece provided a first bit of legitimacy to the new profession. Reading the article, it is clear that Antonoff understood the importance of his writing and spoke directly to the question of legitimacy. He felt the need, for example, to explain his motivation for entering the field. He stated outright that he did not seek to undermine the work of school-based counselors, even writing that he decried \"scapegoating and name calling.\" The balance of the article was dedicated to further justification: describing his role, denying accusations that independent educational consultants (IECs) were \"packaging\" students, and combating the perception that independent educational consultants were making a killing while those employed by schools questioned why anyone deserved to \"be paid--for what they did for free.\" Today, IECs are more fully integrated into the college advising process. In recent years, IECs have headed many regional ACACs and it is now typical to find them on NACAC boards, committees and task forces. Today, independent educational consultants are developing unique specialties that make them increasingly vital to students, families and schools. In just 20 short years, the practice of independent educational consulting has moved from one of requisite justification to full partnership. Students are the beneficiaries of that change, and great college matches are the result.",

        "description":"College and university quality--what it is and how to identify it--is a preoccupation of many prospective college students and their parents, high school counselors, and college admission personnel. Regardless of class, race, and gender, it is no longer enough for a growing number of individuals simply to attend college: matriculating at an institution of unmistakable quality is the over arching concern. In response to this concern, and in the absence of more concrete indicators, a body of folklore or conventional wisdom has evolved about how to identify \"quality\" colleges. This folklore has been shaped by many sources: the lay public, the media, counselors and college admission personnel, college and university faculty, and leading graduate schools. The folklore about institutional quality has assuaged the need for understanding in the absence of more authoritative information. Yet, a growing body of scholarship and research on college quality, much of it published in the past 10 years, raises some serious questions about the adequacy of conventional wisdom. Drawing upon this literature, the aim of this article is to examine the folklore, reveal some of its limitations, and suggest a framework for assessing college quality that may help counselors, students, and parents make more informed explorations of prospective colleges and universities.",

        "description":"This paper is a response to Clinton F. Conrad's article, \"Beyond the Folklore.\" Conrad's strategy for assessing undergraduate quality echoes the sentiments espoused by many admission and college counseling professionals over the years at various workshops for students and families that focus on navigating the process. As transcendent as the components of the strategy are, in today's complex admission landscape, they are tested by a number of external factors that emerged since that time. As the author began to think about Conrad's piece, he remembers one morning this past summer when they welcomed scores of visitors for their information sessions and campus tours. The majority of those students were rising seniors, many of whom had started their college search in earnest several months before in the winter of their junior year. While these families may have acquired a working knowledge of the college selection process during that period based upon their visits and prior connections and meetings with counselors, how many of them took the time to engage in such a methodical approach that Conrad suggests? Or, do they continue to rely on folklore, prestige, reputation, rankings, etc.? The past two years, the author had the privilege of chairing the NACAC/\"U.S. News & World Report\" Ad Hoc Committee. They specifically engaged with members of \"U.S. News & World Report\" on issues of methodology, the rankings' influence on families and the effects on best practices among colleges and universities. Part of the recommendations highlighted focusing methodology on more value-added, personalized weights centered around outcomes and student satisfaction and engagement. This approach could be applied according to Conrad's strategy for assessing undergraduate quality. However, one omission is the lack of consideration on the transcendent issue of access to need- and merit-based funding. Certainly since 1989, the rising costs of higher education may have been reflected in a more recent version of Conrad's strategy.",

He argues that Clinton's engrossing account of the 1990-91 school year at Cairo American College (CAC) gives individuals wonderful insights into the unusual challenges occasionally encountered by an international counselor. The year did not start well. Saddam Hussein and Iraq had invaded Kuwait, an American ally, and the US was weighing its options, both politically and militarily. Clinton returned to CAC to greet a group of seniors almost twice as big as the previous year, a situation not unusual at an international school where enrollment can fluctuate sharply as companies and governments change their policies. However, Cairo is a long way from Bagdad, as Clinton reminded prospective college visitors worried about venturing into the Middle East at such a volatile time. The first big change at CAC involved admitting students fleeing from schools in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, including 11 seniors, some of who had no school records with them. Clinton worried about these kids and how he could help them find colleges, even as they worried about their homes and parents. CAC agreed that admitting these students was the right thing to do. Over the years, guidance counselors in the US have asked the author about international jobs, usually operating on the assumption that such a job would be an easy way to wind down a counseling career. Clinton's article demonstrates exactly why this is not always the case.",

More than one hundred and thirty-six universities have developed computerized applications on their own or through a commercial vendor. Universities developed computerized applications in order to provide better services to applicants, to beat their competition, and to save money. The savings from not having to employ clerical workers to input data have been substantial. More importantly, applicants love computerized applications. The feedback which universities that presently use the computerized application have received has been very positive; and in many cases, has helped them against competition by making the process easier. A trend that will definitely facilitate applying is the commoditization of the application process through computerized applications. Since students are filling out the same symbolic information all the time (name, address, social security, etc.), they could clearly send this information to more than one university. This trend will make the application process easier for students, but it will make it harder for universities to convey their uniqueness. Computers and digital communication will have as large an impact on the information culture of the future as automobiles had on the industrial culture of the twentieth century.

No longer are the days of 10 people crammed into an office built for one person, looking at a screen with a green blinking key, typing in thousands of characters an hour. Rows and rows of filing cabinets have been reduced, and putting students on hold to go look up test scores is less obnoxious. From an admission recruitment point of view, the change has also been drastic, but in a different sort of way. There is a greater demand from students to have access to information in different formats, causing colleges to not only keep their traditional recruitment methods but add a multitude of continually evolving digital services. Colleges still rely heavily on print publications, while adding more and more interactive services. While print is still a major component, digital recruitment has added a whole new dimension to and demand on college admission offices. Digital recruitment has evolved past email and Web sites. Those are considered traditional recruitment methods these days. Computers continue to evolve and so does digital recruitment.

Thresher's work, relevant to this day, is credited with being the foundational document of the admission profession. McDonough and Robertson's 1995 study, commissioned by NACAC, traces the rise of the profession that Thresher is credited with creating. Like Thresher, the social and educational values that are the underpinnings of college admission inform the analysis and provide a productive backdrop against which to identify a profession grappling with growth and change. In their study, one finds that a profession of full-time administrators with distinctive responsibilities has risen from a part-time faculty or registrar's role. McDonough and Robertson document what so many of today's admission professionals feel, from the counselor to the dean; namely, their movement as professionals from educator to marketer. They called for a reasonable and practical change by proposing a hybrid--a blended position of marketer and educator. What was their justification? They saw that the dearth of college counseling in America's high schools meant that students must rely on the college admission staff above others for the critical information about transition from high school to college.",

        "author":["Flint, Thomas A."],
        "description":"Thirty years after the creation of federal student financial aid programs through the Higher Education Act of 1965, the link between moral character and student financial aid programs is once again influencing the public policy debate. A careful look at the debate, though, shows that the nature of concerns has shifted. In the past, the question was, &quot;What good character in students is needed for receiving financial aid?&quot; Today, the question is increasingly becoming, &quot;Is receiving financial aid good for students' character?&quot; According to the author, the answer to that question is yes. Almost without qualification, financial aid has been shown time and again to be accomplishing most policy objectives the programs were designed to achieve. The arguments and concerns about the moral impact of student aid awards made by liberals and conservatives alike are burdened by many myths. What then should one conclude about the relationship of moral character and student aid? Need-based programs of federal student aid have operated over many decades with little evidence of having evolved into a dysfunctional system of perverse rewards. The current preoccupation with the question, &quot;Is receiving financial aid good for students' character?&quot; thus seems largely to be an ill-founded concern. Moreover, questions and arguments of this nature, whether from liberal or conservative viewpoints, detract attention from other moral considerations such as the question, &quot;Is college itself good for students?&quot; (Contains 12 endnotes.)",

        "description":"America's moral compass guiding student aid policy is being co-opted by short-sighted, budget-cutting and deficit-reduction policies. This moral compass was threatened, but had &quot;not altogether disappeared&quot; by 1996, according to an article written that year by Thomas A. Flint, then-vice president for financial services at Robert Morris College (IL). The article documents a shift in student aid policy from the original goal of providing equal opportunity to other priorities, such as enforcing loyalty to the US (and rejecting Communism during the Cold War era), Selective Service registration and the war against drugs. In these times of austerity, student aid programs have become an irresistible temptation for lawmakers to raid. In 2011, Congress provided more than $46 billion primarily to cover increasing participation in the Pell Grant program. While this is only 1.2 percent of the $3.8 trillion federal budget, it is tempting for lawmakers to cut. Flint predicted that this would become an issue. The current political and fiscal environment continues to leave little room for important discussions about the merits and morality of federal student aid. The trend that Flint warned of has intensified to the point that almost all student aid policy debate focuses on how the nation can trim student aid spending to bring the federal budget into alignment. When student aid policy is governed by the budget, it is treated as an expense and not a public investment, eluding the nation's moral compass. Americans must recognize that every dollar spent on education is more than just a line item on a federal expense statement--it's an investment in the nation's future success and prosperity.",

        "description":"When addressing the best ways to utilize high school visits, education professionals must remember that while student academic preparation, family support and financial aid improve student access to postsecondary education, the adult tutelage provided to students, regarding the requirements for postsecondary success and the process of securing admission, and financial aid, significantly add to the likelihood that students will attend a postsecondary institution (King, 1996; Adelman, 1999; McDonough, 1997 and 2004; Orfield and Paul, 1993; Plank and Jordan, 2001). No adults are greater experts than the high school counselor and college admission officer, especially when they work in conjunction. This article examines four primary areas where increased interaction between college admission officers and high school counselors could translate into student success: (1) alleviating the shortage of college counseling staff for students in high-need high schools; (2) increasing the amount of time-on-task dedicated to college counseling; (3) providing professional development to high school counselors responsible for college counseling; and (4) conveying financial aid information to high school counselors, students and families.

        "description":"NACAC's anniversary is a great time to follow up on an article on high school visits, a topic of ongoing discussion in every admission and guidance office. The article highlights a variety of potential good outcomes that can be derived from collaborative interactions. Sadly, however, admission representatives are apt to be described by the guidance counselors that suffer them more like pharmaceutical reps than educational partners, while colleges and universities find weak, if any, return on often large investments. While the article focuses on a series of things individuals can do to make visits better (arrive on time, be respectful of each other... good advice in any setting), there are some additional things to consider to get the most out of the mutual investment in these efforts. The three most important things are training, training and training. Road runners need to be prepared to answer the real questions from guidance counselors, not mistaking this as reciting every major offered or listing the 25-75 percentile SAT range and faculty-to-student ratio. The most successful visit programs are complemented by strong communication campaigns, students and counselors receiving substantive and supportive messages, both postal and electronic, before and after visits. The burden of making high school visits worthwhile is shared by guidance professionals and college representatives, but those in higher education should take on the bulk of the responsibility.",

        "description":"A training module of six sessions was designed for professors in higher education who were transitioning to teaching synchronous, e-learning courses from formerly teaching in either asynchronous courses or in face-to-face courses. Since the participants were experienced educators, the boundary of their expertise to be extended was moving to the fully synchronous e-learning setting. All of the professors were already familiar with their institution's asynchronous learning management system and some were familiar with asynchronous courses with synchronous elements. This research follows the professors through the transition to fully synchronous classes, documenting the challenges and lessons learned in this journey through observations of the training, individual interviews and one focus group. One year after teaching their first synchronous, e-learning course(s), their reflections on the training provide some insights into the kinds of changes the professors experienced as they extended the boundaries of their teaching and learning environments and entered new territory. One finding of the study is that more explicit discussion of theoretical underpinnings of e-learning, such as technology abilities, affordances and constraints, and transformative-pedagogies, might have helped the professors navigate this transition more easily.",

        "description":"It is generally accepted that Canadian postsecondary education enjoys an international reputation for quality. However, Canada does not have an accepted, national framework to understand, measure, or clearly define the actual quality of the postsecondary education sector. In this, Canada is seen as unique when compared with other developed countries. Canada has 13 educational jurisdictions (provinces and territories), each with different institutions, and institutional mandates and missions. One of the results of this structure is that agreement on how to conceptualize and assess quality across the Canadian postsecondary education sector becomes a complex challenge. A single approach may not be acceptable, or appropriate, if applied on a national level. As education is a provincial responsibility with federal &quot;transfer funding&quot;, consideration in this article will be mainly on the Ontario situation. The system for post-secondary education in Ontario consists of three main types of institutions: universities, publicly assisted colleges, and private career colleges. In Ontario, the provincial government has articulated its priorities for postsecondary education as being: Accountability, Accessibility and Quality. In terms of quality the challenges and issues are complex. The fact that the concept of quality is hard to define, and therefore hard to measure, simply adds to the complexity of the challenges. The purpose of this article is to describe how the public college sector is moving forward to address the quality assurance issue within its institutions. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"To build postsecondary institutions that educate responsible citizens as well as competent employees and consumers, it is important that people must teach and learn themselves about the context--domestic and global--in which work is to be done, and the purposes which economic and technological development serve. One aspect of that context is the tremendous human cost of modern prosperity. A moral inquiry into human suffering is surely at least as important as the passing on of the technical skills needed to keep the machinery in motion. A significant historical example concerns the 10 million inhabitants of the Congo Free State who paid the price for King Leopold II's greed and brutality when he opportunistically forced them into slave labour to extract sap from rubber trees to sell to the embryonic automobile industry in the 1890s. Today, externalization of costs insidiously hides cheap labour, unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, destruction of the environment and ubiquitous toxins which have worked their way up to the top of the food chain in mother's milk. Shockingly, human life has become an externalized cost as a direct consequence of the unsustainable lifestyle of people in North America. Literally millions of people have died or been injured as a result of their extravagant lifestyle which, for example, requires enormous quantities of fossil fuels for transportation and the manufacture of consumer or capital products. Paradoxically, due to their consumption habits and lifestyle, they are assigning a value to human life which can be calculated by dividing the resulting excessive purchases germane to perpetual unsustainable growth divided by the number of casualties who have become victims of the American pursuit of economic advantages. Human life has no price. It is alarming that it is held in such low regard, and it is unconscionable that people in North America pay so little attention to their own culpability in social injustice at home and abroad.",

The findings show that the collegial behavior of enrollment professionals has diminished in conjunction with public funding and increased competition for student tuition revenue. Implications of this study provide that resource dependence is capable of changing the collegial behavior of enrollment professionals and the perception of our field. Traditionally, academic consortia were established as associations that promoted the sharing of ideas and resources between universities in a manner that warranted collegiality. While most of academic consortia fostered teaching and research, few concentrated specifically on recruitment and enrollment strategies. Recently, the utility of consortia has evolved to serve a broader range of university interests. Culminated by funding deficits and increased competition for student tuition revenue, admission consortium networks are germinating from the traditional academic consortium design. Set forth by university presidents and provosts from various athletic conferences, admission consortia are led by enrollment experts who center focus on strategic enrollment planning. Intercollegiate collaboration is expected from all members despite external pressures in the form of market forces that have the potential to complicate collegial intentions. Admission consortium members in this study find themselves disjointed between a collegial higher education culture and protecting key elements of their recruitment, enrollment and retention operations.",

        "author":["Gieser, James D."],
        "description":"The fiscal climate for institutions of higher education has changed dramatically in recent decades. Public and private colleges and universities have felt the squeeze of the economic downturn while many public institutions have experienced regular and significant declines in state appropriations. At the same time, families are being asked to pay more for their students' education. In this climate many colleges and universities, particularly state institutions, have begun to shift from a low-tuition, low-aid model to a high-tuition, high-aid model. This shift means that colleges and universities are awarding more and more aid based on merit rather than need. There is growing concern amongst educational leaders that these developments are making it more and more difficult for needy students to afford a college education. What impact do these developments have on the ideals of access and equity upheld by many educators and academic leaders in higher education? Will these rising pressures limit efforts to effectively serve the traditionally underserved? This article explores these issues and provides a critique based on the theoretical work of Pierre Bourdieu. It concludes with a series of implications for institutional leaders and enrollment managers interested in pursuing goals of social justice and access in an increasingly fiscally-tight environment.",

GPAs are used for acknowledgement and awards, as partial evidence for admission to other institutions (colleges and universities), and for awarding scholarships. Given the high stakes nature of the GPA as a tool to compare and rank overall student proficiency and potential, it is important that it be appropriately scaled. In this study, results from a re-scaled GPA reflect a true (proportional) interval scale and are compared to the traditional (ordinal) GPAs for various student groups thereby demonstrating that differential effects for critical populations are absent so that equality opportunity is maintained.

The final sample included 283 admitted minority students from eight CCCU member institutions that participated in the ASQ PLUS survey between the years 2005 and 2010. The results from Chi-Square and t-Tests revealed that race, parents' income, high school GPA, institution's distance from home, financial aid awards (i.e., grants and loans), institutional recruitment strategies (i.e., campus interaction, electronic communication and Web site), and perceived institutional characteristics (i.e., extracurricular activities, recreational facilities, academic facilities, availability of majors, and academic reputation) were significantly related to minority students' decision to enroll at a CCCU member institution. However, in the final logistic regression, only high school GPA, campus interaction and promotional materials remained significant. The findings of this study can potentially aid CCCU member institutions to improve their marketing strategies and eliminate the barriers in the enrollment process to better recruit and serve racially diverse students.

Yet, objective evidence supporting the effectiveness of coaching for college preparatory tests, including the ACT, is virtually nonexistent. This study investigated the effectiveness of a four-week, 20-hour ACT coaching class offered at a large Midwestern high school. The results of this study show that students who participated in the coaching class increased their composite ACT score by 1.5 points over their previous highest ACT composite score. A comparable group at the same high school who did not participate in the coaching achieved an increase of 0.65 points, indicating an effect of coaching of 0.85 points. (Contains 5 tables.)",

It demands information about your family, your finances, your interests, and your desires. For lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) applicants in their teenage years who may not be comfortable with their sexuality, admission officers need be sensitive to a key difference that can make their circumstances especially complex. That difference: in most cases, an LGBT applicant does not have LGBT parents, and his or her parents may or may not know or approve of their child's sexuality. Further, the applicant may not be &quot;out&quot; to anyone yet or perhaps even ready to acknowledge LGBT orientation. This article highlights five cases from my experience coordinating LGBT recruitment at Tufts University (MA). The names and some details are modified to protect the individuals' privacy.

The open and axial coding techniques and the process of theoretical sampling are discussed at length. Our investigation reveals the recurrence of several factors earlier studied in previous models such as cultural novelty, family and peer support, the organization's support and the spouse's personality. Additionally, we found that the Indian spouses' adjustment to expatriate assignments was influenced greatly by their perceived gender-role ideology and their marital obligations to their partners. The resulting extended model of spousal adjustment to expatriate adjustments may help management practitioners to enhance expatriate success in global assignments.

        "description":"Healthcare organizations are striving to meet legislated and public expectations to include patients as equal partners in their care, and research is needed to guide successful implementation and outcomes. The current research examined the meaning of customer service as related to the culture of care relationships within a Canadian hospital in southeastern Ontario. The goals were to better understand these expectations, develop shared meanings and influence cultural change from the perspective of the organization's employees about their interactions with patients, families and work colleagues, and to generate ideas and groundswell for change. An ethnographic approach within the critical research paradigm was used over the course of a three phase study, where direct care healthcare providers (Phase 1), mid-level leaders (Phase 2) and senior leaders (Phase 3) volunteered to explore their values, philosophies and suggestions for change in the organization's care relationships. This paper describes Phase 2 of the overall research project. A mixed methodology was used where mid-level leaders were individually surveyed and then participated in a focus group and/or interview to discuss these concepts. Mid-level leaders indicated that providing excellent customer service was important in their own work with many customers including staff, patients and their families, students, volunteers and outside agencies. They believed that this in turn led to improved partnerships for care, health service transitions and linkages, customer satisfaction and health outcomes. The majority stated that the organization's culture would support change related to customer service relationships and opportunities for this were explored. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Women were chosen from a pool of participants in an Upward Bound program designed to assist low-income and/or first-generation college students in the Midwestern United States. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to retrospectively explore their lived experiences. Recurring themes included facilitators of change, specifically the people, including mental health professionals, family members, romantic partners, and friends who helped make change possible. Another frequent theme found in the research was the impact an education had on the participants. Finally, the participants shared their own insights related to the stigma of poverty and their diverse experiences in transitioning away from poverty. Research findings could prove beneficial to social service professionals interested in understanding the complex realities of resilient, impoverished women. (Contains 1 table.)",

Women living with HIV or AIDS often face complex social problems that may inhibit them from accessing resources and healthcare services to assist them in coping with the disease. In-depth interviews and direct observations utilizing open-ended note taking were conducted at an HIV service provider's office to determine the unique needs that develop because of these complex social issues, specifically among HIV positive women of color in Washington, DC. Ethnographic methods were used to address the study's research questions among 10 women of different ages and backgrounds in group settings at a non-profit organization in Washington, DC. The qualitative results of the study indicate that the women dealt with a myriad of social and mental issues related to their diagnosis, such as fear of disclosure to family and friends. The study also revealed that the women were in dire need of mental health services to address their unresolved issues regarding their diagnosis. The implications of this research add to the growing body of literature on the mental and social health needs of women of color who are HIV positive.",

The goal of this paper is to offer an overview of the various theoretical and methodological approaches to the researcher-participant relationship in qualitative research. The author will first explore how traditional qualitative and emancipatory feminist research have addressed this issue, then she will investigate how poststructural feminists such as Butler (1992), Lather (1991), Pillow (2003), St. Pierre (2000), and Spivak (1993), as well as Wisweswaran (1994), mainly through the use of the notion of subjectivity and voice, stepped into the debate and explored the researcher-participant relationship from a poststructuralist perspective.",

In this article, I will provide a description and discussion of the organization, categorization, and analysis of in-depth interviews in a recent study of women who sexually abused children. The study revealed common experiences of sexual and other abuse in the women's childhood and adult relationships. These experiences created vulnerabilities that appeared to play a significant role in the women's offenses. Although abused women rarely abuse others, the findings suggest that supporting and providing therapy to victims of abuse might minimize the potential for such outcomes.",

The purpose of this study was to describe the nature of collaborative working in two cases of school-based occupational therapy service delivery. This paper reports a cross-case analysis, comparing findings about the nature of a joint effort in each case study to identify workplace practices that facilitated educator-occupational therapist collaboration. Ethnographic case study methods (Stake, 1995; Wolcott, 2008) and socio-cultural activity theory (SCAT; Engestrom, 2001) were used to examine multiple perspectives concerning school-based occupational therapy collaborative consultation for two students with developmental disability in one region of Ontario, Canada. Cross-case analysis (Stake, 2006) facilitated examination of the similarities and differences in teamwork. Specific ways that educator-occupational therapist collaboration can be facilitated were identified in three areas: (a) focus for educational programming; (b) communication practices; and (c) leadership practices of educators. SCAT provided a robust framework for describing the depth, quality, and context of interactions from multiple stakeholder perspectives. As such, this research contributes to the development of theoretical and empirical perspectives on the processes of collaborative working and the relationship of these processes to outcomes.

        "description":"Within the last decade, bricolage, as an approach to qualitative inquiry, has gained popularity in academic circles. However, while conceptual and concrete precedents exist, the approach has remained relatively misunderstood, and unpopular, in broader research communities. This may be because the complexity of the approach has stymied widespread discussions and commentary. This article means to address this concern by providing a thick, yet accessible, introduction to bricolage as an approach to qualitative inquiry. While researchers and scholars have conceptualized bricolage, few have attempted to provide an overview of how the concept emerged in relation to qualitative research. Further, while the literature on bricolage offers invaluable conceptual insights, lacking is a survey that provides clear examples of how bricolage has been implemented in research contexts. Therefore, while greatest attention in this article is devoted to contextualizing bricolage and introducing influential theorists, it also provides key examples of research that adopts the bricolage approach. In drawing on a plurality of sources, the article provides a thick discussion of the complex bricolage project; one that can be beneficial to both novice and seasoned researchers who pursue alternative methodological approaches.",

        "description":"This study examines the allocation of novice primary teachers in Chilean schools, looking at their characteristics and at the attributes of the schools at which they are hired after having completed their initial teacher training. The study reveals that in Chile, more qualified novice teachers are more prone to get jobs in socio-economically advantaged schools or in schools with better academic outcomes. In contrast, in disadvantaged schools, it is more likely to find novice teachers with poor results on their exit exams and who come from socioeconomic backgrounds similar to those of the school populations. These findings provide new data to inform Chilean policies. Thus, achieving a more equitable distribution of highly qualified teachers is a challenge for Chile if the aim is to reduce the achievement gap between schools attended by pupils of higher and lower socioeconomic status. Furthermore, these findings might shed some light on the current debate surrounding teacher education policies. A new law will mandate that novice teachers pass the exit exam that until now they have taken voluntarily in order to be hired in any publicly funded school. This study provides support and evidence to inform the debate that will follow in parliament, since we found that novice teachers performing at a very low level--perhaps below the minimum that will be required--have a high probability of ending up working in schools in more disadvantaged areas. On a more general scale, this research also provides a simple but complete methodology that can be used to study issues of teacher distribution elsewhere. (Contains 6 tables and 20 footnotes.)",

By contrast, charter schools are predicted to have leaner administration and allocate resources more intensively to instruction. This study analyzes resource allocation in charter and district schools in Michigan, where charter and tradition public schools receive approximately the same operational funding. Controlling for factors that could affect resource allocation patterns between school types, we find that charter schools on average spend $774 more per pupil per year on administration and $1141 less on instruction than traditional public schools.

Wyner, Bridgeland, and Diiulio (2007) observe that a progressively lower proportion of low-income, high achieving students remain successful as they advance from elementary school through college. The present study considers college enrollments from a college preparatory charter secondary school serving low-income students. The study finds that alumni enrolled in Preuss, a four-year colleges at a higher rate than did lottery-assigned comparison students. These four-year college enrollment findings held for Hispanic, African American, and Asian American students. At the same time, the overall college enrollment rates, meaning enrollment in two- and four-year colleges in contrast to no college enrollment, were quite similar for the Preuss School and comparison students. These results were achieved, this study suggests, through numerous academic and social supports that increase college eligibility rates and institute four-year college and financial aid applications as part of coursework. The four-year college enrollment findings offer the promise that schools can be arranged to increase academic opportunities for low-income students. (Contains 4 tables, 4 figures, and 7 footnotes.)",

        "author":["Adamson, Frank",
          "Darling-Hammond, Linda"],
        "description":"The inequitable distribution of well-qualified teachers to students in the United States is a longstanding issue. Despite federal mandates under the No Child Left Behind Act and the use of a range of incentives to attract teachers to high-need schools, the problem remains acute in many states. This study examines how and why teacher quality is inequitably distributed, by reviewing research and examining data on school funding, salaries, and teacher qualifications from California and New York--two large states that face similar demographic diversity and educational challenges. Using wage adjustments to control for cost of living differentials, we find that both overall school funding and teacher salary levels are highly inequitable both across and within states--generally exhibiting a ratio of 3 to 1 between high- and low-spending jurisdictions. Furthermore, low-salary districts serve students with higher needs, offer poorer working conditions, and hire teachers with significantly lower qualifications, who typically exhibit higher turnover. We find that districts serving the highest proportions of minority and low-income students have about twice as many uncredentialed and inexperienced teachers as do those serving the fewest. In an elasticity analysis, we find that increases in teacher salaries are associated with noticeable decreases in the proportions of teachers who are newly hired, uncredentialed, or less well educated. These teacher qualifications, in turn, are associated with student achievement, holding student characteristics constant. We review research on strategies that have been largely unsuccessful at addressing this problem, such as &quot;combat pay&quot; intended to recruit teachers to high need schools, suggesting that small bonuses might be productive if added to an equitable salary structure where working conditions are comparable, but may be inadequate to compensate for large differentials in salaries and working conditions. We review studies illustrating successful policy strategies in states that have taken a more systemic approach to equalizing salaries, raising teaching standards, and providing supports for teacher learning and school development. We recommend federal initiatives that could provide stronger supports and incentives for equalizing students' access to well-qualified and effective teachers, including equalizing allocations of ESEA resources across states, enforcing existing ESEA comparability provisions for ensuring equitable funding and equally qualified teachers to schools serving different populations of students, evaluating progress on resource equity in state plans and evaluations under the law, and requiring states to meet standards of resource equity--including the availability of well-qualified teachers--for schools identified as in need of improvement.

Transition Year is an innovative programme, unique to Irish education, which is intended as a non-academic year devoted to personal and social development in the absence of examination pressure. Slightly more than half of the eligible student cohort take part in the programme, with the remainder skipping TY and progressing directly to senior education. Qualitative evidence suggests that TY is generally viewed as a positive experience for participating students. However, competing perspectives regard the programme as a luxury that is no longer worth sustaining.

It disputes the statist view that South Korea's economic development was the outcome of a strong state's imposition of developmental policies. It also denies the human capital account that central to the South Korean state's education policy was the skills formation agenda. In this paper's process analysis, educational contribution to economic development was made most importantly in the entrance competition-swept schools by virtue of their equipping South Koreans with basic knowledge and intellectual skills and the most important educational asset for economic development was those schools' explosive growth. The latter took place as an unexpected effect of the state's developmental policy of containment which aimed to secure scarce funds for strategic developmental projects. This policy intensified entrance competitions, boosted demand for education, and provoked public call for state commitment to educational expansion. The legitimacy-deficient regime responded politically and compromised on the developmental education policy from one level of formal schooling to another. The image of the developmental state thus portrayed is quite contrary to that provided by the statist-human capital perspective. (Contains 8 footnotes.)",

For many students with disabilities, an emphasis on OTL has become national priority, yet measuring its impact is a complex challenge. The first purpose of this study was to explore the factorial validity of OTL using indicators found in the 2005 4th grade National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The study entailed confirmatory factor analyses for potential OTL factors including teacher preparation, professional development, classroom activities, and access to technology. Separate factor analyses were conducted using the reading and mathematics datasets. The authors then looked at the degree to which OTL factors influenced NAEP estimates of ability for both students with disabilities and their non-disabled peers. The following three OTL factors differentially predicted student scores: classroom activities (reading), student constructed projects (reading), and using calculators for instruction (mathematics). For the remaining three reading factors and seven mathematics factors, there were no differences in the relationship between the factors and scores for students with and without disabilities.

        "description":"This paper discusses the results of a pilot study that explored how prospective secondary school teachers are shaped by learning experiences during their undergraduate mathematics education. The collaborative study, which was conducted by a mathematician and a mathematics educator, drew from the experiences of prospective teachers in a non-traditional undergraduate mathematics program that makes extensive use of technology. Analysis of data collected from detailed questionnaires, journals, and focus group discussions strongly suggests that designing, implementing, and testing Learning Objects promotes prospective teachers' learning of the mathematics needed for teaching. Furthermore, the analysis shows that prospective teachers' experiences of ownership, engagement, and pride are key to positive learning experiences. (Contains 2 figures.)",

The pre-service teachers who reported stronger beliefs in their capabilities to teach mathematics effectively were more likely to possess more sophisticated beliefs as well as were more likely to have more confidence in solving mathematics problems. Mathematical beliefs also had a statistically significant effect on mathematics teaching efficacy and on mathematics self-efficacy. Thus, the significant relationship between mathematical beliefs and mathematics teaching efficacy should be acknowledged by mathematics teacher educators. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"This research studied the development of preservice teachers' understandings and attitudes about teaching science through playful experiences. Subjects were 94 senior preservice teachers in two sections of a science methods class on teaching preschool children. Data sources were semi-structured interviews and open-ended questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester, students' reflections on their field placement implementation, and a Playful Science Survey. At the beginning of the course, preservice teachers perceived teaching science through play primarily as drama and puppetry and saw it as an instrument for teaching, demonstrating, having fun, making competition, and making learning easier. At the end of the semester, the following themes emerged from the interviews: children play with materials and ideas as they actively participate, teachers' dialogue and questioning promotes exploration and variation in activity, children who are actively exploring can find answers by themselves and construct cause and effect relationships. At the end of the course, high mean ratings (4.5 out of 5) on the Playful Science Survey showed positive attitudes towards learning and teaching science and also recognizing the importance of play experiences in learning science and the importance of fun and active involvement in the science class and in the field assignments.

Student attitudes were measured using Likert-scale science attitude surveys administered at the beginning of the school year and once again following completion of weeklong ecology curricula. Content achievements were assessed on a pre- and post-test as well as an end-of-unit test. The quantitative results show some attitude measures are correlated with ability-group tracking, and that little change in science attitudes occurred during the course of the study for the three groups. Results also indicate that overall test scores on an end-of-unit test were not significantly different between the inquiry-based and traditional curricula. Qualitative analysis of the pre- and post-tests show growth in ecology knowledge for all three classrooms, with the Inquiry-Based Academic Class achieving the greatest gains. The results warrant an exploration of curricula that use place-based inquiry as a teaching tool and learning goal by educators interested in student content achievements and keeping science attitudes from decreasing while fostering critical thinking skills.

The teacher leaders involved served as staff members for Iowa Chautauqua and continue to develop and improve in their use of constructivist practices. There has been a lack of evidence focusing specifically on how participation in the Iowa Chautauqua Professional Development Program actually increases use of constructivist teaching practices. Results of the research indicate that the teacher leaders continue to develop further in their use of constructivist practices over time. The Constructivist Learning Environment Survey (CLES) scores were used to indicate improvement.

A questionnaire measuring students' intrinsic motivation to learn biology, individual interest in biology and perceived difficulty of biology, along with information about students' gender, level, parents' occupation and educational level was administered to 368 Greek students. Results revealed that Greek secondary school students have almost neutral overall views about biology: they are slightly positive about biology's usefulness in their lives, perceive it as rather easy, but 26.4% finds no interest in it. Gender does not seem to affect students' overall views about biology, neither their scores in any of the subscales--biology in Greece is as popular among boys as among girls. Younger and older students differ only in their perceived difficulty of biology, with the older students considering it more difficult than the younger ones. Parents' educational level (both mothers and fathers are taken into account) is important in affecting only students' intrinsic motivation, since the more educated a parent is the higher intrinsic motivation a student has towards biology. Parents' occupation does not affect students' views about biology. (Contains 3 tables and 4 figures.)",

The instrument was administered to pre-service science teachers (n = 104) at the Sultan Qaboos University in the Sultanate of Oman. The findings indicate that the majority of these Omani pre-service science teachers believed that global warming and associated climate change is happening now and they are concerned about it. Furthermore, they are aware of the measures that individuals could take to help ameliorate this problem but, despite this, showed a lack of willingness to act in key areas, such as the use of public transport and the purchase of smaller more fuel-efficient cars. This suggests that although the pre-service teachers appear to have a sound understanding of the actions that will help to reduce global warming and are well positioned to inform their students about these, their potential as role models might be compromised if their own actions are not in line with their understanding.

The data was collected through a mixed methods approach involving online surveys (n = 153) and subsequent telephone interviews (n = 9) with secondary school science and biology teachers. The findings indicate that teachers identify strengths and drawbacks to both dissection and alternatives, but the majority continue to strongly favour traditional dissection and see it as vital to biology education. Further, although teachers expressed concerns with dissection, their concerns were overshadowed by an overall dissatisfaction with alternatives. It is argued that teachers need to engage more deeply with the ethical questions that underlie dissection and consider how its learning outcomes can be achieved through humane science education practices. It is also argued that science teacher education programs should include ethical discussions about the controversies of dissection and provide training to familiarize pre-service teachers with alternatives.

Research on teachers' conceptions of creative thinking within EE context is also limited, although their role in facilitating creative thinking in students is well documented. The small-scale qualitative study presented here investigates Greek secondary teachers' conceptions of creative thinking in EE. Empirical data were collected based on non-structured interviews with 20 secondary teachers with diverse backgrounds and subject expertise. Among the findings of the study is that participants view creative thinking as a thinking process that can or should be enhanced within the context of EE. All four key components identified in the literature in definitions of creativity--process, person, product, and context--are present in participants' conceptualizations, with the most prevalent being that of process. Teachers conceptualize creative thinking as an inherent component of environmental problem-solving; they claim that EE pedagogy offers a favourable environment within which it can be nurtured; and they attribute ethical dimensions to it by pairing creativity with social and ecological responsibility. The participants' frames of thinking about creativity support the views of scholars who emphasize the links between EE and creative thinking and connections with broader theoretical approaches that currently dominate research on creativity. The study provides a starting point for further research on creative thinking within the context of EE. (Contains 1 table and 1 footnote.)",

The study sample consisted of (45) prospective science teachers in the College of Education at Sultan Qaboos University. The instrument was applied to the sample three times: before the Science Method I course, after finishing this course and after finishing the Science Method II course and the Practicum. The results revealed that after completing the Science Methods I course, prospective science teachers shifted significantly from a teacher-centered approach to the intermediate state between the teacher-centered and student-centered. There was no significant change after the Science Methods II course and the Practicum. Furthermore, the results also showed that among the three different teaching styles: exploratory, conceptual and explicit indicated in the second part of the DASTT-C instrument, prospective science teachers in the current study were found to be at the conceptual teaching style, closer to the boundary with the exploratory teaching style. This teaching style remained consistent across the three administrations of the DASTT-C instrument. (Contains 8 figures and 6 tables.)",

The treatment group was shown a picture of the larva and adult stage of the insect. The control group was only shown the adult stage of the insect. Unique to this study, is the finding that the external morphology of an insect is a causal factor that can negatively affect preservice elementary teacher's attitudes toward insects and beliefs concerning the likelihood of incorporating insects into future science education settings. Implications are discussed that can assist preservice teacher training programs. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)",

Findings also revealed that some of the barriers to incorporating EE were perceived barriers that could be overcome. A four-part EE training series was conducted with the after-school staff and evaluations were completed following each workshop. Staff showed significant confidence and ability to teach EE after the training sessions and were motivated to continue with the EE focus due in part to positive observed student outcomes and parent feedback.

        "description":"Worldwide, innovation in education is highly perceived as an effectual approach to promote awareness for sustainability. International organizations interested in education, research and training support projects seeking modernization of Higher Education (HE) and put much emphasis on developing new curricula, teaching methods or materials to respond to current needs. Building ties and promoting cooperation between institutions around the world through Universities and academic arenas are central in innovative educational approaches. This paper reflects on one of such projects; the Center for Natural Resources and Development (CNRD) which aims at supporting achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7. Eleven University faculties in Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Germany, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Mozambique, Nepal, and Vietnam form part of the CNRD, covering natural, engineering, and social sciences disciplines. To develop solutions for one of the most pressing problems of today; creating sustainable cities, students, teachers and researchers work together in a trans-disciplinary approach. The paper principally deals with the question of how international research and education networks can narrow the distance between countries and promote awareness of sustainability. It discusses approaches in joint education, using modern media and e-learning activities and their contribution to raise awareness of sustainability among young researchers.

This understanding of the NOS is then used as a foundation for developing teacher candidate appreciation of the attributes of authentic science lessons. Based upon their understanding of the nature of science, teacher candidates plan and teach lessons and critique the experiences provided for students using their own conceptual framework of authentic science learning experiences. The study uses an instrumental case study approach in which a case is examined mainly to provide insight into an issue or for refinement of a theory; that is, does the use of the nature of science have utility for supporting teachers of science in their planning and teaching, and, in particular, for assisting them in teaching science authentically and developing a more positive perception of self as a teacher of science. Implications of this inquiry in informing the development and utility of nature of science understandings in teacher education methods courses are also considered. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Participants were 45 preservice science teachers (PSTs) enrolled in two sections of Laboratory Application in Science II course in a university in Turkey. All of the participants were juniors with the same science major background. Participants in both groups were engaged with explicit-reflective and inquiry-based NOS instruction under conceptual change theory. This study is considered as a mixed methods concurrent embedded design model. After the intervention, all of the PSTs demonstrated developments about many of the NOS aspects. It can be concluded that inquiry-based laboratory instruction informed by the conceptual change theory provided PSTs' improve their NOS understanding. This study revealed statistically significant relationships among the some aspects of NOS, epistemological beliefs, and metacognitive awareness. The relationships were discussed in respect to current science education literature. (Contains 7 tables.)",

        "description":"There has been an increased use of authentic practices in both science and environmental education in recent years. Such practices can utilize social constructivist frameworks to consider the learning that may be taking place as students become engaged in tool use. The current study focuses on a group of elementary school students studying the Everglades in the field and in a classroom setting during one academic year. In particular, we observed students' use of tools (identified as tool-conventions to include both artifacts and conventions) and compared their use in both settings. We found that in the field, students spent considerable amount of time engaged in data collection activity such as taking observations and measurements that resembled what scientists might be doing and included the invention of new tools to facilitate data gathering. In this context, students generally worked more independently from the teacher, collaborated in small work groups, and engaged in more self-directed inquiry. In the classroom, while some of the scientific field tools were practiced in anticipation of their use in the field, activity included more teacher direction, often resembling what might be found in other types of classroom work and the tools used there often supported this work. Models of tool use based on Yrjo Engestrom's activity approach were constructed for both settings. Implications of the results include the importance of viewing tool use in authentic learning with a sociocultural and activity perspective to reflect the socially constructed nature of such learning.

The data were collected by on-line administration of a survey to 958 students at Middle East Technical University during February-June of 2008. It needs to be stressed that gender emerged as a strong factor explaining sustainability-related attributes. It was reflected that female students having higher tendency to follow media held more favorable attitudes and behaviors toward sustainable life styles, and more ecocentric values. Furthermore, attitudes and values were found to be significant determinants of university students' behaviors pertaining to sustainability. It was also reported that higher tendency to follow media yielded more favorable attitudes, higher levels of ecocentric values, and engagement in outdoor recreational activities such as walking in nature, bird watching, and camping. These results implied that the university campus should be well equipped with the necessary infrastructures that will satisfy the needs and encourage female students as well as male students to motivate them take appreciative outdoor activities. A gender perspective should be integrated into existing mainstream institutions and all programmatic areas or sectors, including education in order to hinder gender inequality. In addition, during the rehabilitation of sustainability issues in higher education institutions, favorable attitudes and values of university students should be regarded as an auxiliary agent.

This article focuses on the concept of domain critical errors and suggests a framework for considering their use in practice. Domain critical errors are defined here as knowledge, skills, abilities, or judgments that are essential to the definition of minimum qualifications in a testing program's pass-fail decision-making process. Using domain critical errors has psychometric and policy implications, particularly for licensure programs that are mandatory for entry-level practice. Because these errors greatly influence pass-fail decisions, the measurement community faces an ongoing challenge to promote defensible practices while concurrently providing assessment literacy development about the appropriate design and use of testing methods like domain critical errors.

        "description":"A vertical scale, in principle, provides a common metric across tests with differing difficulties (e.g., spanning multiple grades) so that statements of &quot;absolute&quot; growth can be made. This paper compares 16 states' 2007-2008 effect size growth trends on vertically scaled reading and math assessments across grades 3 to 8. Two patterns common in past research on vertical scales, score deceleration (grade-to-grade growth that decreases over time) and scale shrinkage (variability in scale scores that decreases from lower to higher grades), are investigated. Pervasive, but modest, patterns of score deceleration are found for both math and reading. Limited evidence of scale shrinkage was found for reading, and virtually no evidence was found for math. In addition, linear regression was used to show that little of the considerable variability in the growth effect sizes across states could be explained by readily identifiable characteristics of the vertical scales. However, many scale characteristics were not well documented in available technical reports. The most important of these characteristics, along with their implications for interpretations of growth, are discussed. The results serve both as a normative baseline against which other scaling efforts can be compared. (Contains 5 tables, 4 footnotes, and 5 figures.)",

        "description":"Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is a powerful and commonly-used tool for investigating the underlying variable structure of a psychometric instrument. However, there is much controversy in the social sciences with regard to the techniques used in EFA (Ford, MacCallum, &amp; Tait, 1986; Henson &amp; Roberts, 2006) and the reliability of the outcome. Simulations by Costello and Osborne (2005), for example, demonstrate how poorly some EFA analyses replicate, even with clear underlying factor structures and large samples. Thus, we argue that researchers should routinely examine the stability or volatility of their EFA solutions to gain more insight into the robustness of their solutions and insight into how to improve their instruments while still at the exploratory stage of development.
