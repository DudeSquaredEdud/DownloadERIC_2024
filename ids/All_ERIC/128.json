        "description":"This evaluation of Project Special Elementary Education for the Disadvantaged (SEED) sought to assess the impact of SEED instruction upon students enrolled in disadvantaged schools (grades three to six) in four major study areas: mathematics achievement, interest in math and other school subjects, motivation, and self concept. In addition, the teacher inservice training provided by the SEED Specialists was evaluated. Each of the evaluation instruments used was administered on a pre and post basis to students participating in the SEED program and to students in a control group. The present study revealed that the impact of Project SEED on achievement in mathematics was generally favorable for students who were in the program for a two-year period; however, the relative gain for  students who had been in the program for only one year was less favorable. Measures of interest and motivation yielded only a few significant findings and these were not consistently in favor of the experimental treatment for any grade level or treatment group. Similarly, the findings for the measure of self image did not yield evidence of a substantial and consistent treatment effect. The inservice training for teachers was found to be quite extensive. In general, it did not prepare teachers for implementing SEED by themselves. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Chapter 3 of the State School Aid Act was enacted to improve achievement in the basic cognitive skills of low-achieving puPils in Michigan. The program provided funds and considerable program discretion for local school districts with high concentration of low achieving children in the grades K-6. These districts received funds for a three-year program; 1973-74 was the third year, to improve achievement in reading and mathematics for these pupils. This report contains information regarding district expenditures and pupil achievement during 1973-74, discusses pupil achievement over a two-year period, and contains data on the expected growth for pupils evaluated with norm-referenced tests. The report addresses the question of success in terms of the level of accomplishment attained  in Chapter 3 programs. An analysis of test results indicated that the actual achievement for Chapter 3 pupils exceeded the expected achievement gains if the pupils had been in regular school programs. This analysis also indicated that the 1973-74 achievement was higher than in 1972-73. It is recommended that local school districts further analyze the needs of the 8.016 students (7.1 percent of the 112,500 stuoents) in Chapter 3 who showed no achievement during 1973-74, and modify the delivery system to provide better assistance for these pupils.

More than 40 people were invited to express their views concerning the problems of black people living in the Arkansas Delta. Issues related to the political participation of blacks in local and State government were discussed, and the administration of justice as it relates to black citizens in the Delta was examined. Also discussed was the manifold economic and social welfare problems of blacks living in the region. The present document is a report of the principal findings of the open meetings and subsequent investigations. The contents  of the report include an introductory section, findings and recommendations, appended communications and Arkansas statutes, and three chapters, entitled respectively: The Economic and Social Welfare Conditions of Blacks in Eastern Arkansas, Political ParticiPation of Blacks in the Arkansas Delta, and The Administration of Justice in the Arkansas Delta.

        "description":"In October 1970, the commission published its first of three across-the-board evaluations of the Federal Government's effort to end discrimination against American minorities. In February 1972 the commission chairman and the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) agreed that the commission would provide OMB with a summary of Federal civil rights activites, highlighting progress and citing deficiencies in enforcement programs. The commission's staff director in September 1972 provided the OMB director with a report covering the activities of more than 25 Federal agencies and departments with significant civil rights responsibilities. The commission herewith publishes the document sent to OMB. Minor editing has been performed, but no substantive changes have been  made in the report as delivered to OMB. This report was prepared in the same manner as other commission studies of the Federal enforcement effort. Detailed questionnaires were mailed to the agencies in July, interviews were held with Washington-based civil rights and program officials in July and August, and documents and data supplied by the agencies were analyzed. The report covers the activities of the agencies from October 1971 to July 1972. Sex discrimination is not covered in this report, it is stated, as the commission's jurisdiction did not include sex discrimination at the time of the report. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This study investigates two hypotheses: (1) that black children experience more conflict over their racial identity than white children, and (2) that black children are less likely to identify with occupational role models than are white children are investigated in this study. Drawings of a person by 167 black and 156 white primary school children are analyzed for indicators of (1) acceptance of racial identity (drawing a person who is clearly one's own race); (2) conflict over racial identity (failing to color in the face of figure drawn); and (3) identification with an occupational role model (drawing a figure whose occupation is apparent). As predicted, the figures drawn by blacks looked more like blacks than those drawn by whites. This is said to be suggestive of a new  acceptance of racial identity on the part of black children. Black children also showed greater conflict over their racial identity and less frequent identification with occupational role models than whites. Twenty-eight of the black children participated in a second phase of the study, which is considered to confirm the validity and reliability of the draw-a-person test as a measure of acceptance of racial identity, and which investigates intergroup attitudes. The effect of school desegregation on black children is explored in both phases of the research. It is concluded that desegregation may be more easily accomplished in the very early school years than in later years when race has assumed more importance. (Author/AM)",

Subobjectives are to determine the amount and type of evaluation information needed at each level to assess the ability and willingness of education agencies to report the information desired by higher levels, and to devise evaluation techniques and procedures which could be implemented in Title I settings. The evaluation and reporting system was presented to appropriate personnel in nine State Departments of Education and to an advisory panel representing additional local and state agencies. Attitudes toward the system are reported as very favorable and are  interpreted as indicators of success in achieving the study's objectives. A followup project has been initiated that will involve, among other things, further refinement of the system developed. Ways of extending its flexibility have been identified, and work is in progress to enhance both the utility and acceptability of the system. Presently, the prognosis is seen to appear excellent in that the system will be widely adopted in the next few years resulting in vastly improved Title I evaluation and reporting practices.

Since the report does not specifically separate public schools from private schools for the two years,  comparisons between 1972 and 1973 are not made. Although the large increase in the number of schools not offering a food service program to their students may be attributed to the inclusion in the tabulation for 1973 of many private schools which do not have food service, the total number of children with access to a lunch program increased from 1972 to 1973. Over 77 percent elementary school children, 86.7 percent secondary, and 88.5 percent children in low income area schools have access to the National Schools Lunch Program. Higher participation rate in low income area schools is accounted for by the fact that most of the lunches are served free or at a reduced price. (Author/AM)",

The overall purpose of this major component is to enhance positive attitudes toward intercultural, racial, and ethnic relations and understandings through curriculum content and by humanistic teaching methods and not necessarily by direct teaching about attitudes and understandings themselves. The project includes the experimental treatment of an elective social science course in urban sociology at two high schools--a 100 percent black inner city school, and a 99 percent white upper middle class suburban school Control groups for the quasi-experimental design are regular social science courses at  the two schools. Instruments administered include a personality inventory, a self-concept scale, and a racial and ethnic attitude questionnaire. It is concluded that a general approach, while potentially effective in changing attitudes will do so in unpredictable ways, and that even positive changes in attitudes and understandings must be differentiated from liking or accepting perceived race characteristics. It is suggested that attitudes be looked at one at a time, examined situationally, and then followed-up on an item-by-item basis. (Author/AM)",

A section on major developments, problems, and needs addresses such issues as accelerated rate of change, crisis confrontations ano brush fire techniques, and unanticipated consequences of change. Four issues (educational leadership in the mainstream of society, dilemmas in big city education, recent developments and insights, and next steps) are included under a section on problems and challenges of big city education. Sub-issues such as migration of the disadvantaged, quality of education amid the process of ethnic desegregation of schools, accountability, and effective governance are also treated here. A section on  preparing to meet the challenges and needs focuses on cooperative arrangements between groups, organizations, and agencies, planning and change, bringing schools closer to the people, and recognizing and removing constraints. The final section addresses emerging roles and relationships and discusses state education agencies, consortia of local administrators, institutions of higher learning, and intra-governmental efforts. It is concluded that cooperation throughout the entire governance system will continue to develop and improve the quality of the education programs. (Author/AM)",

Program achievement is measured by achievement tests, quality of participation, and other outcomes indicative of achievement. The results vary depending upon the site, but some significant measure of success is achieved in all sites. One the average, students gain 9 grades in reading and 7 grades in math during their first three months. The  best results are reported from one of the NYC programs in which the gain is 1.9 grades in reading and 2.12 in math after nine months' participation. About 45 percent of the students in the NYC program either use NEP credits to gain a high school diploma, or have passed the GED while enrolled in this program. This project is found to be an effective educational component in a variety of programs concerned with academic underachievers. The curriculum changes made based on experience in the unmodified NEP version are found to increase the NEP's effectiveness. (AUthor/AM)",

Between 1973 and 1974, enrollment of black students increased from 10.7 percent to 11.9 percent of total enrollment in Tennessee's public colleges and universities. There is progress toward better racial distribution of students as indicated by the increase in white enrollment at the State University, and increases in black students' total student body at other institutions. Although the total number of black faculty increased from 345 to 360, their proportion remains the same because of the relatively larger increase in white faculty. There is progress toward  desegregation of faculties, but it is apparent that progress toward desegregation of administrative staffs has been less than in the areas of student enrollment and faculty composition. Substantial progress is seen in the Nashville segment of public higher education, as indicated by the increase in white enrollment at Tennessee State University, continued substantial enrollment of blacks at University of Tennessee at Nashville, continued improvement in faculty mix, substantial improvement in the composition of the administrative staff, and the employment of a black administrator. Appended tables include racial composition of personnel, faculties, and student enrollment. (Author/AM)",

This volume employs new methods and categories of analysis to re-examine certain earlier findings such as the lack of any appreciable relationship between achievement level and having a family from which neither parent is absent and the greater independent role of family background fractors in a students' achievement. The role of two previously neglected variables -- that of sex and school attendance in either a metropolitan or non-metropolitan area -- in achievement and motivation is also explored. Earlier reported findings are seen to be substantially confirmed, extended, and made more specific in this report. The  study shows that influences on student achievement tend to resolve themselves into attitudinal and motivational factors and social class factors, with the latter assuming the most importanne. Neither ethnicity, sex, nor regional differences account greatly for the source of variance in student achievement. Ethnically related variations in achievement and motivation are not considered to arise from anything inherent in the ethnic groups themselves and the crucial factor suggested is each group's experiences as a group, including the school attended. The most important achievement of these studies is deemed to lie in the documentation and quantification of the entanglement of influences in a child's education. (Author/AM)",

Various types of academic learning that can occur with the use of puppetry are listed, such as the encouragement of research where the child needs additional information about a character or story, the concretization of experiences, and expansion of concepts. Plays used in puppetry may be based on experience, literature, the child's imagination, and other areas of interest. They can be peer or teacher created, and found in books of plays or  on puppetry. Music can also be incorporated into a puppetry program. Among the major skills attributed to working with puppets is increased opportunities for social amenities, with improvements in poise, self-esteem, and leadership. Other skills that are developed include improved sewing ability, and improved ability in stage construction, carpentry, painting, and measuring.

ESL achievement, as measured by listening and reading comprehension tests, is compared through ANOVA and partial correlation analysis with a quasi-experimental evaluation design. Anlaysis of data indicates that students learning English in a bilingual program learn just as much English as students learning it through ESL classes within a traditional curriculum. Because the amount of  measured English achievement in kindergarten and first grade is found disappointing compared to the substantial achievement measured in second and third grades, two questions are raised - that of the effectiveness of language instruction in K-1 and that of the appropriateness of the techniques used to measure achievement on these levels. Although the study needs replication with other age groups and other languages, the implication derived from the study is that half-day bilingual programs do not inhibit Engllish language achievement in primary-aged children.

The document supports the theory that a sound curriculum in mathematics for elementary schools is characterized by both mathematical content and an approach to teaching consistent with the best available knowledge of learning in children. Its main focus is on activities used in teaching children about operations on whole and fractional  numbers. The learning activities included give instructional suggestions for each of the 35 minimal objectives specified for the program. The importance of the teacher's recognition of four types of errors is emphasized for eventual diagnosis and remediation of failure. Brief guidelines for both diagnosis and remediation are provided. Also offered are some suggested methods of motivating low-achieving pupils; namely, extrinsic and intrinsic motivators.

The program is characterized by intensive individualized instruction in reading and mathematics to underachieving fifth and sixth graders. Minimal objectives, thirty for reading and thirty-five for mathematics, give direction to pupil learning. An integral part of the regular instructional program, this project also calls for parental involvement. A section describing the administration and supervision of the program at the state level addresses the role of the state department of education, action program strategies, criteria for selection of pupils in the  program, and program objectives and funding. A similar section focusing on the implementation of the program at the school division level addresses the role of the local school division, the selection of pupils for program participation, the design and execution of the local program plan, the administration of a specified testing program, the expenditure of allocated funds, the instructional program, and record keeping. A section on the evaluation component notes that since the program has the dual purpose of accomplishing the objectives, and demonstrating the pilot effort aspect of the project, evaluation includes provisions for assessment of both program practices and pupil progress. Appendixes include objectives, sample class record sheets, and a plan form. (Author/AM)",

The Paper discussed learning in a poor urban community using the ethnographic example of a small community to illustrate the larger socio-political impact of the implication of the United States' policy and position for Colombia. The account is considered to be highly personalized and based upon a particiPant-observation approach, supplemented with survey data. A later section of the paper discussed language learning at a major Colombian educational institution. The contrast between language learning at the major institution and that in the poor community is the substance of the paper. Six approaches to the anthropological study of education are discussed and followed in combination in the paper:  (1) education as an instrument for socialization or enculturation; (2) education as the culturally different aspects of a society in terms of its language, conceptual style, behavior, and learning processes; (3) education as a ritual of series of &quot;rites de passage&quot;, (4) education as the differential patterns marking the degree and depth of participation by people in the educational process; (5) education as out of school instruction provided by institutions of all kinds; and, (6) education viewed from a diversity of management perspectives.

        "description":"The Special Summer Food Service Program for Children is one of several programs for the feeding of children administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). The program is designed to feed during summer vacation, children from areas having poor economic conditions or high concentrations of working mothers. It is authorized through fiscal year 1975. It provides Federal assistance through State educational agencies or Service regional offices for financing non profit food services operated by approved service instiutions (called sponsors) at approved feeding sites. GAO's review of the program included visits to six large cities, one each in California, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Among the reports' findings and conslusions are the following: the  program's effectiveness is difficult to assess because the Service and State agencies have not identified the total number of children who were eligible nor their location; the summer program apparently has achieved rather limited coverage, especially in areas other than the largest cities; and, problems which limited participation include vagueness in the law and regulations as to the extent of coverage desired, lack of strong support for an essentially voluntary program, and Federal and State funding limitations, resulting in a large proportion of allocated funds not spent.

Initiated during 1971-72 school year, the cooperative's first two years focused on developing and field testing procedures for conducting district wide assessment of needs, program planning, and program evaluation. During the 1973-74 school year, these procedures were applied. That year's results served as a basis for further development and refinement during 1974-75. The purpose of this report is to describe the project activities implemented during 1974-75 and to present the evaluation results. The project utilized the Continuous Assessment Reading Design (CARD), a criterion-referenced assessment instructional program. The  assessment component is designed to measure the specific skill needs of pupils, who have demonstrated an ability to perform at instructional levels kindergarten through six in the reading materials or basal series currently in use in their school district. The tests provide teachers with immediate and specific information about the pupils' reading skill strengths and weaknesses. Since each test item is keyed to a performance objective, the items missed by a pupil yield a profile of skill needs in the form of performance objectives. (Author/JM)",

The new criteria are considerec to reflect an effort to provide additional funds to school districts more equitably on the basis of specific pupil educational needs. Districts which receive aid for pupils with special education needs, with handicapping conditions, with severely handicapping conditions or in occupational education programs are required to prepare plans anc submit annual reports to the State Education Department. The materials included in this document have been developed to assist district  officials to understand and to carry out these new responsibilities, as follows: (1) general background information on Chapter 241; (2) specific planning, evaluation, and reporting instructions; (3) definitions which will enable district officials to identify pupils with special education needs and pupils with handicapping conditions, and definitions which will be applicable to occupational education: and, (4) the names and phone numbers of State Education Department officials to call for answers to questions about any facet of the special weighting provision.

It has as its main goal to decrease the incidence of alienation among these youth, the staff, and the community. Sub-goals include the reduction of alienation and improvement of self-concept, an increased access to desirable social roles, and the reduction of negative labeling. Since most Focus students are seen to be deficient in the basic academic skills and positive social development, the emphasis in each discipline is directed toward meeting the individual educational and social needs of each student. The philosophical basis of the Focus approach is broken down into seven briefly discussed interrelated components: caring, the setting of expectations, structure,  individualization, responsibility, reinforcement, and evaluation. An area of emphasis in the program is the State funded work experience component in which work experiences are provided for each student, giving them an accurate view of the responsibilities and realities of employment. The Focus program is stated to be significantly different from other mini-school concepts dealing with the alienated student -- the family group atmosPhere or small group interaction, noted to be the backbone of the program.

Interrelationships between the various outcomes are explored. Data indicate that blacks do not differ greatly from whites with respect to academic effort or absence from school, that blacks and whites are similar with respect to educational and occupational aspirations, and that they differ greatly in achievement scores and grades. The second part of the report considers the associations between each of the outcomes in the school and each of several sets of factors which are seen to  account for variations in each outcome. These sets of possible explanatory factors are interracial interaction, student characteristics, home background, school situation, and student goals, beliefs ano interests. Analysis of the data deals with each racial group separately and emphasizes the differences among individual students. Since the data on which the report is based is four years old, the descriptive findings are not held to necessarily reflect the current situation.

Some developmental side effects are noted, as well as the benefits of ethnic concentration when the latter is the result of choice. Also presented is the challenge of providing neighborhoods with a stronger voice in land-use decisions and insuring that the community leaders who wield political influence actually defend the interests of residents they claim to serve. Finally, it is suggested that residents, public officials, and private investors take a new look at Chinatown. It is concluded that new legislation and innovative programs may not be needed and that  the crucial element necessary to enhance the vitality of Chinatown is a clearer vision of its role in inner city revitalization. Since the decision of key actors such as lenders, landlords, realtors, appraisers, city planning staff, community leaders, and other combine to determine the market value, attractiveness, and livability of a neighborhood, the task of neighborhood preservation and rehabilitation involves the cooperation, persuasion, and sharing of a common vision of the future among these parties.

One of the basic components in the career development model used as the basis for the project is the learner.s self-concept which is influenced by the roles of significant others (parents, teachers, and peers) and society. How the student acquires knowledge and the environment under which this knowledge is gained are also important aspects in both self-concept and career development. Program objectives are outlined for the primary, intermediate, junior high school, and  high school levels geared to the awareness, accommodation, exploration, and preparation-exploration phases respectively. The importance of self-concept is discussed in relation to these phases. A list of 29 generalizations about how an understanding of self-concept is acquired is given. A selected bibliography is included. (Author/EC)",

The central purpose of the document is to promulgate and clarify the use of the world of work concept. Part 1 briefly discusses education's treatment of the world of work in the past, which has shown an increasing emphasis on the integration of education and work. Part 2 focuses its attention on current and emerging trends in the world of work, including attitudes to work, the impact of occupational trends, and population changes in terms of age and expectation. The final  section deals with the role of the world of work in the educational program through a model for career development which has as its two basic concepts self and world of work. For the purpose of inclusion in a school curriculum, career development objectives using these two concepts are classified according to the developmental phases of the model: awareness (primary); accommodation (intermediate); exploration (junior high); and preparation-exploration (high school).

The focus of the report is on the process of career choice and career decision making. Career choices are too often made on the basis of social myths, occupational information acquired in school, and the need for work to ensure economic survival. These decisions are influenced by family and educational experiences. The development of a \"work self\" is an important step. The conclusion is reached that any attempt to better prepare young people to make the career decision with which they are confronted should take into account the ongoing economic, social, and  political changes within society.

It is stated that although the GED testing approach is a useful one, it is not a universal testing tool because of the stress placed upon reading competency. Adult high schools are discussed in terms of the Policies and Standards for the Approval of Separately Administered Adult High Schools developed by the NCA. It is felt that these standards will allow flexibility and experimentation among member schools, but at the same time provide effective quality controls. Sixteen separately administered  adult high schools were accredited in 1974, and a seven year cycle of research and evaluation will be necessary to assess the NCA Standards in action. (LH)",

These outcomes were in turn reviewed and rated in terms of being either basic for all 17-year-olds, desirable for some 17-year-olds, or inappropriate for development in the schools. As a result of this rating process,  177 outcomes were determined as basic, and these have been sorted into nine categories.

Central to the project was the construction of valid task inventories for the various vocational programs which would help to ensure that vocational curricula provided the maximum usefulness and minimum cost to the students. During the project's first two years task listings for the hospitality and graphic arts industries were developed and a Handbook for vocational-technical instructors and coordinators was published. During the last two project years a procedure for articulating vocational programs in auto mechanics and clerical-secretarial occupations based on the identification and validation of minimum  task based curriculum content was developed. The final accomplishment during the last year was the collection of task inventories, competency lists, and skill profiles. The articulation procedure appears to be reasonable in cost and efficient in terms of time required to complete the procedure. The document contains a five-page bibliography and two appendixes: Guide for Articulating Vocational Technical Curriculum in Minnesota, and Task List for an Occupational Program--format example.

Technology has been and continues to be a powerful force in society. It has changed the way man lives, the way he thinks about himself and others, and his perceptions of the future. We are discovering that continued development of technology has brought about subtle, cumulative, and pervasive changes in both our natural and social environments. And it is these changes which will force reconsideration of the mission of education, including industrial arts. At issue will not be short range consideration of job or career education, but the far more serious and critical issue of the stewardship of society and the spaceship earth. The central problem of our time  and the issue which should have the greatest impact on industrial arts education is the search for alternative technologies which meet the needs of human beings and enhance the quality of life in all its dimensions. The problem must be recognized as primarily social and not technological, requiring appropriate social tools to enable human beings to achieve the goal of a humane society meeting human needs and human purposes.

The findings unequivocally show a trend whereby career education exposure enhances occupational knowledge, career awareness, economic awareness, decision-making skills, and realistic career planning and preparation. The data also show that students exposed to career education are more positively oriented toward integrating their educational experience with their future plans. An analysis of eight career education activities (occupational exploration kits, in-class work experiences, career education games, career education fairs, community resource speakers, occupational ability/interest tests, occupational films, and occupational  tours within the community) demonstrates that their effectiveness varies with students' age. Finally, the data indicate that student goals in the area of educational and occupational achievement are most influenced by parental expectations. (Author/JR)",

The topics are: orientation, career development, acquiring a job, elements of job success, government and you, you as a consumer, free enterprise system, individual development, and use of leisure time. Each competency contains specific learning activities, resources, and methods of  evaluation. The flexibility of the guide permits diverse application of the related theory in various cooperative education and other field experience instructional programs.

A sample of schools stratified by region, size of community, and school type was taken. Within each school in the sample, students in levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 completed questionnaires. The tables presented in the report are based on the distribution obtained from the sample survey. Job search methods, rates of success in finding employment, and the characteristics of that employment were investigated. Comparisons were made with data gathered in a similar survey undertaken in 1969. The results indicated that 78% had either worked or looked for work during the summer of 1973, with the rate increasing with age. In all groups males had higher participation rates than females.  Other factors influencing labor force participation were community size and geographic location. The job seeking method most frequently used was direct application, followed closely by family or personal contacts. Overall, 85% who sought jobs were successful. The largest summer employment of high school students in 1973 was the service industry, with trade and primary industries running second and third. Fifty percent of employed students earned an hourly wage of $2.00 or less. The median wage was $1.85 per hour for females and $2.16 for males. The survey instrument is appended. (NJ)",

The purpose of the survey was to obtain data that would permit an assessment of the direct impact of proposed changes in Ontario's minimum labor standards. For the industries surveyed, data on some or all of these working conditions are provided by sex, office, and non-office employment, full-time and part-time status, and geographic region. The 47 industries surveyed were selected from the mining, manufacturing, wholesale trade, and service sectors. The data refer to the last normal pay period preceeding April 28, 1974.

Information was collected via questionnaire concerning personal backgrounds, academic status, preparation, work experience, attitudes and satisfactions concerning careers, and professional responsibilities and involvement. Questions were also asked about influences affecting choice of career and the effect of being female on their careers. Basic to the research was the assumption that knowledge of the background and characteristics of women faculty would contribute to the goal of greater utilization of women in higher education. It was also felt that information from the study would aid those persons involved in career counseling of women. Among the results  obtained, it was found that women faculty: (1) occupied positions relatively lower than the men in their institutions, (2) had chosen careers in higher education based on the expected intellectual challenge and an interest in working with college students, and (3) nine out of ten were satisfied or very satisfied with their careers.

The study was undertaken in order to clarify the role of the employment service. Most of the data were collected via visits to State and regional employment service offices. A process of problem identification was conducted in several stages. The main issue discovered during the fieldwork phase was that of setting objectives for the ES. A systematic framework encompassing the four categories of objectives, ES operational activities or services, organization and management, and the  labor market in which ES operates was developed. An agenda for further research and development (R and D) activities including performance management, counseling, and intensive services studies is proposed. Four R and D options are described for achieving the goals of developing a clear statement of ES objectives and an operating model of an effectively performing system. Finally, potential problems in managing such an effort are presented. (LJ)",

        "description":"The report identifies the entrepreneurial needs of minority small businessmen in Arizona's Maricopa County and selected Indian reservations, the entrepreneurial aids available from public and private organizations, and implications for future planning by the State Department of Education. Data were gathered from surveys of organizations and minority small businessmen. About three-fifths of the businessmen surveyed were sole proprietors and approximately the same number had been in business since 1970 or earlier, most frequently in the areas of retail trade and services. Most of the sole proprietors indicated a need for training services and all of the businessmen indicated a need for financial aid in the form of loans or grants. Respondents agreed that high school courses should  be related to appropriate career opportunities and that business skills, specifically marketing and management development, be taught in the high schools. However, job placement was viewed as the responsibility of government rather than the school. The report concludes with a recommendations to help improve and extend entrepreneurial aids to minority small businessmen, including continuing business skills training programs in the high schools. The two survey forms used in the project are appended. (Author/MF)",

The primary objectives of the project were to achieve a 50% reduction of the dropout rate and to achieve a 75% successful placement of students in the target population. Two main activities comprised the project: (1) the student phase component which included work experience, career information, and career and placement services; and (2) the teacher-counselor component which helped guidance and counseling personnel become more familiar with the world of work. The report indicates that most of the objectives were met.  However, it was the opinion of the staff that project and district counseling services had to be unified to better meet the needs of the students.

Career clusters were related to the major academic areas utilizing community resource personnel in the school setting, while field trips provided first-hand experience. Parents participated by assisting with clerical duties, accompanying students on field trips, and sharing personal work experiences. Interest surveys and occupational cluster pretests were administered to all students. In program assessment, some of the techniques employed were: evaluation of student's participation, staff meetings,  participation and response of parents, community participants' critique, and pretesting and posttesting of student participants. A considerable majority of students improved their scores on the career clusters posttests. The pretests for each of the eight clusters are appended, along with the student preprogram inventory, and the staff and parent questionnaires. (NJ)",

The basic evaluation design was established by the Center for Resource Development in Adult Education; assessment was conducted by a third party evaluator. Using a basic Discrepancy Evaluation Model, the study examined the success of regionalization as it is tied directly to organization fidelity, sensitivity, and role fulfillment. Each of the 10 regional projects submitted copies of proposals and evaluation reports and engaged in field visitation interviews. Questionnaire data are presented, and a copy of the  interview is included in the appendixes. It was concluded that regionalization is a viable concept for problem solving, but the arbitrary use of the 10 Federal regions is not the most efficient way to create the number of regions. Generally, there was a basic uncomfortableness and degrees of dissatisfaction with regionalization. Moreover, there was a basic lack of understanding of the concept of regionalization. Positive conflict was not perceived and rationally approached, as the basic approach was to minimize conflict rather than to incorporate it into regional planning. (EA)",

Problems of measurement in context evaluation are primarily related to decisions on the appropriateness of data and how data should be interpreted. When program goals have been established, input evaluation is used to determine how available resources can be best employed to achieve those goals. Data for input evaluation usually are not available from existing sources and must be generated within the program. Five suggested methods are: group consensus, expert judgment, literature and program examination, management by objectives, and pilot experimental efforts. Literature and program examination, group consensus, and expert judgment are intended to solve the problem of cataloging the possible  ways in which resources can be applied as well as to secure judgments about the potential of selected resource usage. A management by objectives stage or pilot experimental effort could follow with the allocation of specific resources applied to the achievement of intended outcomes. Both approaches have the advantage of generating a system for committing resources and examining the results of those committments. Context and input evaluation, systematic ways of measuring the variables involved, will help in making improved program decisions. (EA)",

        "description":"The study sought to determine a statewide status profile of consumer education in Texas public secondary schools and to obtain an attitudinal profile of Texas secondary teachers and administrators regarding consumer education. An introductory chapter traces the historical development of consumerism and consumer education. Two different sets of 10 questions which formed the bases for the status and attitudinal profiles are presented. A questionnaire was sent to 500 schools selected on the basis of enrollment, education and income levels, minority population ratios, and urban-rural characteristics. Responses from 256 schools provided the status profile which showed that consumer education was generally incorporated into other existing courses. The attitudinal profile, obtained by  means of personal interviews with 56 selected public school administrators and telephone interviews with 12 others, indicated receptiveness to the idea of a practical course in consumer education. Information from the questionnaires and interviews is analyzed and discussed in detail. The findings of the study are summarized and five conclusions concerning the development and implementation of consumer education are presented. An eight-item bibliography and appended material (definitions, mail survey form, interview format, and maps showing geographic coverage of the questionnaires and interviews) are included.

        "description":"The project worked closely and supportively with California welfare mothers, helping them find suitable employment which meshed with their parenting functions, to demonstrate and test the impact of flexible work schedules and to determine whether business and industry could provide flexibly scheduled work (part-time, temporary, or intermittent). Activities undertaken included: job finding and job development; career counseling; providing job, training, housing, child care, and other information; and operating group support workshops. The report makes it very clear that: (1) during a recession, when well-qualified applicants abound, private industry will not consider structuring its work force to welfare mothers' needs, without obvious benefits; and (2) reducing the number of  dependent families on the welfare rolls is not a realistic objective even with permanent employment on a part-time basis, unless on-the-job training increases mothers' hourly rate. Then the amount of welfare contributed toward support could be reduced. The case against intermittent jobs was strong. Many women who successfully obtained a job through the project required carefully structured and consistent help. If welfare policy states that self-support is a goal, clients' efforts require support; viewing their needs and readiness broadly is more effective than job placement alone. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The document contains reflections on the concept of lifelong education. Toward a Model of Lifelong Education (Malcolm S. Knowles) proposes a role competency model based on the assumption that the purpose of education is the development of competencies for performing various human roles. Lifelong Learning and Our Schools (Karl-Heinz Flechsig) suggests that instructional socialization is one of the major aspects of schooling that should be taken into account inorder to achieve the aspirations of lifelong education. The Bridge Between Schooling and Adult Education (Paul H. Sheats) emphasizes the interaction between schooling and adult education along the temporal and spatial dimensions. Another dimension, the depth dimension, is discussed in The Inner Continuum (J. R. Kidd).  Lifelong Education and Creativity (Michael Bogdan) views the creative aspect of education as the dialectic ability to surpass oneself. The historical and social contexts of lifelong education are discussed in Lifelong Integrated Education (Michiya Shimbori). On Learning Strategies for Lifelong Education (R. H. Dave) discusses styles for accomplishing the goals of lifelong education. R. H. Dave's list of concept characteristics of lifelong education with their implications for school curriculum and a 62-item annotated bibliography are included. (Author/EC)",

These influences include: professional dissatisfaction; leadership groups, including legislative bodies and professional organizations; current issues and trends, including career education, mainstreaming, and competency based teacher education; and a number of specific influences that affect teacher education. The abstract section of the document is divided into the following topics: (1) issues and trends in vocational and special education (books, papers, and articles covering: some issues in vocational education, mainstreaming--alternatives to special education classes, and the new school population--the severely  handicapped); (2) selected programs for special needs students (mostly descriptions of programs); (3) issues in the area of competency based teacher education (including competency based teacher education, competency identification for vocational teacher education, and competency identification for special teacher education); and (4) existing university-level personnel preparation programs (giving program descriptions, location, and contact person). Each abstract includes the title, author, publication, and date. A glossary of terms used in special education and vocational education is included. (EC)",

Reliable data are necessary to present accurate reports to various State and Federal agencies and to provide answers to questions that are of major concern to legislators. Data are needed in the areas of: (1) target groups, (2) curriculum, (3) qualifications of personnel, (4) circumstances and facilities for vocational preparation, (5) processes for assessing vocational education programs, and (6) costs and benefits of vocational education programs as compared with other educational programs. Project EDNEED focused on two areas: (1) the identification of important questions concerning vocational education and the data elements  needed to provide the answers, and (2) an assessment of the extent to which States collect such data. Much of the project has already been completed and the EDNEED data classification prepared. Further needs identified by the project include: (1) policies to guide vocational educators, (2) an operating system of vocational information, (3) comparison of data to guide future data gathering, (4) an intensive study of data collection, (5) a dictionary of vocational terms, (6) coordination of data with other fields, and (7) determination of actual costs.

A variety of formats was used to contact some of those who had been students between 1968 and 1974, including: door-to-door survey, with 121 responses; correspondence survey, with 57 letters in response; taped interviews, involving 4 students; telephone survey, 150 calls to former students. Results of the surveys are presented in table form and in the words of the participants themselves, indicating multiple variables for the interruption of studies, including health, living conditions, employment, transportation, and family problems. Responses  indicated a very positive attitude on the part of the students toward the center, even when external factors made it necessary for them to drop out of class. Thirty-three percent of the center graduates are presently enrolled in a college program. (LH)",

The first chapter discusses the creation of EBCE, identifies four crises to which schools must respond, defines EBCE, and describes program goals and characteristics. The next four chapters are brief descriptions of the programs including goals, components, and general outcome. In the Appalachia Educational Laboratory program in Charleston, West Virginia, high school students obtain academic credit through direct experiences in the community. The Far West School in Oakland, California, provides direct experiences to prepare tenth through twelfth grade students for entry in the adult world and high school graduation. Community  classrooms, individualized learning, and performance-based curriculum characterize the suburban-rural Community Experiences for Career Education program in Tigard, Oregon. The Academy for Career Education, a part of the Philadelphia Public Schools, includes career guidance, basic skills, and career development in its program for high school students. Evaluations of the four programs indicate generally successful outcomes. The final chapter discusses the potential of EBCE in terms of what has been accomplished and the conditions necessary for replication of the programs. A bibliography concludes each chapter except the last. (Author/MS)",

A survey of approximately 500 Wisconsin Association of Vocational, Technical and Adult Education (VTAE) district administrative and supervisory staff was conducted using a 45-item, five-point Likert-type questionnaire. Tabulations of responses from 360 returns provided rank orders of research areas on the basis of numerical values of means for each item for the State total, by title of job, area of work, and VTAE district. The top five areas based on State total data were: labor market requirements; determining performance levels of competencies for job entry; assessment of individual's vocational,  technical, and adult education needs; open entry/open exit education; and student attrition/withdrawals. Additional comments and suggestions which appeared on the questionnaires are listed. Conclusions were that means values and item rankings varied noticeably among respondents by title of position, area of work, and VTAE district and that the instrument and procedures followed were effective. Recommendations for using the findings are included. A copy of the questionnaire and the letter used with it are appended. (Author/MS)",

The first paper, entitled &quot;Effectiveness of Model Office, Cooperative Office Education, and Office Procedures Courses Based on Employee Satisfaction and Satisfactoriness Eighteen Months After Graduation,&quot; measures and compares the relevance of the three types of office education courses to actual on-the-job satisfaction and performance. The sample group surveyed consisted of 713 Minnesota secondary school graduates who were enrolled in the three courses; 548 responded to the questionnaires. It was concluded that any one of the three courses was a necessary, but probably interchangeable, part of the vocational business education program. The  second paper, entitled &quot;A Study of the Content in Selected Textbooks for the Commonly Offered Basic Business Courses in Secondary Schools,&quot; evaluates the content of the following courses: general business, consumer economics, business principles and management, business law, and economics. The study focuses on the idea that some of these courses might be repetitious and could be consolidated into fewer courses. Data were collected from textbooks published for the five courses. Concluding that extensive duplication exists, course consolidation and restructuring is suggested. (EC)",

The motives of learning, classification of adult learner orientations, and social influences on adults are discussed. A state of the art review analyzes Canadian university populations, emphasizing the fact that the proclivity for participation in adult education is related to the level of formal education attained, with more participation by those who have reached higher levels of education. Institutional limitations in British Columbia are discussed in terms of: course offering patterns, geared to full-time day students; location, making access to postsecondary education facilities difficult; finance, limiting course offerings and scholarship or funding programs; and  noncredit offerings, attended by the greatest proportion of adult students. Professional leadership and two-year community college development in major pools of population throughout British Columbia are discussed, with a list of college roles and functions. It is suggested that the enormous growth of Canadian adult education might be met through strengthening existing institutions' commitment, and developing specialized institutions or agencies to conduct adult education programs.

        "description":"The study examines trends among students and graduates of the Minnesota Area Vocational Technical Institutes (AVTIs). Some of the data were gathered yearly between 1970-71 and 1973-74; some were gathered yearly between 1971-72 and 1973-74. Seventeen selected variables were reviewed. Relatively minor changes occurred over the years on seven of the variables: age, sex, marital status, size of household, handicaps, high school graduates, and relation of first job after graduation to training. The percentages of enrollees from households with parents in professional-managerial occupations and craftsman-operative occupations tended to increase slightly as did household income. The percentage of graduates employed during the first year after graduation has been gradually increasing as  had the percentage of graduates employed in related occupations during that time. The percentage of students graduating from ATVIs has been decreasing while withdrawals and students completing training objectives without graduating have been increasing. The percentage of students withdrawing for economic reasons has been increasing. The percentage of students having only one job during their first year after graduation has been decreasing as has the percentage of students unavailable for employment due to military service. Appendixes tabulate the data with respect to the 17 variables. (JR)",

The section on \"Human Resource Development,\" reflecting  numerous studies, differentiates among terminology and provides general statements regarding facilities, methods and materials, courses and programs, costs, and evaluation. A section on \"Organization and Management of Training\" covers organizational structure, staffing of training programs, the role of the training director, inservice education, and professional organizations/journals.

        "description":"The document describes a project, conducted by Rutgers University under a Federal grant, to help New Jersey vocational teachers cope with student behavior. Called \"traveling seminars,\" the one-day workshops aimed to improve student behavior by helping teachers and administrators better understand it. The objective was approached indirectly, by supplying considerable information to the participants through audiovisuals and a variety of teaching approaches, in hopes of enabling them to increase their effectiveness in both preventive and disciplinary measures. A followup survey showed interest in continuing such seminars; the professional relationship between faculty members and the university was strengthened; and teachers felt the seminar content was useful. The seminar was judged  to have missed its mark somewhat in terms of motivating further individual study on the topic of student behavior and equipping the participants to deal better with discipline problems. Approximately one-third of the document (39 pages) describes the workshops and their evaluations. The remainder of the document is comprised of: (1) a review and synthesis of research findings (35 pages) on school climate, student behavior, and discipline; (2) an annotated bibliography (22 pages) on those topics; and (3) appended letters, forms, minutes, and other materials related to the workshops.

Sample members were both males and females chosen according to their original enrollment in one of the following eight programs: business and marketing, accounting, science, social science, arts and humanities, electrical engineering technology, auto mechanics, and nursing. An overall response rate of 60% was achieved. The results indicated that: of those students who completed an  educational program, a very high percentage are employed in occupations related to their programs; students generally tend to gravitate toward jobs related to their educational program; with several exceptions, most individuals employed in occupations related to their programs felt they could not have obtained their present job without postsecondary education; and those employed in occupations related to their educational programs are highly satisfied with their present occupations with the majority indicating that they would enter such a program again if they had to do it over.

        "description":"The report describes the development and operation of a communal laundry center, or housewife club in Netivot, Israel which provides laundry facilities, a social meeting place, and a variety of classes and services for users. The proposal for the club grew out of the difficulties facing the district social welfare bureau in solving the laundry problems of large families in the low-income community of 6,000 persons. During the three-year planning phase, community workers, trained by the Ministry of Social Welfare's Service for Community Work, interviewed residents to assess their needs and established a joint administrative committee of local authority and social welfare agency representatives. Characteristics of the population and the town, physical facilities of the laundry,  center ownership and administration, and procedures for its daily operation are discussed. Participation in center activities (classes, films, lectures, and parent counseling sessions) by an average of 60 families a day from all sectors of the population is described. The report concludes that the club has become a family center which has improved community and family relations while serving as a model for similar clubs under construction throughout Israel.

The survey covered eight selected VA regional offices. Available information shows that since the program began in 1967 through June 1974, about 207,000 veterans have participated in the program and that as of November 30, 1974, about 26,500 approved employers were providing on-job training to about 58,200 veterans. The following were identified in the survey: (1) employers with approved programs, (2) approved employers with veterans in training, and (3) approved employers withoug veterans in training. About 58% of the approved employers did not have any  veterans in training and an updated statistic (September 1974) revealed that 65% of the approved employers were inactive. Interviews with a sample of 271 employers revealed that one out of four employers needed on-job trainees and would accept qualified veterans if one had been refereed. A VA or Department of Labor program to conduct followup activities is necessary in order to determine the need for on-job trainees among approved employers and to relate this information to veterans.

Three rationales for educational upgrading include: (1) to improve effectiveness in performing crime control functions through better motivation and greater ability in applying systems and technology, (2) to improve performance effectiveness of &quot;order maintenance' functions through a balanced use of social counseling and law enforcement techniques, and (3) to insure proper exercise of police discretionary power. Research to assess educational upgrading efforts revealed that (1) police educational levels have risen significantlyduring the last few years, and (2) educational levels of police recruits in a particular  agency are a function of the extrinsic rather than intrinsic characteristics of that agency. A curriculum for law enforcement education should be based on a prescriptive/theoretical approach. The appended materials (39 pages) present a model curriculum for the educational preparation of police and criminal justice personnel. It includes: (1) guidelines for 20 recommended professional courses of a criminal justice baccalaureate curriculum with a catalog description, selected reading resources, and course outline for each course; (2) a research questionnaire; (3) relevant contingency tables; and (4) a bibliography.

The document briefly describes some aspects of the project, in which employers, administrators, and supervisors identified undereducated employed adults, and instructional programs for them were implemented in a hospital, a packing plant, a Union, and a city public works department. Individual prescription programs for each student were developed, based upon: (1) a survey identifying necessary levels of competency, (2) supervisor interviews to identify each employee's specific academic weaknesses, (3)  employee interviews to determine their specific interests, and (4) site visits. Paraprofessionals were hired, career-oriented math and reading curricula were developed, and instructional materials were compiled into instructional packets in the areas of Health Services, Private Industry, and Municipal Service. Communication between the agency and the supervisors provided feedback. An annotated bibliography was compiled, a dissemination conference held, and a slide presentation developed and shown for promotion, training, and recruitment. Sizeable gains were produced in educational levels among participants. The document does not contain the bibliography or the instructional packets. (AJ)",

The process involved (1) gathering data (recorded adult perceptions of government functioning) by a writer traveling throughout all of the local districts and (2) workshops for Adult Basic Education (ABE) teacher training specialists to further develop and translate the materials. Throughout the process, materials were continually exchanged with the local districts for review. An attempt was made to develop simple materials in the beginning to motivate learners to complete the second section of the course, Government Structure. Stories in the student reader are printed in nine languages. The  staff felt that they successfully put together relevant teaching materials (14 publications or filmstrips including reference and Federal program lists). The bulk of the document consists of excerpts from the developed teacher's guide and student reader, illustrating the contents and the manner in which the materials could be used. Appended are workshop agendas, a map of the Trust Territory, a list of cooperating agencies, names and addresses of ABE specialists, and the participant characteristics form for adult education teacher training projects.

Data were collected through five questionnaires sent to program administrators, program teachers, students, former students, and parents. In addition, 14 schools were selected for on-site evaluation which included interviews with the vocational director, administrator, curriculum coordinator, program teacher, students, and parents. An indepth evaluation of four additional  schools was conducted which included similar on-site interviews and gathering additional information. The data, acquired from 106 administrators, 136 teachers, 4,524 students, 284 former students, and 250 parents, revealed that the objectives of consumer homemaking programs are being adequately met. The appended materials (44 pages) contain the following: (1) anecdotal evidence from teachers, students, former students, and parents as well as letters of community support for the programs; (2) value clarification instruments; and (3) questionnaires given to the administrators, teachers, students, former students, and parents.

Analyses of pre/post student measures of self-awareness and career knowledge showed no significant changes. Tentative recommendations include more advanced planning of inservice activities, more project resources allocated to career education programs at the postsecondary level, and careful defining of the project's role in implementation for each component and target group level. approximately 75 pages consist of appendixes: evaluation plan for fiscal year 1976, reviews of self-awareness and career knowledge instruments, and a review of student data collected during fiscal year 1975.

Activities carried out in the four content areas are described, with teacher comments on their reception by the students, separately for the primary, intermediate, and secondary levels. After pretesting, about two-thirds of the sample of 351 students were given consumer education training. After training, all students were posttested using the opposite version of their pretest form. The results of the tests suggest that while test order played a significant role in determining pre- to posttest improvement, neither test series (elementary, junior  high, and high school) nor test group (consumer education and control) by themselves were significant in effecting improvement. However, a significant effect was revealed when the interaction of test series and test groups was considered in an analysis of variance test. The implications for consumer education of the findings of learning differences by age and topic are briefly discussed. (EC)",

Consisting of statistical tables, textual analysis, and subjective discussions of implications, the report presents a major overview of the survey's findings in eight sections: (1) public attitudes toward old age, (2) public expectations of people over 65, (3) social and economic contribution of people 65 and over, (4) preparation for old age, (5) the experience of being older, (6) accessibility and use of community facilities by the public 65 and over, (7) the media and the image of people 65 and over,  and (8) the politics of old age. The study found that most older Americans desire to and can be productive and that many millions live at or below the poverty line. Considered extremely significant, the findings related to public policy include these: Almost all americans believe social security payments should automatically rise with living costs; most agree that the Federal government should use general tax revenues for supporting older people, and oppose mandatory retirement at a fixed age.

        "description":"The document is comprised of brief excerpts from the Louis Harris and Associates' study for the National Council on the Aging, &quot;The Myth and Reality of Aging in America,&quot; the most extensive study ever conducted to determine public attitudes and perceptions of aging in this country, and to document older Americans' views and attitudes toward themselves and the experience of old age. Topics to which excerpts are devoted include: old age and public attitudes, preparation for old age, the survey advisory committee, the experience of being old, community involvement, the image of aging, the politics of old age, the media's portrayal, and the level of service by older adults. One finding in the area of public policy is considered to be extremely significant: 97 percent of Americans  believe that Social Security payments should automatically increase with rises in the cost of living; also, the conclusion is drawn that most of the older population wish to be productive and have the potential to be so, and clearly, too, most older people feel that their condition in life is better than the general public believes it to be. Nevertheless, many millions of older people are living at, or below, the poverty line. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The publication provides guidelines for assisting developing countries in determining strategies for the utilization and training of traditional birth attendants (TBAs). TBA's are persons (usually women in rural areas) who assist the mother at childbirth and who initially acquired their skills through experience rather than formal training. After a chapter giving the results of a World Health Organization survey of birth attendants in various contries, it describes the formulation of strategies for TBA involvement in maternal and child health and family planning programs. It outlines a suggested training program (including learning objectives and tasks for antepartal, intrapartal, postpartal, and infant care, family planning and coordination with health services) stressing that  the course should be adapted to the needs of individual TBAs. The publication deals also with the preparation of trainers and supervisors and with the problems and techniques of supervision. It ends with chapters on evaluation and on topics that call for further investigation. Each chapter is followed by a list of references. Appended are: titles used to designate TBAs, statistics on supervision of deliveries in various countries, analysis of existing training programs for TBAs (20 countries, 1972), national workshop questionnaire on activities of Indonesian TBAs, and suggested tasks of the trained TBA working in collaboration with the health establishment.

The author, a theorist and practitioner in adult education and a member of the UNESCO Secretariat since 1948, suggests how lifelong education can be promoted and highlights some of the problems it involves. The book is in two parts. In the first, the author tries to show the logical and organic development of lifelong education in its various stages and identifies a number of challenges which require an intellectual, physical, and emotional readiness. The study continues with a number of analyses of the significance, dimensions, and objectives peculiar to lifelong education, and closes with proposed elements of a strategy for educational action. It stresses the necessity of linking together, in both  thought and achievement, the objective and processes of education as applied to children, adolescents, and adults. (Author/EA)",

The training is based on two research studies that identified environmental and attitudinal factors influencing a patrolman's arrest decision. These factors are summarized in tabular form and discussed. The training program design is a workshop using the case-study technique. The following steps in the development of training content and format are desired: compilation of training requirements, selection of training objectives and strategy, design of materials, pilot tests, evaluation and revision of materials, and production of final copies. Results of three pilot tests of the  training package and participant evaluations are presented, which indicate that (1) the training package developed by the project presented a necessary and interesting topic and (2) the format and manner of presentation were judged as adequate or better. Recommendations were that the materials be produced for dissemination and that continuing evaluation of workshops be maintained.

The model also employs placement specialists, people whose background and experience qualify them to work in the business community and within the school structure. Depending on student population, the placement specialists may be assigned to from three to five schools. In addition, each high school has one &quot;contact&quot; counselor who is responsible for coordinating  and facilitating placement activities in conjunction with the placement specialist. Counselors are also responsible for coordinating and facilitiating the dissemination of pre-employment information to students. Through a coordinated program of graduate follow-up it is possible for counselors to serve as agents of educational renewal, in the sense that they can revise programs to ensure that incumbent students receive the maximum benefit from the experience of recent graduates.

        "author":["Koym, Kenneth G."],
        "description":"The document investigates certain physical characteristics of airman occupations in terms of the dexterity, muscular coordination, and sensory discrimination required. It examines the feasibility of estimating physical demands in jobs using incumbent ratings and compares physical demand profiles for four career ladders: (1) avionic instrument systems specialist, 325X1; (2) instrument repairman, 422X0; (3) aircraft loadmaster, 607X0/A; and (4) aircrew life support specialist, 922X0/B. Ten primary physical demands were selected: hand-arm movement, finger dexterity, body strength, hand-arm strength, physical effort, eye-hand coordination, body coordination, hand-arm steadiness, precision, and reaction time. Five lifting demands were also included which covered the range of jobs that  require occasional heavy lifting or continuous application of relatively little lifting effort. Surveys administered to the job incumbents elicited 635 responses. An analysis of the collected data revealed that, with the exception of the hand-arm strength measure, significant physical demand differences were found between the career ladders. The most extreme differences among ladders were noted for precision and reaction time requirements. Results support the conclusion that career ladders have unique physical demands which can be inferred from job incumbent responses. The discussion is supplemented by nine tables. Definitions of the physical demands measured in the study are appended. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"The document presents the first phase of a project designed to develop specific direction, organization, and implementation of public service occupational education in community colleges. A consortium of 17 colleges in California was established to provide information needed to develop a master plan. Four workshops were held to formulate a definition of public service education. A revised classification of public service occupations is discussed in detail. Designations include: (1) government; (2) public safety, correction, and judicial services; (3) educational services; (4) human services; (5) health and hospital services; (6) library, media, and museum occupations; (7) recreation; and (8) other public service occupations. A survey of community college catalogs revealed  ambiguities and inconsistencies in terminologies identifying public service occupations in specific programs. However, it showed a rapid growth in this area. The lack of a uniform terminology creates a problem in horizontal articulation. Two processes which would allow a student to move to different educational levels are discussed. A conceptual framework for a public service master plan is suggested based on a study of several college programs. Appended materials provide information on the participating colleges and three varying classifications of public service occupations. (Author/EC)",

Aspirations, expectations, and attainment were the variables measured, using the Duncan Socioeconomic Index of Occupations, with respondents classified according to race, sex, and residence. Analysis focused on two questions: &quot;(1) do occupational aspirations and expectations of youth reflect different levels of realism in the matter of occupational choice when compared with occupational attainment, and (2) do occupational aspirations and expectations become more realistic through time, i.e. from adolescence to young  adulthood.&quot; In answer to the first question it was found that neither aspirations nor expectations reflected a high level of realism regarding occupational choice, with occupational aspirations less realistic than expectations. Race, sex, and residence controls did not alter the findings. In answer to the second question, it was found that for the sample as a whole, occupational aspirations did not change and occupational expectations decreased, although for women both remained the same. Females showed a higher 1972 occupational attainment score than males, indicating more realistic occupational status projections. (Author/LH)",

During December, 1974 and January, 1975, questionnaires were sent to 209 nutrition paraprofessionals, representing the total number of nutrition paraprofessionals in Pennsylvania. The 96% questionnaire response indicated a socioeconomic profile showing a higher percentage in urban counties, a ratio of whites outnumbering blacks two to one, a large 35-49 year age group, an income of $3,000-$7,000, and formal education of nine to 12 years. The work profile indicated most paraprofessionals work with  31-50 families and had worked with EFNEP for more than three years. Respondents indicated a definite improvement in their food buying habits, felt growth in understanding people and how to relate to them, and found their association with EFNEP beneficial. Implications for extension programing include a consideration of the age of the paraprofessionals in comparison to the target audience and the possibility of additional methods of reaching client families to supplement the one-to-one technique.

Information was gathered to help determine the operators' perceptions of the type of training, training site, and their commitment ofmoney and time. Questionnaires were sent to all food service operators who were not members of a chain food service organization. Two follow-up letters, and a selective telephone follow-up resulted in a 31% return, which did not demonstrate an avid interest for a food service training program. The respondents who were favorable toward further training were characterized by a larger yearly volume of business. Respondents supported the  idea of utilizing the Altoona Area Vocational-Technical School facilities for inservice training. Promotional considerations for potential food service clientele also are explored: in-house training programs for small food service business operators; interaction of the Cooperative Extension Service home economist, the home economics departments in high schools, and the city sanitarian; service clubs; voluntary community youth groups; high school clubs or organizations; and the feasibility of licensure of food service workers.

The TAT ISTT program operations are presented within the conceptual framework of an input-output system which is the systems model that underlies industrial production. This system has four important functions: (1) the intake process (including recruitment procedures; tour, test, and interview; selection of trainees; and enrollment) identifies and imports the &quot;raw&quot; materials from which it produces something else and sustains itself; (2) the training process (including skill training and behavioral training) combines such  imported elements in such fashion as to produce something different from the original state of these elements; (3) the process of placement distributes the new product back into the environment; and (4) program administration manages and coordinates the overall process. The TAT system contains some policy implications for manpower training: flexibility within the total employment process; relative efficiency of decentralizing skill training programs to utilize existlng technical and physical resources; investment efficiency; and overtraining.

Students were predominantly male enlisted military personnel, the mean age was approximately 20 years, and the average student had dropped out of school during grade 10. Survey A included all 352 students enrolled in a six-week cycle at First Calvary Academy site at Fort Hood, Texas, and Survey B consisted of 60 randomly selected students enrolled in a 12-week cycle at Central College campus site near Fort Hood. Information about drop-outs or habitual absentees was not included in the study. A 29-item questionnaire was developed to  quantify the students' attitudes, with frequencies for each response category converted to percentages. Overall impression from both surveys was one of positive response toward the entire API program. Students indicated an adaptability to the informal and friendly atmosphere, being encouraged by individual attention and instruction, and recognition of a difference in API's approach from the high school in which they were unsuccessful. However, students expressed conflicting time demands between school and military duties. (EA)",

        "description":"It is important that career education goals and objectives be clarified and any present inaccurate images by changed. Career education can be defined as that delivery system which helps students develop the necessary competencies to function in the real-life role of producer or wage earner. Thinking in terms of competencies required to function effectively inlife roles is one way of avoiding \"fuzzy\" goals. Abraham Maslow talks about a hierarchy of human needs leading to self-actualizing experiences when their survival needs have been left unmet? The primary areas of accountability for the schools are related to the roles of citizen, consumer, learner, and wage earner; secondary areas include the renewing self, the physical and mental self, and the family member. Concentrating on  the life role of the wage earner, career education must be an all-encompassing discipline which is not confined to single occupations or life styles. A good career education program provides options for all students, not just for the college-bound. Career education, an experiential and multi-interdisciplinary approach, helps students develop both competence and confidence. (EA)",

Information was collected from 10 States selected from 10 Federal regions. Descriptions of the findings are presented for each agency according to the following categories: (1) State vocational education agencies; (2) local vocational education agencies; (3) State and local employment security agencies; and (4) regional offices of the United States Office of Education, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Manpower Administration. Exemplary practices at the State and local levels are listed and include organizational relationships between employment service and vocational education agencies, special services provided by employment security  agencies, and innovative uses of manpower data by vocational educators. Factors influencing the availability and use of manpower data are identified: student demand, personal knowledge, local autonomy, agency isolation, and revenue-sharing. Recommendations for improving the availability and use of manpower data are presented for the Congress, Commissioner of Education, Commissioner of Labor Statistics,, and Assistant Secretary of labor for Manpower. References are included. Appended materials include the methodology, the occupational employment statistics program, and a copy of the Interagency Agreement for the Development of Occupational Manpower Information.

Career education was taught by the regular classroom teacher in all elementary grade schools. Detailed unit plans were developed and published as a guide for teachers. In the middle schools career education was introduced in the major subject disciplines, and simulated work experiences were expanded by the addition of a communications unit. At the high school level the career education unit was continued in all ninth grade civics classes. Other activities, such as career conferences, library career corners, day with the worker, career interest inventories, and counseling, were carried on and refined.  Over 125 business leaders in the community participated as resource persons and guest speakers. Listed in the appendixes are teacher-developed lessons and the frequency of their implementation by school.

The study was limited to 1974 vocational education graduates from 10 Arkansas high schools. Three hundred and thirty-three of the 441 target students replied to a questionnaire. By using the U.S. Office of Education's publication, &quot;Vocational Education and Occupations,&quot; and the &quot;Dictionary of Occupational Titles,&quot; a student's employment status was determined to be in the same, related, or a field unrelated to his high school  training. Descriptive statistics, in numbers and percentages, present the employment status of students as reported by both the teachers and the students, and to show comparisons of teacher and student reports. It was concluded that the majority of the 1974 graduates were working in an occupation in the same field or one related to their training. A wide discrepancy was found between the teachers' and the students' reports of the students' employment status six months after graduation. Considerable variation was also found in reports of employment status from one occupational field to another. (Author/AJ)",

Interviews were held with administrators, counselors, State supervisors, and teachers from a selected sample of vocational centers and comprehensive high schools from January to May 1975. Self-administered questionnaires were issued to vocational students and their parents, and to matched pairs of nonvocational students. All existing laws, procedures, and standards affecting vocational enrollments were reviewed and analyzed. Of the 892 student questionnaires, 76.8% were returned, and of the 892 parent questionnaires, 67.5% were returned. Interpretation of the results yielded the following findings:  16 of the 20 principals indicated that 50-90% of their student population should be in a vocational program; among the nonvocational students, 28% said they might be attracted by different vocational programs; if all school-related barriers, such as scheduling problems and credit and course requirements were removed, not more than 10% of all nonvocational students would be affected; and very few respondents reported attitudes unfavorable to vocational education.

During this year a 5% computerized random sample of 4,369 firms, generated from the six technical community college areas, was drawn from the updated master list of approximately 85,000 firms. Each employer in the sample was interviewed by a University of Nebraska student to obtain the number of employees in each job category and the future need for additional employees in each job. Data from the interviews were compiled and processed by computer to  give total employment, projected manpower needs for the next 12-month period, reason for need, and needs for the following two years. Stored data for the two previous years were merged with the new data and averaged for the three years.

        "description":"The purpose of the civil highway curriculum evaluation was to provide data for course review and revision. As civil engineering is a rapidly changing occupational field, it is important to determine what skills are currently essential for civil highway technicians. The associate degree programs in the four Wisconsin technical institutes offering the civil highway technician curriculum were summarized and presented to both program graduates (1970-1973) and to potential and actual employers for their assessment of the importance of the abilities required on the job. Responses from 62 graduates and 21 employers were tabulated for their impressions of the kind and degree of knowledge needed for each course element in the program. The principal conclusion from the data was that more  emphasis is needed on communication skills, particularly written reports. Conflicting responses in the areas of mathematics and sciences indicate that further research is needed in these areas. As the employers surveyed were not necessarily those who hired the graduates, some differences of opinion may be due to differences in type of employment. The student and employer questionnaires (each eight pages long), a list of employers of the respondent graduates, and a list of employer respondents are appended. (Author/MF)",

A program description and evaluation of the project are provided by the evaluator. Grades K-7 focused upon knowledge about work were more significant than increases in self-awareness. Grades eight and nine focused upon vocational orientation. Grade nine also experienced career counseling. These students displayed minimal increases in awareness of and knowledge about work. There was no increase in ninth grade students' career decision-making knowledge. Grades 10-12 focused upon vocational exploration, preparation, cooperative education, and counseling and placement activities. This program had little effect at the twelfth grade level,  although students did benefit from placement and referral services. It is recommended that the program be continued after an examination of program activities and measurement techniques.

Because of the new concept initiated by the policy statement, it was decided to field test the manual in six other high schools in the State. At the end of the 1975 school year, an evaluation of the manual was made. Because of different situations found in the various schools, some changes were made in the manual, and it was recommended as a guideline for establishing a program in other schools subject to individual modifications. The revised program manual presents the objectives and requirements of the supervised occupational experience program in  agriculture, along with program descriptions and course content. The manual includes the following sample exhibits for use in the program: vocational agriculture supervised farming program agreement, plans for productive enterprises, Dickinson Area Vocational High School training agreements and plans for supervised occupational experience programs (both on-farm and agribusiness placements), individualized instruction program, and improvement project plans.

A total of 36 teachers and administrators took a two-hour credit course in career education, planned and held staff development workships, and then initiated career education teaching programs in their schools. A three phase evaluation plan was used which included: a bench mark study to identify school administrators' and key staff members' perceptions of career education, a study of the expressed needs of employers,  and a determination of the number of career education programs initiated by the key staff members. The results of each phase of evaluation, presented in detail, indicate the success of the project in: (1) creating a better understanding of career education principles and concepts among administrators and staff members and (2) stimulating the initiation of career education programs.

Assessment procedure criteria were to: (1) provide information to assist schools in planning and evaluation; (2) be directed, conducted, and financed by local schools; (3) include all school leavers; (4) provide valid and reliable status information about educational and employment activities of former students; (5) produce a high rate of response from former students; (6) be kept at reasonable cost; (7) supply information to simplify  future assessment; and (8) provide consistent information across schools. The assessment procedure test was conducted in four steps: (1) an orientation workshop for local directors and clerical assistants, (2) implementation, (3) local process evaluation, and (4) summary evaluation by the Minnesota Research Coordinating Unit. The test concluded that the assessment procedures met each of the criteria and recommendations based on test results are presented.

A definition of career education and an operational philosophy is presented and the major components and seven basic goals of career education are identified. It is asserted that the chief benefits of career education will be realized only when articulated programs have been developed on a K-adult basis and career education has become a vital part of the activities carried out by every teacher in the State. It is also proposed that teacher education be an on-going process  using inservice teacher orientation. Also discussed is the development of career education teaching methods and career curriculum planning with a built-in evaluation system. In a concluding section on community involvement, it is suggested that planning and developing district career education programs should involve representatives from the guidance areas, all curriculum levels, and representatives from many segments of the community--the world of business, industry, and labor.

        "description":"The final evaluation report of the Federally-funded Windham Central Career Education project (July 1, 1973-June 30, 1975) in Townshend, Vermont addresses the status of career education in the Windham Central District, the impact which two years of effort had, and assesses the future of career education in the district. The report provides information on the demographic and geographic characteristics of the area, the project's goals and objectives, and special factors affecting the career education project. The impact study of the first two years discusses the major problems involved in implementing career education throughout the Windham Supervisory Union. It describes, at the secondary and elementary level, the initial participant reaction, the on-going workshops, the  utilization of materials, and commitments to the future. Initially planned as a three year project, budgetary, program, and personnel problems became a growing concern and the project was terminated June 30, 1975. The concluding analysis indicated that the selection of a new superintendent was a key factor in determining the future path of career education in Windham. A nine-page evaluation design is appended.

A questionnaire was sent to 3,045 individuals who graduated from high school in 1970 in Austin, San Antonio, and Houston, to determine their occupational achievement. Statistics were based upon the 894 questionnaires returned, with six variables of income and length of employment used: accumulated income, monthly earnings, hourly rate, weekly working hours, employed months, and actual job length. Analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis were the statistical techniques used. A summary is provided and chapters include: (1) study background information;  (2) descriptions of research methods and techniques; (3) discussion of test factor associations; (4) presentation of preliminary analysis findings; (5) presentation of further testing; (6) discussion of conclusions and policy implications. Thirty-one tables supplement the text. Appended material includes additional tables, the questionnaire and accompanying letters, and extensive coded raw data on the 894 participants.

The project planning, development, and implementation were the responsibility of a team of selected staff members, who developed materials and inservice activities over a two-year period. Outcomes included a teacher's guide, an inservice model, and a field trip model. All teachers and students in the pilot school were affected by the program, and two other elementary schools are now involved. The 20-page report offers background information, describes procedures followed in the project's development, lists and evaluates the results or accomplishments of the project, draw  conclusions and states recommendations, and presents demographic and statistical information and a summary of costs. Among the extensive appendixes are materials related to the inservice model, the results of the teacher and community surveys, and a 74-page curriculum guide presenting occupation-related units for grades one through six. Also appended is the final assessment report, whose three parts indicate project accomplishments in terms of original objectives, synthesize the project staff's reactions to the assessment team's questions, and list recommendations.

The rationale, philosophy, goals, and objectives of career education are included. Also discussed in the relationship between career education and vocational education. The goal of career development as described provided the general direction from which the design was derived. The program involves students from kindergarten through grade 12 and has four overlapping phases in three grade bands: career awareness and orientation in kindergarten through grade six, career orientation and exploration in grades seven through nine, and career exploration and specialization in grades 10 through 12 and beyond. All four phases are concerned with objectives in the following  categories: concepts of self, concepts and skills (in the use of language, mathematics, scientific methods, and social sciences), sense of responsibility and initiative, information processing skills, interpersonal relationships, and work attitudes and values. The three essential, interdependent components of the program, guidance, content, and refocus (the blending of subject area and career education objectives) are briefly described. General content and student outcomes are presented for the programs phases in each of the three grade bands. Appended are two charts which summarize the curriculum design. (Author/MS)",

The underlying principles are those of a comprehensive, integrated approach to education, a developmental focus on individuals, and the integration of subject matter with work and other life roles and values. Through this concept, all educators assist each individual at every level to progress toward a personally meaningful and productive career. The status report by the Career Education Task Force provides information on many facets of career education in Georgia, including, in addition to early childhood and special education, elementary, secondary, and vocational education, such components as  administrative leadership, guidance, educational television, library services, adult and vocational education, adult basic education, and improvements necessary to continue the career education movement. The report notes the importance of the role of teacher colleges, and includes information on participation of student teachers in area career education programs. The format provides objectives, policies, plans, and operational procedures which facilitate career education, and statistical data.

Suggested ways in which career guidance can become a useful tool for providing students with the information, skills, and assistance to make career plans are presented for the elementary, middle, and high school levels. At the elementary level, counselors can assist students in career education in the following areas: (1) promote an awareness of self, (2) provide for a realistic awareness of the world of work, (3) assist in the development of decision-making skills, and (4) facilitate the introduction of positive values and attitudes towards work. At the middle school level, students should be ready to explore some occupational consideration in a realistic manner. The  counselor and teacher could facilitate this through activities in: (1) career cluster exploration, (2) assessment of interests, aptitudes, and abilities as related to occupational roles, and (3) orientation of students to high school curricula and training programs. The guidance counselor at the high school level should be able to assist students in planning for their educational, vocational, and social needs by offering career guidance services in the areas of vocational counseling, consultation, placement, and followup.

An occupational knowledge pre/post-test and occupational interest questionnaire were administered to 359 fourth and fifth graders at 10 elementary schools and 238 eighth and ninth graders at four schools. Pupils at both levels showed a significant increase in knowledge about vocations, an increased interest in artistic occupations, and a decreased interest in conventional occupations. At the junior high level, boys showed more consistency than girls during the project, and a high correlation was indicated between pupils' self-perceived ability and  their vocational interest. Responses from six principals and 92 teachers to an open-ended questionnaire were mostly positive, with most faculty identifying the career education project closely with the counselor. Some of the career education activities observed were: an employment service, a plant-growing unit, role playing with puppets, writing vocational autobiographies starting with their parents and grandparents, using newspaper want-ads, group counseling related to rethinking vocational sex roles, and making filmstrips of students' vocational background and future.

        "description":"Focusing on readability and interest factors of instructional materials for adult education, the study examined the possible relationships between performance and expressed interest in individual reading passages and in categories of passages. Passages on one of three levels of difficulty were administered to 180 adult education students from three New York State instructional centers. Students then answered multiple choice questions evaluating their comprehension of the materials and rated each selection according to interest level and category interest. Data analysis indicated negative correlations between passage interest and performance at the easy and difficult materials levels and a high positive correlation with moderate material. Positive correlations were indicated  between performance and interest by categories for all subjects; categories ranked from most interesting to least interesting were: people, functions of the body, animal life, history, and environment. It appears that the readability leveling may not feature all the factors influencing comprehensibility of material for adults and that low reader groups may be more sensitive to interest by category of material than high reader groups. Further study is needed to examine motivation, material relevancy, and material interest in non-testing situations, as the test conditions of the study may have influenced performance over interest factors.

        "description":"The benefit-cost relationship analysis concerns the cost effectiveness of employment and training in the Water Distribution Division of the Dallas Water Utilities Department and deals specifically with 104 entry workers hired to become pipe fitters. Half of the entry workers were enrolled in the Public Service Careers (PSC) training program and the other half received no formal training. Employee cost, employee proficiency, and personnel turnover were examined for each group. Data indicate that although the PSC trained employees incurred a cost of $200 per month of training, they reached full proficiency at 13 months; the non-trained employees reached proficiency at 21 months. One out of 10.4 non-trained employees stayed; the 47 that quit terminated work after an average of 7.4  months. Half of the PSC trained employees stayed; those that quit did so after 12.9 months. Comparing the training costs involved in filling a job with trained versus untrained employees, the savings experienced from an investment in formal training is $12,633 per job, thus verifying the cost-effectiveness of training.

Trends and innovations in organizational development are capsulized for: California, New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, Virginia, and Massachusetts. Special attention is directed to two doctoral dissertations concerning community education at Flint, Michigan, and a nationwide survey of interagency cooperation of agencies in each State responsible for adult and continuing education, vocational and technical education, and  community junior colleges. Likewise, efforts of the 1975 national seminar of leaders in adult continuing and community education (Flint) are viewed as a strong potential source of coordination. NCUAAE members are presented with 11 pertinent issues related to joint national conferences, advisement of State legislatures on coordination in adult education, coordination with postsecondary/secondary level institutions, Community Education Act, adult education program funding in urban areas, research funding, improved delivery systems for adult education, and adoption of a policy on synergy in adult education.

The three domains of career education (learning to live, learning to learn, and learning to make a living) form the North Carolina Career Education Task Force's rationale, which, in turn, was used as the basis for the model. A guidance program with sufficient funds, personnel, and materials is essential for the model to be effective. The career development model deals with the goals, performance objectives, and activities that are of most concern to the development of a guidance-based program within the three domains identified by the task force. The model's three main areas of concern are grades K-6, in  which awareness is the major concentration; grades 7-9, where exploration is emphasized with awareness being a continuous process; and grades 10-12, where awareness and exploration are of concern but preparation receives the major focus.

An organizational pattern for each component of career development is presented indicating two elements, 17 general goals, and 49 sub-goals. In addition another chart shows how each of the 49 sub-goals are restated as performance indicators for four developmental levels (K-3,4-6, 7-9, and 10-adult). A brief discussion of the infusion process for teachers and counselors is also presented. (Author/BP)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to examine the status of deictic reference in the speech of 19 three-year-old Black children. The deictic verbs of motion are examined with reference to other aspects of the deictic system. The data for this study are approximately eight hours of spontaneous speech collected in a pre-school classroom. The hypothesis to be investigated is that &quot;go&quot; and &quot;take&quot; are more frequent than &quot;come&quot; and &quot;bring&quot; in the speech of children at this age, due to two sets of feature constraints on &quot;come&quot; and &quot;bring,&quot; which are discussed. Reasons for believing that the child first learns the core meaning of a lexical item within a semantic field and only later acquires the derived meaning are offered. Use is made of certain concepts from Piagetian psychology in  describing how the deictic system functions for the child. A justification for the use of these concepts is provided. The importance of the study is two-fold: it explores the appropriateness of Fillmore's description of deictic verbs for child language, and attempts to establish certain characteristics of the deictic system in child language, an area that has been neglected in linguistic research to date.

The increasing urbanization of Polish culture and the forced change in Polish society are the main factors influencing the change in the language. Indirect evidence of changes which have occurred in the vocabulary and idioms of spoken Polish in the postwar period can be found in textbooks of Polish for foreigners, written by Polish authors and published in Poland. The new features of spoken Polish can be divided into the following groups: (1) new lexical features (including idiomatic constructions), (2) new syntactic structures, and (3) new morphological structures. The differences between the language of the young Polish generation and that of their parents are also discussed.  (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"The Culver City (Calif.) Schools' Spanish Immersion Program (SIP) offers an innovative and highly successful approach to the development of proficiency in a foreign language in the elementary grades. This approach differs from most bilingual programs in that for the first two years the students are completely immersed in Spanish. When the students reach second grade, an hour a day of English instruction is added to the program. Additional instruction in English is added each year until, by sixth grade, instruction time in the two languages will be approximately equal. Begun in 1971, the program is aimed primarily at the native English-speaking child, although a few Spanish-speaking children are also involved. The program has been inexpensive to operate because no extra staff has  been required. The regular elementary program is taught by teachers who are themselves bilingual. They just happen to be teaching in Spanish, enabling the students to absorb the language in a way that is natural, almost casual. Test scores indicate that students also do as well as or better than the students in the regular English-speaking classrooms in their mastery of basic skills. (Author)",

A primary reason for low language program enrollments is that these students often believe that foreign language study is difficult, or uninteresting, or they actually fear participation; their cultural and travel experiences, too, may be limited. Instructors, on the other hand, feel that their cultural training is going to waste. The answer may lie in using a different kind of expertise. Some success has been shown with classroom studies of foreign language-based cultures in the western hemisphere, such as Chicano civilization. The teacher equipped with other skills and community interests that can be combined with proficiency in language instruction may be  the most successful in coping with the pedagogical, sociological, and economic realities of junior college teaching.

Nine weeks of policy and strategy study at the University of South Carolina complete the course. The second class began in June of 1975 with 93 students from 20 states and 9 foreign countries. They studied German, Spanish, French, Portuguese and English as a foreign  language. The paper also discusses the results of a study of the use of foreign languages in South Carolina industry. Forty-two percent of the original 774 questionnaires sent out were answered. Thirty-seven percent of the companies that answered use foreign languages on a daily basis; 84 percent engage in business abroad; 69 percent deal with non-English speakers; and 61 percent have employees competent in foreign languages. Discussion of the usefulness of foreign languages, not only in business operations but also in crossing cultural barriers, concludes the paper. (CLK)",

The data suggest that children acquire reference to time first by simple sequentiality, then by reversal of event order with the appropriate sentence construction, and last by simultaneity. The use of verbal imitation of some complexity may also be a valuable instrument in the study of child language. Further investigation into the child's use of meanings  together with semantic strategies is indicated. (MSE)",

Some of the conclusions were as follows. Attitudes remained essentially the same over the academic year; although they had been quite positive at the beginning, the abundance of cultural material to which the students had been exposed had had no systematic impact on attitudes. A positive correlation between achievement and  more positive attitudes was obtained on a number of scales for those students who had changed significantly. Students who held strongly positive attitudes toward German cultural traditions and the German speakers obtained higher marks than others, while students who felt insecure of their position in Canadian society, who felt Canadian culture was superior to German culture and were suspicious of foreigners, and who saw only utilitarian purposes in learning German had the lowest achievement.

The approach to the investigation is based on choosing vocabulary that corresponds to the current communication needs of the students, has functional content, and takes the spoken language into account. The need for limiting the volume of the vocabulary is stressed. Two basic criteria are defined for word selection. The criterion of function and distribution considers such things as word frequency, number and kinds of contexts a word appears in, grammatical function, cultural content, and the vocabulary needed for the language learning situation. The criterion of facility in language learning considers French cognates a word may have, and a  word's regularity, simplicity and semantic precision. Four methods of choosing and classifying vocabulary items are described and compared. The first appendix lists the scientific works consulted, while the second appendix provides a sample index card used in the study. The third appendix lists the English function words to be included in the vocabulary. (CLK)",

Apparent changes both in the language situation and in attitudes towards language and some of the causative factors involved in the changes are discussed. The study currently underway, which utilizes informal interviews and participant observation, shows that those who use English as a first language are essentially all of those 12 years old or younger. Noting this as a rough cut-off point, the paper considers whether one might predict that Chamorro, the indigenous language of Guam, will fade when these 12-year-olds are the oldest living generation. The paper further notes that the demise of the last Chamorro speaker on Guam is not likely to be  the last trace of effect that the language has. Some of the characteristics of the English currently spoken there, which are now being investigated, are very likely to be retained. The present paper also considers what internal and external motivations have brought about the situation of Chamorro succumbing to English. (Author/CLK)",

Data on the development of comprehension of these pronouns gathered in two conversational situations, child as person addressed and child as onlooker, from six children (about 2 years of age) in a five-month longitudinal study indicated that the acquisition order of these words does not directly reflect linguistic complexity but rather the complexity of the percepts underlying the semantic concepts involved. Additional data indicated that children's decentering in the speech event also plays a critical role in the discrimination of the relevant semantic concepts by allowing  the child to appreciate the relational nature of person pronouns. These results are interpreted as evidence against the use of formal linguistic representation as an explanation of semantic development. (Author)",

Classicists have been unable or unwilling to plan solid actions, waiting instead to react, or respond, to educational trends and problems. While the entire junior and community colleges movement was growing, Classicists ignored it and were ignored by it; more doctoral-level programs were begun, yet no one really stated the need or market for such programs and their degree recipients. These and similar actions and inactions have brought Classics to a critical stage; at the same time, other liberal arts fields are beginning to confront the same sorts of problems. With these allied fields, however, Classicists have not sought common bonds or paths of  action. Thus, internally and externally, the discipline of Classics has done little to learn about its own goals and mission and to convince academicians and the general public that Classics is worth retaining at the secondary and collegiate levels. A call to commitment by Classicists on behalf of the Classics is followed by suggested steps which might be taken to establish machinery for planning. (Author/CLK)",

Some threats come from the foreignness of the language, others from the power imbalance between student and teacher, others from the student's failure to live up to what he expects of himself. All of these threats produce various kinds of defensive behavior, which interfere with the quality as well as with the quantity of learning. Teachers should try to run their courses in ways which will reduce these threats. A general strategy might include three elements: (1) trying to maximize student security; (2) arranging for students to study in ways that maximize their own self-investment in the enterprise; (3) allowing students, as much as possible,  to learn from themselves and from one another, rather than directly from the teacher. These three elements are compatible with one another if the teacher concentrates on establishing and maintaining classroom routines and making necessary information available when needed, and if the teacher allows the students a large amount of responsibility for who says what to whom, and when.

Peer-tutoring programs designed specifically to serve students from educationally deficient backgrounds in postsecondary institutions are rather new and have been implemented in response to the relatively large number of students with weak educational backgrounds who now enter two- and four-year colleges and universities. This document was organized to provide information in the following areas about special peer-tutoring programs in postsecondary institutions: their development, goals and objectives, academic areas for tutoring, funding, selection of peer  tutors, training programs for peer tutors, compensation of peer tutors, entry and exit criteria for tutees, tutee-tutor ratios, arrangements for the tutoring, and perceptions of program success. Using data of the above sort, the essential ingredients of peer-tutoring programs are discussed. A directory of tutoring programs for educationally deficient students surveyed in this study has been provided. (Author/KE)",

Today, none of these certainties remain. The uncertainties of today involve declining enrollments after 1980, society's capacity to effectively use the many college graduates projected between now and 1980, the future of private institutions, and even some recently established state and community colleges, and society's willingness to finance higher education. These uncertainties are examined in respect to their implications for the financing of higher education. The declining birth rate and the uncertain job market for college graduates have created a new demography and  enrollment projections reflect this. This includes the shift in enrollment from private to public institutions. The ultimate victim of this uncertainty may be the diversity that has been the hallmark of the American higher education system in the past. (JMF)",

The assumptions of effective budgeting should be identical to the purposes of the institutions that are served. Developing a system around the acquisition, storage, and transmission of knowledge, however, involves translating qualitative variables into quantitative ones such as credit hours or learning opportunities, support of faculty research, and public service functions. Even more controversial are the expectations people have about college and university systems and budgeting methodologies. There are three categories of people involved: the users, the distributors, and the providers of  education. Each has varying perspectives and conflicting expectations. Users expect sensitivity and flexibility; distributors expect equity and efficiency; providers expect austerity and accountability. The financial officer must set up systems that attempt to satisfy all of these. (JMF)",

It was a unique process in the institutional review of programs and in the setting of priorities for future growth and direction. There was an extensive communication and consultation flow up and down the hierarchical ladder with input from the president, vice presidents' groups, as well as the provosts, deans, Senate committees, Office of Budget and Planning and Information Services, the Expanded Consultative Committee, the Regents' Committees on Educational Policy and Budget, Audit and Legislative Relationships, and the students. The time consuming and exhaustive  process included a number of public meetings and working sessions in an attempt to dispel the suspicion that the process was a sham used to legitimize decisions already made. Although many questioned the value of this institutional self-evaluation, the concensus is that the evaluation process will yield proposals for more efficient and effective use of faculty and student time.

The propositions are equally true and can be reconciled, or at least understood, and thus handled more effectively than, in the recent past, through an analysis of why administrators resist change. There is an examination of the fundamental factors from which resistance stems, including the basic needs and the sources of motivation, the role of perception, the role of communication, the role of participation, and the powerful influences of culture.

The groups that have demanded, and in most cases been given, a share in the governance of the institution are the administration, the faculty, the students, and the non-faculty staff. The problem arises in implementing the claims for a share of authority. Some recent trends toward a more effective system of governance within this context are examined. The first is decentralization, which may be approached by the development of autonomous small sub-units having authority to bring decisions to a concluding point or influencing decisions and policy formulation. The second trend is the establishment of a joint council or university senate, a move toward centralization. The third trend in  governance is the strengthening of the executive role for prompt and decisive action, which requires administrative accountability and continuous evaluation. Shared authority does not necessitate a balance of power but an emphasis on sharing. The concern is not the problem of whether one should share but the problems of sharing. The attempt is to develop a system of governance that balances the emphases on decentralization, centralization, and executive authority. (JMF)",

Secondly, colleges and universities generally approach  financial management as an integrated function, dealing with the resources and needs of the total institution over a period of time.

(2) Most student rating schemes are nothing more than a popularity contest. (3) Students are not able to make accurate judgments until they have been away from the course and possibly from the university for several years. (4) The student rating forms are unreliable and invalid. (5) There are extraneous variables or  conditions that can affect student ratings, including class size, schedule, term, student sex, major, and level. (6) The grade a student receives in the course is highly correlated with his rating of the course and the instructor.

This article discusses ways in which systems techniques can be used to support the humanistic efforts so highly valued in the existing educational system. It examines one of these techniques, cost benefit analysis, with particular emphasis on its usefulness in evaluating nontraditional education. A cost benefit analysis is a quantitative, evaluative technique that relates the total benefits of a program to total costs of the program. It is an analytic study designed to assist decision makers by providing a criterion for identifying a preferred choice  among a number of competing alternatives. It provides information on how to maximize or optimize a desirable measure of output, given a set of limited resources, including a budget constraint. The two broad areas discussed are the need for cost benefit analysis in nontraditional education and practical suggestions and steps necessary to carry it out. (Author/JMF)",

        "description":"Understanding the financial reports of colleges and universities has long been a problem because of the lack of comparability of the data presented. Recently, there has been a move to agree on uniform standards for financial accounting and reporting for the field of higher education. In addition to comparable data, the efforts to make financial reports more understandable require the use of other kinds of statistical data which, when related to financial data, make interpretation, analysis, and understanding of financial data easier to achieve. It must, at all times, be remembered that an educational institution does not have the same characteristics as a business enterprise. Financial statements must be written in language understandable to the lay person, and must take into  account that the institutions employ three major resources: money, people, and facilities. These resources have meaning in relation to the primary functions of the institution: instruction, research, and public service. Finally, financial data should be reported in absolute and relative terms, i.e., a year-end balance sheet with the totals of revenues and expenditures; and a comparison with a standard, norm, guideline, forecast, prior year, or other point of reference. The use of relationships in analysis and interpretation of the data enables the reader to judge the relative financial health of the institution. (JMF)",

The current growth rate of interinstitutional cooperation is approximately 12 percent per year. This is inseparably linked in many respects to increased levels of statutory coordination and regulation by state agencies and boards and \"1202\" commissions. Examples of institutions and states leading the way in cooperative planning is the New Hampshire College and University Council, the Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine, the states of Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. Changes are also occurring in types of institutions participating. Five years ago over 75 percent of the members came  from private institutions, while less than 4 percent came from junior colleges. Today more than 40 percent came from public institutions and 13 percent from junior colleges, as the membership of private institutions still increases. The cooperative movement is also becoming increasingly international and new emphasis is being developed in the areas of continuing education, military programs, and colleges of art. Title III has made a positive contribution to consortia, but it does not encourage continuing voluntary cooperative relationships. Despite this fact and the little research done on consortia, the growth of voluntary cooperation has been phenomenal. (Author/KE)",

Many of these schools have weathered the financial emergencies of recent years by cutting expenditures to the point where the quality of education is threatened. New measures have been called for to reduce the tuition gap between private and public institutions and to use public resources to assist threatened private colleges. There are, however, a limited number of instances where the small liberal arts college has remained financially and academically healthy. This condition is usually accompanied by a self-analysis program identifying a distinctive purpose for the college to serve. Information on the state of the college's operations and potential new markets is obtained with the  cooperation of faculty and staff. Firm plans and decisions can then be made about the future directions the college will take. (Author/LBH)",

To investigate such concerns, a study was initiated in 1964: (1) to describe to faculty, administration, and other students the characteristics of SUNY/B students and their experience during and after college, and (2) to contribute to existing knowledge of personal, social, intellectual, and vocational development during the college years and early adult life. This document is a 1971 follow-up sample of 1966 freshmen. Generally, the respondents seemed optimistic about themselves and their futures, reporting satisfaction with  jobs, education, and marital status, and having experienced a year that brought mostly positive changes in their lives. Some differences were noted in the experiences of men and women and residents and commuters. (Author/KE)",

Greatly increased state investment in public universities has strengthened university capabilities in many disciplines and research programs related to problems facing governments. But the real problems are involved in a university's efforts to provide more effective service to state governments. These problems include inappropriate organizational structures within universities, unfavorable past experiences in providing services, and widely varying perceptions of the university's total range of functions. While there is considerable consensus about the nature of state government university problems, there is much diversity in the manner of solution. Mississippi has established a single research and  development center; Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas have established special centers or institutes; and Kentucky has often relied on faculty participation in task force efforts by state governments. After a comprehensive picture of the ways in which state government and university spokesmen view the public service responsibilities of higher education, it is concluded that a close and effective cooperation between a state agency and the universities can be a productive and continuing force.

By recording all events in a single protest, as well as participants in each event, in sequential order, interrelationships between issues, participants, protest response, precipitation, and amplifying factors were examined. Some findings indicated racial protests resulted more than others because of nonresolution of previous protests; war-related protests were often precipitated by the arrival on campus of an industrial or governmental representative; racial protests made the greatest overall impact on the campus and war-related ones the  least; black students led most racial protests, radical left students led most war-related protests, and unaffiliated students led most of those on issues of academic and student life; administrators were most responsive in black protests and least so in war-related ones; violence and civil action appear to be amplifying factors in protest; campus police presence tends to precede violence but off campus police presence tends to follow the first violent act; administration negative or nonresponse also preceded and is highly associated with violence; disruption appears to be associated more with persons than with events.

Chapter three deals with a number of principles that have guided the Committee. A number of problems emerge when these principles are applied. These problems include; the costs of imbalance of supply and demand; market studies and their limitation; fellowships versus training grants; training grant  funds to institutions and to trainees; and the postdoctoral pool. In Chapter four, some significant trends concerning the development and utilization of biomedical and behavioral research personnel are presented, including: graduate enrollments and student support; Ph.D. output 1961-74; research and development expenditures; current number of active researchers. Chapter five provides a brief summary of important points.

Some findings are: (1) the majority or respondents live in the local area including Nassau and Suffolk counties and New York City, with 70 percent of them living in the tri-state (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut) area; (2) 63 percent of the respondents are  currently pursuing or have completed post-baccalaureate education at 37 different institutions; (3) the proportion of undergraduates at the New College both past and present, pursuing the field of education is extremely small, while the number of students intending to pursue social service fields is extremely large. Yet these two fields are inversely represented among the alumni; (4) the number of New College alumni who have pursued additional training for education beyond the BA is high. (Author/KE)",

These issues are: our national policy of regarding postsecondary education as a discretionary spending item in either inflationary or recessionary times; the steady-state syndrome, a mind-set that leads to the dangerous assumption that funding levels should not change; the concept of entitlement, and the related issues of a lack of correspondence between federal student aid and state or regional plans; the demand that public institutions get rid of unviable or marginally efficient programs in combination with the high cost of phasing out or converting current programs; and the growing tendency for legislatures to link funding to  productivity, quantitatively assessed. Along with these issues are some that seem to offer no offensive strategy: the emerging dominance of student aid as a delivery mechanism for financing postsecondary education; and the place of Voc/Tech and proprietary sectors on the funding picture of postsecondary education.

The institutions may be public, private, or proprietary. Emphasis on the wide spectrum stems from a national tenet--that there is honor and dignity in work whether it is solely intellectual, primarily physical, or a blend of the two, by the same token, the integrity of learning, of job preparation, can be as valid outside the traditional world of academe as it is within and from a belief in freedom of individual choice. In recent years, provision of postsecondary opportunity for all the nation's youth has been a national educational priority, and the largest single share of government support for higher  learning has been used to reach this goal. Federal assistance to higher education began more than a hundred years ago with land grants for the establishment of colleges to teach the agricultural and mechanical arts. It continued with the G.I. Bill; the Education Act of 1958; the Higher Education Act of 1965, which established the Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant, the College-Work Study Program, Guaranteed Student Loan Program; and the 1972 Amendments to the Higher Education Act, establishing a new Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program that reaffirms the principle of postsecondary education as a right, not a privilege, which must be accessible to all who qualify. Together, the various federal programs help several million needy students each year. (Author/KE)",

Each statement begins with a few items of general information, followed by sections on curriculum admissions, student life, annual expenses, financial aid, and where to write for more information. The  general information at the beginning makes it possible to classify the college quickly according to certain major characteristics--that is, whether it is a two-year or a four-year college, public or private, church-affiliated or not, and for men or women or both. In addition, this section gives the number of undergraduates enrolled in graduate study; information about its academic calendar, including the availability of summer session; and a description of the nature and location of its community. Colleges could, if they chose to, identify themselves as predominantly black, and they could also describe special features or other information not called for in other sections of the statement.

This paper focuses on the problem of grade inflation, its causes and results. Included is a brief historical sketch of the evolution of grading systems in this country along with a discussion of current grading options, ways of measuring student achievement and the uses to which grades are put by the university and society. Whether the reinstatement of conventional (A-F) grading and the insistence on rigorous enforcement of standards by institution are possible or desirable are questioned. It is  suggested that the growing belief that learning is independent of evaluation has profound consequences and could be the idea around which future grading systems will revolve. (Author)",

They also remain concerned about issues of freedom and participation in campus decision making. While these newly emerging sources of influence are potentially quite effective, students have met with a number of barriers, both on and off the college campus. The sources of influence seem to have taken two routes: students organizing separately or students participating in already existing structures and processes. The evolution of sources of influence seems to be toward more student extra-institutional political activity where students may have an advantage at this time.  Student extra-institutional political activity has been used directly to gain specific ends (like more financial aid appropriations) but, perhaps more importantly, indirectly to gain influence through permanent and legitimate participation in the ongoing institutional decision-making processes.

The state of compensatory education at the college level and the equivocal status of evaluation efforts is confused, but some conclusions can still be drawn. Where programs have been implemented with full systems of student support services, special opportunity students showed equal or higher grade-point averages than regular students of comparable ability, equal or higher retention rates, and increased self-esteem and motivation. Where special opportunity students are selected on  the basis of previously demonstrated talent, college completion rates exceed those of the traditional college population. Some student support services that show promise include: full systems of student support services, services that provide protection from an impersonal atmosphere, remedial courses based on specific needs, programs which give attention to the sociopolitical life of the students, behavior modification, course content that complements the nationalistic concerns of students, developmental programs in test taking and study habits, and programs that prepare adolescents in the transition from high school to college.

Geography controls opportunities because the formula of today's GI Bill, unlike that of World War II's Bill, ignores state differences in educational costs. This legislative formula inadvertently minimizes veterans' use of their deferred compensation for military service in Eastern and Midwestern states. Under the formula of today's GI Bill, all veterans get the same flat monthly sum--$220--to pay for education and living costs. The World War II GI Bill provided a sustenance payment of $75 per month and a separate payment for tuition, books and supplies of up to $500 per year directed to the educational institution. In addition, current benefits  levels are interpreted by the Veterans Administration to show that veterans today have more adjusted dollars than did World War II veterans. However, this computation is based on Consumer Price Index data, which treated the 1948 dollars as being worth $2.00 in October 1974 dollars. In actuality, figures like the minimum wage and average monthly earnings have increased three to five times their 1948 levels. Federal or state corrective action is needed to give all veterans equal educational buying power and to give them the needed income base. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"As background for the 1972 Education Amendments, the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) was asked to look at whether a method of federal institutional aid could be developed that would still preserve the incentives of the states to fund higher education. It was concluded that such a method of financing could be developed. The current proposal is reported in five main sections covering: (1) details of the current proposal; (2) the policy platform that underlies the current proposal; (3) attempts to determine the contribution that proposed methods of financing would make to the national objectives for higher education that were proposed by the National Commission on the Financing of Higher Education; (4) ancillary details of the current proposal; (5)  some criticism and concerns that have been raised about the proposals.

The content represents resources for change, not capital resources, but those noncapital resources essential to improvement--people, institutions, and ideas. The Project Directors named are practitioners working each day to implement real improvements in their settings. And the institutions named are not just the major universities, although some of them are included. The projects represent, in their totality, the broad sweep of practitioners of organizations involved in American postsecondary education today. The ideas, although all may not be regarded as dramatically new, often are woven into new contexts and others evidence  untried dimensions. The projects generally fall within certain categories: (1) expanding educational opportunity to populations poorly served; (2) new approaches to aid prospective educational consumers; (3) faculty development and new incentives for effective teaching; (4) improvement of instructional services; (5) leadership development; (6) institutional development and renewal; (7) integration and work and education; (8) development of assessment techniques for evaluation of program quality and individual learning.

In that year the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Libraries recommended: library titles equivalent to existing academic titles; a range of librarians' salaries equivalent to those in academic ranks; equivalent working months, with additional compensation for service beyond the academic year; full faculty voting power; and an appointments program and tenure equivalent to that of the faculty. The legislature approved only the voting and appointments measures, leaving the librarians in a &quot;limbo&quot; with academic rank but with salaries and titles in the existing administrative hierarchical structure. A SUNY librarians association was  formed in 1969 to help promote the original recommendations to both the university and unions representing faculty. So far, however, the unions have been unable or unwilling to negotiate for the improvements desired by the librarians. (LS)",

During fiscal year 1975, savings of over ten million dollars were realized, mostly due to course reductions ranging from 24 to 80 percent and reductions in on-board students. It has been found that CMI training yields better end-of-course performance levels while maintaining more positive attitudes among students. Attrition rates are lower with CMI, and a continuation of this trend is predicted as the system is expanded. Savings are projected in the potential for expanded capability and competitive procurement using the current system and hardware. Research has shown positive personnel attitudes associated with the  integration of personnel and operational procedures using CMI. It is suggested that performance and cost benefits qualify Navy CMI for expansion. (Author/CH)",

One is the urban or metropolitan program serving the four to six percent of the urban population who are homebound, elderly, or institutionbound or who find mail service more convenient. Another is the rural program serving from 8 to over 40 percent of a local population hitherto unserved by public libraries. The reading interests shown by BBM patrons reflect the general reading patterns of the local area. Staff cost is the largest cost factor in both urban and rural programs. In rural programs, maintenance of a separate paperback  collection and creation of a catalog for the BBM program are the second and third ranking cost factors. In most areas, the BBM program complements rather than competing with or replacing the existing standard library services. The conference report includes an extensive summary and 13 presented papers.

The materials were evaluated by administering pre- and posttests to library patrons; the resulting degree of improvement was determined by statistical analysis. An interview procedure was also used with the college staff and students. It was concluded that the tour was well-received and contributed materially  to the general orientation program of the college, to the improvement of the attitude of students to the learning resource center, and the improvement of their library skills. A discussion of the limitations of the study and suggestions for further refinements are included. The script of the audio tape and the test questions are appended. (Author/HB)",

Information and policy recommendations were gathered from existing sources in the general literature, USOE file materials, 10 single-topic commissioned papers, a 10-member advisory board, a Federal advisory group, and interviews. Over 90 interviews were conducted in six locations, including Washington, D.C., with personnel directly involved in or knowledgeable about the dispensing or utilization of Federal dollars in support of children's television programing. This final report provides a descriptive map of the various components essential to an integrated system of broadcasting; gives a side-by-side comparison of USOE's two major investments in  children's programing (Children's Television Workshop and series and spot announcements funded under the Emergency School Aid Act); and summarizes major policy issues, alternatives, and recommendations.

They were asked to describe the tasks they performed on their present and last held jobs, the percentage of time spent on each task, the degree to which their training had prepared them to perform that activity, their professional activities, and their salary. Results showed that while all groups of graduates were heavily engaged in traditional library activities, graduates of NLM-supported internship programs were significantly more involved with activities related  to application of automatic data processing, computers and computer programing, library administration, and design implementation/preparation activities. They were also earning higher average salaries, were more apt to be working in a medical library, and were more likely to be involved in research or development activities. The findings suggested also that many graduates of library programs were having difficulty finding a job in a medical library. Survey questionnaires and data tables are included in appendixes.

The cost of course development and design for business and management instruction is high, but declining hardware costs and increasing use will lower per student hour costs. CAI is now used primarily for drill and practice in mathematics, word usage, and technical skills. Only recently has it been used in complex situations involving education and business theory. Limitations in the successful application of CAI to curriculum development are due to distrust of and lack of confidence in the computer and skepticism regarding the instructional capability of any automated teaching technique. A survey of schools of business administration  and management revealed that such programs now use CAI for about 5 percent of instruction. They are expected to increase their use in the next ten years to about 20 percent. (CH)",

The economic rationale is based on improved cost effectiveness and improved utilization of capital resources. In finding formulas for assignment of financial responsibility to various levels of government and segments of society, several principles must be considered. Public, academic, special, and school libraries should continue to be funded by their constituencies with state and federal help where needed, while new public libraries should be funded by a mix of local, state, and federal funds. System, state, regional, and  national resources should be supported by their constituencies, but should be given state and federal aid for services provided outside their constituencies. The federal government should fund the capital costs of the network, while the capital costs of resources should be born by the private sector or the constituency served. Research, development, and staff training should be funded by the responsible institutions, but the federal government should fund programs to meet the needs generated by the national network.

The exchange has also begun an interlibrary loan program, and has experimented with microform supply of certain kinds of materials and with brokerage of materials for libraries. Given its  cooperative structure and the large scope of materials with which it deals, USBE may serve as a model for NCLIS program components, as a network component itself, or as a resource for several components.

The problem addressed in this report was one of integrating two unlike components into one synchronized system. These two components were the Basic T-37 Simulators and their various subcomponents developed by Singer under another contract, and the Computer Image Generator (CIG), developed by General Electric. This integration included not only the physical mating of the CIG system with the basic simulator computer, instructor-operator stations, visual displays, and cockpits, but also the computer software integration to make the visual scene correlate with the flight instruments and the real world. The  selected approach to integrating the CIG system was one of planned organization. An Interface Control Document (ICD) was drafted early in the program which identified the hardware and the software interface between the two systems. The authors concluded that the success of this effort was in the organization and maintenance of the ICD and the advance planning for the integration of the computer systems. (Author/HB)",

Comprehended in this report are post-secondary two-year junior and community colleges; multi-purpose technical and/or vocational schools and institutes; and university branch colleges, campuses, and centers. Total enrollment was2,819, 583, a rise of 11.9 percent from 1973-74. Part-time enrollment totalled 1,553,399, a rise of 17.7 percent. Full-time enrollment totalled 1,266,184, a rise of 5.8 percent. Six tables break the data down by type of institution (public, church-affiliated, propietary, or independent), by geographical regions and states, by sex of students, and year in school. Data are also provided on the full-time and total teaching staffs of each of the 923  institutions. The six tables, which make up the bulk of this document, are discussed in a short introductory narrative in which trends are described, and projections are made. The report is intended to be of primary importance in post-secondary higher education planning. The slowing of the freshman flow in 1974-75 provides further evidence of the need for two-year institutions to continue their activity in providing increased educational opportunity for nontraditional and other continuing education students in part-time programs.

Over 160 reports are arranged in three sections. The first section annotates 44 of the studies, which were selected on the basis of anticipated interest, quality of study design, narrative sections on findings, and program innovation. Annotations are arranged by nine topics: follow-up studies, experimental studies, innovations, community, counseling and guidance, student profiles, instruction, administration, faculty and staff. The second section lists all studies by topic, and the third lists all studies by college. The types of materials included vary considerably, from sophisticated experimental designs  to casual descriptive studies, from routine reports to innovative proposals. Series of routine reports are compiled separately in the topical listing. Although some reports did not seem to be in the &quot;research&quot; category at all, for the most part the listing is inclusive, not exclusive. However, the file from which this document was prepared does not necessarily contain all of the reports conducted by the 23 colleges. (NHM)",

In general, the comprehensive community college concept as defined by legislative statute is supported in this final study report. This concept includes: the three-part program classification of vocational/technical, lower division collegiate, and community education; the open admission policy; the present system of local autonomy within broad state policies and under the direction of a local district board; and the present general funding pattern of 50 percent from the state general fund,  30 percent from district property taxes, and 20 percent from student tuition. However, each committee makes a number of recommendations which can be implemented within present broad legislative guidelines: e.g., colleges should avoid or eliminate academic ranking of instructors; communication should be improved between the State Board of Education, the community colleges, the public, and legislators. Over half the document is devoted to appendices of data related to enrollment distribution and trends by program area, operating income and expenditures, and curriculum. (NHM)",

Pressure has been brought to bear by the Citizens' Resource Committee to grant the program administrative autonomy, a separate instructional budget, and a full-time Coordinator. This study examines the reorganizational needs of the CS program in light of these demands and the college situation. Employment trends of part-time and full-time CS instructors and instructor turn-over rates were analyzed. A comparison of part-time instructor attrition in regular and CS sections of the same courses revealed that both exceeded the 33 percent limit regarded as essential for program stability. A  descriptive survey of 10 urban community colleges with CS programs in California was conducted; three programs were administratively autonomous, half had independent budgets, and all 10 reported that most classes were taught by full-time faculty. On the basis of the findings, employment of a full-time Coordinator, full-time faculty, and central budget coordination are recommended, but administrative autonomy is not recommended.

The overall LACCD teaching load in fall 1974 was 532 weekly student contact hours per full-time faculty member, compared to 531 for large community colleges statewide, 489 for small community colleges, and 521 for all community colleges. The 1974 LACCD faculty load represented a 4.9 percent increase over the 1973 figure of 507. Although faculty loads increased over the two years, the overall profiles for both LACCD and statewide institutions were similar in the various disciplines for the two years. The largest increases occurred in the fields of foreign languages, public affairs and  services, architecture and environmental design, and home economics. Decreases occurred in health professions, commerce, apprenticeship, communications, law, and mathematics. One reason for the increases in faculty load, both in the LACCD and statewide, was an unexpectedly large enrollment increase in fall 1974. Data are tabulated for the district as a whole and for each of the eight LACCD institutions by instructional program area, and the percentage differences are calculated between the LACCD averages and statewide averages for institutions of comparable size.

The primary goal of the Center is to facilitate the mastery of necessary learning skills in order to support and advance the instructional objectives within the career curricula. Diagnostic testing is provided and a comprehensive student data system has been developed. A Professional Learning Systems course was implemented to apply basic skills to a target freshman science course. In order to provide supplementary support to individual courses, the Center  provides modules of instruction, multi-media aids, study group sessions and peer assistance in an open lab learning environment. Seminars are given to increase student proficiency in skills specifically related to licensure and certification examinations, and career information is disseminated. Faculty workshops and seminars are conducted to promote professional development. The continuous increase in student contact hours over a three year period indicates the effectiveness of the Center in meeting the needs of the diverse student population. (NHM)",

A more appropriate system is individual, learner-oriented instruction. The attempt is to shift the students' orientation from external (chance or other powerful individuals determine events) to internal (there is a direct relationship between an individual's behavior and its outcome). The keys to the success of individualized instruction are: (1) systematic design of the total learning environment, (2) provision for multiple levels of entry into carefully ordered instructional sequences, (3) staff involvement personally and professionally, and (4) openness to  approaching specific problems (grades, dropouts) on a generalized, fundamental level (locus of control). A study is being made involving a sample of 1,200 students attending several community colleges. The basic research design examines the main effects of (1) instruction, either self-paced or traditional, and (2) counseling, either composite or traditional. Data for the first two years of the project indicate that individualized instruction does produce a shift toward internal locus of control in students, if a period of at least one semester is involved.

Students enrolled in 50 percent or more of individualized classes were considered to be in the treatment group; the other students were considered as the control group. Results, although not definitive, were positive. Students in the treatment group scored more homogeneously on the control expectancy scale than did  students in the control group. The average increase in internality was in excess of three scale points indicating overall movement in the direction of internal control orientation. However, a slightly greater percentage of students in the treatment group made external shifts (chance or other powerful individuals determine events) than did students in the control group. Thus, a single semester of individualized courses, particularly to students unaccustomed to such instruction, may not provide enough impetus to cause a significant shift in locus of control. (NHM)",

Each of the 204 students in the sample had earned at least 30 semester credit hours at each institution. Grade point averages earned at each institution revealed that SWVCC transfers experienced some transfer shock in the initial semester, with an average drop of .26, but went on to perform better than they had at SWVCC. No significant differences were found between the achievement of the transfer students and lower division native students. A questionnaire survey of 109 current transfer students was conducted to  elicit subjective evaluations of their college experiences, with a 43 percent response rate. Personal interviews were then conducted with 35 of the respondents. Students expressed high satisfaction with SWVCC because of small classes and personal attention. ransfer shock was attributed to the more demanding course work of upper division classes; the change from the rural environment of SWVCC to the urban environment of Marshall was not felt to be a significant factor.

The subjects were 189 lower division students, the vast majority of whom were declared law enforcement majors. Since both sections each semester were day offerings, most students were full-time and not currently employed in law enforcement agencies. Registration counts indicate that significantly more students were attracted to TL than to PSI sections, reflecting students' reluctance to attempt experimental curricula. Although significantly higher percentages of PSI students achieved A and B grades, the withdrawal rate was significantly higher in the PSI sections,  and may correspond to the lower grades earned in the TL sections. PSI students were, however, able to complete course requirements sooner than TL students. Because the course has open enrollment and lacks the proper randomization, this study's internal validity is suspect. Even with proper control groups, the PSI group's performance relative to the TL group's must be questioned because PSI offers the advantage of clear goals and objectives in the study guide. A review of the literature is included, and the author recommends further study and implementation of PSI. (MJK)",

Since respondents were enrolled in all programs except the pre-pharmacy curriculum, the sample was broadly representative of the attitudes prevalent among the current student body. The Assessment of Student Attitudes (ASA) was used as the measuring instrument. The instrument consists of 26 positive and negative statements to be rated on a five-point Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree). Arrangement of the results by academic major of the respondents generates data which should be of interest to  program directors. The composite responses for each of the four attitudinal subscales, assuming 100 percent as the ideal score, are: (1) Attitudes Toward Curriculum, 62 percent; (2) Attitudes Toward Education in General, 60 percent; (3) Attitudes Toward School Resources, 56 percent; (4) Attitudes Toward School Counseling, 48 percent.

        "description":"Faculty members in most community colleges have occupied a less prestigious governing role than administrators. For the most part, instructional staff have had little say in personnel decisions, and only limited influence on curriculum and other academic matters. Compounding these problems has been the lack of professionally trained administrators. The future of governance in community colleges runs in at least two separate channels to a common future. First, faculty will become increasingly involved in formal collective bargaining. This is a healthy trend, since a fair contract, well administered, can provide a number of important advantages to administration and faculty alike. Second, since the steady state has produced a career faculty for community colleges, instructional  staff will begin to exert increasing influence in decisions involving colleague selection; faculty retention, evaluation, and promotion; and academic reform. As a more professional faculty begins to assume greater responsibility for the educational program and for its implementation, professional administrators will be concerned more with defining their own contributions to the education process, and less with supervision and evaluation of their professional colleagues.

        "description":"The designer of a modern community college must concomitantly meet the needs of those who expect a college to fit their traditional perceptions of a suitable physical plan, and not repel the great numbers of nontraditional students the community college is expected to serve. Many community colleges have been built as an uneasy compromise between these two requirements. The selection of the site for West Los Angeles College took place between 1958 and 1967. Site development began in 1966 and is still going on. Only one plan was considered for site development, and underlying this plan were the following assumptions: a campus should look more like a campus than like the buildings in its vicinity; the campus will collect people from a commuting range of five miles or so, and  everyone will drive to campus; stand-up live teaching of liberal arts courses will be the dominant pedagogical form. Planning a practical setting for a modern community college should be influenced by a philosophic commitment to offer direct community services, and programs to suit the needs of everyone in the community. Involvement of an urban design group as advisors to the Board prior to determination of college type, locale, emphasis, and site seems a minimal first step to meeting this philosophical commitment.

The focus of the report is on faculty workload in terms of the classroom situation: credits and classes taught, student credit hours generated, and class size. There was a general increase in the number of courses, classes, credit hours, registration and student credit hours at all campuses. The number and proportion of classes with 10 or fewer students have declined at most colleges, while average class sizes are slightly larger. As in the past, average class size in general education courses is larger (30 students) than in vocational education courses (26 students). Average class size varies by campus, from 24-31. Faculty workload figures indicate a generally lighter load  at the colleges compared to fall, 1974 and fall, 1973, especially in terms of credit hours taught and faculty-student ratios. The productivity ratios, however, show a slight increase at most of the colleges. A comparison with fall, 1974 data shows increases in the number of instructors at all colleges.

Respondents were asked to indicate the frequency with which instructors used various teaching strategies and techniques representing either the behaviorist or the cognitive field theories of learning. Students were also asked to indicate which of the various strategies they felt would work well or poorly for themselves. There was a slight preference for the cognitive field approach, but the students were not clearly  receptive to either approach, as both approaches received some favorable and some unfavorable reactions. Cognitive field techniques that received at least 60 percent favorable reaction include: concern with ideas, choice of activities, and emphasis on knowing reasons for misunderstood concepts. Behaviorist techniques that received favorable scores include: clarity of purpose and curriculum design, rewards, repetition, and short answer tests. A survey of the literature is included, and data are displayed in tables. The survey instrument is appended. (NHM)",

To identify needed procedures and to clarify responsibilities, chairmen responded to two questionnaires. The first was distributed to all members of the Curriculum and Instruction Committee of which the 11 division chairmen are the only voting members. Each member was asked to evaluate 61 selected college responsibilities on the basis of importance. The four responses were, in order of decreasing importance: (1) must recommend approval; (2) must be consulted; (3) may be consulted; (4) must be notified. A two-thirds margin in the two highest categories established 20 of the 61 given  responsibilities as proper functions of the committee. The second questionnaire asked division chairmen to indicate their comprehension of 53 major responsibilities and the procedural obligations relating to each. Of these, 33 were identified as requiring either clarification or written procedures. The preparation of a manual of procedures for divisional chairmen is the anticipated end product of this study. Questionnaires results are organized into tabular form throughout, and the survey instruments are appended. (NHM)",

This document provides a sample syllabus for a Jewish Religious Heritage class. Fifteen lecture topics are provided, with accompanying suggested journal activities. Activities are many and varied, providing an opportunity for the student to develop methodology and preserve or alter deepseated commitments in his view of  himself, society, nature, and history.

Of college transfer graduates, women more frequently chose the Associate of Arts degree, and men, the Associate of Science degree. Business  was the most popular occupational-technical program, followed by engineering, health services, and public service. Although the percentage of white graduates predominated in all curricular groups, larger proportions of minorities were in business and engineering. About half of the graduates completed their programs in the traditional two-year period; about one-fourth took an extra year, and the remaining fourth took more than three years.

The importance of warm human interaction and the way in which social-emotional development is inseparably intertwined with cognitive development are stressed and illustrated with references to Skeel's orphanage study and to Piaget and Freud. It is shown that the societal value of integrity in relations with others is slowly being lost, and teachers are urged to regain a sense of humanness, to clarify their moral and ethical  values, and to strengthen in themselves a love of people, pride in work, and pleasure in contributing to others. Since children look to adults for clues to what is acceptable or not, it is suggested that adults make a careful choice of those values that they wish to pass on to the next generation. (GO)",

It is suggested that pressure on the parent cooperative comes from parents' diminished respect for the professional status of educators, from new demands for a strict academic approach to preschool, and from the changing status of women. The parent cooperative philosophy of shared responsibility requires that the teacher have the professional skill and responsiveness to direct meaningful and successful parent participation and also maintain consistency of philosophy and procedure in the face of frequently changing parent boards. One essential element in a parent cooperative preschool is good teacher planning which can help parents become  effective teachers. Another essential element is program evaluation which prevents a build-up of parental dissatisfaction and makes the communication of new ideas routine. The changing expectations of parents necessitates a clear division of responsibility between teaching staff, the parent board and the parents. (GO)",

        "description":"This paper describes three interrelated studies which investigated the cognitions, feelings, and motives involved in the emergence and progression of prosocial behaviors. The first study examined the child's emerging sensitivities to the affective events in his environment through data collected over a 9-month period from groups of 10-, 15-, and 20-month-old infants. The infants' responses to affective events were recorded daily by their mothers and at 3-week intervals by home visitors. The second and third studies investigated (1) the relationship between perspective-taking skills and prosocial behavior, (2) the frequency, circumstances, and generality with which prosocial behaviors occur, and (3) the relationship between prosocial and antisocial behavior. Standard experimental  situations were used to test a group of 3- to 7-year-olds on their perspective-taking skills and prosocial interventions. Observations in the children's natural play settings were used to record prosocial and aggressive interchanges and to measure social activity level. The results indicated that even very young children were able to discriminate between affective events and be responsive to the needs of others. No overall relation was found between perspective-taking abilities and prosocial behaviors at any age level. The findings with regard to prosocial behaviors and aggression were mixed. (JMB)",

        "description":"This study investigated the relationship between perception and production in children's phonological learning to determine whether perceptual confusions could account for the patterns of substitution and deletion found in 2-year-olds' speech. A total of 14 children were presented pairs of toy stimuli, with each pair composed of a familiar item and an unfamiliar nonsense toy. The names of the toys in each pair differed from each other by one or two phonological features. The children were asked individually to name the toys both imitatively and spontaneously and to perform a task that tested whether they could discriminate the two names when the experimenter produced them. The methodology used is recommended in the study of developmental perceptual confusions of speech sounds in  children at this age since it is easily administered and scored and can be presented by live-voice without substantial loss of data validity. The data suggest that some minimal pairs of phonemes are easily discriminated by most 24-month-old children, but others are more difficult. Elements which are substituted for each other in childhood speech production are not necessarily the most difficult contrasts to perceive; perceptual confusions probably play a substantial part in childhood speech errors but not all errors are related to perceptual difficulties.

        "description":"An experiment was performed to determine whether the mothers of 20 inner-city black preschoolers could successfully train their children in interpersonal problem-solving skills. The skills acquired by the mother-trained children were compared with those of 113 teacher-trained and 106 non-trained 4-year-olds, equated on initial IQ scores and school behavior. Mothers met in small groups weekly, for 10 weeks, to learn games and dialogues which focused on language and interpersonal thinking skills (e.g., \"How is this girl feeling?\"). For 15 minutes daily during this period each mother used the games and dialogues with her child. The teacher trained group of children was given similar instructions. The goal was to help the children cope with typical interpersonal problems, generate  alternative solutions to a problem, and conceptualize potential consequences of a given act. Results showed that 19 of the 20 children trained by their mothers improved in interpersonal skills, as measured by pre- and posttests. There was no difference in skill improvement between mother-trained and teacher-trained groups, but children trained by either their teacher or mother improved significantly more than those never trained. Children trained by their mothers or teachers also improved in school behavior. (BRT)",

        "description":"Four experiments were conducted to investigate the extent to which infants of different ages respond to facelike drawings on the basis of stimulus complexity and/or resemblance to the human face. Infants' responses to stimulus patterns were assessed using the corneal reflection technique developed by Robert Trantz. In the first two experiments, 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-week-old infants were shown four stimulus patterns differing in degree of resemblance to the face and degree of stimulus complexity. In the other two experiments, 10- and 15-week-old infants were shown six stimuli which represented three levels of complexity and two types of organization. The three stimulus patterns with nonfacial organization differed only in stimulus complexity. Those in the set with facial  organization differed from each other in degree of facial resemblance as well as in complexity. The results of these four experiments indicated that there is a change between the ages of 10 and 15 weeks in the dimensions which underlie infants' response to facelike patterns. Older infants, 15 and 20 weeks, responded to both the degree of facial resemblance and the degree of complexity while younger infants, 5 and 10 weeks, responded only the complexity of facelike patterns.

The program emphasizes an understanding of &quot;normal&quot; child development, rather than the pathological model with which most pediatricians are familiar. Pediatricians are encouraged to use their awareness of a child's developmental progress to establish a cooperative relationship (rather than a dominating one) with the child's parents. Two-hour seminars are provided twice weekly for the doctors by an expert in child development. Each pediatrician is required to carry out a research study related to child development. To aid the doctors in their research efforts, weekly seminars in research methods are conducted by psychologists. Pediatricians  are expected to learn to teach child development principles to other medical personnel during weekly ward rounds, consultations, or clinic work. Through these trained pediatricians, the program aims to apply an understanding of child development to models for preventive and caregiving services in the community. It is anticipated that the program will establish a working liaison between pediatrics and other fields concerned with early identification and intervention. (BRT)",

A hypothetical family situation is used to illustrate that present approaches to day care are not optimally functional because of the dichotomy existing between day care and family life. Historical origins of day care centers and significant changes in the concept of day care are reviewed. It is suggested that federal legislation on day care (e.g., child care tax deductions) is rarely evaluated for potential impact on impact on families. Two elements are suggested as necessary for the development of comprehensive, family-centered child care programs: (1) a broad concept of the role of parents as predominant in child rearing, and (2) new institutional arrangements and structures which enable  parents to assume such a role.

Family counseling and referral were provided as a fourth component. An Advisory Board was established to allow Medical Center employees, students, parents, and project staff members to contribute opinions and information. Extensive evaluative sections  in the report cite problems encountered in program implementation, including poor relations between caregivers and administrative staff, pressure to disseminate prematurely, diffusion of individual staff members over all components, repeated administrative restructuring, and the desire of Advisory Board members to determine policy. Recommendations are made based on experience with these problems. At the end of three years Office of Child Development funding expired, and serivces at the Medical Center were discontinued, but part of the program was absorbed by other community child care facilities.

        "description":"This paper presents an integrative perspective on infant development (based on a consideration of developmental data) which focuses on the function of the smile. From the earliest spontaneous smiles of the newborn period to mature smiling and laughter, a central role was revealed for an excitation (tension)-relaxation process in producing smiles. This notion is complementary to social and cognitive theories of smiling but is more basic in pointing to the function of the smile for the infant and in stressing continuity of smiles following mastery, and smiles following excitation. In unraveling the changing meaning of the smile, a number of developmental principles are revealed, including the following: (1) developmental sequences may be repeated, though in a transformed and  elaborated manner; (2) the infant becomes increasingly active in producing and mastering his own experience; (3) social and individual functions of the smile converge in promoting accommodation to and assimilation of novel events; (4) fear and joy, and wariness and smiling have a close functional relationship with respect to novelty; and (5) cognitive and socioemotional aspects of development are inseparable.

Social orientation was assessed through the mothers' responses to the Bearison and Cassel Questionnaire for Regulatory Appeal Strategies. Each of the mothers' regulatory phrases was classified as person-oriented (expressing the feelings, thoughts, needs, of a person affected by the child's behavior), or position-oriented (expressing a nonsituation-specific rule of behavior in terms of the position status, or role of the child). Society was found to have a significant effect on mother's use of person-oriented versus  position-oriented statements, but its impact varied as a function of the mother's educational level. Situational variations also influenced the adoption of a person versus a position orientation. This effect of situational determinants was modified by the mothers' education. The results were interpreted within the framework of Bernstein's (1961) theory of social learning. (Author/BRT)",

A total of 91 children, between the ages of 3 and 10, at three grade levels, were shown a series of photographs containing conflicting situational and expressive cues to the pictured child's emotional state. The children between 3 and 7 years of age based 96 percent of their judgments on the expressive cues, while the correspondence between expressive cues and judgments decreased to 86 percent for the 9- to 10-year-olds. The subjects' own emotional responses to the photographs appeared to be independent from their judgments. It is argued that these results support the conclusion that children as young as 3 years of age  judge the emotional states of others on the basis of perspectivistic reasoning processes, and that the development of social reasoning proceeds along a continuum from simple to more complex reasoning processes.

Preschool children were presented with a discrimination learning task. Their performance had to meet low (few correct), medium, or high (all correct) standards to be rewarded. In an accelerating standard condition their performance had to surpass that on the previous trial. In one experiment, rewards were externally dispensed tokens, while in the second, children self-administered verbal evaluations (\"I'm doing real good!\"). Learning was significantly more rapid in the high and accelerating standards, and the self-dispensation  of evaluative reinforcement produced such rapid learning that by the end of the experiment, effects due to different standards had vanished. Results are discussed in terms of the incentive values of differing standards and the power of self-dispensed evaluative reinforcement. (Author/BRT)",

Problems with the implementation and functioning of the nutrition program are discussed. Specific criticisms are made about the program administration by the Department of Agriculture and the States. Descriptions of some State WIC programs and recommendations for future WIC program operation are provided. Appendices include a bibliography of medical research on malnutrition, a list of government reports on WIC, WIC caseloads and budgets, a list of local WIC sponsors, and legislation authorizing WIC.

Findings indicate that children in orphanges, homes for the mentally retarded, juvenile detention centers and other residential institutions eat starchier foods, have less staff assistance and fewer rehabilitative programs than are deemed adequate. It is asserted that states have not appropriated sufficient funds to provide adequate cost-of-care increases for state wards; in addition, many states have neither adequate nutrition standards nor frequent reviews in licensing  regulations. It is suggested that these and other factors combine to make a strong case for the inclusion of children's residential institutions in federal child nutrition programs. (GO)",

The boys were administered three tasks (in their nursery school) which measured representational skills, and later, with their mothers, were observed interacting in a university laboratory setting. A significant relationship was found between certain maternal teaching strategies and influence techniques coded in the laboratory session and children's performance on the representational task. It is suggested that parental use of communication styles which restrict a child's attention to the immediate physical and concrete  present may discourage the child from exercising his symbolic capacities in problem solving situations which require their utilization.

Most of the families served were low-income. Assessments of cognitive, social, emotional, motor, and hygiene/self-help development were obtained regularly for most of the children by observing their behavior on a series of developmental tasks. The programs in the system focused on maximizing children's total growth and development, increasing the involvement of the family and community, and providing families with supportive services. Parents were encouraged to help plan programs  and become participants on advisory boards. Day care staff members were either inservice trained or had completed a two-year college curriculum.

The experimenter pointed to each picture and asked \"Who is that?\" Results indicated that infants were more likely to label their father's than their mother's picture and that they did so earlier and more accurately. The data also suggested that: (1) the child uses  a word to represent several perceptual features of social objects; and (2) overgeneralization may occur when there are not enough labels available for all of the child's perceptual categories. Since the children in this study overgeneralized labels in an age- and sex-appropriate manner, their social labels appear to be a reflection of the way in which they categorize the social world.

(2) how do fast and slow habituators compare in their response to discrepancy? and (3) does intervening stimulation produce interference with infants' visual recognition memory? The subjects were 36 17-week-old infants, half were male and half female. Each infant sat on his or her mother's lap facing a semi-circular screen while an observer watched the infant's head and eye movements on a television monitor located in an adjacent room. Each trial consisted of the infant's looking at a blinking light on the left, followed by one unlimited fixation of the stimulus on the right. Each infant saw the same pattern repeatedly until his or her  fixation time reached the specified habituation criterion. Each infant was then presented with a pattern discrepant from the standard stimulus. The findings indicated that infants do not gradually decrease their response to a repeated stimulus, but rather seem to habituate within one or two trials. Further, there were distinct, non-overlapping distributions of trials to criterion for the fast and slow habituators with both groups of infants showing the same degree of recovery to a novel stimulus. Finally, evidence of interference with infants' recognition memory was found and attributed to there being only a single, repeated intervening stimulus. (JMB)",

A group of children, aged 4-6 years, received tests of inversion, reciprocity, qualitative and quantitative identity, and conservation of liquid, weight, and length. A total of 75 of these children, who showed no evidence of conservation but exhibited considerable variability on the four rule tests, were selected for the experiment. Of these, 50 experimental subjects were trained to acquire liquid quantity conservation via an elementary feedback procedure. The 25 control subjects received the  same liquid quantity problems during training trials, but feedback was omitted. In a posttest one week later, subjects were readministered the liquid, weight and length conservation tasks. Performance of the trained subjects in all areas was far superior to their controls. It was determined that prior knowledge of Piaget's inversion rule was an excellent predictor of conservation learning, and that neither Bruner's nor Piaget's analyses of conservation appears to be entirely correct.

Results, which show lasting effects of body weight deficit and markedly depressed plasma albumin levels during the malnutrition, attest to the severity of protein malnutrition induced in these animals.

        "description":"Perceptual motor development, habituation, and learning in squirrel monkeys were studied under controlled rearing and diet history conditions to determine whether the animal's level of behavioral development was similar to well-nourished animals of his own age (agemates) or his own size (sizemates). From birth to 8 weeks of age, the animals were tested weekly on two items of perceptual motor development, visual locating of a click and visual following of an object. At 18 and 52 weeks of age, they were tested in a standard visual habituation-dishabituation paradigm, and from 44 to 52 weeks, they were tested using a two-choice color discrimination learning procedure. Results indicate that early protein deficiency had a strong retarding effect on early growth, and a significant but  less extreme effect on perceptual motor development. Protein deficient animals were retarded compared with agemates but precocious compared with sizemates. The behavioral effects associated with protein deficiency persisted for at least 10 weeks after the diet restriction. (GO)",

        "description":"This paper reports an observational study of the effects of handling on the social behavior of squirrel monkeys who received a protein deficient diet. After birth, experimental animals received a low-protein diet for a 6-week period. A subgroup of these animals were handled between 3 and 12 weeks of age. All of the animals interacted (in four animal social groups), five times a week beginning at 4 weeks of age. Animals were observed interacting twice-weekly. Results indicate that protein deficiency produces a general retardation of development as measured by locomotion, use of space and social contact. Between 20 and 41 weeks most of the differences had disappeared; the differences that did maintain offer evidence that handling attenuates the effect of protein deficiency,  specifically in the area of motor behavior and activity. It is suggested that low levels of protein in the diet during the critical period of brain development cannot be compensated for fully by handling. Loss of the non-handled deprived group by death leaves unanswered the question of persistent effects of handling on the ultimate outcome of nutritionally deprived animals. (GO)",

In daily visual perception lessons, children were instructed to view an object on a card and describe what they saw, generating the necessary vocabulary. Children were then directed to locate objects in the room which contained elements of the perceptual object on the card under discussion, to look at the activity card, and to draw what was  seen. Tactual perception activities were also developed in which children constructed the object. Subjects were pre- and post tested on perceptual ability. Results showed that children in experimental groups increased in perceptual ability more than children in control groups. Some teachers' responses to the SEE program are included.

All actual observation and  recording of data was done from an adjacent observation room. Results indicated that in a laboratory investigation, the presence of an observer does have singificant differential effects for the two social classes, with the working class mothers producing significantly more verbalization in the unobtrusive condition and the middle class mothers verbalizing equally in both conditions.

The sample consisted of 26 middle-class mother-infant pairs who were observed in their homes for four hours once every three weeks. During each visit, the observer made a running record of everything that happened when the infant was interacting with another person. The report focuses on the data on pick-ups by the mothers. The infant measures examined positive and negative responses to being held and positive and negative responses to being put down. The maternal measures examined tender, careful holding, inept holding, and affectionate behaviors. Findings suggest that initial constitutional differences in infants' responses to contact are  overridden by the influence of maternal behavior and that tender, careful holding is most clearly associated across time with positive infant response to being held. The amount of time the mother held the baby does not seem to influence the child's positive response as much as the way she holds him. Finally, babies who show most enjoyment of close bodily contact with their mothers do not become addicted to it, but are the very ones who became increasingly content to be put down. (JMB)",

Recall data indicated no instruction differences at the kindergarten level, differences favoring the Recall-specific over the Recognition-specific set at grade 2, and differences favoring the Recall-specific over both the Remember and Recognition-specific sets at grade 5. In Experiment 2, the same instruction sets and stimuli were presented, but followed by a recognition test. Recognition data  revealed no instruction effects at grade 5 (due to a ceiling effect), differences favoring the Recognition-specific and Recall-specific sets at grade 2, and scores favoring the Remember set at the kindergarten level. These findings were seen to reflect the uneven development of recall- and recognition-specific memory capabilities. The role of particular encoding and storage activities was discussed.

The participants were 10 boys and 10 girls each from kindergarten, 2nd, 4th and 6th grades. A modified \"Simon Says\" game was used to enable the children to respond to eight selected verbal and motor commands with an appropriate motor act. The experimenter first read or demonstrated each of the eight commands in a random order and, after all the commands had been presented, asked the child to execute as many of the commands as he could. Each child received 20 presentations of the eight commands. Results revealed recall effects typically observed in studies on memory development in which words were used as stimuli or responses. These  included: (1) serial position effects, with younger children showing more recency and older children more primacy effects, and (2) better recall by older children. However, since the younger children structured their responses in recall as well, and in the same way as older children, the developmental differences in amount recalled would not seem to depend on response organization.

Half of the subject population had children identified as developmentally delayed/high risk. These children were matched with normal (nondelayed) children in the same ethnic group. Data were collected through videotapes of the child's daily activities, of the parent and child handling new materials, and of sequenced activities based on Piagetian developmental tasks designed to evaluate the child's developmental level. After the completion of the videotape series, parents'  knowledge of child development and of how home environments may be prepared for the optimal development of children was assessed by use of a parent questionnaire. An observation instrument was then used to determine the parents' performance in actually preparing appropriate learning environments for their children. Preliminary results indicated that parents of all three ethnic groups had significantly higher knowledge scores than performance scores in the preparation of their children's learning environments.

Sex of parent, order of parent (which was counterbalanced), and situational episode were varied within subjects, while sex of child and sex of stranger were varied between subjects. Traditional indices of attachment (indirect indices such as disorganization behaviors) suggested that the infants were more attached to their mothers, while positive approach behaviors of the infants suggested a stronger attachment to fathers. Male  infants engaged in proximity-contact seeking and contact maintaining behaviors significantly more than expected in the mother situation, while daughters were significantly more likely to perform these same behaviors with their fathers. Data analysis suggests that there is not a unitary construct of attachment, but rather different patterns of attachment behaviors which develop individually in relation to specific figures and as consequences of specified interactional experiences.

The main thesis is majoritarian inconsistency (&quot;hyprocrisy&quot;) and the demand by the minority culture for consistency (&quot;nonhyprocrisy&quot;). The entire society profits from the attention being called to these discrepancies because this emphasis will be the keystone of a new ethic which will give a more useful base for models and tools for (1) identifying early signs of Watergate-types of breakdowns in the future, and (2) overcoming deleterious effects of such breakdowns. That Chicanos entering the establishmentarian processes may exhibit the same kinds of discrepancies they had initially disavowed, does not,  however, detract from the validity of the insight itself. It seems that minority youth's focus on such discrepancies is associated with insecurities and frustrations in entering formerly denied mainstream public administration and governmental processes. Thus, some impacts of much-discussed subcultural variations, may be specious to extents that emerging leaders are skimmed off, in this process, with the effect that they do not remain in positions to speak for groups from which they originated.

It was hypothesized that by using &quot;community contacts&quot; in an holistic approach for a period of 4 years (1969-72), communicative linkage would be established between professional resource people and local community leaders who, thereafter, would continue to solve community problems without benefit of liaisons. ACIP attempts at integration in the power structure included efforts to assure: broad administrative support; broad legitimization; interdisciplinary involvement;  integrated community approaches; interdisciplinary references; and informal organizations. Utilizing the principles of communication and education which suggest that who expresses an idea is often as important as the idea itself, ACIP emphasized communicative skills. It was concluded that by design and action ACIP was successful, for an evaluation by non-Extension staff revealed that when compared with the control communities, the experimental communities made significant improvement in the social institutions and the economy, developing both self awareness and self-reliance.

It was found that in France the characteristic forms, precipitating factors, and objectives of agricultural disturbances had changed predictably with increasing organization and that similar phenomena had occurred in North America over the same time periods. It was concluded that in America there has been a lack of political/historical research on agricultural violence which might substantiate  these tentative findings. Examination of contemporary French and American farm revolt movements revealed the emergence of &quot;autonomist&quot; themes and a corresponding new emphasis on internationalism. For example, the Committee for Economic Development has advocated (1957 and 1962) the gradual removal of price and income support programs; acreage allotments and controls; and job training for displaced farmers. The ideology underlying such efforts is one that suggests government control has been both self-serving and manipulative on behalf of corporate interests and banking. (JC)",

        "description":"Since there are large gaps between the culture, economy, and education of Native Americans and mainstream Americans, the recruitment and training of Native Americans as paraprofessionals in the schools appears to be a promising opportunity to deal with all three gaps simultaneously. Three model programs which are currently bridging these gaps with increasing levels of complexity are: (1) the Rural Indian Education Program sponsored by the Cherokee Nation and the Tulsa Public School District; (2) the Teacher Aide Project sponsored by Oklahoma City University; and (3) the On-site Pueblo Personnel Training Program sponsored by the All Indian Pueblo Council and the University of New Mexico. The Tulsa program recruits and trains parents and other Indian adults as classroom  paraprofessionals capable of undertaking very specific tasks. The Oklahoma City program goes beyond such objectives by providing university classes for its paraprofessionals and giving college credits for courses taught on-site throughout the State. The New Mexico program is the most comprehensive of the three in that it is planned to encourage Indian paraprofessionals to complete a sequence of courses leading to an Associate degree and to move on to advanced degrees. In the Pueblo program, most instruction is conducted in the schools in which the aides work. (JC)",

Professional teachers, employed to &quot;back up&quot; the parent teacher, help with training, curriculum planning, securing teaching materials, and performing other services which will help the parent teacher do a more effective teaching job. The program design as 2 components: the &quot;mobile&quot; and the &quot;stationary&quot; components. In the mobile component, the teaching adult brings the children together as they move from La Grulla (Texas) to various work stops in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Illinois and continues to teach them. In the stationary program, year-round centers are  operated in Connell and Moses Lake (Washington) to serve the settled-out migrant who is still a seasonal farm worker and the migrants who come in temporarily during the peak seasons. Programmed curriculum materials are used to teach math, reading, handwriting, and language in Spanish and English. Weekly &quot;placement&quot; reports are kept for each child in each subject. The program has provided a significant educational advantage to the children served. This detailed report of program effectiveness covers the instructional, staff development, parent and community involvement, and materials development components and the management for an interstate delivery system.

One of 10 projects nationwide which make up Project Rural, ES's aim was to develop \"a community-centered school\" which utilized available human and natural resources to foster positive attitudes toward learning, provided individuals with basic skills which enable them to realize personal goals, and utilized community resource facilities as a basis for lifetime learning opportunities. Project components were administration, in-house level I evaluation, and instruction. There were 3 instructional components: career/vocational education, language arts, and environmental/outdoor education, as well as adult education. An in-service training program was conducted to provide  practicing educators with the opportunities to enrich their learning and to expand their awareness of new practices and techniques in project related components. Since May 1975, a teacher recertification staff development program has been operated by Union 58. The ES project's in-service workshops, minishops, skillshops, visitations, and staff training activities complimented the local program and provided teachers with the opportunity to gain clock hours of credit toward their professional recertification.

In order to guarantee stability and permanence of a newly developed program, the change agent needs to involve as many community and school system staff members as possible in every phase of the change process. Community members can be useful co-workers when conducting community surveys, needs assessments, planning meetings, and public support campaigns. Professional staff members can be involved in identifying and writing program  goals and objectives; identifying instructional materials and strategies which can be used in the program development process; establishing an instructional time sequence; developing a professional staff in-service training program; and determining the most appropriate evaluation strategy for the tasks at hand.

        "description":"As Mexico's first viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza's most noteworthy achievement was his laying the basis of colonial government in New Spain which continued, with modifications, for 300 years. Although he was lenient in dealing with the shortcomings of his Indian and Spanish subjects, he took a firm stand in dealing with the rebellious Indians in the Mixton War and the Cortes faction which threatened the Viceregal rule. His primary concern was to keep New Spain for the crown while protecting the Indians from want and inhumanity. Focusing on the institutions he founded and developed, this booklet provides a study of early Spanish colonial institutions. Although the biographical account is of secondary importance, the description of Hispanic colonial institutions are valuable in  presenting the Spaniards' colonization after the conquest. Practical application of the material at both the elementary and secondary levels can be utilized in stimulating student discussions and debates on the merits and demerits of 2 colonial powers--the English and the Spaniards. A brief select bibliography is included to provide additional resources and a list of audiovisual aids which are of a general nature and provide broad vistas of the institutions initiated during Antonio de Mendoza's administration.

        "description":"Bartolome de las Casas devoted himself completely to crusading for the rights of the Indians. Although he was never a missionary among Indians, he began projects such as the Indians' conversion in the Land of War in Guatemala, which later became the task of his Dominican colleagues. However, his true importance lay in his role as the Indians' protector before the royal court. This was shown by his involvement in the debate of Valladolid, the decree of the New Laws of 1542, and the campaign for the abolition of the encomienda and Indian slavery. However, the significance of his crusade went beyond the rights of Indians; it involved the rights of all men. Equally significant was his strong conviction that the Indians had a right to retain their cultural heritage in the face of the  invading Spaniards, who considered themselves culturally superior to the Indians. Intended to provide the teacher with meaningful historical information on the clash of cultures and the rights of man, this booklet relates the story of the Spaniards and Indians as seen in the life of Las Casas. Although primarily intended for use by elementary teachers, the booklet may be profitably used by junior and senior high school teachers. A brief bibliography is included to provide additional information, suggested readings for students, and audiovisual materials. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"The conquest and colonization of Mexico initiated by Hernan Cortes resulted in the fusion of the Indian and Hispanic cultures. This fusion led to the &quot;mestizo&quot; culture. Cortes was the bearer of the Hispanic heritage just as the Aztecs and other Indians in Mexico and the Southwest were the carriers of the Indian heritage. In studying the life of Cortes, he is seen not only as a military conqueror but also as a colonizer in which role he left a more lasting legacy than he did as the victor over the Aztec Empire. This booklet focuses on Cortes' colonizing efforts. In narrating the story, the teacher can stress the religious motivation of Cortes, the building of towns and cities, the introduction of Spanish political and economic institutions, agricultural products, mining and the  Spanish language. At the same time the conqueror regarded the Indian as a Spanish citizen, whose civilization had much to offer to enrich what the Spaniard brought. Intended as a teaching tool, the booklet is intended primarily for elementary teachers. However, it can also be profitably used by junior and senior high school teachers. A brief select bibliography is included to provide additional sources which go into greater detail. Added to the bibliography are sources geared to the elementary and secondary levels and audio-visual aid materials. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"The decades of the 1530's and 1540's witnessed the founding of Hispanic colonial institutions, many of which with modifications continue today. Among the most lasting of these has been the Church. This is part of Juan de Zumarraga's (Mexico's first archbishop) legacy, not only the setting up of ecclesiastical administration but also the prelate's ministry among his people. Zumarraga's concerns were many and varied. Concern for the Indians' spiritual and material well-being prompted Zumarraga to establish schools and hospitals, introduce the first printing press, and collect a library. Equally significant and less known is his role of introducing and promoting European culture in early colonial Mexico. Spain and Portugal were a century ahead of other European colonial powers in  bringing Western Christian civilization to the New World. Throughout the 1600's much of the present day United States Atlantic seaboard was a wilderness when compared to the developing cultural life in Central Mexico. This booklet's purpose is to provide the essential historical information for this head start through the study of the life of Zumarraga. Although its primary intent is as a teaching tool for elementary teachers, it can be profitable on the secondary level.

The 295 centers were classified according to: (1) rural--a center serving a catchment area consisting exclusively of rural counties; (2) non-rural--a center serving a catchment area containing no rural county; and (3) part rural--a center serving a mixed catchment area with one or more rural and one or more non-rural counties. Demographically, more rural patient  additions were in the dependency age groups, fewer were black, and more were female than were non-rural additions. Rural center additions were characterized by more lower income persons, more persons with low educational attainment, and more married but fewer never married, separated or divorced persons than were part rural and non-rural additions. More rural additions had received previous mental health care. Differentials by rurality in referral disposition upon discontinuation from centers and in diagnosis were relatively minor. (NQ)",

Lacking comparative data from other jurisdictions, a comparison between migrants and a random sampling of residents in these same courts was drawn. Data were obtained on the: total number of migratory farm workers in these courts, types and dispositions of charges, number of migratory farm workers represented by counsel, relative success of public defenders representing these workers compared with retained counsel for resident defendants, and possible causes of crime by migratory workers. Data were obtained from: criminal dockets in 18 town and village  justice courts and 2 county courts, statistical reports of the 2 types of public defender offices, records of hearings by governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, interviews, and observations. Some findings were: (1) the total number of migratory farm workers charged with criminal offenses in these counties was insignificant; (2) the &quot;typical migrant defendant&quot; was male, 37 years old, black, arrested on charges of having committed minor offenses and convicted almost 90 percent of the time; and (3) the resident defendant was male, white, about 13 years younger, more likely to be charged with misdemeanors, and was about 14 percent less likely to be convicted.

Attention was given to differences in village land tenure and exploitative patterns from those imposed with the advent of Anglo American political control and the long-term conflict that resulted. This conflict was first approached in terms of the contrast between ideal legal systems and beliefs regarding land, landholding, and land use and actual cultural practices in both Spanish American and Anglo American societies; thus, the jural rules were seen as they were practiced in this particular environmental setting. The process of accommodation was explored through detailed analysis  of the mediating roles played by Spanish American patrons, Anglo American merchants and attorneys, and the functioning of the most important territorial governmental institutions, which were the Surveyor General's Office and the civil courts of law.

Twenty-six bilingual Latino (24 spoke Spanish as a first language and 2 English) and 42 monolingual students were asked to define the following words, taken from the vocabulary section of the revised Stanford Binet intelligence test or slight  modifications of these: orange, envelope, puddle, eyelash, dress, lecture, hurry, peculiarity, rule, tolerate, and burn. The Spanish language list was compiled by back translation. Correct responses were categorized according to: (1) definitions stressing the word's function, description, location, or origin (signifying lesser linguistic development) and (2) synonym and synonym modified definitions (indicative of more mature or qualitatively higher language development). Both the first and second hypotheses were rejected; the differences favored the monolingual group. Since no significant difference was found, the third hypothesis was retained. (NQ)",

The system was developed in response to the need for providing timely academic and health information to the schools these children enter as they migrate. Selected aspects of MSRTS were reviewed to determine its accuracy, efficiency, and the degree of participation in the system. Emphasis was on its use for determining the number of migratory children upon which State fund allocations are based under Title I of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act. An Office of Education (OE) validation study, completed in March 1974, was also evaluated. A joint effort by OE and State  migrant program personnel and an OE consultant, this validation study determined the degree to which the system's data represented actual migrant children at various schools throughout the country. It was found that MSRTS provided a more reliable basis for allocating migrant program funds under Title I and that OE did not provide funding for certain migrant children in fiscal year 1975, though required by the Education Amendments of 1974.

In many instances these students, because of sporadic attendance and discontinuity of their educational experiences, have found it difficult, if not impossible, to function in the regular school programs. Purpose of the Migrant Education Programs is to provide educational and support services necessary to accommodate the unique and specific needs of these students. In planning and administering these programs, provisions are made to create an environment compatible with and attendant to the social, cultural, educational, health, and nutritional needs of these students. Program  objective is to identify the individual student's strengths and weaknesses and to prepare a program that will best serve his needs. Prepared for parents, project personnel, and other interested persons, this booklet summarizes the general concepts and requirements of the Migrant Education Programs funded under Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I. Topics covered are: program funding, priorities, staffing, and evaluation; student eligibility; supplemental program funding; support services; parent involvement; the Migrant Student Record Transfer System; bilingual education; and in-service training.

First, evaluation must be recognized as a key process within science, both pure and applied, and must be taught as an integral part of science education. Second, the applications of science must be evaluated not only as a social responsibility and a pragmatic way to select researchable areas, but also as a scientific matter in itself, and thus a proper component of science education. A third type of evaluation in science education is the analytical approach to values-laden issues in a way that identifies the values' assumptions and proceeds to investigate their evidential status. A fourth important evaluation in science education is the evaluation of science materials; this is  similar in some respects to the evaluation of applied science. The fifth way that evaluation enters into science education is in the attempt to list and indoctrinate the student with the supposed values of the scientific approach, such as truth, tentativeness, and criticality. Also discussed is evaluation as a form of knowledge and a form of education, as well as the types of evaluation content and attitudes specifically related to science education curricula.

Some of the difficulties associated with research in this area are identified as problems in instrumentation, methodology, and statistics. Specific problem areas include the inadequacy of standardized tests, the unknown predictive ability of tests from special teaching units, the problem of building multivariate outcome measures, the problem of measuring the appropriateness of teacher behavior, the lack of experience in choosing an appropriate unit of analysis for describing teacher behavior, and the lack of stability of many teacher  behaviors. Further research is recommended on how student backgrounds affect measures of teacher effectiveness, what subject matters should be examined, how normative standards and volunteer teachers affect what we can say about teachers and teaching, how individual students react to teaching skills, how students monitor and interpret a teacher's behavior in ways which may or may not coincide with how educational theorists interpret the phenomenon, and studies on the validity and generalizability of measures of teacher effectiveness.

Results are compared with similar studies which go back through 1967 and a survey conducted in the fall of 1974 of 360 graduate science departments. From the studies, it was found that graduate science and engineering enrollment increased in the fall of 1974 for the first time since fall 1970. From fall 1971 to fall 1973, every area of science showed a decrease in enrollment, except the life sciences and psychology in which enrollment has continued to rise. During this period, the number of full-time students dependent on federal support declined from 47 to 26 percent of the total enrollment. By analyses of the surveys conducted between 1967 and 1973, an overall decline  of 5 percent in full-time science and engineering enrollment was noted. Also, the number of federally-supported students was reduced by one-half. Academic science obligations decreased by 18 percent below the 1967 level in constant dollars. (Author/CP)",

        "description":"To the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the federal agency primarily responsible for the conduct of biomedical research, the Survey of Graduate Science Student Support and Postdoctorals is important because it provides information concerning bioscience research manpower projections. To policymakers in NIH, the two main components of the survey enrollment and financial support, are of great interest. This paper deals primarily with two assumptions which can be made concerning enrollment and financial aid: (1) first-year enrollment is a predictor of Ph.D. output, and (2) support affects both graduate enrollments and Ph.D. production. Data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates tend to provide a correlation for the first assumption, although the ratio of Ph.D.'s per 100 first-year  graduate students has declined from 31.1 in 1961 to 25.0 in 1967. This factor may be a result of an increase in the time needed to complete the degree, for the survey is based on a six year time lag. The author also states that assumption two, although not as easily illustrated, appears to hold a positive correlation. (CP)",

A questionnaire was mailed in February 1974 to the principals of all senior high, junior/senior high, and K-12 schools. The investigators were interested in finding out how much environmental education was offered, content areas, how it was taught, subject matter necessary for teacher preparation, priorities of environmental problems, and importance in the high school curriculum. A few of the major findings were: 6.5 percent of the 366 schools offered courses designated as environmental education; 21 percent offered courses although not so designated. Class enrollment ranged from 10 to 60 and average  number of course offerings was there. Subject areas most often taught included water and air pollution, forest conservation, soil conservation, and wildlife conservation. Topic emphasis lead researchers to conclude that in Indiana high schools, conservation was environmental education. Recommendations called for the implementation of a nation-wide environmental education plan. Suggestions include a national conference of leaders to give direction to curriculum efforts, a test to students to determine environmental knowledge, inservice and preservice workshops, textbook revisions, etc. An annotated bibliography is provided.

The University of Michigan's Institute for Environmental Quality focuses resources on problems associated with improving the quality of the environment through support of multidisciplinary teaching, research, and service activities. Utah State's Environment and Man Program  provides faculty, staff, and students with interdisciplinary research and educational opportunities to study environmental problems in Utah and the Rocky Mountain Region. Environmental studies at the University of California, Davis, center on ecology and involve undergraduate and graduate instruction, research, and public service.

Instruction was divided into two parts, each part being a lesson. The first lesson  presents the defining attributes and teaches children labels for defining attributes. The second lesson presents the definition of &quot;trees,&quot; presents a rational set of examples and nonexamples, and teaches a strategy for evaluating whether or not an instance is an example of the concept. Active involvement and immediate feedback are provided for the student in both lessons. (Author/CP)",

The studies represent research into the interrelated problem of the processes involved in media effects and age-related differences. In the first study an action-adventure program, in which a character's reputation and loved ones were threatened, was edited into two versions and shown to two sample groups. In one version the hero responded with physical aggression and in the other with constructive nonviolent efforts. The second study focused on the effects of ambiguity in the dramatic context for modeled aggressive behavior. One version of a program presented the aggressive character as unequivocally evil, while a second version presented scenes which  made him appear both good and bad. The third study examined how the dramatic context in which aggression appears can modify the negative effects of aggression. Results indicate that the character who uses constructive coping strategies may have more impact on young viewers than violent character; that the dramatic context of a program can modify the impact of the aggressive action; and that if young viewers see an aggressive character with both good and bad qualities, the impact of his aggression is greater.

The framework, descriptive in nature, is comprised of five conceptually distinct historical traditions in elementary-level social studies: (1) social studies as knowledge for the sake of knowledge, (2) social studies in the child-centered tradition, (3) social studies as reflective inquiry, (4) social studies as structure of the disciplines, and (5) social studies as sociopolitical involvement. The five traditions were identified and developed through a systematic search of the literature in social studies education from the 1890s to the present. Recognizing that specific curricular components determine to a large degree the  direction of social studies education, the following six curricular components were selected and used in delineating the traditions constituting the framework: (1) citizenship education; (2) student maturity; (3) selection of content; (4) use of content; (5) significant others including publishing companies, social studies projects, methods teachers, and community members; and (6) evaluation of teachers and students. Each component is discussed in light of the role it has played in a particular tradition. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"A microeconomic simulation game, called Micro-Economy, is discussed. The game approach was developed to provide students and educators an opportunity to express the aspirations, values, and principles of the people living in an environment. By following a microeconomic model, Society School, students create microinstitutions for their society at school. Several uses of the simulation in various schools are reported. Some noted qualities of the model are (1) teachers will find this model attractive because it allows them to bring real world experiences into the classroom and to demonstrate the connection between competency in traditional language and mathematics skills and success in the social system that evolves; (2) the program gives students access to new ways to think about  themselves and their own competencies; (3) the model offers grounding in commercial, legal, and political practice; and (4) the central unity of the experience of institution building emerges within the domain of human values. Possible research issues are given for each characteristic. Micro-Economy is available from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich's Center for Curriculum Design for $39.00. The game and its development are described in \"The Micro-Society School: A Real World in Miniature,\" Harper and Row, 1973, $7.95 hardcover, $2.50 paperback. (Author/ND)",

The tips offered in this publication, written by seven authors, are intended to help teacheres deal with both content and teaching strategies in American history. Each of five actual lessons provides examples of how to incorporate nontraditional subject matter using a structured inquiry approach into the regular American history curriculum. The structured inquiry approach requires the teacher, rather than the student, to select the content of the lesson and to predetermine the structure of the learning activity. The teacher does not have final answers but has a framework in which most student inquiry can  occur. Chapter 1 introduces the work by examining reasons and processes for teaching history. Chapter 2 uses a role-play activity for examining the social history of American industrialization. Chapter 3 presents an interdisciplinary social science approach to the study of the American Revolution. Chapter 4 uses comparative data from other societies to illuminate the issue of American slavery. Chapter 5 describes several methods for active inquiry into local history. Chapter 6 provides short activities for developing information search skills. Chapter 7 contains an annotated list of American history resources including games, audiovisual materials, collections of documents, journals, and teacher resources. (Author/DE)",

Fourth, seventh, and tenth graders viewed one of these versions or a wildlife documentary. They were then given an opportunity to either \"help\" or \"hurt\" a peer who was completing a task. At all three grade levels, children who had seen models of constructive coping showed greater frequency and duration of prosocial responding than subjects in other conditions. The results indicate  that viewing modeled constructive responses to provocation enhances general prosocial responding and inhibits aggressive behavior. (Author/DE)",

Second and sixth graders viewed one of two edited versions of an aggressive television program: (1) one in which scenes relevant to motives and consequences were clearly negative, and (2) one in which the aggressor sometimes appeared negative and positive. There were nonaggressive control programs at each age. Random subgroups of children responded to an indication of willingness to hurt or help a fictitious other child, while other random subgroups responded to a paper-and-pencil instrument  employing both aggressive and nonaggressive response alternatives to hypothetical situations. The results indicate that children who watched the program with mixed character motivations are more aggressive. Therefore, the effects of aggression on television are not only modified by motives and consequences in the program, but also depend on their uniformity. (Author/DE)",

By simulating the evaluation of policies in terms of social indicators, STAPOL (State Policy) provides insight into the possible future application of such indicators in real-world policy planning and analysis. Participants play the roles of state legislator, societal evaluator, or exogenous-event assessor. From the point of view of these roles, each player is concerned with the ongoing quality of life including environment, health care, education, culture, and standard of living. The actual play of the game focuses on  the attempts of the state legislators to increase, through legislative actions, the level of quality of life. The index levels of this quality, in turn, are set by the combined efforts of the societal evaluators, who judge the impact of legislative actions on various societal groups, and the exogenous-event assessors, who determine how certain societal and technological events affect conditions independent of the actions of the planners. Learning objectives and suggestions for how the game can be used are included. (Author/DE)",

The consensus of all involved in the discussion was that the core philosophy of the university must be pragmatic rather than theoretical, using knowledge to solve global problems. One outgrowth of the colloquium was to have the Academy of World Studies act as a clearinghouse and information center for those wishing to promote the development of the university.

The document begins with an historical view from other cultures and other times. Chapter two briefly looks at the American system of justice, including handling criminals and juveniles, the purpose of the courts, and the role of the correctional procedure. The next two chapters present selected issues which the criminal justice system faces as it attempts to combat crime and cooperate with local, state, and national government. These issues are presented for the purpose of highlighting the processes and the procedures the system uses as it works with minorities, women, juveniles, and individual rights.  Following that is a chapter on the criminal justice system as viewed by the police, the courts, and the criminal. Within each chapter are organizing questions and learning activities which supplement the readings. Several appendices conclude the document, including a selected bibliography (Author/JR)",

The entire RESS project will be available through ERIC and consists of six classroom material packages for grades 1-6, four of which are multimedia teacher training kits. This first booklet contains four major sections which assist the teacher of RESS materials and the parents of children studying the materials. Consisting of a booklet and one audio-cassette (not available through ERIC), this first unit of the kit presents the Supreme Court's opinion on the Schempp and Murray cases for analysis, offers diverse definitions of  religion so that participants may refine their own definition, discusses several views of objectivity in light of the Court's usage in the context of religion study, and urges participants to develop and warrant their views on religion study in elementary social studies. Audiovideo tapes supplement the materials and are available from the Division of Instructional Research and Service, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306, after August 1976. The second part of the document is an evaluation report of the materials of Kit 1 by religion scholars and educators and by 100 preservice teachers in university classes. (Author/JR)",

Four innovative pedagogical techniques are used: (1) a mastery approach, (2) formative evaluation, (3) a modified pyramid-like structure using small group discussion leaders, and (4) supplemental readings. Posttest data from two large lecture classes using these innovations are contrasted with posttest data from the smaller class that did not use them. The results of the posttest and a survey of students' opinions of the innovations indicate that large lecture classes do not have to be a negative educational experience for undergraduate college students. From both a cognitive and affective  point of view, students gain more knowledge and prefer the experience of a large class if it is structured in this appropriate manner. Making use of formative evaluation, small group meetings, discussion leaders, supplemental readings, and the mastery approach can efficiently achieve educational goals and enhance the student's experience in a large class structure.

The emphasis of the research is to improve art education through a better psychological understanding of symbol systems and media of art and through better understanding of the perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes involved in dealing with art. This third technical report in the series studies whether preadolescent children can learn to classify paintings consistently by style or by figure. Subjects at the seven- and ten-year age level were given a pretest, a seven-week training session, and a number of post- and transfer tests. Children at both age levels demonstrated the ability to sort paintings according to a  consistent criterion. The older group could more readily alter the basis of its classification and their style sensitivity was not found to be dependent on concrete operational thought. Results of transfer tests given to the experimental and control group indicated that practice in looking at pictures may increase sensitivity to the textural aspects of visual display. (Author/DE)",

The results indicate that all age levels showed some sensitivity, with the three oldest age groups performing at a level which was significantly higher than the two younger age groups. Younger children showed a significant tendency to focus on a dominant figure and had strict criteria for judgments of style similarity.

The three papers in this report all concern the bearing of projective geometry on the perceptual processes by which pictures are &quot;read&quot; for spatial information. The first paper describes the human inclination to interpret pictures as representing rectilinear forms when, from a geometric standpoint, they might represent nonrectilinear forms. The second paper studies how the visual system compensates for pictures seen at an oblique angle, rather than perpendicularly. The third paper examines how viewers readily and consistently interpret simple line drawings as space forms, even though conventional depth cues  such as perspective, occlusion, or &quot;familiarity&quot; may be absent. Throughout these papers, the logical ambiguity of line drawings--their lack of distinct three-dimensional information--is stressed together with the active role of the visual system in making assumptions to resolve this ambiguity.

It outlines the symbol relations involved in such &quot;program devices&quot; as expression, description, naming, quotation, and representation in order to study whether music expresses like words, pictures, or metaphors of a nonliteral form. Though each type of reference differs from the others, they all involve denotation of or by music. This paper particularly emphasizes the analysis of music denoting in the context of programme music and opera. Primary attention  is given to (1) syntactic and semantic features of musical names and description, (2) the status of semifictional compliants of naming motifs in opera, (3) analysis of the expressive and descriptive aspects of programme music, and (4) the mechanisms of musical allusion and quotation.

This study summarizes the content and practical procedures of a series of lecture-performances in different arts performed before a target audience. The lecture-performance offers an alternative to the dominant and largely unexamined assumption that the best way to build alert audiences is to produce skilled amateurs. The goal of the series was to expose the artist at work so vividly that the audience would be caught up in the artist's process of exploring and choosing between alternative ideas and means of expression. Artists usually demonstrated alternative approaches to the same object, presented and  discussed some unfinished works, and included some successful finished works. Descriptions of the dozen presentations conclude the author's case that to become an &quot;audience&quot; is a responsible vocation requiring special preparation. (Author/DE)",

The aims of the course are to introduce students to open classrooms, to introduce a developmental approach for the teaching of a sense of history, to offer students a chance to use the techniques in an open classroom style, and to develop a learning group workshop format to contribute to the growing body of literature on open classroom teaching. The course takes a humanistic approach to education and examines the following major topics: (1) the development of a personal sense of history, (2) the developmental approach, (3) the contract system, (4) the modular syllabus, and (5) unified educational philosophy and techniques. Sample diagnostic  and performance forms and learning activities are incorporated throughout the document. One other diagnostic test is available as SO 008 710. (Author/JR)",

Objectives of the ethnic studies project were to (1) continue the ongoing statewide oral history project, (2) implement a pilot program or demonstration project on the incorporation of existing relevant Afro-American materials into the current instructional program in social studies and humanities, (3) disseminate the instructional materials to participating schools for classroom use and evaluation, (4) provide inservice training for a pilot group of 15 high school teachers, and (5) develop instructional units and media materials dealing with black awareness. The document includes the agenda and  guidelines from the teacher workshop for incorporating black literature in the high school curriculum, as well as a selective bibliography of appropriate materials. Following the report are eight instructional units which were developed to incorporate black materials into United States government and American history courses, American literature, speech and choral reading, and poetry and biography courses. The units include philosophy, goals, objectives, outline of course, appropriate materials, and activities. (Author/JR)",

The articles deal specifically with the crises of a rapidly growing world population, a worsening world food situation, and an energy crisis. A number of specific recommendations, both national and international, are offered to improve the precarious world-food situation. Following an introductory article on these problems, the second article calls for a global effort to help solve the problems through the continued efforts of the United Nations General Assembly's World Food Conference. The third article calls for a buildup of food stocks to give the world a security against serious food shortages through a coordinated system of national reserve stocks of  cereals in both developed and developing countries. The following article calls attention to the problems of food in relation to the growing population--problems of both quantity and distribution. Also included is a Declaration on Food and Population presented to the United Nations on April 25, 1974. The problem of the world fertilizer shortage which threatens food supplies is discussed in another article. Other articles deal with food, nutrition, family health, and family responsibilities.

Considering that the university is still in the early stages of policy planning, the seminar was one means of demonstrating that there are people and organizations who support the university. Topics for discussions included: (1) What Is the United Nations University? (2) Can the United Nations University Become a Vehicle of World Education? (3) How Can World Citizens Foster Planetary Consciousness through the University? (4) Curriculum: Global Problems and Priorities, (5) The University as a Communications Center, (6) Research Priorities, and (7) How Can People Become Involved in the United Nations University? In discussing the university's status and future potential,  the participants recommended that research should be multidisciplinary; the university should adopt a holistic approach to problem solving of global issues affecting mankind; the university should become a vehicle for the reorientation of education toward preparing students for life in a world community; and in order to effectively meet its objectives, the university should enlist the support of existing research organizations, universities, and nongovernment organizations.

The purpose of this study is to identify significant attributes of classroom activity and organization relevant to the concepts of \"traditional\" and \"open\" and to see whether these attributes can be used to derive meaningful classroom types. Fifty fourth-grade public school classrooms in Montgomery County, Maryland were observed eight times for specific behavioral categories referring to general organization and activity, teacher behavior, student behavior, and classroom atmosphere. Results indicate that there are three basic classroom types of approximately equal numbers. The first type was  characterized as \"open\" and included elements of student autonomy, individualized student-teacher interaction, emphasis on student creativity and involvement, and a warm, friendly atmosphere. The second, more traditional classroom type was characterized by tight teacher control, little student autonomy, cold and critical atmosphere, and an emphasis on individual work on convergent tasks. The third classroom type was a combination of the open and traditional where teachers stimulated student interest by their own relatively flamboyant classroom performance. (Author/DE)",

The student body, faculty, and administration responded to a 37-item questionnaire which examined their attitudes toward student government activities and importance in school decision making. The results indicate that a majority of the students and faculty felt that students were not involved in the decision-making process even though the prinicipal felt that they were. Students were disenchanted with the performance of the student council, did not feel that the council solicited their opinions, and did not think that the council served as a link between the students and the administration. While activities to increase student input into  student council activities were initiated, efforts at increasing student input into the decision-making process met with little response from the administration even though the principal agreed to meet with council representatives every two weeks.

The study is based on ten months of participant observation in an Irish-speaking village of Southwest Kerry, combined with weekly visits to the county mental hospital. The author uses a comparison of selected themes in four cards of the Thematic Apperception Test, which was administered in its entirety to 36 normal village adolescents between 15 and 19 years and to 22 single mental patients of both sexes between the ages of 15 and 35. The author concludes that the cost of inheriting the land and perpetuating the rural culture with its demands of an austere lifestyle leaves the Kerry adolescent and young adult few options.  Among these are escape through emigration, stoical acceptance via repression, or periodic maladjustment during which times the delicate balance tips and the normally repressed individual is flooded with uncontrollable angers, resentments, and felt needs for attachment and intimacy with the absent or nonexistant &quot;significant others&quot; in his life.

The first questionnaire surveyed student comparison of social studies with other school subjects; assessment of preference for various teaching methods and materials; and evaluation of such course characteristics as realism, analytic emphasis, and objectives. The second questionnaire measured student attitudes toward contemporary and future American society and included questions on family, marriage, and sex roles; physical needs and public services; social class and status; social implications of religion; jobs and education; racial and ethnic relations; and crime and violence. The  results indicated a generally positive view of social studies courses in comparison to other courses in the curriculum. Most students preferred discussion to any other form of teaching method and liked lectures the least. In viewing present and future society, all students, except for those of lower socioeconomic background, anticipated highly significant changes in the future. The students saw job preparation as a major purpose of contemporary education. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The paper describes ways in which the urban classroom teacher can celebrate the Bicentennial and investigate the historical role of the cities throughout American history, without sacrificing current and futuristic issues and topics. Primary and secondary sources are used and a community-based field program for students is developed. The following common municipal problems confronting both colonial and contemporary city residents could be the basis for a unit of instruction: fire, sanitation, traffic control, crime, welfare and the poor, public works, and defense. By developing a sense of historical perspective, the urban social studies student should be better prepared to examine the issues and municipal problems of today's cities. Community resources are abundant for the study  of these and other local history issues and include community residents; guide books; Bicentennial television programs; novels; newspapers; municipal and county court records; diaries, letters, and autobiographies; maps; town, city, and county histories; travellers' accounts; and field trips. Also included is an extensive bibliography of early American history references and a sample competitive funding proposal for a community-oriented local Bicentennial project. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"Brief descriptions of recent research in early childhood moral development and the author's own hypotheses about the relevance of moral development theory on early childhood classrooms and curricula are provided. The three recent research studies focus on young children's development of a capacity for empathy, social perspective, and sense of justice. According to the author, positive reinforcement for thoughtful ways of dealing with conflicts provides a home and classroom environment conducive to learning. Adult verbalization in moral development helps the child bridge the gap between the awareness of his own feelings and his awareness of the feelings of others. When language underscores the child's experiences and when the message is consistent with the social behavior the  child sees around him, the language undoubtedly contributes to social learning. A stable, consistent, and accepting environment can help the child learn about fairness even though the teacher makes no overt effort to teach about justice. Finally, since television is often the child's primary view of society, moral education in school must consist of guided discussion of information and misinformation from television viewing.

The focus of the project is on curriculum analysis of materials for either pupil or teacher which have a significant influence on decision making at the curriculum level. Following the introduction of the project and its  rationale, the second chapter sets out to define curriculum analysis and its relation to curriculum evaluation, curriculum criticism, preservice teacher education, and inservice education. Chapter three includes a review of published schemes for the analysis of curriculum materials from several countries. The fourth chapter examines the Sussex scheme which was developed from the investigation of the other curriculum analysis systems. The final chapter presents the training process of curriculum analysis. (Author/JR)",

Topics discussed include the processes and procedures which ACSP used to gather materials for the publication, the sources of the anthropology materials, processes used for screening materials, and the screening procedures. It is noted that precollegiate anthropology curriculum materials are steadily increasing in numbers. However, because most social studies teachers were trained in departments of history, they have difficulty distinguishing sound anthropological materials from other content which only coincidentally contains anthropological issues or concerns. Therefore, an important task for both  educators and anthropologists is to establish sound procedures for the evaluation, dissemination, and adoption of K-12 anthropology materials. The book was published to help with this process. (Author/RM)",

Paraprofessionals are now an integral part of the Minneapolis Public Schools. They have contributed much to the education of students and staff and to good school-community relations. The New Careers and Career Opportunities Programs have provided many low-income paraprofessionals with additional educational opportunities. Every effort has been made to provide training for both specific job assignments and to meet the needs of individual paraprofessionals. Opportunities range from basic education to academic courses and are offered at community schools and college campuses. While it is important that a paraprofessional be well trained, it is equally  important that the supervising teacher or other staff member be trained in the effective utilization of the paraprofessionals. Orientation is given to first year teachers and teachers who are new to a school that uses paraprofessionals. Paraprofessionals do not make a teacher's job easier. The duties a paraprofessional assumes release the teacher to initiate activities at a higher and broader professional level. As a result, the teacher and paraprofessional team provide a better learning environment. The paraprofessional in education is a means through which schools and communities can work together. (RC)",

        "description":"A field test of \"Guiding Older Children As Tutors,\" one of the four motivational-instructional procedures of Individually Guided Motivation (IGM), was used in two Milwaukee, Wisconsin schools. A total of 34 tutees, 22 tutors, and 24 adults participated in the field test during the 1972-73 school year. The field test objectives sought an increase in the motivation, self-direction, and achievement of the tutees; a demonstration of the tutor's ability to conduct sessions; and a demonstration of the school staff's ability to implement the procedure. In addition, the field test was designed to determine the adequacy of the IGM book and films and the feasibility of the procedure in elementary school classrooms. The results indicated an increase in the general level of motivation and  self-direction in the tutees of one school, but not the other. The tutee's motivation and self-direction during tutoring sessions and while working on the tutored subject matter outside the tutoring sessions did not increase but started out and remained at a high level. Achievement of tutees did increase more than that of comparison groups when only tutored skills or items were considered. The tutors demonstrated their ability to conduct sessions, and the school staffs demonstrated their ability to implement the procedure. The IGM books and films proved sufficient to support tutoring implementation. The tutoring procedure itself was determined to be a feasible curriculum component for an elementary school if modified in terms of its demands on staff time. (Author)",

        "description":"Experts in the fields of educational media and competency-based teacher education at Trenton State College were consulted in an effort to gain their support and employ their knowledge and experience in the development of this self-instructional system. In addition to these consultations, the objectives of the educational media course that would be developed through the self-instructional system were analyzed in an effort to outline the competencies and to facilitate instructional implementation of the system. As a result of both the consultations and the analysis of the course objectives, plans were made to begin development of the self-instructional system in September 1975. A target date of February 1976 was set for commencing instructional operation of the system. The  self-instructional system will consist of 16 wet study carrel stations which will be equipped with the devices and materials necessary for developing the competencies. The system will employ 3/4\" color video cassettes for presenting each competency through a single concept approach that follows the outline of each competency module. (The competency module outline is included in this report.) (Author)",

Fifty surveys were mailed to the State Education Departments in each of the 50 states. Questions 1-5 of the survey were designed to determine the number of districts in each state, the number of students in each district, the amount of money spent on education at the state level, and the percentage of funds being directed toward education. These factors were included in order to see if they related to the type and magnitude of state control. The rest of the survey dealt with the specific type of state control exhibited by each state. It also asked the state to make an estimate of the amount of control it has over (1) subject matter,  (2) implementation or methods, and (3) evaluation of existing curriculum. Of the 50 surveys distributed, 36 were returned. The results indicated that states have minimal control over local school districts. Regional differences were evident, with southern states exhibiting greater control than other retions. The results were interpreted to suggest that states should increase their involvement in curriculum revision. (RC)",

It is stated that the model specifies that criterion performance is a function of initial abilities and of the following four constructs: (1) opportunity, (2) motivators, (3) structure, and (4) instructional events. The paper describes each construct as it pertains to the classroom and deals with evaluating the model and testing the assumptions. The model is applied to the Ashton-Warner approach, the Montessori system, and the individualized programs developed by the Learning Research and Development Center. The paper then describes the variables that make up each of the four constructs and two additional constructs  (initial performance, and outcomes). Lastly, the paper deals with the construction of measures of the previously identified variables. The problems involved in moving from variables to measures are discussed, methods that have been found to be useful in describing classroom processes are summarized, and an example of a classroom data-collection instrument is described.

An American minicourse, \"Effective Questioning,\" was adapted to and tested for Swedish teacher training. The course represented a method for skill training that aims at stimulating student participation, making students verbally active, having them use higher cognitive processes, and reducing the amount of teacher talk in favor of student participation. The testing of the minicourse took place during the autumn term in 1973 with 32 student teachers on their practice term. A control group of 10 student teachers was included. The  hypotheses set forth to test the minicourse were: (1) that the minicourse skills would be used to a greater extent after the course, (2) that there would be no difference on the whole between pre- and post-recordings in the control group, and (3) that there would be no difference on the whole between student teachers at junior and middle levels in mastering the minicourse. Hypotheses two and three were confirmed. As for hypothesis one, there was an obvious change in more than half of the minicourse skills, while the rest of the skills in most cases showed tendencies in the expected direction. (Author/RC)",

It explains that by combining task differentiation and upward mobility, a system can effectively reduce a conglomerate function like teaching into several job categories, each connected to the other in the upward mobility sense and designed to be more efficient in the service delivery. The first part goes on to explain that tasks are distributed at each level on the lattice so that they foster the acquisition of needed skills to move to the new higher step on the ladder. According to the report, this concept allows an unemployed person  entering the system as a teacher aide to become a supervising teacher; it also allows for many new and different workers to be trained in new ways. The report affirms that the ladder/lattice design effectively deals with the use of personnel and career mobility, and has enabled COP to take a major step in proving the viability of utilizing the skills of residents of low-income communities in delivering educational services. The second part of the report presents and explains examples of career lattice concepts in operation, and includes career lattice designs, sample job descriptions, articulation between work and training, and evaluation designs.

In the next section a listing of the current CAT minicourses is presented. The following section describes the steps in the  development of a minicourse. It states that a minicourse is essentially a self-contained minicurriculum, and therefore the steps in production are essentially a miniaturized version of the classical steps of curriculum development.

Conceptualization of program purposes and objectives provides a base for the design, development, and operation of program activities, evaluation, and management. The greater the specificity and explicitness of that conceptualization, the greater the likelihood of program success. Instructional system conceptualization involves the specification of competencies and the specification of instructional characteristics. The specification of competencies should be built on conceptualized role description; that is, specified in terms of  the roles persons assume during the operation of the program, and/or in terms of those roles persons are expected to play upon the completion of the program. The specification of the instructional system's operational characteristics in advance of program operation is crucial, for it is this process which sets the &quot;rules of the game&quot;.

This information was gathered from school districts, principals, and teachers. The data included the following general subject areas: (1) number of school districts using paraprofessionals and school district policies relating to them; (2) important reasons for the introduction of paraprofessionals into the school instructional program, (3) number of paraprofessionals in relation to full time staff members; (4) classroom activities which involve paraprofessionals; (5) effect of paraprofessionals on class size and learning; (6) level of acceptance by professional staff; (7) recent and future trends in use of paraprofessionals; (8)  paraprofessional salaries; (9) paraprofessional organizational affiliations; and (10) advantages and problems as a result of the use of paraprofessionals in the classroom. From the data obta obtained in this study, it was concluded that almost 100 percent of all districts are currently using paraprofessionals, and that there has been a steady increase in the numbers of paraprofessionals used over the past several years. Teachers, principals, and district administrators surveyed expressed a desire for increased use of paraprofessionals in the future, and the majority of teachers believed paraprofessionals have a positive effect on student learning. The need for in-service training of paraprofessionals was also expressed by participants in the study. (BD)",

Intramural sports programs, however, have not cultivated many commercial involvements in publicity. The approach in intramural sports advertising is simple. A commercial interest pays for space or time in a given communication media (usually printed--newspaper, newsletter, etc.). The business name appears only in the title of the publicity efforts, such as the \"McDonald's Intramural Page.\" The rest of the space is filled with intramural information, pictures, and stories. At the University of Minnesota, Hamms Beer advertised weekly in the student newspaper by sponsoring an intramural page. At Iowa State, participation in intramurals was good, but the student  newspaper ran little news about them. McDonald's was convinced to pay for a weekly page covering intramural sports. The publicity was good for the intramural program as well as for McDonald's and convinced the newspaper staff to add intramural news to its regular sports page. The way to sell this concept of advertising is to stress that it is an innovative method along with being soft-sell and that there is solid readership interest in the advertisement from intramural participants. Other possibilities for commercial involvements in intramurals include intramural graduate assistantships or scholarships, scoreboards/time clocks, awards, and intramural rule books or handbooks.

Overall results showed that students were most concerned with and favorable to teachers' methods of instruction and most disturbed by improper classroom management.

        "description":"Title I of Public Law 92-512, the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, is popularly known as the Revenue Sharing Act. It provides for payments of approximately $30.2 billion to over 38,000 general units of governments, the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and approximately 350 Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages. Revenue sharing funds may be spent with a minimum of Federal regulation and restriction--states may spend their entitlements in any expenditure category they wish. A number of recreational and cultural activities are eligible for support. States and local governments spent approximately 4 percent of their budget on recreation programs from 1972 through 1974. There are many advantages to revenue sharing, such as (1) it is predictable, since funds are  authorized for 5 years; (2) there are few bureaucratic problems; (3) it is simple to apply for funds; (4) no arbitarary decisions are made on merits of programs; (5) it disperses aid universally; and (6) it is administratively inexpensive. Categorical grants by the federal government, on the other hand, force local funds to match categories of the grants even when local priorities are different, operate against small communities which don't have or can't afford \"grantsmanship\", and make reporting difficult. Revenue sharing has been studied and positively reviewed by everyone from Congress to individual scholars and consumer groups. The President recommended that the program be extended until 1982, with minor modifications, and it is hoped that Congress will concur. (CD)",

Observational reports from American ethnologists and anthropologists were also included. Forty-six examples of North American Indian athletic game-ceremonial relationships were collected. Thirty-one tribes were represented in the data. The results indicated that ceremonial rites, both need-related and game-success-oriented, formed a major category of the athletic game/ceremony relationship. Ceremonial rituals also formed a major category of the  relationship. It was shown that the ceremonial accompaniment aspect was a minor category of the athletic game and ceremony relationship; when the ceremonies were over, the games, as entertainment, began. Based upon the accounts from which the data were drawn, it is shown that North American Indian athletic games were not without ceremonial relationships. Tribal culture was integrated into native North America ceremonial athletic games in a number of ways. (RC)",

They were gambling, amusement-diversion, ceremonial observance, increase of physical powers, and development of moral attributes. The data indicated that gambling, the wagering of stakes or game implements, was a highly significant motive of the North American Indians for holding  all athletic games.

These young women, who train by running approximately 50-90 miles per week, had scores in certain physiological and anthropometric measurements which were among the most advantageous for running ever recorded in a group of females. Each subject was administered the California Psychological Inventory (CPI), the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control test, and an open-ended questionnaire. Through comparisons with earlier norms for young women of this age group, it was found that the subjects scored higher than normal in academic achievement as a result of a more independent sense of self. In all other factors of the CPI the subjects were found to  have normal scores. These results were in accord with the findings from the Locus of Control scores which showed that the subjects scored high in internality (i.e., these athletes are self-directed rather than other-directed). They seem to be motivated by the joy of running, the feeling of independence associated with running, and the close interpersonal relationship between team members. The data suggest that they are high in achievement motivation. (Author)",

After the American revolution, the school became a focus for patriotism and the institution where individuals learned how to become citizens. The testbooks of the mid-19th and early 20th century emphasized white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant values. While the values of cultural homogeneity have dominated American education since the mid-19th centruy, they have never been implemented without conflict. Four of these conflicts are particularly suggestive of both the extent to which ethnic alternatives were available in education and the limited tolerance for cultural variety in the schools. These are (1) the conflict over foreign customs and foreign languages (biculturalism and bilingualism), (2) the  conflicts over parochial education, (3) the conflict between white and black Americans over socialization into a common mold, and (4) the conflict between the cultural values of American ethnic groups and the demands of school achievement. Certain developments in American educational history seem sufficiently clear to allow their use in current debates over ethnicity and the schools. Appeals for ethnic pluralism have a long history in American education and, especially in the 19th century, have sometimes been successful. But the ideological commitment to cultural homogenity in American education has been stronger and has made public education highly resistant to ethnic pluralism. (RC)",

        "description":"The impetus for this study developed from a search for intervention procedures applicable to children with learning difficulties in the regular grades. It was noted that, when certain aspects of the curriculum which involved extensive repetition were being taught to pupils, approximately 90 percent of the interactions between teachers and pupils were either negative or neutral. It was decided to explore the use of the audio tape recorder in the three areas of spelling, math combinations, and preschool language (areas which exemplify this extensive repetition), thus replacing neutral and negative comments by audio-tutorial (A-T) programming. Three groups of exceptional children provided the data for this study: slow learning, educable mentally retarded, and trainable mentally  retarded. The purpose of the A-T programming in math combinations was to provide intervention after the concepts had been taught, but prior to the time the pupil was required to use them as part of more advanced math skills. The purpose of the spelling program was to provide overlearning of words on the required spelling list. The preschool language program was used with severely retarded pupils, utilizing the Basic Concept Inventory as both a diagnostic device and as a subject matter source. These three programs are criterion referenced in their basic approach and the data collected to date on pupil progress and teacher reaction is encouraging. The characteristics of A-T programming offer promise as a way of meeting some of the problems encountered in the instruction of exceptional  children. (BD)",

        "description":"Screening for early identification of learning problems must be done through effective identification procedures which assure all children an equal opportunity for quality education. In order to do this, it is necessary to identify the essential characteristics of an effective screening program, the ways these characteristics might be implemented, and the possible pitfalls which must be avoided. Early identification is a predictive procedure which seeks to identify signs that warn of impending problems, and it should be proven that these warning signs and the methods of their recognition are reliable and valid predictors of future educational difficulties. Unvalidated screening programs are detrimental both to children not served and to those incorrectly classified. Thus,  accuracy is an essential characteristic of an exemplary early identification program; the accuracy of the forecast must be demonstrated by specifying exactly what outcome behaviors are being predicted. It is, then, important to specify and measure reliably the set of predictors that one thinks can validly forecast failure in the basic academic skills one, two, or even three years in advance. A screening procedure must be practical as well as accurate. It must be acceptable to all involved (the child, the teacher, and the parents), and it must be cost effective, by utilizing inexpensive materials and requiring a minimum amount of child, teacher, and administrator time.

        "description":"This paper deals with future research needs and problems in learning disabilities, and is divided into the following two broad categories: (1) supporting conditions, which involve necessary prerequisites to the research effort; and (2) procedural considerations, which deal with methodological concerns. First, the problems posed by supporting conditions such as financing, training research personnel, gaining cooperation from practitioners, and maintaining research's credibility are dealt with. Then, the second set of research needs, those involving procedural issues, are discussed. Two basic procedural needs are discussed. The first involves the fact that research in learning disabilities relies on established research paradigms in an effort to test competing falsifyable models.  The second involves finding ways to bridge the gulf between research and the unknowns that the practitioner must face daily. The paper maintains that the basic research problem confronting learning disabilities (or minimal brain dysfunction) is that of sample definition. The final section of the paper discusses categorization of disability (minimal brain dysfunction, learning disabilities, culturally disadvantaged deaf, blind, etc.), the use of these labels for administrative purposes, and the reaction to them by educational practitioners. This section also discusses the problems caused by categorization in classroom management, remedial programming, administration, and research methodology. (BD)",

Attempting to address the needs of project directors and evaluators, this guidebook deals with one central aspect of project evaluation--measuring congnitive achievement gains. Its purpose is to provide the tools needed to conduct technically sound, interpretable evaluation studies. It covers the entire evaluation process from the administrative decisions in selecting an evaluation design to the details of collecting, analyzing, and reporting the data. After the introduction, Chapter 2 describes 12 hazards commonly encountered in evaluations which may invalidate otherwise  sound studies. The hazards are discussed, and ways to avoid the hazard are outlined. Chapter 3 presents a procedural guide, in decision-tree form, for selecting a suitable evaluation model given a particular set of constraints. Chapter 4 presents the five evaluation models referred to in Chapter 3. Each model is summarized describing its characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, and considerations relating to its implementation. Chapter 5 deals with the details of data collection and Chapter 6 with summarizing and reporting of impact data. Appendices contain characteristics of some commonly used standardized tests and analysis of covariance worksheets. (RC)",

Events were classified, and an interpretation of the interrelationship of events was made. Events were classified as stemming from writings of individual authors, publications of professional organizations, and actions taken by the Legislative, Executive and Judicial Branches of government. The publications of the professional organizations and actions taken by the three branches of government were described in detail. The writings of individual writers were acknowledged but not described. The major concerns of the initiators of events were identified as follows: (a) problems generated by the use of tests for making employment decisions, (b) problems of interpretation  generated by semantic differences between the psychological and legal disciplines, (c) problems associated with and resulting from the impact of accountability on the test developer and user. A noticable trend was the shifting of the foci of prime concerns from an emphasis on professional competency to an increasing emphasis on professional integrity. This, in turn, resulted in an increasing resortment to a legalism that holds the test developer and user accountable for their respective product and use. (Author)",

As part of this project, two studies were conducted to determine the effects of a course in test taking skills on the reading achievement scores of two classes of fifth grade inner-city students. The students were divided, based on their reading test scores, into two groups: low achievers and high achievers. These groups were then divided into experimental and  control groups. The students were introduced to the program unit which was designed to keep them motivated as well as develop skills in test taking. At the end of the course, the students were administered the Stanford Achievement Test-Reading and the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, Level II. The results of the study showed that although students who received instruction in test taking skills average higher scores, their gains were not statistically significant. (Author/DEP)",

It also differs in method of screening and weighting the predictor variables, and treats the problem of small-sample bias. Applications, to date, are in the analysis and use of questionnaire responses to predict categorical outcomes, namely, voluntary, academic, and military attrition from a Service College. Classification efficiency appears to be comparable to that of the Moonan  technique. (Author)",

But the evidence regarding groups other than U.S. blacks and whites is either lacking or is still too sketchy to permit any strong conclusions. The evidence regarding black-white comparisons, however, is based on a number of well-known, widely used, and quite diverse standardized individual and group tests of intelligence given to a large representative sample of whites and blacks. The results are unequivocal: none of the several subjective indices of cultural bias shows any significant indication of bias in any of these tests when they are used with blacks and  whites. Correlation of raw scores with age, internal consistency reliability, rank order of item difficulty, relative difficulty of adjacent items, item correlation with total score, loadings of items or tests on the general factor, and relative frequencies in choice of error distractors--all are substantially the same in black and white groups. It is concluded that these standardized tests of intelligence--the Peabody Picture Vocabulary, Raven's Progressive Matrices, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Stanford-Binet, Wonderlic Personnel Test, and most likely other similar tests--are not at all culturally biased for blacks and whites. They behave statistically the same in both racial groups and do essentially the same job in both groups. (Author/DEP)",

        "description":"This study attempts to examine and document the implementation pattern of Individually Guided Education (IGE) across 30 Wisconsin school districts operating IGE programs in their schools. Using these results, the data were then analyzed to determine which of the seven IGE components examined, contributed most to a favorable overall or Total IGE Implementation Score. The seven components are: organizational arrangement, instructional programming, materials, measurement and evaluation, home school relations, facilitative environments, and research and development. The results indicated that the pattern of IGE implementation across the districts participating in the study is generally adequate or approximately 50 percent along the way to an ideal implementation of the IGE system.  Only two of the IGE Components, Home School Relations (35 percent implementation) and Research and Development (33 percent implementation) were areas where improvement and modification can be justified now. The remaining analyses, which consisted of correlational techniques, suggested that districts having a generally favorable Total IGE Implementation Score received favorable ratings on the implementation of the MUS-E Organization, Instructional Programming, and the Measurement and Evaluation Components. At this point in time it appears that Home School Relations, Materials, and Research and Development Components are less a part of the implementation scene of IGE. (Author/DEP)",

The program consists of seven phases: (1) first week: testing, simulating, and preparation; (2) second-third weeks: human relations and survival lab in wilderness; (3) fourth-seventh weeks: post-wilderness community problem solving upon return to campus; (4) eighth week: midterm evaluation; (5) ninth-twelfth weeks: skilled experiences; (6) thirteenth-fourteenth weeks: reporting, sharing, discussing, and analyzing; and (7) fifteenth-sixteenth weeks: evaluation and grading. A group of students who had completed two evaluation phases of an outdoor survival program  and two different CLASP groups all involved in wilderness educational programs, were examined together with two control groups. The control groups were a conventional beginning class in sociology and a conventional T-group. Results significantly favor CLASP communities over T-groups and control groups in terms of sociological content, changes in self conception, and academic achievements. Strong positive reactions rated the CLASP program as the best learning experience in the students' college career. The program has created considerable &quot;noise&quot; in the traditional academic system for nontraditional education. Recommendations are made for institutions to adapt this survival-type program to the needs of each college department. (Author/BJG)",

Evaluators who have omitted the evaluation of the effects of educational innovation on the total system--not just the students--may find it productive to assume this additional responsibility. It is hypothesized that greater productivity may be realized if institutions undergoing change attend to and respond to the real and the projected anxieties of all those responsible for and affected by the change, since implementors may undergo greater changes than clients. Those involved in effecting change may need assurance that they can be competent in their new roles, and that their needs will be identified and  responded to. Such identification and supportive response is a key to establishing a climate where change can be productive and &quot;non-events,&quot; or business-as-usual teaching under the cloak of a project title or number, will be at a minimum. The transactionally oriented evaluator could participate in the usual formative, summative and cost tasks, but he would also ask additional questions about (1) Who is involved? (2) What is expected of them? (3) How are they threatened by change? (4) How do they make compromises between their needs and the reward system? (5) In what way, and how adequately does the institution assess the consequences of change, not only on the system clients, but also on the members of the system? (Author/BJG)",

Student achievement of specified goals is greater than in the traditional program, and study perceptions of the instructional experience suggest that competency-based instruction emphasizes, more than the traditional approach, such things as independent, activity-oriented, assignments and that such assignments contribute more to success in the course than instructor interactions or assigned readings from text. The successes of the CBTE science methods course do not appear to be translated into differences in behavior during a later directed teaching experience. Overall, Central Michigan University (CMU) students are  viewed as successful in lesson planning and lesson teaching in the directed teaching experience, whether they participate in CBTE or non-CBTE sections of the science methods course. The data of the current project suggests that CBTE has effects at the level of the university classroom, but that these effects are not translated into behavioral differences in the classroom. The presence or absence of field experiences concurrent with the CBTE modules does not seem to moderate these results. (Author/BJG)",

Four objectives were developed for the first year project: (1) the development and implementation of nonsexist curriculum in grades 4-12, (2) the development of teachers' and librarians' awareness of sexism in learning materials, (3) the development of dissemination materials and a resource center of nonsexist learning materials, and (4) the measurement of student awareness of sex bias. To meet these objectives, the project developed three elementary nonsexist units of instruction and 19 secondary nonsexist lessons which were taught in Minneapolis public and parochial schools, conducted inservice training for teachers and librarians, created a  resource center of nonsexist learning materials, and developed criterion-referenced test items to measure student awareness of sex bias. Evaluation involved the monitoring of the development and administration of instruments to measure student and teacher ratings of the lessons and the validation of each lesson by two curriculum experts: inservice training sessions were evaluated by means of participant responses to surveys developed by the evaluator. The progress toward the development of the resource center was monitored, and the results of the criterion referenced testing were analyzed, item difficulties, item discrimination and test reliabilities computed. Findings indicate that the project was successful overall in meeting its objectives. (Author/RC)",

In February 1975, the 755 participants who had processed their recertification forms were mailed a questionnaire to determine overall program effectiveness, differences among programs, and directions for future human relations education. Based on the post-program reactions given by 75 percent of the participants, it was the evaluator's opinion that, considering the conditions under which the program was operating, the 521 program was valuable. Not all participants became more competent in the areas specified by Educ 521; in fact, a substantial percentage indicated that the program was not helpful. However, two-thirds of the participants  did say that the program helped them increase their understanding of various ethnic/cultural groups, biases, and power/powerlessness. Three-fourths said they improved their communication skills; about half said they learned skills that could be used in the school setting; and about half said they interacted differently in the school setting as a result of the 521 program. Recommendations were made to offer a variety of 521 programs that would meet the different needs of potential participants, define clearly the goals and activities of each program, offer voluntary in-depth human relations programs beyond the 521 program, emphasize real experiences in all programs, and explore some new approaches.

Achievement scores on the Modern Math Supplement to the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills have improved each year of the IPI project. Contrary to children in many disadvantaged areas, Hall students do not compare less favorably with publisher norms as they become older; the IPI students hold near the percentile rank they had as third graders as they progress through  school. Hall students have expressed more positive attitudes toward math than those in comparison schools. Hall teachers have supported the IPI project, emphasizing the individualized approach and the students' positive attitudes. IPI was not to be continued in the 1973-74 school year. (Author/BJG)",

The model is based upon identifying principal subsystems, such as source, channel and audience, which are involved in initiation, production, delivery and reception of educational messages. These subsystems are seen as separate but interdependent, having the power singly or jointly to make crucial decisions about generation, dissemination or withholding of information. The extent to which these subsystems may in fact exert such controls has been demonstrated in a variety of research studies, many in the mass communication area. Specific application of the model is illustrated in the evaluation of the &quot;Mulligan Stew&quot; television series which, although directed at a young  audience, has implications for evaluation of any adult education program which involves extensive use of the mass communications media. The study included before-after student responses in eight schools and estimates of such response from nutrition specialists, information specialists, television station personnel, and teachers. In terms of final outcome, the Mulligan Stew results generally and strongly support the information control systems model, and testify to its utility in evaluational research. (RC)",

Three principles are considered to govern the orientation of this document: (1) objective research and knowledge are possible and should not be entangled with political and social policy; (2) phenomena are better explained by theory as opposed to ad hoc explanations; and (3) conclusions expressed in terms of statistics and probabilities must be accepted, with their tentative nature kept in mind. Among the topics dealt with are: (1) mutation and drift, migration, and selection processes affecting evolutionary differentiation; (2) formulation of  heritability of group differences; (3) psychometric evidence for the author's conclusions; and (4) hypotheses of culture-biased tests and environmental foci. It is reiterated that it is highly probable that genetic as opposed to environmental factors are involved to a substantial degree in the lower average IQ of American Negro groups. (Author/AM)",

The main results of systematic research findings and experience in multi-racial schools are given along with the main implications for action and research. Specific recommendations submitted include requests for additional resources from central government, the establishment of a national policy for deprived urban areas, several programs for  local education authorities (such as advisory teams on multi-racial education, multi-racial curricula development, and assessment in multi-racial schools), and teacher training with the adoption of positive policies to recruit and train professionals from minority backgrounds.

Self-concept and I.Q. were found to be positively related at the retesting. The D.C. children had good positive self-concepts and showed  positive changes in self concept and I.Q. at the retesting.

The oral repetition technique is used with 80 Puerto Rican children enrolled in grades 2-4 in a predominantly Puerto Rican bilingual school. Findings indicate a significant positive correlation between degrees of black dialect interference and time in mainland schools. Significant inverse correlations are indicated between degree of black dialect interference and reading ability in English and between  degree of Spanish interference and aural ability in English. Time in mainland schools is said to be significantly related to aural ability in English but not to reading ability.

Differences in achievement gains or losses are hypothesized as being both a function of bused students attitudes toward busing and desegregation and of the interracial climate of acceptance in the receiving schools. Findings from data gathered by various statistical analyses indicate that the achievement performance of bused black students after the two year period of busing is significantly lower than that of the non-bused black students. In two years, bused black students are said to have advanced an average of only one month in grade placement. School interracial climate and student attitudes are considered to account for the significantly lower achievement performance  of the bused students. The major conclusion of this study is that mandatory busing to desegregate schools in communities with great resistance to busing may serve to weaken the achievement performance of the bused minority student.

This study, therefore, is considered to have used elements of the natural observation measures and applied them to the videotape from the Instructional Strategies in Infant Stimulation (ISIS) project to further examine the social roots of competency. The sample consisted of 53 families with 22 boys and 31 girls who participated in the ISIS  project. They were low income families residing in or near Gainesville, Florida. It is held that, generally, the project demonstrated that the use of observation systems developed originally for naturalistic observation in the home is functional for the analysis of videotapes of structured teaching situations. Further, it is asserted that the mix of theoretical orientations contributes to the richness of this understanding of the meaning of the social transactions between babies and mothers. The project is seen as having demonstrated that within a social class there are variances in maternal-baby behavior which influence infant performance. (Author/JM)",

Three project components are instructional, including personalized instruction in English, mathematics, social studies, and reading; staff development, including curriculum development and human relations training; and student services, including counseling, psychological-physical needs, home visitation, and parental involvement. Findings indicated a 34.4 percent reduction in the dropout rate over a five-year period for Paducah and 16.9 percent at Shawnee for a three-year period. Suspensions are found to be reduced to an acceptable level. Achievement  gains in reading and math at Shawnee are seen to be significantly higher in 1973-74. At Paducah, student self-concept is considered to have improved throughout the five-year period, with the exception of 1973-74 at the junior high in Paducah.

        "description":"This report summarizes the data about minority group scientists and engineers obtained as part of a national survey of scientific and engineering personnel in 1972. Information pertaining to minority group college students enrolled in engineering is also discussed briefly. Data presented on overall distribution patterns indicate that persons of Oriental descent have the highest concentration of scientists and engineers. The distribution of all scientists and engineers among regions of the country are seen to correspond to the distribution of the total population. The age distributions of minority group engineers are found to reflect past lack of opportunities for entry into the field, the median age for all minorities being five years less than the white median age of 42. Age  distributions of scientists show less differences. The levels of educational attainment among the different racial groups of scientists and engineers vary, with those of Oriental descent indicating more education than either members of other minorities or whites. The key relationship between field of study and professional identity relationship is considered to be the level of degree earned rather than the racial characteristics of the workers. (Author/AM)",

A profile of the community is given in terms of data collected from personal and family interviews. Personal interviews assessed how the Appalachian black viewed his group. Among the 13 variables studied are: trustworthiness, religion, work ethic, intragroup cooperation, discrimination, drinking problems, and educational values. The family interviews inquire as to the religion, education, marital status, occupation, family size, length of residence, type of dwelling, number of vehicles owned, nature of family relations, and income level of families. The blacks are considered to share, to a great extent, the Appalachian lifestyle of advocated abstinence, strong religious,  community, and family ties, as well as the contradiction of heavy alcohol consumption among adult males. While sharing in similarities, whites, Cherokees, and blacks of Appalachia are seen to have little interaction with each other. All three groups are found to project negative images to the valley whites and to outsiders. The paper concludes that the black community is not an isolated phenomenon but part of a larger cultural situation that must change in order for the black community to change. (Author/AM)",

Information is based on interview data, personnel records, and responses to a questionnaire. Results indicate that while teacher-pupil ratios in inner city schools are slightly less than in non-inner city schools, actual class size is not significantly less. Principals and teachers in inner city schools are found to have less teaching experience and greater staff turnover than those in middle class schools. Results are discussed with reference to the educational implications of teacher experience, satisfaction, and stability on the implementation of the curriculum. A selectively screened and well prepared staff  is suggested to be an essential component for curriculum development. An identification of pupils' needs and the establishment of educational priorities to adapt the curriculum to reflect these priorities is stressed, along with improvement in teacher education programs and inservice training for teachers and administrators in inner city schools.

A series of faculty seminars was planned as part of the first-year program, after an initial survey of all Pennsylvania institutions of higher education indicated an interest in a gerontological seminar series. The first two-day workshop was designed to introduce participants to general concepts in gerontology and to stimulate program planning. An Opinion About People scale was developed and administered prior to the first workshop to determine participant background and set the level of presentations. Participant evaluation of the first workshop reflected a two- and four-year  institutional dichotomization of interests, which was taken into consideration in planning the second workshop. Evaluation of the second session showed an increase in the level of interaction among participants. The concluding workshop focused on curriculum development, with participants organized into small role-playing groups for problem-solving at hypothetical institutions. A core of interested and knowledgeable individuals, representing the needs, resources, educational philosophies, and institutions in the State was identified for second-year planning in program development for gerontology.

A general discussion of the definition of career education, program goals, administration, funding, and facilities provides background material on the program. Several projects are discussed, including: a model school; the development of a graduate course in the techniques of career education, in conjunction with Indiana University at South Bend; the screening of commercial products for applicability to the program; the development of the ELCEP library and mobile unit; recruitment of teachers for career education courses; and, consultation services and information on career education for the Elkhart  school district. Administrative offices are housed at the Elkhart Area Career Center, and facilities enable field trips, workshops, the graduate course, and the resource library to be available to community schools. School projects developed by teachers in conjunction with ELCEP are discussed, and future goals cited for career education development.

A program to educate and train students in California in the philosophy, administration, and development of PHP was developed in response to difficulties in the implementation of the legislation. The six-month program combines classroom training in specific skills with internship. Program activities described include student recruitment and selection, and the training program itself, which consists of a curriculum covering medical billing, statistical reporting, marketing, accounting, PHP/HMO law, medical terminology, principles of PHP/HMO management, and communications. An  assessment of the curriculum showed a positive response from the students but an attrition rate attributed to several factors was detected. Other factors reported on are class composition, guidance and counseling, job placement programs, public acceptance, and student motivation. A high success factor in terms of realization of objectives was found for students who finished the program. Conclusions and recommendations about the program are given. Appended materials include: details of the California State plan for nine-point Institute for Medical Service; student selection, orientation, and evaluation materials; curriculum outline; and a list of texts and materials.

The sample lesson plans compiled in the publication should assist the ICT coordinator in developing instructional units for the generally related phase of the ICT One program. It is emphasized that the guide is not designed as a course to be rigidly  followed. Ten units including two to six lessons each are outlined: introduction to the ICT program; pre-employment information; employer-employee relations; techniques of learning; on-the-job communications; income tax; you and the American economy; money management and banking; laws, contracts, and you; and safety. Sample lessons are described in terms of objectives, content, and methods of teaching. Transparency masters, handouts, and lists of resource materials are included for most lessons. (Author/EC)",

The approach was to design an individualized instructional program to provide participants with the instructional skills and knowledge to manage their own training and educational growth. A 104-page section describes the operational model which utilized 12 interrelated learning concepts and teaching strategies to structure the program into three levels, each containing sub-levels (modules). Data  were collected on the self-selected activities engaged in by the 24 participants and the proficiency levels they reached during their stay in the project. Considerable gains were reported in both areas for a majority of the participants. Recommendations for setting up a special program with similar objectives are listed. Appended materials (66 pages) include: a schematic breakdown of model operation (describes the process the participant works through in the project), individual participant scores and mini-case reports, and a correlation matrix.

An assessment of health care practices in these countries led to the conclusions and recommendations presented in part one of the report. There are trends toward: (1) individualized community level health care and prevention (primary health care), (2) greater cost-effectiveness, and (3) educational reorganization. Recommendations deal with the need for national health policies, integration of health care and education, coordinated government action, research, continuing and recurrent education, and international efforts. The second section reviews present trends: the  size, growth rates, and complexity of health care and education of the health professions in member countries. New demands on health care systems by consumers, professionals, and government officials for improved access, quality, cost control, and extension are outlined. Response to these demands is reported as new health care policies, (especially primary care) and policy implementing mechanisms. The educational responses to trends in health care systems are detailed with the conclusion that innovative approaches are more abundant than actions being taken on them. The report concludes with a five-page bibliography. (Author/MS)",

The body of the document consists of a student manual which is made up of seven blocks of instruction: introduction and orientation, geometric construction, multiview projection, dimensioning, sectioning, auxiliary projection, and pictorial views. Each block contains general objectives for the total block, directions for use of the block, a pretest, and lessons consisting of performance objectives and learning activities. The learning activities are made up of reference sources, informational outlines, performance operational steps, and criterion tests. A teacher manual, designed to complement the student  manual, presents additional, supplementary material to aid in the implementation and effective use of the student manual (answers to test questions, reference sources, and comments). Completion of the manual should give the student the background that is necessary for successful achievement in the advanced drafting phase. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"An understanding of the professional development of educators involved in career education is necessary for an understanding of changes occurring in the field of education. Changes brought about in education have caused shifts in the professional and occupational behavior of educators, only some of whom perceive themselves as change agents. Educators' needs and values are changing, due in part to a greater emphasis placed on work values and expectations similar to those held by workers in general. A characterization of today's educator shows a variety of identified values and responsibilities which can be transformed into learning experiences. Job security is a factor which influences educator change and is applicable to other work situations as well. The continued growth in  career education has been possible because it calls for a wider group of educator and student responsibilities, skills, and new behaviors. Educators actively involved in career education can be seen as providing a model of professionalism which appears to have achieved an equitable balance between the goals of an institution and the individual goals of its members. These educators will exact from any future definition of professionalism a far more explicit understanding of their roles in implementing a changing institutional image.

Over 400 students at two universities served as subjects. Four experiments were conducted using a counterbalanced repeated measures design. Students used adjunct materials for portions of the text and served as a control for other portions of the text. The results indicate that adjunct materials promote learning of materials directly covered by adjunct questions, but do not contribute to application of the material covered by adjunct questions. The use of adjunct instructional materials is recommended. Further research, especially concerning the effects of various types of questions, also is recommended.

        "description":"A test was made of the hypothesis that only immediate supervisors know enough about their subordinates' job activities to render job performance ratings. Pairs of supervisors who rated the quality of performance of 295 supply airmen had identified themselves as immediate supervisors and other-than-immediate supervisors. These pairs, working independently, rated the same airmen (job incumbents) on how well they performed individual tasks. Each supervisor was asked to rate each task that he was sure the subordinate did, but he was not told which tasks the subordinate had identified. The selections of tasks were tallied against the responses made by the incumbents on the same inventory. An incumbent's responses were relative time spent ratings. Tasks were classified by a scale of  percent time spent, and two supervisory levels were compared in terms of percentage of tallies (agreements) with the incumbents. The tallies were greater for tasks on which the airmen spent more time, but there was no detectable difference between immediate and other supervisors. It was concluded that in the Inventory Management and Material Facilities career ladders, at least, it was possible to obtain other supervisors who were as familiar with their subordinates' jobs as immediate supervisors.

An industrial advisory board identified occupational categories in the local economy which met the criteria of being temporary in nature with limited career opportunities and lacking in appeal to younger job seekers. Older persons employed in these mainly clerical, assembly, and packaging positions were paid through the Human Resources Center. PSA clients totaling 804, recruited through other agencies and the mass media, were interviewed. Positions were found for 280. The others were placed in a work force supplement program (skills bank). For all clients, data were maintained on the numbers and type of  placements, referrals but no placements, and non-referrals. These data and personal characteristics were analyzed to assess potential factors which might prove predictive of successful employability. Detailed discussion and conclusions indicated that: aged persons had a need to work, there was a demand in industry for their skills, and job placements enabled workers to earn incomes above poverty level. Appended are: tables on client characteristics and attitudes, interview forms, and reprints of publicity articles. (Author/MS)",

Another workshop was conducted for developing curriculum guidelines and presenting information related to sources of occupational information for teacher use. The development and implementation of a career education materials center followed. Inservice training  sessions were conducted on the effective use of the occupational materials.

Rationales for the four-phase system (awareness, exploration, preparation, and continuing) are discussed in terms of students, teachers, administration, and society. They emphasize the need for every student who leaves a formal education system to have the necessary skills for employment. A position paper discusses plans for a limited revision of curriculum content in terms of the integration of systematic study and interaction of the following concepts: self, society and culture, career development and work ethics, environment, personal economics, and decision-making. The philosophy of the program  incorporates the following concepts: self-awareness, academic proficiency, occupations, personal economics, society roles, value and attitude clarification, life-coping skills, leisure time utilization, decision-making, cultural awareness, and environmental awareness. A Latte Stone Model for career education is presented, comprising four phases of development: (1) Career Awareness, (Grades K-6); (2) Career Exploration, (Grades 7-9); (3) Career Preparation, (Grade 10 to the termination of formal education); and (4) Retraining and Upgrading. Lists of general and student expected outcomes for the overall program are provided. (LH)",

The projections methodology was based on the Case 1 estimates by the National Petroleum Council of the results of \"maximum efforts\" to develop domestic fuel sources by 1980 and 1985. It is based on seven energy-related industries: electric generation; petroleum and natural gas extraction and petroleum refining; natural gas production, transmission, and distribution; coal mining; nuclear power production and radioactive waste disposal; manufacture of selected producers' durable equipment for electric companies; and energy-related construction. Employment of engineers and scientists is expected to increase  117 percent from 1970 to 1985, with a more rapid growth of demand for engineers than for scientists. Physicists, with an increase of 186 percent, and chemists, with an increase of 110 percent, are expected to comprise about 61 percent of the total demand for scientists. Demands for geologists and geophysicists will also continue. The projections indicate an average, annual additional requirement of about 11,200 engineers and 4,300 scientists by 1985; the future supply of engineers and scientists may be inadequate to meet the demands of energy/energy-related industries.

An introductory article, \"Criteria for Selecting Curriculum in Adult Basic Education\" by Donald Mocker, emphasizes the need for broader criteria for selection of ABE curriculum. Three papers, authored by educators of diverse backgrounds, address the question of what is basic in the humanities and why this must be included as part of the ABE curriculum. The papers, presented as part of a 1975 \"town meeting,\" are: \"Why Not Teach the Humanities to ABE Students?\" by H. Bruce Franklin, \"The Humanities in ABE: A Means of Achieving Productive Individuality\" by Carmen Rodriguez, and \"The Humanities: A Brief View of  Potential Power\" by Walter Bradford. The commentary on the three addresses is by William Jones. The authors stress that there are individual rights to full development of human potential and that human potential can best be understood through the humanities. The articles call for ABE learners to demand that they be given an education which nurtures cultural and ethnic pride. Objections are raised toward institutional goals of ABE and the narrow conceptualization of ABE and the adult basic learner. (EA)",

Procedures used in testing the six hypotheses formulated for the study were: intelligence testing; occupational preference inventory; pretest to measure developmental level of students and posttest for subject evaluation; and  performance rating based on quality and amount of work accomplished. Instructors and instructional materials were also tested to rate their motivational orientation as intrinsic or extrinsic based on the occupational preference inventory.

The goal was to generate principles for identification of ability requirements from knowledge of the characteristics of a task and of variations in the conditions of task performance. Such knowledge has implications for selection and training of personnel. In this fourth study, possible interactions among task variations, ability profiles, and subject strategies were examined within the context of troubleshooting and problem-solving tasks previously studied. Subjects' strategies were defined in terms of their method of problem-solving under each level of task difficulty and perceptual  complexity. Subgroups adopting one of several kinds of strategy were then analyzed to determine the relationships between abilities and strategies, and strategies and performance. The recurrent findings support the contention that abilities are sensitive to differences among tasks, making them more precise descriptors of performance than the broader rubrics (e.g., mental, motor; cognitive, noncognitive; etc.) which have been in vogue. In general, knowledge of a subject's problem-solving strategy was useful in obtaining a clearer understanding of ability requirements under different conditions of task performance. (Author)",

        "description":"An experimental Basic Electricity and Electronics course (BE/E) utilizing a lock-step, instructor presentation methodology was developed and evaluated at the Service School Command, Great Lakes. The study, directed toward the training of lower mental group, school nonqualified personnel, investigated comparative data on test performance, attitude, and attrition of 50 students in an experimental group matched to a control group within the ongoing individualized BE/E training system. The results revealed significantly reduced attrition within the experimental group, control group, and overall Great Lakes BE/E School with no significant differences in quality of the graduates of the two treatment groups. Attitudinal data was generally positive for both groups and not significantly  different. Two factors were concluded to be responsible for the program's success: the focus of management attention to problems of training lower ability individuals in both groups, and the introduction of prestudy sessions into the experimental group. Appendixes (55 pages) include: statistical tables comparing test performance of the two groups, statistical analyses of test and attitudinal questionnaires items, instructor comments on the course, instructional materials readability and student reading ability, the prestudy concept, and cost breakdown for conducting the research.

An inherent contradiction was found in the characterization of professional police in these terms, and a reconsideration of the professions and the police is necessary. The concept of reproductive activity is suggested which is substantively understood as the process of reproducing the social order, especially the working class. This activity is the activity of the professional and of the police. The  exercise of control over this activity renders the professionalization of the police impossible. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"The author has presented a historical review of societal/industrial conditions affecting the development of manual education to determine if a need for change in industrial arts exists at the present time. Societal conditions, industrial conditions, and the resulting educational response are examined in: Russia (mid-19th century), Sweden (19th century), England (19th century), America (mid-19th century to 1920), and America (present time). In Russia, the 1861 emancipation resulted in freed, untrained peasants, who formed the basis of the working force required for industrial development. The introduction of Sloyd (a system of handwork or manual training in Scandinavian countries) in Sweden was more an attempt to revitalize a society than to produce skilled workers. In England,  the Arts and Crafts Movement was a protest against the dehumanization of workers. Decay of the apprenticeship system in America necessitated the development of manual training. As dissatisfaction with manual training became apparent, industrial arts, aimed at helping students understand industrial processes and materials, appeared on the scene. Industrial arts is still making use of general shop today as it did in the 1920's. The author contends, in light of the data collected, that a need for change in industrial arts currently exists.

Fifty-six competencies or tasks were identified in the instrument, grouped under six headings: (1) planning, organizing, and administering; (2) improving educational opportunities; (3) securing and developing personnel; (4) providing educational facilities, equipment, materials, and services; (5) providing and maintaining adequate fiscal resources; and (6) developing and maintaining effective communication. Each task was analyzed in the  following areas: rank by percent of respondents performing, cumulative sum of average time spent by all respondents, average time spent by all respondents, average percent time spent by respondents performing, and percent of respondents performing. It was concluded that the respondents could differentiate their tasks and the time spent for their performance.

A questionnaire was given to 1,149 vocational-technical teachers with 85 percent responding. The teachers were classified according to vocational program areas and were asked to identify the tasks they performed and the time spent on each of 105 given tasks in the areas of: instructional planning, execution, and evaluation; program planning, development, and evaluation; management; guidance; school-community relations; student vocational organization; professional role and development; and coordination. Data are arranged according to vocational education program areas and a composite analysis of the data  across program areas was also performed. Each task was analyzed in the following areas: rank by percent of respondents performing, cumulative sum of average percent time spent by all respondents, average percent time spent by all respondents, average percent time spent by respondents performing, and percent of respondents performing. It was concluded that the respondents could identify the tasks performed and the amount of time required. The research offers useful information for curriculum decision making and developing instructional programs. A bibliography is included and the questionnaire appended. (EC)",

The guide is intended to provide drafting students with an explanation of the techniques of plotting utilizing a G.E. 225 time-sharing computer and a time-sharing Peripherals Corporation flatbed plotter (TSP212). Section 1 provides a basic understanding of computerized drafting so that plotter output can be generated with minimal Fortran training. Available subroutines and  instructions on how to use them are discussed. Six subdivisions cover: glossary of terms, using the time-sharing system, using the time-sharing plotter, subroutines, normal program structures, and sample program with plotter. Section 2 deals with the Fortran makeup of the subroutine available in the system. It provides knowledge of the structure of plotter-oriented subroutines so that, with a knowledge of Fortran, one can expand subroutines to provide a broader library of available subroutines. It is divided into areas on programing and subroutines. (Author/EC)",

The limited number of research studies on counseling adults conclude that more progression is found among counseled groups than noncounseled groups and that existing guidance services for adults are inadequate to meet clientele needs. The essence of counseling is the relationship between counselor and client which places emphasis on the client's perception of his/her environment. The role of a counselor may be clarified by examining what tasks counselors of adults perform or by studying the competencies  identified as needed for counseling in adult education. Of basic importance in counseling adults is to understand the needs of adults. Moreover, adult students bring many anxieties, over and above those in any learning situation regardless of age or level, to the learning situation. Another consideration is counselor attitudes toward the adult counselee which can influence the counseling process. Abraham Maslow's explanation of self-actualization is recommended as an ideal model for counselors when dealing with adults. (EA)",

The specific skill selected for the study was shielded metal arc welding because it is representative of this class of skills. Thirty-six inexperienced welding trainees were gathered: 18 were assigned to an experimental group and alternated their time equally between the simulator and the weld shop; the other 18 were assigned to the control group and received conventional welding practice only. After 12 days of training their performance was evaluated based on visual grading of the vertical and overhead test. The following  conclusions were reached: the simulator trainees performed significantly better than the conventionally trained group, and the simulator trainees also used 215 times less electrical energy, less welding material, and spent approximately half as much time in the weld shop.

A seven-week Supplyman course was selected for the experiment. There were 19 performance tests for the course, each constituting a station at which an instructor provided an overview of the material and information on where the required reference documents and practice materials were located. Students were allowed to take each of the 19 Supplyman performance tests whenever they felt qualified to do so.  Performance and attitude data were collected on approximately 135 baseline (lock-step) students and 200 self-paced students. Findings indicate the self-pacing is feasible to implement and operate, can be used effectively in cognitive skill training, and is well-received by students and instructors. Appended are two student attitude surveys with responses statistically expressed, one instructor information questionnaire with response scores, and another instructor questionnaire for which responses are not shown.

Several criteria were used as the analytic base for the interpretation of national results: trends in program performance (resources, activities, and outputs) matched against growth in numbers of licensed drivers, vehicles, road milage, and miles of highway travel; program productivity in terms of outputs per unit or manpower time; trends in unit cost; and direct and indirect effects of state and  community grants. Summaries of findings are given for the following program areas selected for study: (1) the funding of highway safety programs, (2) police traffic services and adjudication, (3) drinking-driver countermeasures, (4) emergency medical services, (5) driver education, (6) driver licensing, and (7) periodic motor vehicle inspection.

Traditional formal education with its greatest benefits for a small elitist group will not contribute significantly toward the resolution of major socioeconomic problems. Adult education is an important existing strategy that can be further developed as a major nonformal strategy. Currently, adult education is beginning to assume two major new role tasks, as lifelong education for all levels of society and as a major component in education for developmental strategies. A limitation of adult education, however, is the lack of an organizational framework to systematically build and improve operations. The systems  classification of this proposal would provide classification for self-analysis, gathering, classifying, evaluating, and diffusing information about adult education programs in India. The model includes: (1) Identifying Characteristics (organization/administration, program objectives, and time allocation); (2) Setting (needs assessment, culture/economic/civic/scientific context, and other area programs); (3) Program Structure and Function (facilities, philosophy, personnel, clientele, curriculum, and processes); and (4) Output: Evaluation and Feedback (pre- and posttests, interviews, questionnaires, on-the-job records, research, cost/benefit analysis, internal/external efficiency, and feedback).

        "description":"A methodology for inventorying the technical concepts relevant to the occupations of automotive mechanics, business data programers, and general secretaries is described in the report. Five general types of technical concepts are presented, consisting of specialized knowledge having practical use to workers. Through a process of development, editing, and review, these general concepts resulted in a listing of 440 concepts for automotive mechanics, 382 concepts for business data programers, and 80 concepts for general secretaries. CSR (Concept Significance Rating) booklets for each occupational area containing these listings were sent to selected occupational instructors to obtain their ratings of the job significance of the concepts. Usable returns were obtained from 104  instructors in seven states. Summaries of the ratings obtained for each occupation are presented, along with methodology, rationale, and description; an explanation of the process involved with compiling and rating the concepts; and a summary and implications. Tables supplement the discussion. Ratings for the three occupational areas, additional concepts suggested by instructors, and the CSR booklet are appended. It is stated that summaries of the ratings obtained may be useful to those involved in curriculum development and research, and occupational performance surveys that derive or validate training content.

Three groups of students, from the Wisconsin College-Conservatory, the New England Conservatory, and the San Francisco Conservatory, were interviewed and asked to complete a questionnaire. Forty-three professional musicians responded to a questionnaire, most of them from the Milwaukee area. A symposium was conducted which involved students, music teachers (both private and school affiliated), music association representatives, members of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, and other music professionals. The three workshops, headed by professionals from outside the Milwaukee area, focused on preconservatory education, curriculum,  and careers. Dialogue with students and questionnaire results are presented. Conclusions cover a variety of areas, including: (1) the suggestion that conservatories are providing vocational training, (2) curriculum development, (3) the need for stronger humanities programs, and (4) other educational needs. Recommendations suggest a broader study, with a stronger questionnaire and more developed interviewing techniques.

Analysis of the Federal and State legislative history from 1906 until the present has revealed that early legislation encouraged the separation of vocational programs by sex as a way of meeting what was then viewed as the special needs of girls. Later legislation continued this separatism, leading to the isolation of vocational education programs for females. Analysis of the data pertaining to Massachusetts' vocational education has clearly demonstrated the  existence of a separate system of education in which females have not participated equally with males. The study recommends a series of corrective actions which the State Board of Education could undertake. The 90-page appendix contains separate system data from localities and regions, supplementary documents (student questionnaire, Chapter 622 recommendations/regulations/policy statements and educational specifications in response to Chapter 622), and selected references.

The APL project methodology involved the following activities: specification of competencies, development of performance indicators, field test and subsequent revision, national assessment of competency, and determination of competency levels. Three APL levels are  identified: APL 1--adults functioning with difficulty, APL 2--functional adults, and APL 3--proficient adults. An APL national survey (five samples totaling 7,500 adults) on functional competency reports the competency levels of adults according to knowledge and skill areas and demographic groupings, with 20% falling in the APL 1 category. Additional performance data related to general knowledge areas and primary skills are provided.

Problems encountered by the committee included confusion as to the appropriate roles for the committee, its members, and agencies in terms of the area planning process. The adequacy of and accessibility to planning information and financial support for the planning program were also problem areas. Conclusions and recommendations are presented, emphasizing:  coordination between vocational education programs, financial support from the State government to help implement educational and manpower information systems, the establishment of a monitoring system for vocational education program status and planning, and regulatory measures.

This study examines overeducation in the American work force in terms of its frequency; segments of the work force in which it is most common; its relationship to job dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and depressed mood; and the effects of reinforcement from the worker's environment on the overeducated worker. Data were collected in 1973 from a national probability sample of people 16 years old or older, living in households, and working for pay at least 20 hours a week. Workers were interviewed regarding overeducation, job satisfaction, self-esteem, depressed mood, promotions, and skill shortage. Findings indicated that 27 percent of  the American work force felt their level of formal education exceeded that needed by people in their jobs, and 19 percent felt their education was less than that needed. Overeducated workers were significantly more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs, to have low self-esteem, and to experience depressed mood. Occupational role strain was greatest when the worker was both overeducated and either had never been promoted or did not perceive a shortage of people with his/her skills. (EA)",

About 14.1 million wage and salary employees worked overtime in May, 1975 (down 2 million from 1974) and about 5.1 million of them (down 1.6 million from 1974) received overtime pay for those hours. The changes were linked to the decline in economic activity beginning in late 1973. The goods industries, accounting for about two-fifths of all employees on extended workweeks in May, 1973, sustained about four-fifths of the employee reduction on long weeks in the following two-year period. In the automobile  industry, employees on overtime declined by approximately 70 percent. Overall, the proportion of workers on overtime who received premium pay declined from about 43 percent in 1973 to 36 percent in 1975. Blue-collar workers were more than three times as likely as white-collar workers to receive premium pay. Among overtime workers employed in May, 1975 who received overtime pay, about 70 percent were union members and 30 percent were non-union. (EA)",

The task statements were assigned to the duty categories sequentially, as they are normally performed on the job. A random sample of 21 members of a carpenters union responded to the personally  administered inventory by checking the tasks that each performed and by rating these tasks on a seven point relative time spent scale.

Courses were offered in response to worker demand, and were taught by union members, using either school or industry training facilities. Welding, safety, and blueprint reading were offered in most trades, with a variety of specialized courses taught in individual locals. No significant differences were found between participants and non-participants, except that more  participants had been trained in apprenticeships. Several suggestions are made for improving upgrading programs, including the prospect of using these programs to assist in bringing more minority journeymen into building trade unions.

        "description":"An empirical study of minority business enterprise in construction, the paper is based on interviews with 340 general and specialty contractors (out of 1,275 identified minority contractors) in Atlanta, Houston, Chicago, and San Francisco-Oakland, as well as 300 other individuals including civil rights officials, and other knowledgeable individuals. The study includes consideration of the characteristics of existing contractors and their firms, the aspirations of the contractors, an analysis of the problems they face in upgrading their businesses, and an examination of alternative approaches to improving and expanding minority business enterprise in construction. Among the strategies reviewed are demand stimulation through identifying minority firms in published lists and  redirecting public and private procurement toward minority firms and supply development through bonding and financial assistance, technical and managerial assistance, and labor training. Also discussed are the potential and pitfalls of the minority contractor association and joint ventures between minority and nonminority contractors. The general conclusion is reached that some minority contractors have significant potential for advancement which could be realized with the proper assistance. Specific conclusions and recommendations concerning the efforts to offer this assistance are stated. The concluding section lists interview subjects and bibliographic sources. (Author/MS)",

The components providing occupational information were: (1) a career orientation program for sixth, seventh, and eighth grades; (2) a cooperative work experience program for secondary students enrolled in marketable skill-centered programs; (3) a placement program for high school graduates; and (4) Project SET (Select Employment Trainee), a counseling/training program for alienated potential high school drop-outs not enrolled in vocational programs. A summary describes each of the components and presents major conclusions of the three year evaluation reflecting the  general success of the program. Other sections of the report provide descriptions of the interactive process used in evaluation, detailed descriptions of the program components, and the procedures used for each of the three evaluations. An in-depth discussion of the evaluation results (including tabulated achievement test scores and attitude data) is presented cumulatively by year for each project component, with emphasis on the third year. Appended are student, parent, and employer questionnaires for the project components, and a student achievement test for the career orientation program. (Author/MS)",

The two major components are the questionnaires and the system of scoring and interpreting the questionnaires. The methodology will enable the employee development specialist to determine the training needs of six categories of personnel specialists: personnel management series, personnel staffing series, position classification series, salary and wage administration series, labor-management and employee relations series, and employee development series. There is a set of three different 45-item questionnaires for each type of specialist. The combined results of the three  forms will yield a listing of areas of training needs. The questionnaires are designed to accommodate inputs from the specialist and the specialist's supervisor. The result is a readout of each individual's reaction to the questionnaire in terms of the appropriateness of training in areas of importance to personnel specialists. An example of a completed and scored questionnaire and its interpretation is given. Both manual and computer scoring are explained. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"A review of the history of adult education (AE) graduate programs and their recent spurt of growth reveals four areas of concern (trends). First, the content of courses seems to be returning to basic, practical knowledge after an emphasis on knowledge without application. Secondly, diversity in the names of units governing AE graduate programs is noted. The issues surrounding these name changes are: public awareness of graduate programs, employability of graduates due to name given program, and diversity of employable skills of graduates. The third concern is the relationship of programs of study to job availability and placement. Younger students with less work experience may give rise to a need for a sound specialty basis for employability. The final concern deals with the  philosophies of departments/units for degrees in adult education. The predominant philosophic stance centers on the dichotomy of basic content vs. process. It is feared that the issues of other more long-term educational units have been taken on philosophically. Perhaps a cooperative philosophy of adult education programs can be arrived at as a beginning to build on. (Author/MS)",

Numerous tables throughout the report contain cost benefit data. Private Economic Costs, Chapter 1, are reflected in a general formula calculating the components of student opportunity cost, other school related expenses, percentage of students receiving financial aid in agribusiness, and the average amount of financial aid received by students in the agribusiness program. The model implies that a student would work or go to vocational school and does not consider the alternative of college.  Chapter 2, Societal Economic Cost, identifies 16 components for computation: instructional costs (teachers), student opportunity costs, average financial aid given, equipment depreciation, building depreciation, ancillary and professional, administration local, debt service, operation/maintenance, transportation, fixed charges, transfers to clearing accounts, outgoing transfers accounts, school sales, food services, and school administration. Societal/private economic benefits are determined in Chapter 3; the concluding chapter determines societal/private benefit cost ratios.

Composite results of unvalidated knowledge tests, theory tests, school marks, and supervisors' ratings are presented which indicate that these measurement instruments have low empirical validity. The limitations of traditional systems effectiveness measures are also discussed. Although job task performance tests (JTPT) have higher empirical validity, they have had limited use due to their relatively high cost factors. A series of efforts to develop better criterion referenced JTPT, and to attempt the development of paper and pencil symbolic substitute tests of high empirical validity, were made. Described is the model battery of 48 criterion  referenced JTPT covering all key maintenance activities (checkout, align/adjust, remove/replace, troubleshooting, test equipment, and soldering), intended for use on the job, in training, and for validation of symbolic substitute tests. Developed batteries of graphic and video symbolic substitute tests were given limited validations. Suggestions are made for use of the criterion referenced JTPT in improving maintenance efficiency.

Personal interviews were held with 117 students eliminated from UPT. The data obtained were organized on the basis of the official cause of elimination. The frequencies of problems or factors perceived as contributing to elimination were categorized according to the five most prevalent causes of UPT attrition: self-initiated elimination, manifestation of apprehension, flying deficiency, medical deficiency, and academic deficiency. Information from the study is presented in a series of 10 tables following the interview format. Similarities and differences in student perception of problems as a function of cause of elimination are noted and  briefly discussed. The contents of the tables provide suggestions which may be evaluated on their merits in considering prospective modification of training procedures. It was concluded that eliminated students' perceptions of training problem areas can provide useful information for training program management and can suggest areas for training research.

Those 65 years of age and older are defined as elderly, placing 20 million of the 203 million Americans in this category (1970 census). The major causes of chronic conditions in the elderly and the percent of those 65-74 years of age who are affected are stated as: heart disease (40 percent), rheumatoid arthritis (9 percent), and hypertension (38 percent). The findings of a study on degrees of activity limitation of the elderly are reported, indicating that, of those with a chronic condition, 85.6 percent have some degree of mobility. Tabulated statistics demonstrate that financial resources do not prevent contraction of a chronic disorder. The factors  contributing to deficient quality of medical care are outlined, including unnecessary operations and drugs and failure of physicians to update their knowledge. The rising costs of medical care as a problem for the elderly and their high hospital utilization rate are discussed. The article concludes with some observations on possible ways to bring about needed improvement in health care for American elderly and other age groups. (MS)",

Training agreements assure the integrity of the continuing educational experiences that occur outside the classroom. It is with this awareness that the material contained within this document was brought together. The introduction briefly states the role of cooperative education and lists the various reasons why training agreements are essential to these programs. This is followed by summary definitions of training agreements, training plans, evaluation reports and followup reports; a general outline of the content of a training agreement (general information, monetary  compensation, statements of agreement, training plans, and signatures); and brief descriptions of the 12 training agreements issued by the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming. Sample copies of each of these state's training agreement forms are provided. The document concludes with a directory of the State vocational education directors. (BP)",

This accounted for 4.7 percent of all employed persons. The multiple jobholding rate for men was 5.8 percent and 2.9 percent for women. The rate was also higher for whites than blacks. The proportion of multiple jobholders who are women increased from 16 percent in 1970 to 24 percent in 1975. About 23 percent (900,000) of all moonlighters had at least one job in agriculture. The multiple jobholding rate for workers whose primary jobs were in agriculture (7 percent) continued to be higher than for those in nonagricultural industries (4.6 percent). Men whose primary jobs were as teachers below the college level had the  highest moonlighting rate (16 percent). By industry, men whose main jobs were in public administration in state and local governments, and in educational services had the highest rates (12 percent). The proportion of multiple jobholders holding second jobs to meet regular expenses (35 percent) was slightly higher than a year earlier (32 percent). The next higher proportion of multiple jobholders moonlighted mainly because they enjoyed the work (18 percent). Five tables support the data analysis. (Author/EC)",

These institutes have offered secondary and post secondary vocational education programs. Since the 1967 Community College Act there have been several studies concerning the structure and organization of vocational education. The Senate Select Committee on Vocational Education offers recommendations for the establishment of a commission on vocational education based on a special study concerning the desirability of modifying the state's vocational education system. Several fundamental issues have underlined the arguments surrounding vocational education: philosophical differences, jurisdictional differences, and the question  of compatibility between desired state and federal policies and the administration of vocational programs. The philosophical problem is emotional and therefore difficult to resolve. The second problem is concerned with the lack of a clear legislative mandate for the jurisdictional responsibilities for providing educational services. The third problem is concerned with the use of federal funds under the guidance of federal policies. Different viewpoints are presented. Appended materials include the Senate resolutions and the select committee; Substitute Senate Bill No. 2463 and a bill analysis; budget excerpts; correspondence; excerpts from Title 20, U.S. Code Annotated; and official statements.

This grid was used to classify cell(s) in which a given program operated (program instances) and to note the number of cells in which expressed needs were  identified. Of 118 agencies identified, 102 were contacted and 44 had programs. Educational institutions and volunteer agencies provided the greatest percentage of programs (60 percent). Most program instances were in human development (36.5 percent) and food and nutrition (one-third). Program needs clustered around human development, career ladders, buymanship, and management. A detailed discussion of the findings and specific implications and recommendations are included.

        "description":"The three-day conference focused on giving clearer direction and visibility to community resources utilization in preparing persons for employment. It sought to clarify the scope of cooperative education as a plan for delivering occupational skills and to examine selected issues which would serve to stimulate expansion, improve practices, and cooperative relationships among educators, employers, and organized labor. The 148 conference participants included State Department and university personnel, local educators, union officials, employers, representatives from national organizations, and other federal agencies from 45 states, the District of Columbia, and Trust Territories. Background papers include Education in a Changing Society (C.H. Madden), A Prospectus for Cooperative  Vocational Education (W.F. Pierce), and Critical Issues in Cooperative Vocational Education (R.M. Worthington). Different viewpoints from the areas of business (J.A. Pinkston), labor (J.C. Turner), and education (P.W. Briggs, R.L. Bennett, and E.C. Roberts) are presented. Seven issues dealing with cooperative vocational education were the topics of group reports: role expectations in career education, expansion of cooperative education in career/job preparatory curriculums, relationship to apprenticeship training, liability considerations, participation of students under age 16, rural and urban considerations, and employer participation. J.K. Coster's evaluation of the conference concludes the document. (Author/EC)",

The first major part of the document (15 pages) provides a detailed organizational outline of the behavioral outcomes and generalizations for the unit plans. The material is organized according to levels of maturity: (1) beginning (you), (2) intermediate (your family), and (3) advanced (your future). The second major section (142 pages) provides four unit plans. The first three units, prepared for the three levels of maturity, stress two concepts: the significance of textiles and clothing to the individual in society and acquisition and use of textiles and clothing. Each unit specifies the major concept, areas of concentration, learning level,  and behavioral outcomes; and is organized according to coordinated generalizations, learning experiences, and resources for learning. The fourth unit on clothing construction specifies the major concepts, areas of concentration, concepts, and generalizations. It is organized according to learning experiences or activities based on the five clothing construction concepts of compatibility, fitting, flexibility, stabilizing, and shaping. The document concludes with three appendixes: the criteria for learning experiences and teaching procedures, suggestions for individualized instruction, and lists of resource materials. (BP)",

        "description":"In 1974, Pennsylvania began data collection on veteran-inmates of its eight correctional institutions to assist them in taking advantage of veterans' educational benefits. A detailed interagency chronology of the efforts of the State Education, Correction, and Military Affairs Departments and the Veterans Administration is contained in the report. Of a total of 6,039 inmates, 1,521 veterans were identified. A stratified random sampling was made to estimate percentage of bad conduct, dishonorable, and undesirable discharges; percentage with Army service; average duration of active duty; average minimum sentence length; average educational grade level; percentage of blacks; number of prior offenses; and offense types. A 100 percent sampling indicated military service by war era and  eligibility/noneligibility for GI educational benefits. The average age for veterans was 33.6 years with a 10th-11th grade level of education; total inmate population age was 27 years with a fifth grade educational level. Approximately 54.4 percent veteran-inmates attended small group benefits briefings. The most prevalent request for assistance was institutional skill training/education. Intensive followup is planned in order to significantly increase veterans' participation in educational programs. (EA)",

Short visits were also made to Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, and California. Comparisons between Canadian and British approaches to continuing professional education were made on the basis of the visits regarding: their activities and development; the organization of the professional staff and activities in the centers for continuing education; university activities in the professional areas of engineering and management; the training of adult educators; and the financing of continuing education activities. Opportunities for part-time degree study in  Canada and the United States through the extended day and trimester systems offer new ideas for continuing education in British universities. Appended materials (30 pages) contain the author's notes on the continuing education activities at the universities visited in Canada and in the United States on an individual basis. (EC)",

        "description":"The study's purpose was to determine the supply and demand for vocational agriculture (Vo-Ag) teachers in Washington State for 1975-76. Primary source data were collected from the files of the State superintendent; institutional information was obtained from Vo-Ag teacher program directors of five regional State universities; and a questionnaire was mailed to all Washington secondary schools, with a 97 percent return rate. Among the 11 general findings were these: class sizes, enrollments, and offerings in Vo-Ag have increased in the 1970's, as has the number of high schools offering Vo-Ag courses; Vo-Ag teachers generally perceive their teaching loads to be heavier than those of other teachers; Vo-Ag teachers are generally younger than their cohorts. One of three reasons cited  by high schools without Vo-Ag programs was the unavailability of certified Vo-Ag teachers. Enrollments of the five teacher preparatory universities appear to be in a steady-state, except for Utah. The demand seems to exceed the supply for 1976 by a range of from 3 to 18 teachers. Other findings related to teacher mobility and loss. It is concluded that factors affecting supply and demand for Vo-Ag teachers be studied further. An agricultural education checklist and the survey instrument are appended. (Author/AJ)",

An extended analysis examines students and staff. The instruments used in Iowa are included: evaluation committee and  ABE coordinator questionnaires, covering the six major areas of decision making; teacher questionnaire, form A involving intended practice, form B involving current practice; student questionnaire, seeking student opinions about their classes; adult education director questionnaire; learning center coordinator questionnaire; Department of Public Instruction questionnaire; and co-sponsor questionnaire, involving the organization with which the ABE program co-sponsors classes. The evaluation methodology is flexible, and suggestions are made for revision of instruments and the limitation to one or more of the six areas of decision making. (LH)",

The document consists of two major components: sample instructional materials (40 pages) and information about the project (60 pages). The 14 multi-use resource packages designed for instructional use include two for each grade (K-6) and contain physical activities and supporting media. Each package emphasizes a cluster of occupations and contains objectives, activities, materials such as field trip site suggestions, available resource speakers, a teacher's guide, and testing materials. Guidelines used in development included emphasis on a greater number of occupations, additional occupations for  girls, methods for finding and grouping occupational information, emphasis on ability and training, realistic job descriptions, relation of classroom skills to future jobs, use of a variety of media including &quot;hands-on&quot; experiences, and integration of material within existing curriculum. The appended final report includes teacher and student evaluations and student growth data. (Author/KJ)",

Both mothers and fathers of the experimental group parents were found to have more personality disturbance than did parents in the control group.

The anonymous poll consisted of 29 items pertaining to religious activities, beliefs, and issues. The SAS is an instrument designed to measure attitudes of whites toward blacks in 10 situations. The results of the study indicate that the relationship between religious and racial attitudes depends on the situation involved as well as the type of religious beliefs and sex of the respondent. Those respondents who were active in the church and believed in God and life-after-death tended to show more tolerance toward a black person joining their social group and a black youngster stealing, but were more prejudiced against a black man raping a  white woman. Those with more liberal attitudes toward abortion, marrying outside the faith and not engaging in war tended to be less prejudiced, while those holding more conservative beliefs on issues such as the above tended to be more prejudiced. The results were discussed in terms of previous research on racial and religious attitudes. (Author)",

Twenty students who were performing at a year below grade level in reading and math were selected for the study. These students received individual tutoring twice a week for 14 weeks from parent volunteers. Self-concept, achievement, and the behavior of the students were measured before and after the tutoring program. The measurement instruments used were Rotter's Test of Self-Concept, the Wide Range Achievement Test for Reading and Math, and questionnaires administered to teachers. While the results showed increases in achievement and desirable behavior, weaknesses  in the design prevent the determination of a clear relationship between these results and positive self-concept.

The target population was primarily minority-group truants, aged 10-15, who had been in trouble with the authorities. The program included recreational and counseling components, utilized an interdisciplinary approach, maintained family counseling services, and at times interfaced with other institutions. Physical activities such as trips, were provided. The program utilized status groups to provide graded rewards and peer group pressure towards increasingly appropriate behaviors. Team conferences were held to provide consistency in approach and sharing of information among the  interdisciplinary staff. These conferences eventually became a training vehicle for staff members. Problems in the program included: (1) integrating the interdisciplinary staff; (2) determining the exact purpose of the project (therapy or education); (3) behavior modification; and (4) inadequate mobilizing of the community and its institutions to provide better treatment and programs for the youths. The program was quite successful as measured by offense statistics (fewer contacts with juvenile justice system up to six months after program) and satisfaction among parents and clients. (NG)",

Athletes participated in at least one of four interscholastic sports while the non-athletes were involved in only activities associated with a required Physical Education course. Differences between the groups on 14 scales of the California Personality Inventory were analyzed by means of the t test. Chi-square analyses were conducted on the distributions of year-end letter grades in English, Mathematics, Physical Education, Science and Social Studies. The results indicated that at both grade levels athletes rated significantly higher than non-athletes on the personality factors of dominance, sociability and achievement via  conformance. At the ninth grade level, the athletes obtained a significantly larger proportion of high grades in all subject areas than did the non-athletes. At the tenth grade level, the distribution of letter grades in Science and Physical Education were significantly different between the two groups, with more of the high grades being awarded to the athlete group.

The complete results of this study are reported in two volumes referenced in the bibliography. Part II describes the mechanics of the pre-trial intervention design in three communities, based on available documentation and brief on-site visits. The section includes: (1) an overview of the major  operating components of all three programs, highlighting both their common and distinctive features; and (2) separate descriptions of the selection, service delivery and termination procedures at each site. The specific programs are presented merely as being illustrative of the intervention design. (Author/SE)",

The polls were designed to investigate the incidence and frequency of drug use; the students' reasons for using and not using drugs; and student attitudes toward drug legalization, the illegal sale and use of drugs, and the University's role in providing drug-related services. Results suggested distinct differences between males and females, particularly in their patterns of drug use. The incidence of drug use and regular use were found to be fairly stable for males and increasing for females over the three years sampled. Beer and marijuana however, reflected  increases in incidence and frequency of use for both sexes. Significant sex differences were also found in 6 of 15 attitude items. In general, women seemed to be more conservative in their attitudes. Reasons for usage and non-usage were similar for males and females. (Author)",

The service careers of the subjects were then monitored for two years in order to assess the ability of the HOI to predict the criterion of in/out service. An a priori adaptation index developed from HOI items correctly identified as high risk 23 percent of those subjects discharged from service during the two-year period, while incorrectly labeling as high risk only 6 percent of those subjects still in service after two  years.

The guide discusses the Adlerian approach to disciplining children, which stresses democracy in the family on the basis of the equality of individuals. The Adlerian approach uses natural and logical consequences as a discipline for the child, rather than the power of the parent; encouragement of the child is also important along with parental action. To understand better how parents discipline their children and what kind of behaviors are disciplined, several suggestions are made for observing and analyzing specific parent-child interactions. Mutual problem solving, a  method by which both parent and child can solve their conflicts by finding solutions acceptable to both, is recommended for parents. The handbook has an appendix about behavior modification, with behavior charts and rating scales. (Author/SE)",

The question of interest concerns the relationship between the conceptual complexity of teachers and the type of teacher-student interaction in the classrooms. Specifically, this study asks if a teacher's belief system is related to a pattern of asymmetrically or reciprocally contingent interaction between teacher and students in the classroom. To assess the extent of reciprocally versus asymmetrically contingent interactions in classrooms, the Hit-Steer observational system was devised, which is designed to reveal the patterns of teacher and pupil interaction, especially the extent to which the behavior the patterns of teacher and pupil interaction, especially the extent to which the behavior of each  is contingent on the behavior of the other, by assessing the number of times a teacher or pupil attempts to influence (&quot;hits&quot;) the other and whether the other modifies his behavior as a result of the &quot;hit&quot; (whether the other &quot;is steered&quot; or not). Thirty-three seventh-grade classrooms were selected for intensive observation. Results indicate that teachers who function in a relatively concrete and rigid way tend to be more directive and controlling than others, and they tend to dominate classroom interaction.

In 1972, 13 percent of all policemen killed in the line of duty died while responding to disturbance complaints. Despite these dangers, techniques for dealing with such crises are rarely included in police recruit and inservice training programs. The feasibility of training police as specialists in family crisis intervention was first tested by the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance in 1967. The National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice believes that crisis intervention training can enhance police safety and make police service more responsive to community needs. The institute has prepared this monograph to explain the concept underlying the training and  to discuss some guidelines and problems in organizing a training program. (Author/HMV)",

        "description":"The National Institute of Education takes a fundamental approach to the problems it is addressing. This implies the creation of an intellectual framework for the problem areas, which can be used to systematize existing knowledge and research approaches and suggest promising new directions for research and development. Neural mechanisms of learning and memory constitute the ultimate foundations upon which learning of basic skills rests. This conference grew out of such concerns. Twenty review papers were prepared and circulated in advance by leading investigators, each describing a major research approach, well-established findings, current gaps in knowledge, current research efforts and near-future prospects, and relations to other approaches. At the conference, presentation of  highlights of each review by its author was followed by a prepared discussion of the paper by another leading investigator, and then by general discussion. The review and discussion papers, revised on the basis of discussions at the conference, will be published as the report of the Conference in late 1975 by the MIT Press. The report, in addition to being very useful to investigators in the field and to students, will be used by NIE in formulating its policy on future support of research in this area. (Author/CKJ)",

The question raised was, \"Are there any behaviors more common to women than men that are considered undesirable in an applicant and thus are hindering women applicants' chances of being hired?\" An eight-page questionnaire was prepared to elicit employers' comments on various issues relating to women as applicants for employment. The employers in the sample represented various segments of industry, business, government and education. The following are the main results obtained: (1) employers reported that women's career goals and plans for the future are more short-term than men's goals; (2) marital status hindered advancement of women into management and a few other  areas; (3) most respondents reported that women are more nervous and sometimes less confident during interviews than men are; (4) generally, female employers responded more liberally and tended to see no significant differences between men and women in a number of areas; and (5) most employers in the study seemed to be sincere in their efforts to afford women equal consideration in the employment interview and the hiring process.

        "description":"Starting with the premise that the construct-oriented approach is the only viable approach to personality assessment, this paper considers five propositions. First, a prerequisite to generalizable and valid psychometric measurement of personality rests on the choice of broad-based constructs with systematic univocal definitions. Next, measures will be likely to demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity and relative freedom from desirable bias if, and only if, these requirements are incorporated into test construction. Third, untrained item writers produce more valid personality scales than do empirical procedures using extant pools. Fourth, convergent and discriminant validity of personality measures is demonstrable even in the face of confounded method variance, and last,  a potentially fruitful avenue for further investigation is the demonstration of a number of reproducible sets of psychopathological types. Evidence supporting each of the above propositions is discussed. Some areas of research needing attention are outlined. (Author)",

This group structure was formed early in camp and was stable across settings, time, and types of dominance interactions. The hierarchy correlated significantly with the rank-orderings bed position and hiking position and highly, but not significantly, with athletic ability, physical fitness, chronological age, and late popularity. Group characteristics and individual differences are noted, especially in regard to the alpha and omega individuals. The dominance hierarchy appears to serve in the reduction of antagonistic behaviors and, on an individual level, to provide knowledge of where one's place is among one's peers.  (Author)",

An experimental design is suggested, though not implemented, which would analytically separate the effects of cooperative and competitive task interaction from those of positive and negative reward interdependence. Thus, it is hypothesized that both task interaction and reward interdependence would contribute to strengthening across-sex task-related interaction outside of the formal task-reward setting. Appendix A includes student self-report measures of the dependent variables of  interest, and Appendix B discusses several problems encountered in reviewing the literature on sex differences and sex discrimination.

In Phase I, specially selected students were trained both in the implementation of an interpersonal relations training model and in the conduct of small discussion groups of peers. In  Phase II, these selected students served as interpersonal relations training group leaders in conducting the training program for volunteers from the high schools in the Taylor County, Georgia school system.

The results showed that the training program had a significant behavioral impact upon the student participants. (Author)",

These students were given assertive training, as well as training and practice in the conduct of discussion groups. This activity constituted Phase I of the project. Phase II consisted of assigning other students volunteering to participate in the training program to discussion groups, each of which had 10-13 members. Each group was led by two of the students who  had been trained in Phase I. While the foregoing describes the approach used in the Taylor County project, the material presented in subsequent sections can be modified to fit other requirements. One modification which occurred in the course of this project was an expansion of the initial focus on appropriately assertive behavior to one which included all aspects of interpersonal relations.

He was strongly influenced by Kulpe, feeling that the thought processes were autonomous, in contradiction to more traditional and elementary conceptions of mental activity. His experiments, using paired-associate techniques to study the place of thought in logical memory, made note of time to complete each word pair; interval between presentation and test; and the subjects' introspections about the experience, perceptions of the word pair, and trains of thought engendered by the presentation of a single word. Significant findings were the different patterns of conscious phenomena each subject used in recalling the second word  of the pairs, regardless of almost identical recall accuracy, and the large number of intermediary phenomena (relational and non-relational thought, visual imagery, and false words) that made up the recall process. Michotte concluded that relational thought was necessary to logical memory, but that it could not stand alone. Michotte's emphasis on memory as a contributor to action (one experiment was carried on in everyday situations instead of the laboratory) and his discovery of the multiplicity of means by which different individuals arrive at the same outcome are still of significance to current memory research.

The program's content and instructional system were developed by the project coordinators using a commercially available phonics program. They divided the content into 25 modules that described terminal behaviors. A series of tasks for each module was prepared. For each task a set of pupil performance objectives was generated, and from the objectives, Quality Control Check Tests were developed. The program is carried out by  the regular classroom teacher, who ensures that 30 minutes a day is devoted to the program. The instructional system consists of six steps: becoming familiar with the task, teaching the skills, performing the skills, taking the Quality Control Check Tests, recycling the particular tasks, and achieving mastery. Following mastery of the materials, the student goes on to become a peer instructor for other students entering the sequence. (WR/AIR)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether children as young as second-graders could encode categorically within an abstract evaluative dimension. The study uses mode of stimulus presentation (auditory or visual) as an independent variable. The subjects were 40 white middle class children from grades 2, 4, and 6, who were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. A control group received four trials of words from the same subjective category. Interference between trials followed Wicken's release from proactive interference paradigm and consisted of a color naming distractor task. An experimental group received three trials of words from the same subjective category with a shift to another category on the fourth trial. The interference remained the same.  Subjects were asked to recall the words after a 15 second interference duration. Some of the results indicated that the experimental groups at each grade level show an increase in recall from trial 3 to trial 4. Significant main effects were found for overall recall performance between grades and across trials. The mode of presentation did not appear to have a differential effect on the children's encoding at any grade level. (MKM)",

        "description":"In an examination of the problem of national mathematical illiteracy, the math student, the math teacher, and the math problem are discussed. The math student may have defects, deficiencies, disruptions, and/or differences in the cognitive abilities required to perform a mathematical problem. The math teacher may tend to be less verbal and less socially responsive than other teachers. Math teachers also may have internalized mathematical reasoning and its accompanying numerical coding and notation so that they can hardly understand the primitive state of most students and many adults and thus students tend not to question, but instead accept math as a closed system. The math word problem poses a barrier to learning because of the new words and notations and the complex language  and terse sentences. An approach to these problems which involves the student, the teacher, and the problem is the R/Q procedure, a variation of the ReQuest procedure developed by Manzo. The R/Q procedure is a questioning strategy carried out between teacher and student in which they both read each sentence of the problem and then ask each other questions about the problem until the student is ready to solve the problem.

Work on the 1974 Oregon Statewide Assessment Program began in September 1973 and culminated in a set of reports and related informational packets in November 1974. The assessment plan involved the following procedures: selection of 25 reading objectives grouped into the four areas of word attack, vocabulary comprehension, and application skills; selection of 96 items for a reading test; sampling of a scientifically drawn sample of fourth grade pupils; testing; analysis of the assessment data; and review and interpretation. Results of the testing are discussed and recommendations for action are proposed. Some of the findings are that the general performance across the state  was good; the relative performance of the district types was consistent across the four skill domains; and the performance across the state was lower for comprehension and application skills than for word attack and vocabulary skills. Numerous tables and graphs illustrate the findings of the assessment. (MKM)",

A conceptual model is presented which could be used to identify the effective teacher. The focal point of the model is that effective reading instruction should be based on measures of students' outcome and then look for process variables which could explain the product. This approach is based on the assumption that students' end of school year reading achievement is directly affected by the reading instruction which they received during that school year. The model is then discussed in terms of three alternative assessment instruments, determining the appropriate unit of analysis, and making  decisions about how to best examine these data. (TS)",

The volume utilizes the interviews and self-analyses of 36 principals who participated in the Bank Street Right to Read Program, as first hand resources for the delineation of competencies required for enacting the leadership role in enabling adults to develop an effective reading environment in the school. The competencies identified by the principals are in the areas of staff development, leadership roles and relationships, and parent/community interaction. Each of these areas is discussed in the various chapters, in which are also listed  resources and references for implementing and enacting the programmatic and administrative aspects. Six different self-rating instruments are placed in the appropriate chapters.

Students enrolled in the lab attend each day for a regular fifty-minute period. The lab is an elective for all students and in all but a few cases does not supplant the regular English classes. Instruction is individualized, prescriptive, and effective. Both remedial and developmental contracts are prepared for each student. The basis for this prescription is the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test. The mean expected increase in reading achievement as measured by this test after two semesters in the lab  is one year and three months. However, nearly 50% of the students in the lab may be expected to show an increase of one year or more each semester, with gains of 3-5 years per semester for some students. These data are consistent from year to year. (TS)",

Usually this has been accomplished long before the child enters school. However, if the child's language is atypical for any reason, such as cultural or linguistic factors, then the acquisition of literacy requires a well-laid foundation which consists of a sympathetic and comfortable classroom environment and facility with the language of instruction. When this has been accomplished, the child is ready to learn to read, but should do so under conditions conducive to mastering reading skills. Through all this, it must be remembered that language variation can be used as an adjunct to learning to read rather than a hindrance. (JM)",

A correctional school district organization can be developed to support viable education programs for individuals within the penal system. The six states of Texas, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, Arkansas, and Ohio already have operating correctional school districts. Key aspects and elements of the special district concept are discussed. Positive aspects of the organizational concept are considered to be that priorities can be readily established and assigned to educational programs and services in correctional institutions, that legally constituted educational units have broader access to state and federal sources of funds, that funding which will permit full  programming encourages long-range planning and staffing continuity, and that the status of prison of educational programs can be advanced in relation to other prison programs. A profile of the Connecticut Correctional School District indicates a trend toward more centralized operation and a 50 percent enrollment of inmates in educational and training programs. Sources of further information about correctional school districts are suggested. (MKM)",

LLD students are often poor spellers and their handwriting looks like that of a younger child. Constant difficulty with certain grammatical transformations may also be clues of language learning disability. LLD students may have trouble with reading and may be incapable of getting meaning from certain words. Many LLD students also have problems in decoding the oral language and in communicating their own thoughts orally. Characteristics of the causes and conditions for dyslexia are discussed and three suggestions are offered for picking up clues about students who may be disabled.  The teacher should first find out what LLD students need and what they have to offer and then find out how they can work with their fellow students most beneficially. Visual materials, rather than oral or written assignments, are suggested as being particularly effective for LLD students. (TS)",

For city people who dreamed of suburban homes but were reluctant to forego the comforts of the city, &quot;Country Life in America&quot; offered an outlet to rural life. For those with the capital to make their dreams come true, the magazine provided a wishbook and a guide. &quot;Country Life&quot; ceased publication in 1942 after a profitable period as a magazine that appealed to and reflected popular  culture values during the time when technology was introduced to the public on a mass basis.

        "author":["Applebee, Arthur Noble"],
        "description":"Theoretical aspects of the spectator role in James Britton's (1970) model of language use are explored within a perspective based primarily on the work of George Kelly, Susanne Langer, Jean Piaget, Michael Polanyi, and Denys Harding. This view is amplified in a series of empirical studies based on stories told by children between the ages of two and five, and on written and oral responses to repertory grids and open-ended questionnaires by six, nine, thirteen, and seventeen year olds and from five schools. Separate samples of eleven, thirteen, and sixteen year olds were drawn for a supplementary study of various spectator-role genres and media. Developmental changes center in: (1) the relationship between spectator-role experience and the life of the individual; (2) knowledge of  the conventions of spectator-role discourse; and (3) the complexity of the experience (both personal and literary) over which a person has mastery. Spectator-role discourse emerges as a separate mode of language use at a very early age, but there is only a gradual separation of spectator-role experience from other life experiences. Not until adolescence is such discourse clearly a way to present possibilities rather than to describe reality. (Author)",

One hundred seventy-six questionnaires were returned and 158 (52.6 percent) were usable for tabulation purposes.

Students should participate in a work experience program because a student with practical experience in speech communication is in a better position to get a job; the limitations of the classroom make it hard to learn; and in such a program a student can see the relationship between speech communication and the organizational modifications of bureaucracy.

The development of a pre-legal communication program is discussed in terms of three interrelated states: (1) the development of a specific academic program within the speech communication department in which students, faculty, and administrators can actually identify students as pre-law communication majors ; (2) the pre-law communication program needs to be correlated with other academic subjects helpful in developing the skills and insights useful for the study of law, while also being helpful for pursuing other practical vocational interests if one does not attend law school; and (3) the pre-law communication program should be  supplemented by a series of related activities sponsored or encouraged by the speech communication department. Various activities are suggested, such as guest speakers, lectures, and interviews; video tapes; and joint law school activities. The paper concludes with a description of the potential benefits of establishing such a pre-law communication program. (TS)",

Communication education is discussed in each time period in terms of who the learners are, who the teachers are, what concepts are being taught or emphasized, how the concepts are taught, and in what contexts the instruction occurs. These components are also considered against the motifs of education and society, i.e., the values, beliefs, and goals that dominate the social and political institutions and inter-relate with the educational systems of the time. It is concluded that in the future, the most profound impact on society and education will be the advent of the learning society, one in which the emphasis will be on practical experience with time off for working before, during, or after  schooling. It is further concluded that the profession of speech communication will probably be a prominent force in the twenty-first century. (TS)",

Outlined in the second section are the logical and empirical requirements of systems theory in four variations: open systems, closed systems, cybernetics, and structural-functionalism. A brief example of how to conceptualize a communication system from a cybernetic perspective is presented in section three. In section four, the relationship among the forms of knowledge offered by the behavioral, actional, and systems frameworks are examined.

        "description":"Three potentially useful perspectives for the scientific development of human communication theory are the law model, the systems approach, and the rules paradigm. It is the purpose of this paper to indicate the utility of the rules perspective. For the purposes of this analysis, human communication is viewed as the successful transfer of symbolic information from one person to another. Divided into three parts, this paper examines the focus of laws, systems, and rules perspectives to determine similarities and differences; reviews the previous development of the rules perspective and its application to the area of interpersonal communication; and outlines a rules theory of interpersonal communication consistent with the previous discussion. The investigation revealed that  self-concept is an organized set of rules which direct human action through a cybernetic feedback system, and the rules paradigm of interpersonal communication is predicted upon the feedback approach.

        "description":"The first section of this paper defines covering law explanation as a theory which maintains that explanation may be achieved, and may be achieved, by subsuming what is to be explained under a general law. The model is examined in light of the deductive-nomological explanation, the deductive-statistical explanation, and the inductive-statistical explanation. The second section of the paper examines the feasibility of covering law models and examines some criticism of the covering law approach, including laws versus rules, cultural variation, and temporal variation. The third section of the paper examines potential barriers to theory construction and discusses irrelevant variety, irrelevant change, realism versus nominalism, insensitivity to embeddedness, and overemphasis on  statistical techniques. It is concluded that a defense of the covering law approach does not deny the usefulness of the rule governed approach or the systems approach, and that the covering law approach probably does provide the most complete explanation of a phenomenon when the explanans are true.

A total of 527 students enrolled in first-term daytime speech classes completed the V.R. Scale (Verbal Reticence Test Developed by Myron W. Lustig) during the first week of classes. Results showed that, as a group, community college students are more reluctant to engage in various kinds of verbal behavior than students enrolled in large four-year universities; that the higher students' grade point averages, the less reticent they are likely to be; that the newer a student is to the college environment, the more likely it is that verbal restraint will manifest itself; and that vocational-technical students lack the same  level of self-assurance held by students intending to obtain associate or bachelor's degrees.

However, studies show that spots do not constitute an important source of political information for any significant number of eligible voters, nor do spots affect voter turnout. A variety of factors suggest the desirability of prohibiting political advertising on television and radio (as in Britain) and of requiring publicly licensed broadcasters to make free time available for all major candidates to appear in an uncontrolled format.

It is assumed that college students need and desire the kind of learning whereby theory becomes functional in their lives. This approach engages students in the problem-solving process using a problem extant in their own community. A practical solution is explored and, finally, implemented in the community. The addition of such a project to the conventional teaching routines of lecturing and speechmaking will tend to encourage motivation, enhance communication skills, and develop stronger ties between classroom and community. A further expectation is that  classroom and community will become mutual agents of change. (Author)",

        "description":"The first duty of the educator is to forecast enrollments as accurately as possible, using the best means available. The second is to begin planning long in advance of a school closure or major reorganization. Watchwords of successful management for the years of dwindling enrollment are communication and community participation. Communication with teachers, pupils, parents, and anyone else whose interests are affected by the changes to come is crucial to any measure of success. Moreover, the participation of all those affected is essential. It will be necessary to glean their ideas and cooperation to be certain that decisions affecting the community are acceptable to the community. Taken positively, the implications of declining enrollments are that enterprising and creative  school administrators will develop better programs as they condense them. They will devise equitable reduction-in-force policies with the teachers' unions and will become even more prominent as public leaders when they unite with community task forces to solve the problems of school closings.

        "description":"This study investigated various characteristics of the multiunit school and a seven-step Instructional Programing Model as they relate to home-school-community relations. Within this framework, the study had two objectives--to describe the characteristics of the multiunit school and Instructional Programing Model, and to analyze the interrelationships among those characteristics in terms of the allocation of economic resources, educational values, and power. Data were collected at two schools selected from eight schools participating in a home-school-community relations research project. Open-ended interviews were held with principals, unit leaders, teachers, aides, and parents to obtain substantive data regarding the operationalization of the multiunit school and the  Instructional Programing Model in the two schools. Findings of the study supported two general conclusions. First, multiage grouping of students and instructional teaming were more successful than were other characteristics of the multiunit school, because they are more easily translated into tangible benefits. Second, conflict is more likely to result from differing educational values associated with the various characteristics than from their effect on the allocation of power or resources. (Author/JG)",

Two types of analyses were used: an analysis of computerized personnel data, and an analysis of administrators' responses to an 18-item questionnaire. Questionnaire items fell into four general categories, including perceptions about job preferences, perceptions about graduate preparation and choice of academic field, perceptions about present administrative responsibilities, and perceptions about teaching, research, and choice of colleagues.

If the assumptions underlying program budgeting are accepted, the system can be an effective tool for identifying new ways to do jobs faster, better, and less expensively. Some technical and psychological problems may have to be overcome before the potential benefits of program budgeting are realized. The major technical problems are determining the relevant costs of programs and determining the causal effects of programs. The decision to implement a program budgeting system should be a six-step process: (1) define and limit a problem to be solved or a question to be  answered; (2) analyze the problem in terms of technical or psychological factors, and anticipate new problems that may emerge as a result of solving the original problem; (3) develop standards by which solutions to the problem can be evaluated; (4) collect and organize all data pertinent to the decision; (5) select a preferred solution to the problem and test it; and (6) implement the preferred solution and evaluate it.

        "description":"This report presents the results of a survey of 5 public and 22 private schools in which Work Incentive Program (WIN) registrants were enrolled for vocational training during the vouchering feasibility test in Portland, Oregon. The data include the responses of school representatives to an interview schedule that asked about the schools, their operations, their reactions to the vouchering program, and, additionally, what the schools said about 146 of the 168 WIN registrants who spent their training vouchers in the schools. Pervasive differences in the responses of public and private schools were found. These differences were attributed to differences in the size, organizational structure, and training philosophies of the two categories of schools. The private schools seem to be  more pragmatic in their orientation toward vocational training. The voucher system posed no particular problems for the schools, and the schools so far do not seem to have behaved unethically or in an exploitive manner with respect to vouchering. At the same time, it cannot be concluded that problems will not arise if vouchers become available on a larger scale and over a longer period of time. (Author/IRT)",

Over 60 community organizations, represented by more than 110 individuals, participated in early meetings of the commission, although the number of participating organizations and individuals declined as time went on. The analysis and discussion is organized into three sections. The first section analyzes the participating organizations and representatives on the commission and discusses the relative degree of community involvement versus administrative control of the  commission. The second section examines the commission's recommendations and reports the final votes on each recommendation. The final section reports the author's observations of political manipulation and control of the commission by the school administration and describes how the business of the commission was actually conducted and directed.

In undertaking and completing this program of physical plant expansion and improvement, the university has wrestled with and solved two difficult planning problems. The first of these problems is how a university in a landlocked urban center can create the new facilities needed for an expanding enrollment and an evolving academic program. The second major problem of significance is how to preserve an architectural landmark  that several times in the 1930s and 1940s narrowly escaped demolition. This was made possible by its conversion into an academic building serving a contemporary purpose. (Author/MLF)",

Besides meeting the requirements of a mandate from the state legislature, the system was also intended to enable the local school board to implement an incentive pay plan. A narrative evaluation form for teachers was developed, while a management by objectives system was simultaneously devised for the evaluation of administrators. It was also decided to use the clinical supervision process to improve instructional practices separately from the evaluation system. Two clinical supervision practitioners conducted numerous activities for the orientation, training, and monitoring of a randomly selected group of 30 teachers.  These teachers were administered preintervention and postintervention questionnaires to indicate any changes in their attitudes toward supervision. (Author/JG)",

Each model provides a different perspective on the problem of evaluation and each contains certain advantages and disadvantages. The five approaches are next put into organizational context by a survey of some major obstacles to effective evaluation studies. Persistent obstacles are found in the client, in the OD consultant, and within the OD activitv itself. In the final section, two issues are addressed that must be faced in any effort to evaluate an OD program--clarity of the role of evaluation and the audience of the evaluation.  (Author)",

The first three approaches tend to emphasize the product dimension of teaching, whereas the latter three focus more on the process of teaching. Most of the research activities on teacher evaluation have concentrated on the molecular level of teaching--the processes and results that occur within a classroom setting--whereas administrative concerns seem to be more at the molar level--the overall workload and attendant results. One way  of performing formative evaluation at the molar level while increasing teacher morale is to incorporate elements of management by objectives. This is what has been done in the Faculty Performance Objective Form designed for the faculty of education at Queen's University. This instrument (included in an appendix) can be used in overall and specific planning; as an additional form of motivation for individual faculty; and as a source of information for promotions, tenure, and firing.

        "author":["Napier, Lee"],
        "description":"In order to determine what characteristics are most important in prompting Mississippi's major educational consumers to hire teachers, an opinionnaire was developed and sent to a stratified random sample of elementary, junior high, and senior high principals, and to superintendents. The questionnaire consisted of 11 factors to be ranked according to their priorities by the school administrators who were concerned with hiring teachers for their first teaching position. There was high agreement between the groups. Effective use of written and oral English was ranked first by three groups. Personal appearance was ranked second by superintendents and senior high principals, and third by the other principals. The principals placed slightly more confidence in the evaluation of the  public school supervisor than did the superintendents, who felt that students' grade point average were more indicative of future teaching performance. This survey suggests that those seeking positions in Mississippi will not be judged first by their academic records and recommendations but rather by the way they write in initial contacts by letter, the manner in which they complete their application forms, and the impression they leave in interviews. Several suggestions for incorporating these results in teacher preparation programs are presented. (Author/IRT)",

The central focus of this paper is on the specification of cost-finding concepts plus identification of a few cost indicators. Various sections of the paper discuss the use of cost indicators for interstate educational comparisons, examine the use of cost indicators for comparing education with other state governmental services in Florida, consider the main issues and concerns in developing and using a costing system for education, offer suggestions for classifying and costing Florida's educational goals, and discuss some fundamental concern and problems related to a uniform costing system and to some  of the financial management problems facing educational administrators. The appendix contains examples of suggested data presentation formats and data requirements for use in a statewide educational costing system. (JG)",

The data are arranged in five columns in an extensive chart. The first column gives the name of the researcher(s), the date of publication, and something of the locale or the scale of the research. Complete references are given the end of the paper. The second column gives what is usually treated as a dependent variable--some measure of output or presumed quality. The final three columns list independent variables that have been used to predict the dependent variable. They are arbitrarily divided into three  groups: socioeconomic status and community, student characteristics, and variables over which the school has some immediate control--program, expenditures, teacher characteristics, finances, and the like. Much of the conventional wisdom about students, schools, and achievement is borne out by the research reported in these studies. For instance, such measures of socioeconomic status as family income, father's occupation, race, and educational attainment of parents are all highly correlated. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"Judgments about competence are always relative, tentative, and situation-specific. An effective competency-based program for preparation of school administrators must base judgments about competency development on the same sources that will judge on-the-job administrative competency. The four most common instructional orientations to administrator preparation--traditional, academic, phenomenological, and performance-based--share an implicit assumption that competence can be judged by limited criteria and audiences. Regardless of philosophical orientation, the most common judge of administrator preparation is a single professor. This audience has little or no importance in judging the competence of the practitioner. Most existing programs that have been labeled performance-based  education (PBE) or competency-based education (CBE) are examples of PBE. CBE may be best defined as a way of thinking about program planning. PBE is, by contrast, an instructional approach. To realize the promise of CBE demands the use of assessment criteria that involve judgments by multiple audiences. (Author/JG)",

Enabling or discrete objectives were assessed informally first through checks with peer perceptions and faculty perceptions. Experiences that were to serve as prerequisites for the achievement of later objectives were assessed through a record of participation. Terminal, complex cognitive objectives were assessed through written exercises. Objectives that resulted in written reports of research efforts were assessed by the  outside agencies for which they were done. Final assessment of the growth of the total group and of individual students was accomplished through public statements of self-evaluation checked by peer perception. (Author/JG)",

They feel that this process ought to continue. The following are some representative values gained through teacher participation in administration. (1) Individuals grow through participation in cooperative thinking and planning, and they develop a fuller understanding of the problems both of administrating and teaching. (2) Democratic administration is a means of developing excellent staff relationships. Learning to improve relationships through cooperative effort on school problems increases the chance of broader cooperation in the life of the community. (3) Democratic administration helps to achieve the release of  the abilities and powers of all the staff for the benefit of the entire organization. (4) The plans developed through cooperation are likely to be superior because the judgment of many has been brought to bear on the problem. (5) Participation in general school administration should help to encourage more democratic procedures in the classroom and, to provide greater opportunity for pupils to prepare for living in a democracy.

Using primarily the same steps of scientific investigations, education today holds a place of much greater esteem than ever before. The methods of deductive and inductive reasoning are the basis of scientific inquiry, which has proved of extreme value not only to physical science, but also to the study of human behavior. There is no question that basic sciences like anthropology, biology, medical science, psychology, mathematics and statistics, and economics have helped make education truly a science.

In addition to these propositions, intervention techniques that may affect Goal IV (student interest in school and learning) are described. The interventions, in most cases, are widely discussed in the literature and are being used in school districts throughout the nation. An appendix contains bibliographies related to these strategies, which include continuous progress plans, team teaching,  open education, learning stations, student contracting, individualized instruction, simulation and gaming, programmed instruction, and peer tutoring. The final section considers related innovative programs resulting from Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title III and describes a publication that can help identify school districts using these programs.

The assessment instruments concentrate on attitudes that measure the degree of value students place on areas of human accomplishment and the willingness of students to explore environments where firsthand experiences are available. The purpose of this paper is (1) to provide school districts concerned about the improvement of student attitudes as they relate to Goal IX with clues to strategies and programs that may effect change, (2) to help school districts utilize the EQA School Report as a diagnostic tool for the design and implementation of curriculum change, and (3) to provide suggested strategies and sources of literature specifically designed to focus on Goal IX. Two distinct  approaches are presented. The indirect approach analyzes the condition variables that have significant correlation coefficients to Goal IX scores. The direct approach analyzes the student response patterns to the questionnaire items to determine areas or subscales that can serve as a point of focus for investigating educational research and implementing intervention strategies.

Based on these definitions, the author argues that theory is at the heart of the administrator education curriculum, and that the study of theory is actually very practical. The author presents a model for illustrating student progress through theory courses and a second model for integrating the skills developed from \"process\" theory in the \"pure\" theory frame of reference.

The purpose of the questionnaire was (1) to determine the most pressing problems facing those who have responsibility for administering the School Lunch and Breakfast Programs; and (2) to gather recommendations for strengthening the legislation, with the goal of feeding as many children as possible in an economical way. This working paper contains the individual responses by the state directors; a summary of some of the more important answers received; an analysis of the potential effect on child nutrition programs, if the administration's bloc grant proposal goes into effect; some citizen responses to the administration's proposal; and a copy of this year's  legislative package for child nutrition, S. 850, with a section-by-section analysis.

Diffusion was a discrepancy area, and lab autonomy occurred. State and local implementation of a curriculum developed by the federal agency led to dissension within the project. Project renewal negotiations, following unanticipated events, were for further exchange of services among federal, state, and local agencies operating on scarce resources.

The empirical research tested three hypotheses: school districts in a at least some metropolitan areas are becoming less alike regard to their stock of human resources; school districts in at least some metropolitan areas are becoming more alike with regard to certain fiscal characteristics such as per pupil expenditures, property valuations, and tax effort; and the expenditure levels of school districts in at least some metropolitan areas are becoming increasingly determined by  the material and human resources found in those districts. The first hypothesis is not strongly supported, with the possible exception of the income measurement. The second hypothesis is strongly supported, though the movement toward equality may have been more a phenomenon of the 1950's than of the 1960's. The third hypothesis is also strongly supported. The paper includes conclusions, tables of data, references, and appendixes that define terms and deal with statistical complexities. (Author/IRT)",

Discussed are the geographical setting of the project, family profiles, the primary caregiver, project participation, families' financial status, housing facilities, and family assessments. The five major areas of project concern are noted  as child development, home management and parenting, health and nutrition, physical environment, and community relationship. Five case studies are provided to illustrate the variety of families and home visitor styles of service delivery. Responses to a parent evaluation questionnaire are outlined, and some items are briefly analyzed. In a summary evaluation, the outreach model is seen as a viable alternative for providing services to young children and their parents.

Information given on each of the 38 projects includes the delivery system for intervention (such as an LD resource room), the initial entry system utilized (such as teacher referral), and the personnel involved in decision-making (such as parents and psychologists). Flow charts provided depict the information gathering, information transmittal, decision-making and administrative procedures used in determining a  child's eligibility for LD intervention. Among findings reported are: that the resource room is the most prevalent delivery system for LD children in public schools; that almost 80 percent of the projects use teacher referrals to identify potential LD children; and that emotional disturbance is the condition most likely to be specifically invoked as an exclusion criterion.

Noted are the following major conference purposes: to increase interorganizational awareness of activities to expand opportunities for GT individuals, to identify mechanisms for improving public awareness of GT needs, and to identify critical messages and constraints in communicating with key audiences. Cited are constraints (mistaken assumptions) which prevent commitment to and implementation of better programs and services for GT children (such as lack of public understanding that GT pupils need special differentiated help; that special services need not be costly; that programs can be provided within the educational mainstream; and that GT  students exist among various racial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups). Stressed is the need for advocacy and communication efforts to be targeted to key state and local decision makers (such as board of education members and legislators), parents, and regular classroom teachers. Recommendations for further action include development and distribution of a communication matrix (a sample matrix chart is provided) of GT advocacy organizations together with solicitation of input from key representatives outside the advocacy groups.

Cross-cultural misunderstandings result from incorrect interpretations of the tone of voice, body motions, facial expressions, and the distances used when people communicate face-to-face. These misinterpretations are not obvious, and probably are not as rare as most people might assume, since they often occur below the level of awareness. Therefore, both teaching and testing procedures should allow for nonverbal communication. Dialogs can include gestures which can be either demonstrated by the teacher or shown on film and videotape. Varying tones of  voice can be used to indicate emotions just as vocabulary is used by writers to express their attitudes toward their subjects. Teachers can thus add life to the printed words in their textbooks and stimulate student interest and motivations. (Author)",

This publication seeks to provide a foundation for the coherent, comprehensive development of educational programs for children who speak a language other than English. The philosophy on which the design is predicated is that two languages and cultures are both taught and used as mediums of instruction in a truly bilingual-bicultural education program. The aim of such a program is to enable students to function with equal facility in two languages and two cultures. After setting forth several important considerations, the design presents overall  needs and goals for five interrelated elements of a bilingual-bicultural program: instruction, staff development, community involvement, curriculum development, and management. The needs and goals presented were assessed and evaluated by people experienced in developing and operating bilingual education programs in Chicago. The publication includes a selected listing of sources of information and a selected bibliography. Both may be helpful in developing bilingual-bicultural education programs. A copy of the 1973 Foreign Language Survey of Chicago Public Schools accompanies the document. (Author/CLK)",

The aims of the paper are to: (1) show the usefulness of introducing the concept of reference point in tense analysis, (2) provide an account of how to construe reference points semantically, and (3) speculate on how to fit this semantics of tenses into a formal grammar of English. Reference point is defined as an expression which refers to a moment of time at which it is appropriate to utter some temporally-positioned version of the sentence in question, and as an expression that designates a time at which the speaker of the sentence might imagine himself as uttering some version of the sentence in question. This definition  has to do with speaker strategies, aims of discourse, and beliefs of the speaker. In this analysis, tenses are viewed as properties of entire sentences rather than as properties of verbs or verb phrases. A semantic approach is proposed, since tenses are not always marked morphologically or syntactically. Representations of all relevant tenses and sequence of tense rules can be generated by the proposed analysis. (CLK)",

The research was done by a number of teams scattered throughout France, and this book is a collection of the papers prepared as a result of their research. The report is divided into five sections. The first section serves as an introduction and gives the objectives and the organization of the report. The second proposes ways of improving the level and structure of verbal communication in the classroom. The third section presents some non-linguistic facets of communication, describes the phonological component of the research and includes a presentation of the phonological system of French. The implementation of certain pedagogical  experiments in the teaching of communication is described in the fourth section. The fifth consists of articles dealing with various approaches to the observation of language learning processes, including the sociological/psychosociological approach, the psychological approach, the linguistic approach and the psychopedagogical approach.

The discussion in the course centered on the philosophers Richard Montague and Ludwig Wittgenstein. The course was divided into three sections: (1) Introduction--discussing trends in the philosophy of language in regard to the role and importance of formalization, and describing and giving some history of the three fundamental notions of logical syntax, meta-language, and an &quot;Lsemantic&quot; definition of truth; (2) Montague--describing his work on the formalization of natural language and giving an account of Montague grammar with examples; and (3) Wittgenstein--showing how some of his ideas are relevant to  the present situation of AI and the way they clash with the views of the formalist school. The course emphasized the importance of partial/inductive knowledge in our understanding of language and concluded that to handle language &quot;formally&quot; on a computer, it is in no way necessary to accept tenets based on formal logic. The most fruitful approaches to understanding language are precisely those not subservient to a powerful logical or semantic theory. (TL)",

        "description":"This paper challenges from a practical point of view the idea that the phonemic principle is the most adequate or the optimal theoretical basis for devising a romanized alphabet for a language. In the past, romanization of languages, written or unwritten, have largely been based on the phonemic principle and have unnecessarily burdened the learner with the task of memorizing phonological rules. In the present paper, a strict distinction is made between a romanization for a practical purpose (i.e., for a foreigner) and a romanization for a scientific linguistic purpose (i.e., for a native speaker), because the learner does not have the same competence in the target language as the native speaker. Furthermore, a language is romanized, not for its native speakers who can read the  language in their native writing system, but rather for those who do not use the same writing system. Korean is used as an example to demonstrate how romanization can be free of as many phonological rules as possible, and adhere as far as possible to the principle of \"one sound, one symbol.\" (Author)",

        "description":"A number of terms employed in the field of bilingual education are used interchangeably and incorrectly. Some of these are: English as a second language (ESL), English as a foreign language (EFL), Americanization, bilingual, bicultural, multicultural, multiethnic, cross-cultural, and intergroup. There is a lack of consensus as to the meaning, perspectives and proper uses of these terms, which causes considerable confusion. This article is a plea for some agreement on the definition of commonly used terms relating to bilingual education. Educators should adhere to two principles when they refer to bilingual education: (1) indicate whether these terms are used as products or processes, and (2) distinguish between programs and components. The terms listed above usually refer to  instructional processes, and the major part of this article defines these processes, which are at the heart of bilingual/bicultural education. (Author/TL)",

Small-scale refers not to the number of subjects involved, but to the scope of the experiment. Instead of looking at a method as a whole (as happens in large-scale global experiments) one limits the area to be investigated, isolating particular variables for study and controlling likely confounding variables. To assess the various methods, two different French grammar topics were presented through the common medium of the language laboratory, at varying levels from first-year university to first-year secondary school in southeast England. Several tapes were made for each topic, all covering the same  information, but dealing with it in different ways. The children were divided into groups at random, each child in a particular group using one of the tapes. One group acted as controls. All the subjects were tested on the particular topic before being given the tape, then immediately afterwards, and again ten days later. The results were analyzed statistically, using a computer, to see whether the tapes had had a differential effect on the pupils' achievement and/or attitude scores. (Author)",

        "description":"The recent tendency in language instruction is toward the functional approach which shifts focus away from structure and internal semantics toward communicative competence and the external uses to which language is put. The implications of this trend for methodology, materials production, educational technology, and in particular for the language laboratory are discussed here. The efficiency of the language laboratory is questioned. The main criticism is that it isolates the learner, thereby excluding visual, kinesic and proxemic information. Also, it has not been proven by any empirical surveys that the language laboratory as it now exists is doing the job it is supposed to. The evidence points towards the abolition of the classroom-laboratory and a corresponding increase in  sound libraries and in the diffusion of a variety of audio-visual equipment. It is predicted that the next generation of language laboratories will be \"video-boratories\" wherever they can be afforded. But any expediture on expensive laboratory set-ups should be considered carefully in terms of returns. The switch to the functional approach will result in a move away from artificially constructed programs toward the use of authentic materials. (TL)",

The long-range purpose was to delve into the more theoretical issue of the kinds of bilingual functioning. The discussion is divided into the following sections: (1) the compound-coordinate dimension--the history of the study of this concept and the difficulty of defining the distinction between compound bilinguals and coordinate bilinguals; (2) acquisitional and societal patterns--how the place and manner of the acquisition of the two languages affects the degree of compoundness or coordinateness; and (3) description and analysis of the data--the subjects, the  instruments used, and the results, which are summarized in tables appended to the report. The experiment suggests that: (1) UTSA Chicanos fall, by and large, into the category of compound bilinguals, (2) their compoundness is a result of a fairly high degree of acculturation into the dominant society, and (3) the diglossic behavior of the older generation is in the process of changing into a more random-bilingual one in the younger generation.

Because men have been able to effectively control English through their control of the communications media and educational institutions, they have made our language an effective instrument in the continuing oppression of women and the perpetuation of sex-role stereotypes. The effects of male control of English are seen most clearly in the \"gender classification system,\" which most grammarians have described as a system of \"natural gender.\" In fact, however, our nouns are not classified on the basis of \"natural\" gender, except insofar as it has been defined by men. Aside from a very small number of animate  nouns, e.g., \"nurse,\"\"secretary,\"\"mother,\"\"prostitute,\" every other human noun in English is inherently masculine, and carries the semantic feature + male as part of its lexical entry. Modern linguists have simply continued the tradition of male control of language, as evidenced both in their descriptions and in their illustrative examples in textbooks. Neither English nor its grammars have changed much in four centuries. (Author/CLK)",

This interaction is seen, then, as delimiting androgynous possibilities.

Social policy on labor utilization has become increasingly involved in neutering employment vocabulary regarding occupational titles, job classifications, recruitment, and upgrading. Relatively little attention has been given to sexist rhetoric related to work, career choice, opportunity structures, and occupational mobility. The rhetoric for maintaining women as an underclass and for preserving traditional values on sex roles in the labor market has played a powerful part in socialization of both females and males for \"keeping women in their  place.\" This socialization in microstructures and macrostructures has involved the use of language and ideology which, starting in early childhood, fosters female learned helplessness and provides many hidden dissuaders to discourage career aspirations, entering occupations, and achieving levels of employment not \"traditional\" for women.

These three dimensions lead necessarily to activity in other fields, specifically (1) information gathering; (2) bringing information about languages and jobs to the attention of the public, including students, parents, counselors, school administrators and members of the business community; and (3) curriculum development. Due to declining enrollments and changing student attitudes and needs, foreign language departments need to redefine their goals with a  realistic approach to the place of language skills in actual career planning. With this approach, language needs to be offered not as a primary skill but rather as an auxiliary or supportive one. Materials appropriate for career-oriented language courses are needed, and the career approach will also undoubtedly affect teacher training. In addition, interaction between the school and the community is needed, partially in the form of adult language programs, a few of which are described here. (CLK)",

        "description":"State after state is wrestling with federal legislation's mandate to respond to the needs of students whose native language is not English. Much ambiguity, confusion, and frustration surrounds the issue of bilingual-bicultural education. This paper begins by describing the confusion which often surrounds the English component in a bilingual program, and then reviews the historical development of bilingual education in the United States. Within this context, aspects and implications of the Bilingual Education Act are discussed. Definitions of key terms are then presented, followed by a discussion of the fundamental question of whether the child's mother tongue should function solely as a &quot;bridge&quot; to English or whether a systematic attempt should be made to maintain and develop  linguistic and cultural differences between the child's native language and the target language. Specific problems related to bilingual-bicultural education are then discussed in some detail. Some of these include the qualifications of bilingual-bicultural teachers, the development and implementation of a bilingual curriculum, the development of bilingual-bicultural materials, the identification of bilingual children and/or the assessment of language dominance. Finally, the importance of community involvement in bilingual-bicultural programs is discussed. (Author/TL)",

        "description":"Very sharp discrimination functions for the timing of voice onset relative to stop release characterize perceptual boundaries between certain pairs of stop consonants for adult speakers of many languages. To explore how these discriminations depend on experience, their development was studied among Kikuyu children, whose native language contains no stops in which voicing is substantially delayed relative to stop release (e.g., /p/). Kikuyu distinguishes stops in which voice onset substantially precedes release (prevoiced) from those in which voice onset is nearly simultaneous with release (voiced) for apical and velar places of articulation. However, the language has only a single prevoiced labial stop. Prior to exposure to English, children discriminated prevoiced from voiced  labials and voiced from voiceless labials, although these distinctions are not phonemic in Kikuyu. Moreover, the voiced/voiceless discrimination for labials ([ba]) versus [pa]) improved markedly with schooling in English, rapidly surpassing the prevoiced/voiced distinction. Apparently, certain voice onset time differences are naturally discriminable, but it is also apparent that the very fine voiced/voiceless discrimination among adults for whom it is phonemic is largely attributable to experience.

        "description":"In teaching a course on the history of the German language, it is preferable to use the linguistic approach, which deals with the structure of language and those linguistic events which characterize the development of contemporary German from Proto-Indo-European, rather than the cultural approach, with emphasis on extralinguistic data. The main arguments in favor of this viewpoint are: (1) in most German major or graduate programs the students will have little other opportunity to experience a linguistics course and should therefore be given as heavy a dose of linguistics as possible; and (2) the cultural aspects of the history of German can be picked up much more easily by the students as an adjunct to their other classes, or on their own. Such language history courses should  also give attention to contrasting German and English. The students taking such courses will be mostly Americans who plan to teach German in America. Knowledge of the historical bases for irregularities in German and of the main linguistic features which distinguish it from English should make language teaching easier for them. Many examples are given from phonology and some from grammar where such knowledge would be useful in explaining language phenomena. (Author/TL)",

It has been designed to accomplish two goals: (1) provide a language-related academic experience for students who would otherwise not have any contact with languages, and (2) attract students to the further study of language. There are nine major components in the course: (1) geography and language; (2) the origins of language and the evolution of dialects; (3) the deep culture of language; (4) the similarity of the Indo-European languages and the differences in the Chinese and Japanese grammatical and writing systems; (5) the analysis and demonstration of sample dialogs in French, Spanish, German, and Russian; (6) the \"international\" language of science; (7) the genius of literature (sample readings);  (8) the arts and language: a survey of music or opera or art or the film in foreign cultures; and (9) beyond language: computer languages, codes and codebreaking, the language of symbols and signs. All four languages taught at Murray State University are represented, and additional lectures are given by the departments of Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Art, Music, and English.

Many students, however, are effectively denied such opportunity for intellectual growth by the identification of education with job-training. Much of the curriculum neglects the past and the foreign. Humanists approach this problem not be reforming humanities curricula per se but by proposing \"bridges\" between the humanities and vocational interests. There is a great need for individual humanities courses that are not introductions to further work in a particular discipline. The \"arguments\" for persuading students to study the humanities have changed little in this century; these are categorized as (1) the traditional, (2) the exemplary, and (3) the pragmatic.  All are persuasive, but none offers absolute proof of the benefits of such education. The methods of the sciences and social sciences should be applied to furnish that proof. In addition, it should be possible to popularize the content of the humanities without vulgarizing or diluting it. Everyone beyond infancy has skills and knowledge of a humanistic kind. There are hopeful signs of a resurgence of interest in humanities education. Humanists must choose now whether to harness this interest to their own purposes or to decry it as a dilution of their discipline. (Author/KM)",

The basic assumption is that the content of an utterance must be its most salient aspect in memory. The for of an utterance, its surface grammar and phonology, must have some salience for memory, especially short-term, but nothing like that of content. Amy meaningful grammatical distinctions of markers should, therefore, be more salient in memory than meaningless ones. This experiment focuses exclusively on different varieties of one surface distinction: sentences whose underlying predicate surfaces as a verb versus those where the same predicate surfaces as some nominalization of that verb. The  experiment consisted of administering to the subjects pairs of synonymous sentences, differing in the above manner and referred to as Critical Pairs (CP's), and five other types of sentences, included for comparing recognition performance on CP's to performance on other kinds of linguistic memory. The conclusion is that the surface syntactic differences manipulated here have little, if any, salience for memory, and that it is unlikely for such surface differences to have any semantic consequence. Such conclusions, however, do not necessarily generalize to other surface features. (Author/TL)",

        "description":"A thorough study of changing student transportation patterns is justified on the grounds that (1) campuses are major traffic generators; (2) there is increased concern over the need to develop transportation systems that pose less ecological threat to the urban environment; (3) transportation patterns of students, faculty, and staff are changing and planning for the future requires an analysis of the changes. This study analyzes all significant changes in student transportation patterns at the University of California during the period 1965-66 to 1971-72. The study was initiated in 1972 when the number of bicyclists appeared to be rapidly increasing at several of the nine University campuses. The campuses were classified by their dominant student transportation orientation:  pedestrian (San Francisco and Berkeley); bicycling (Davis and Santa Barbara); automobile (Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Diego); and auto-public transportation (Santa Cruz). The factors shaping student transportation patterns are discussed including proximity and concentration of student housing; availability and quality of alternative transportation modes; scale and intensity of environs development; topography of campus and environs; and campus and community transportation policies.

        "description":"In 1969, in a report to The Ford Foundation entitled &quot;The Law and the Lore of Endowment Funds,&quot; William L. Cary and Craig B. Bright summarized the results of an extensive survey of the law governing college and university endowment funds. The key conclusion of the report is that &quot;there is no substantial authority under existing law to support the widely held view that the realized gains of endowment funds of educational institutions must be treated as principal.&quot; This was critiqued by Thomas E. Blackwell and Ralph S. Johns (NACUBO Professional File, May 1970). The first article in this publication by Cary and Bright is a reply to the critique and deals primarily with the legal aspects of endowment funds and particularly with the question of whether capital gains on investments  should be treated as principal or as income. The second article, by John F. Meck, is also a comment on the Blackwell-Johns article and presents the author's thoughts on the investment considerations involved, especially as they relate to the concept of total return. (JMF)",

A questionnaire, designed to determine professional characteristics of the respondents, and environmental, and organizational factors supportive of curriculum research was mailed to the total faculty of four colleges, and the responses analyzed. In additional, other, similar studies were reviewed and the results compared with the present study. Curriculum researchers reported a higher incidence of: doctorates; senior faculty positions; heavier teaching loads; administrative responsibilities; degree of outside professional activities; research training; departmental research committees and student research programs; established college  relationships with other institutions; availability of a centralized research office; and awareness. All respondents: ranked curriculum research low for curriculum improvement; reported similar motivators; and ranked individual faculty, departmental chairmen, and the presidents highest for favorable attitudes toward research. Results of similar studies were generally consistent with the results of this study. (Author)",

The procedures presented are suggested methods for collection of data on each particular outcome measure, often with several alternatives suggested. The procedures are not all-inclusive, but rather are designed to suggest a starting point for institutions wishing to collect the data. Most procedures are relatively straight-forward, relying primarily on two methods of data  collection: (1) a questionnaire administered to those receiving the benefits of postsecondary education or to those who can determine how many persons received certain benefits, and (2) searches of institutional records.

One outcome of this history is the dual system of higher education--a system that is partly private and partly public. Despite the important service rendered by the private sector, it is today facing a bleak financial future. Meanwhile dozens of new public institutions and new campuses of old ones have been established , new educational programs have been started in the public sector, and the general quality of public institutions has been raised. These changes have still further weakened the competitive position of the private sector. It is clear that if the present trends continue, many if not most private colleges will be in trouble. The nation clearly faces  the decision: Does it wish to maintain the dual system of higher education or not? The point of view that seems to be emerging among educators of both the public and private sectors is the emerging division of labor between the states and the Federal Government. The states will continue to have major responsibility for institutions and some responsibility for student aid. The Federal Government will have a supplementary and supportive role with emphasis on student aid, incentive programs to encourage state action, and categorical grants for research and graduate and professional study. The hope is for a plural or diverse system, including a healthy, private sector, within which there will be competition and also complementarity. (Author/KE)",

The rights of millions of college students to a low tuition education should not be bargained away in the name of some notion of \"higher educational consensus\" or \"healthy dialogue.\" Nor should this right be bargained away in the name of aid to low income students or in the name of student choice. An emphasis on student aid alone, without adequate institutional aid, can force a general increase in tuition that will disadvantage all students--working class and middle-class as well as poor. There is a substantial and growing body of research that finds increases in tuition and other college costs lead to decreases in enrollment.  Indeed, such tuition increases are one principal reason why the percentage of high school graduates going to college has been declining for several years. Congress and the administration should include a set-aside of funds for education and training to enable some of the unemployed to develop new skills for later employment. (Author/KE)",

Developed is a model which consists of three conceptual areas: environmental influences, social work skills, and supportive skills, joined by feedback of evaluative information. Each of these areas is independent in the accountability model for social work education. Fourteen construction areas can be refined into a number of elements, modules, or capsules of instruction. The focus is on the latter two conceptual areas, social work skills and supportive skills.  Accountability in social work education is not an alternative but a societal demand.

The target clientele is arranged into three general groups--disadvantaged, &quot;second chance,&quot; and those already making use of the existing continuing education system.

The model is a result of the authors' work with the Institute for Personal and Career Development which is responsible for the external degree program of Central Michigan University. Most adult learners have limited time available to attend class meetings; however, this time factor becomes far less crucial and learning and instruction can be efficient and effective if these individuals can acquire the basic concepts and principles of the course prior to the group sessions. For this purpose learning packages and various mediated materials are used which include diagnosis of pre-instructional knowledge, behavioral objectives, self-pacing and  self-diagnostic tests with immediate feedback. Intensive schedules are used for class sessions at which time the professor can assist the students to apply, synthesize, and evaluate the concepts and principles learned prior to class and to develop new principles from them. The professor develops the hierarchy of objectives and acts as the resource person. The student gains additional insight by assuming greater responsibility for an enriching learning experience.

These predictors were related to the following performance criteria, using step-wise multiple regression and Pearson correlation at the .05 level: tenure, most commendations, most reprimands, most absenteeism, \"ideal\" officer, most promotions, highest peer rating, highest self-rating, and highest supervisor rating. Results indicated that statistically significant predictions were possible on all criteria, but that each criterion was associated with different, sometimes opposite characteristics. For  instance, those with the highest peer ratings tended to be authoritarian, while those with the most commendations were not. Other findings included negative racial attitudes being associated with most commendations, \"ideal\" officer, most promotions, and highest supervisor ratings. Potential explanations and implications of these and other results are discussed. Ultimately a decision on the performance characteristics considered most important must be made so that officers meeting those requirements can be selected. (Author)",

        "description":"The National Commission on the Financing of Post Secondary Education (NCFPE) has developed a model of student response to alternative financing plans, and has used this computer model to evaluate several alternatives in terms of enrollments and costs. The model predicted enrollments by types of institutions and family income and costs based on the changes in \"price response\"--the changes in the number of students who attend an institution based on its tuition, fees, and other costs. Thus enrollment would be expected to increase if the costs to the student--price were lowered and enrollment would be expected to decrease if the costs to the student price were increased. Two models were developed from the NCFPE model. This document provides the results of using those models with  several alternatives interpretations of the general policy of \"low tuition.\" While the results can themselves be useful to the discussion of alternative financing plans, they are intended as an example of using these improved models at two levels of interest. These models, like many others, depend on the student's response to the change in the \"price\" of postsecondary education. A brief summary of this concept and data bearing on this issue are included as an appendix. (Author/KE)",

Even fewer have attempted to link projections of demand for degree programs to the supply of graduates generated by those programs. Moreover, none have set the state outlook for a particular college-trained skill within a context of the supply-demand balance picture for neighboring states and the South in the aggregate. From a career guidance perspective, if not in an educational planning context, such a comprehensive evaluation is required. It is the intent of this document to present preliminary state-by-state projections of supply-demand balances for a limited selection of degree specialties in the context of similar projections for the Southern region as  a whole developed under the same general methods. The projections of degrees by level, by state, and by field of study are based on the region's share of U.S. degrees according to projections by the U.S. Office of Education (USOE), and the historical distribution of degrees in the region by degree levels relative to the U.S. historical distribution. All graduates at all degree levels have been classified into 20 major fields of study. Generally the data reflected limited opportunities for Southern college graduates in the traditional field of work (conventional projection) but show openings in the extended list of occupations (comprehensive projection) to be more likely during the 1970's.

A central problem for the study is to suggest methods of how overarching societal (political) goals for higher education could be attended to, together with local and regional freedom and a local and regional planning that is effective and innovative. Another main focus is to study how changes in organization and decision-making can promote desired educational development such as problem-orientation, interdisciplinity, international education, course development to meet  demands for new student categories, and new teaching methods, such as project groups. It is based on talks with 250 individuals within the university and professional schools, on literature and documents, and on seminars and discussions within a limited circle of persons. In conclusion, it seems that present bad habits in organization, planning, and management develop because analysis of the real problems is neglected and inefficient methods are used to tackle problems that are not clarified.

Compared were two groups of medical school faculty members (including M. D.'s and Ph.D.'s). One group included those who completed postdoctoral work before 1968. The second group was composed of those with no post doctoral support. The two groups of faculty members were compared on the following indicators of academic performance: (1) academic rank in 1972; (2) research orientation of the employing medical school in 1972; (3) research responsibility in 1972; (4) participation in NIH training grants in 1972; and (5) participation in other federal  research programs in 1972. The M. D. postdoctorals outscored the M. D. nonpostdoctorals on all four performance criteria. The score differences were found to be statistically significant for all but the second criterion. An analysis of Ph. D.'s in academic medicine found roughly twice as many M. D.'s in academic medicine as there are Ph.D.'s. The Ph.D. postdoctorals outscored the Ph.D. nonpostdoctorals on all academic performance criteria, but only two of these differences were statistically significant. Although it is not possible to conclude that exposure to postdoctoral training results in better career performance in academic medicine, it is certainly not possible to reject that notion.

These variables fall into four broad categories: size of institution, faculty variables, financial variables, and miscellaneous variables. The most notable finding reflects the low correlation of the 27 institutional predictor variables with the criterion. It may be that other institutional variables were not included in the present study  that related to faculty attrition, or that few variables capture the variance in common among medical schools regarding faculty attrition.

        "description":"Universities in two social settings may independently orient themselves to public service obligations and/or restructure the university system along similar lines to provide the information services demanded. Yet, with the achievement of the information systems capacity in agricultural colleges in the United States and with contracts and idea exchange between these universities the presence of an information systems capacity is more likely to be the product of diffusion than of independent invention. Some specific concepts are more acceptable than others and some are also more acceptable in one social setting than in others. Q-methodology, a method of opinion analysis that deals with priorities, provides insight into the priorities of the social sciences faculty at Columbia  campus of the University and at NTU and Chunghsing Universities in Taiwan. Assessing diffusion by noting the deviation of item ratings from their ideal, typical placement in the Q-sorting seems to be useful. Generally, speaking, the social scientists on the Columbia campus rated basic landgrant concepts more favorably than those on the Taiwan campus. (Author/KE)",

This document initiates formulation of a federal strategy for consumer protection that works in conjunction with efforts of the states, localities, consumer groups, and other private organizations, describes the responsibilities of federal agencies in postsecondary education as they deal with educational consumer protection, examines the status of federal programs and efforts to improve them, and discusses the issues and implications involved. Federal actions recommended that steps be taken by federal agencies: (1) to help insure students' rights in the marketplace; (2) to prevent or protect against abuses of educational consumers; (3) to  arise out of their particular responsibility as funding or guaranteeing agencies; and (4) to strengthen activities of state and private agencies dealing with postsecondary institutions and their consumers. Some abuses commonly reported by students that are dealt with in the document are delivery programs of instruction that are different from those which both the student and the student funding organization were led to expect, and educational funding programs for meretricious rather than educational purposes.

        "description":"Faculty development has become an increasingly prominent concept for a growing number of faculty and administrators in American colleges and universities. To bring about the significant improvements in instruction demanded by the new and difficult issues facing higher education in the 1970's, it is essential that a faculty development program be both comprehensive and based on a set of diverse, though related strategies. Our proposed approach to faculty development is based on the assumption that significant changes must take place at the three levels of attitude, process, and structure. This handbook, designed as a self-contained guide to faculty development, presents both theoretical guidelines and practical suggestions for actually doing faculty development. The first section  presents a brief overview of faculty development. Next follow sections on instructional, organizational, and personal development. Each of these sections contains separate chapters on such issues as classroom observation and diagnosis, decision-making, and helping skills. Each chapter typically includes an introductory discussion followed by related instruments, handouts, and exercises. A final section suggests a number of ways colleges and universities can develop and sustain their own faculty development programs. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"This document explores some of the interrelationships between the collective bargaining process and equal employment issues. The National Labor Relations Act, the federal collective bargaining statute, is the focal point of the labor law discussion because it has had significant impact on the drafting and interpretation of state labor legislation and stands on an equal footing with federal equal employment laws. The federal labor statute, applicable to private colleges and universities is discussed, underscoring the Act's application to discrimination in employment based on race, sex, religion, national origin or color. Next, four federal equal opportunity laws -- Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equal Pay Act, Executive Order 11246 as amended, and Title IX of the 1972  Educational Amendments -- are briefly described, emphasizing their impact on labor relations matters. Finally, some suggestions for higher education collective bargaining in the context of equal employment obligations are given. To the extent possible, an attempt is made to shape the principle of law, which arises in an industrial setting, to conceptually fit a situation involving faculty organizing or collective bargaining and campus equal employment issues. Much of the discussion is applicable to both faculty and nonfaculty employees. (Author/KE)",

The survey included 609 students enrolled in business studies from 1966 to 1969. Studies at the university are pursued in two stages, four semesters each, that lead up to what may be translated as half-degree and degree examinations. Student success was measured in terms of: (1) the behavior of a student intake chosen from a field of study; (2) new methods of analysis usable in an institutionalized system; (3) models designed to forecast a student's probable success or failure; (4) a basis for decisions to improve conditions of study, with the help of a  simulation model; (5) an attempt to define a global, theoretical model for the study sequence; and (6) proposal for an institutionalized system for the whole of Australia to enable examination data to be processed by a central computer. While the possibility of applying the Linz model depends on the existence of relatively well-structured study regulations, the system might also be slightly amended to apply to any university, provided that the student was obliged to report before the end of his studies.

        "description":"Recurrent education, as developed in the past four or five years in a number of European countries, is seen as a process of formal, full-time, for credit instruction for adults beyond the age of compulsory schooling in which participation was supposed to take place during intermittent periods throughout the adult working life-span. This would include provisions for reciprocal entrance and exit between recurrent education and work experience. The central feature is the emphasis on formal instruction for credit that leads to certificates of completion recognized in the society as credentialling the student to perform occupational or job-related functions in a production and service economy. While there is serious doubt about the desirability of recurrent education as a sutstitute  for higher education, adult education, or adult learning, the metaphor of recurrent education can be used to teach us something about alternative social meanings available for the future of postcompulsory education. After examination of the implications of the concept of recurrent education, it is found that the future of adult education and learning is not best served by the recurrent education model imported from Europe.

The logical arena for corrective action is the states. It is they who hold the authority to charter, license, and in essence permit America's more than 1,000 private degree-granting institutions to exist. But only 25 states in the country can claim functioning licensing operations. The methods and criteria by which state licensing operates remain elusive and poorly defined. Features of nontraditional education such as time- and place-free degrees and credit for prior learning leave licensing officials groping for standards. Complicating the situation is the rapid change from single-campus tradition to an interstate marketplace in which  institutions of all persuasions are setting up extensions and external-degree programs far from home. Recommendations are that: (1) nonlicensing States get into the act; (2) a comprehensive interstate information clearinghouse be set up; (3) technical assistance and research services be given to the sparse and untrained staffs that comprise licensing authority in most states; and (4) additional conferences and active participation of state licensing officials in all aspects of the reform movement.

The figures show a wide variation among the states and an even wider variance among institutions. While it is impossible to eliminate all inconsistencies and accomplish absolute comparability among states and among insitutions, some uniformity is achieved by including only certain information. Information includes: (1) sums appropriated for the annual operating expenses of the institutions of higher education; (2) pre-allocated state taxes whose proceeds are dedicated to any institution of higher education; (3) wherever practical, separate appropriations for medical centers, agricultural experimental stations and cooperative agricultural extension services, off-campus outposts of universities or  land-grant institutions; (4) sums derived from state tax funds and appropriated for state scholarships; and (5) only net state tax funds. The data are in preliminary form and subject to verification and change. (Author/KE)",

The Program Effectiveness and Related Costs (PERC) framework addresses this problem. The five components of PERC are outcomes, costs, students, learning programs, and faculty. An overview and discussion of the PERC model points out certain minimum tasks that must be completed to build relationships between program effectiveness and related costs. These tasks are: (1) trace what happens to students while attending the institution and how much money is spent from all sources in various programs to achieve results; (2) obtain data on specific intellectual and personal attributes of students on entry and completion of their  programs; (3) collect data about student change and development from at least two sources; (4) use two types of measurements, quantitative and qualitative, to study and evaluate student change and development; (5) interpret and evaluate data from two points of view.

Because of this, colleges and universities are being forced more and more to base their decisions on hard fact instead of intuition. The institutional research function is instrumental in assisting in this kind of data collection and analysis. To determine the extent to which predominantly Black colleges were fulfilling this function, a questionnaire was devised to solicit information regarding institutional activities and products at the predominantly Black colleges. An assessment of the institutional research activities and products at these colleges suggest that the growing complexities of management and the societal pressures for a greater degree of  accountability in the last two decades serves as a mandate and as an impetus to organize and synthesize data that supports the existence of these insitutions.

The TCCP is a major effort in intervention and reform in the higher education of black Americans generated in predominantly black colleges. The goals were to reduce attrition rates by improving the quality of instruction at freshman and sophomore levels of college. The initial efforts and the kinds of results here are responsible for the fact that 41 schools have now been involved in trying to replicate these initial findings in a much larger group of institutions. In the body of the report the findings in each area are first presented as a composite picture, followed by a discussion of the comparative differences between the three previously identified groups of seniors. In  general, the study reports the positive outcomes of the TCCP. It implies that long-range gains can be made by black students who are in an innovative curriculum intervention program during their freshman year. Indirectly, the results of the study indicate the positive outcomes of ISE's recurring summer and winter faculty development efforts with freshman instructors on student growth and development.

Graphics display was used to construct a learning task with directed graphs and graphic data entry. The subjects were given varying portions of the spatial cues ordinarily available in fixed display. Results showed that spatial cues offered through interactive graphics were a significant advantage in the learning of directed graphs. When spatial cues were available, no difference between  different learning formats was found. When spatial cues were denied during learning, delay of the posttest was detrimental to performance. Regularly ordered formats of displays of directed graphics led to confusion for some individuals. In general, the use of interactive graphics for learning structural digraphs was better than the use of nonspatial media. (CH)",

Students with higher scores on the academic philosophy of the Orientation Toward College Inventory (OTC) has higher course grades. Abstract conceptualization was found to vary positively with course grade. Higher scores on the task scale of the Bass Orientation Inventory (ORI) were positively related to higher course grades for computer-based instruction while low scores  on the task scale had higher grades in the regular instruction group. On the interaction scale of the ORI the high scorers in computer-based classes had lower grades while the high scorers in the regular group had higher grades. In computer-based instruction sections, applied science majors generally tended to have lower course grades, but had more favorable attitudes toward the course and the computer.

A statewide public service media campaign was developed to demonstrate the library's ability to provide relevant information and to show the capacity of libraries for sharing resources as a way of broadening the capacity to deliver information. A communications strategy was presented to librarians in six workshops. Booklets and poster ideas were distributed to support local tie-in campaigns. TV and radio stations broadcast $15,889 in public  service announcements.

The second step is to determine the optimal learning environment for the achievement of those goals. The final step is to set up a system of evaluating the quality of the instruction and the performance of the student so that the training can be corrected if it is in any way deficient. If the systems approach is to be successfully used, three preconditions must be satisfied: first, the goals of instruction must be identifiable; second, the process of instruction must be open to fundamental reorganization; and third, the goal must be achievable in a reasonably short amount of time. Difficulties are often encountered when a curriculum  designer identifies only one course of action to achieve a goal, when in actuality there are many. The traditional teacher-centered model of instruction is also a frequent barrier to rearranging the educational environment. (EMH)",

(FRMS), employed a project management model for its organizational structure. The organization and management system utilized by the STD was designed to accomplish a predetermined set of objectives with the highest quality possible within a federally funded, prenegotiated budget. The management decision-making process was developed to maximize and control available resources in the accomplishment of specific tasks through a process of resource reallocations, task modifications, and intercomponent coordination. Therefore, the STD utilized a decentralized functional structure and modifications of applicable management science approaches including Management by Objectives (MBO)  and Systems Theory. The primary subsystems of the management process were the Task Structures and Control and the Budgetary and Financial Control Subsystems. Specific techniques applied when appropriate included variations of the PERT system, linear programing, and general financial control systems. In some cases, it was the first extensive application of such techniques in a large scale social project. (Author/HB)",

        "description":"The Satellite Technology Demonstration (STD) is an attempt to use new satellite technology and low-cost ground terminals to deliver community service broadcast to rural areas. Since community involvement was one of the projects highest priorities, clear communication between local, state, national, and international agencies was imperative. The public information plan entailed: (1) designing and scheduling information dissemination at all levels; (2) filling requests for information about the project; (3) designing information for all STD audiences; (4) coordinating STD activities with other health, education, telecommunications agencies; (5) developing brochures, displays, and media shows; (6) striving for indepth coverage of STD activities in various media; and (7) serving as  STD spokesman at various conventions and symposia. This information service not only facilitated leaders' ability to make decisions, it also increased participation at the local level. The appendixes to this document include lists of: materials used, external presentations made, appearances made by the mobile unit, special satellite presentations, articles published, press conferences, and news releases.

Three series were broadcast: (1) a junior high school career development, (2) career development for public school administrators and teachers, and (3) topical programs for community members. The STD also used the Advanced Technology Satellite (ATS-3) as an interactive voice-link with 24 participating schools and recorded this data. Schools were defined as &quot;interactive&quot; and &quot;noninteractive.&quot; Across all measures, the interactive students showed a greater number of learning gains and larger gains on those tests which reflected the cognitive aspects of the STD programing.

It also needed a nontechnical component to insure product and service acceptance. Accordingly, the STD's Utilization Component was responsible for identifying populations that could use the Project's products and services and for facilitating user involvement through information services and training programs. Both of these functions required extensive interaction with other Project components (Broadcasting and Engineering, Programing, and Research), but the responsibility for coordinating products and services in the field remained with the Utilization Component. In order to  coordinate products and services, Utilization had to: (1) develop and maintain a comprehensive field services network; (2) attract and hold audiences; and (3) promote regional telecommunications efforts. The organizational structure for Utilization was based on team interaction, on decentralization, and on a regional, state, and local field services network. (Author/HB)",

Difficulties encountered are due to the fact that the traditionally stated goals of schools are ambiguous, there is little accountability for internal operations; classrooms have low interdependence; and investment in technology is limited. Any significant use of mediated instruction (30 percent of total instruction) will require role reorganization of the teacher, administrator, and district. Operational changes will be necessary in the certification of mediated instruction and the distribution of financial resources. Technology-advanced instruction can provide a  more comprehensive curriculum, high quality courses at reasonable cost, inservice teacher education, and short practical training requiring specific skills. It can also monitor student progress, reduce administrative paperwork, and facilitate communications between schools and state agencies. (NR)",

The people operating the equipment at the remote installations for the Satellite Technology Demonstration (STD) were different from paid employees or from private consumers. The STD site operators were paid only token fees; thus, they are best describd as having been motivated by the service benefits of the system. Indeed, a survey of their interests and capabilities at the onset of the project showed little or no inclination for communications-type equipment. Although not necessarily unsolvable, the problem of training people to operate communications equipment is complex and unique. The STD, therefore, studied the stages and factors involved in training site operators. Initially, the prior experiences and  capabilities of the site operators were isolated to provide a base of information against which the effects of the STD experience could be measured. Sequentially evaluated therefore were: (1) training; (2) initial results of the training program; (3) site operator performance throughout the demonstration; and (4) psychological disposition toward the hardware configuration.

The STD leased 300 programs from Encyclopedia Britannica Educational Corporation and 100 programs from Great Plains National Instructional Television. These films were then videotaped and used by STD schools at their convenience during the 1974-75 school year. A catalog of titles was made available to classroom teachers for selection and scheduling of films. Participating schools were required to purchase a video tape recorder (VTR) and monitor in order to use the service. The MDS was rated positive regardless of minor  inconvenience such as equipment malfunction, copyright restrictions, and budgeting limitation. The project demonstrated that mass distribution of materials on an individualized, personalized basis is a viable potential for satellite delivery systems. A table showing the MDS audience attendance is included. (Author/DS)",

The STD amalgamated the resources of government, health, education, and broadcasting organizations and produced such programs as: &quot;Time Out&quot;--a career education course for junior high school students--&quot;Careers and the Classroom: A New Perspective for Teacher&quot;--an inservice program for teachers in the curriculum of career education, and &quot;Footprints&quot;--a series of community-oriented evening programs. The technical performance of the satellite and the network of inexpensive ground terminals which serve 23 states has  exceeded design requirements. In this report, objectives, planning and development, and results are extensively discussed, and a project evaluation considers hardware performance, program acceptance, student learning gains, and costs.

Paperbacks were proven to be even more acceptable than hardbacks, except that patrons did want access to bestsellers available only in hardback. In spite of a higher number of books unreturned, the dollar loss per 100 circulation was lowered by the use of paperbound books. It was  considered practical, however, to send overdue notices to those with a large number of unreturned books. A circulation study showed that the categorical arrangement appeared to be acceptable to patrons, but some redesign of the topical categories should be considered. The success of the experiment led to use of the same system on the other four bookmobiles. (LS)",

Since the model postulated that transfer effects would be a function of the amount of practice, half of the students were required to complete one practice problem successfully before moving on to the next stage; the other half had to do two practice problems successfully. All students completed the courses successfully; students who had one success at each stage did about as well as those who had two successes. The Wollmer was thus not suitable for optimizing instruction, in terms of minimizing overall time, in the particular courses. Perhaps the main  reason for this result was that, as the student works up to the top of the hierarchy, the sheer number of subskills involved in the final task becomes a major determinant of the practice time, and the number of practice trials has a relatively minor effect, unless a large number of practice trials are given.

The five main areas of concern to the early CLA were the development of traveling libraries and interlibrary loan within the state, the need for a state library training school in California, and the need for additional copyright depositories including one in California. Meetings held during the first decade covered those subjects as well as book selection, the ideal librarian, women serving in public libraries, book publishing and selling in California, and children's  literature.

Among the current trends are: (1) unhappiness in the divisions related to ALA's tendency to be less responsive toward individuals; (2) greater concern with bread and butter issues; and (3) centralization of power in the hands of a few, generally establishment-oriented, individuals. Also cited are the weakness of ALA in the areas of  democratic organization, library education, influence on the selection of Librarians of Congress, and publications. Benefits include ALA's role in raising the status of librarianship, pursuing foreign activities, and backing the concept of intellectual freedom.

A second kind of research that should be conducted would be to develop pilot programs and to have the programs evaluated by their intended target audiences. Since each local station has its own audience, it is necessary that surveys be taken at the local level and that stations become accountable to their local audiences.

The weight of numerous illustrations are to the contrary. Furthermore, the assertion is so broad that there is no way to prove its validity. To focus on a single variable (media) to explain the state of human consciousness ignores the multitude of other variables that are at work. McLuhan's second error is one of omission. He fails to understand the gravity of language in affecting communications. By comparison, the effects of media are only trivial. (EMH)",

This approach was attempted at OHC as a response to the decreasing abilities of entering students, after many other innovative techniques had been tried with limited success. The Mastery Learning strategy rested on a foundation of fundamental propositions about learning, and seemed specially in accord with the community college's philosophic emphasis on instruction. The paper describes the development of course objectives, establishment of achievement criteria, definition of learning units and identification of learning elements, and the construction of  diagnostic tests and prescriptive remedial materials. In general, the Mastery Learning approach has been judged successful at OHC; although some problems have been encountered, a greater level of achievement has been attained by students in Mastery Learning classes. Mastery Learning has permitted traditional group instruction within the fixed academic calendar. It has not required administrative restructuring, complex instructional hardware, curricular change, or a large budget allocation; thus it lends itself to implementation in many different college situations.

The trend to hire more part-time instructors will likely continue, due to the increasing numbers of part-time students, the movement toward off-campus classes in scattered locations, and the growing numbers of unemployed college graduates with teaching majors. Meanwhile, important issues related to part-time faculty are being debated: pay of part-time instructors, the number of day part-time faculty and their ratio to full-time instructors, their inclusion or exclusion as members of the bargaining unit where collective bargaining exists, and their rights and responsibilities in the department and in the college. The author delineates the different perspectives on these issues held  by administrators, and full-time and part-time faculty. The present situation is described in the major sections of the paper: definition, number, sources, qualifications, academic preparation, experience, workload, and wage rates of part-time instructors.

The program is designed to familiarize adjunct faculty with college procedures, to ensure instruction of equal quality with that provided by regular faculty, and to establish a process of communication between adjunct and regular faculty and staff. Based on a systems model, the program consists of four parts: recruitment, input, processes, and output. In the recruitment phase, media advertisement is used to secure qualified applicants. The input phase begins with providing the new  instructor with the Adjunct Faculty Handbook, which outlines college policies and regulations. An Adjunct Faculty Workshop attempts to initiate communication processes with division chairpersons and other college personnel. Extended availability of auxiliary services and their professional staffs as consultants to adjunct faculty during evening hours characterizes the process phase. Evaluation of the output is provided through objective/subjective student and supervisor evaluations of the adjunct faculty member. (BB)",

        "description":"In order to identify and respond to a broad range of identifiable needs within the urban-suburban community, an improved community college district management model was developed which combines the management resources of community colleges with the management resources of the multibillion dollar operations of community business, industry, and civic agencies to provide better, more efficient, cost-effective college district management. Emphasis is placed on determining objectives and evaluating progress toward community goals. This document reports on Phase 1, the period of preliminary development. Phase 2, will be a period of refinement, and Phase 3, will be concerned with further validation, indepth analysis of the process, and dissemination of the results. Fourteen different  developmental areas are identified, but the bulk of this document is devoted to a series of nine Progress Indicators which include samples of activity such as that from the Chancellors' Round Table, the Collective Bargaining Conference, Master Planning, and the Seminar on Administrative Reorganization. This document is intended as an aid to all multicampus community college districts in their development of improved management systems, and their use of community management resources. (NHM)",

        "description":"The growth of interest in personalized learning, which emphasizes the realization and development of the self-concept in the learning process, prompted educators to combine the Jungian psychological theories of Perceiving and Judging with the personality types measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to form a model for veiwing community college instructors and students. A sample of 354 full-time community college teachers and 335 first-term community college freshmen were compared within this framework. The most significant difference between the teacher and student typologies was in Sensing (a person values the immediate realities of direct experience) versus Intuition (one prefers the inferred meanings, relationships and possibilities of experience), with the  students scoring high on Sensing and Judging, teachers high on Intuition and Perception. These types learn in different ways: Sensing in a systematic manner using primarily the five senses, and Intuiting in a flexible manner relying heavily on language. This basic mismatch between the preferred learning and teaching styles of students and teachers, which may be characteristic in community colleges, can be corrected by the use of self-concept theory, which will play a key role in making education a humanizing process.

        "description":"The Advanced Studies Program (ASP) at Southeastern Community College (Whiteville, North Carolina) is a developmental studies program that offers freshman courses in English, biology, and psychology to approximately 75 students. Learning activities are individualized and self-paced, and each ASP course has behaviorally stated objectives. Instructional techniques include the use of self-instructional packages, programmed materials, and various audio-tutorial aids. Through these individually styled instructional components, and reality-based counseling strategies, ASP attempts to internalize the external orientations of nontraditional students, thus greatly enhancing their chances of academic success. Rotter's Locus of Control Scale was administered to 77 freshmen prior to ASP  enrollment. These students were given the scale again at the end of the first and third quarters. Of the 77 students entering ASP, 60 completed the spring quarter (77.9 percent). This persistence rate is higher than those reported by Monroe (1972) for community college students in general. Control orientation for ASP students generally shifted toward greater internality, and grade point averages improved with gains in internality. Recommendations are made for further research, and a bibliography is appended. (NHM)",

Surveys were conducted of all public college faculty and the Grade 12 public school population. Past enrollments, costs, and financing at all postsecondary institutions were analyzed in order to  assess the impact of the community colleges on the higher education system. Socioeconomic profiles were constructed of each community supporting a college.

The average veteran is a male caucasian, 24 to 25 years old, married, with one or two dependents. He entered the U. S. Army at the age of 18 in 1969, served three years of active duty, did not serve in Vietnam, did not receive a service connected disability, and was discharged in 1973. He has acquired 12 years of education, and  is taking 15 or more quarter hours in day sessions. He was employed before entry into the service and is now unemployed after holding three or more jobs since his discharge. Although he knew the G. I. Bill existed, he has not used it previously because he did not know how to go about getting it. Before talking to an outreach worker he was unaware that lower tuition and tutorial assistance were available to Vietnam veterans.

A questionnaire was sent to each of the 43 participants prior to an interview with a representative of the Institutional Research Office. The diversity of faculty views on the instructional process is attributed to intrinsic differences in subject matter, tradition, differing skills, unexamined assumptions, organizational constraints, and the lack of a common framework for conceptualizing the instructional process. Questions were grouped into four different  areas: (1) instructional techniques, including manner of presentation, and audiovisual support; (2) instructional intentions, covering the provision of a statement of course goals, and faculty expectations; (3) motivation, covering requirements satisfied, grading, and course requirements; (4) suggestions for improvement. It is hoped that refinement of the views reported here can be the basis for developing a common framework for conceptualizing the teaching/learning process on which specific improvements can be built.

As of the fall of 1974, B.C.C. enrolled a markedly higher proportion of students with high school averages below 70 percent than any other college in the City University of New York. On the basis of placement tests, 78 percent of the 1975 class were recommended for at least one remedial course in the reading-English area, and 68 percent were recommended for remedial mathematics. However, only 54 percent of the matriculated students actually enrolled in reading-English remedial courses, and only 29 percent actually enrolled in remedial mathematics courses. The actual programs of  students who were placed into, but did not register in, remedial courses is examined. Eight tables show the distribution of remedial placements in English, reading, and mathematics by curriculum; the actual programs of students placed into, but not taking remedial courses; the distribution, by curriculum, of high school averages for entering freshmen (general, English, mathematics, and foreign language); and the proportions of high school averages below 70 percent for freshmen entering between September 1971 and September 1975.

Using the information on current programs as a base, this sourcebook outlines appropriate core curricula and presents a model for program development built on the characteristics that appear to make programs successful. The key to the model is an alliance with the community of elders. Guidelines  for the choosing of a representative board are presented, as well as suggestions on how to attain the proper balance between the consumer board and the college administrator. The model itself involves needs assessment, selecting program content, insuring program effectiveness (recruitment, location of programs, and teaching methods), and maximizing manpower, finances, and other resources.

Taking into account the current swell in the field of media, this broad-based program is designed to prepare students to play a paraprofessional role not only in libraries, but also for a variety of other employment situations, thereby rendering them more \"marketable\" in the rapidly changing career ladder. In addition, it establishes feasible routes for lateral or vertical personnel movement. The bulk of this document is devoted to a review of the literature, in support of both instructional  technology programs, and broad-based vocational education frameworks. A core curriculum is provided, along with four supplementary curriculum options: reprographics, telecommunications, maintenance and repair, and a general comprehensive option. Selected course descriptions are appended, along with lists of institutions having similar programs. (NHM)",

        "description":"In order to measure the importance of financial assistance to part-time students and develop a profile of part-time students at Worthington Community College (WCC), a questionnaire was designed and mailed to each of the 255 persons who had enrolled at WCC as part-time students during the 1974-75 college year. Although the response rate was low (29.4 percent), certain persistent indications were noted: financial assistance is desired and needed by many part-time students; in many cases, finances are a key factor in a decision to terminate or delay the realization of educational goals. Most part-time students are married, and bear considerable familial responsibilities, adding to the financial burden of attending college. The greatest financial difficulty is realized by women  students, particularly married women students. When financial assistance is available, progress toward the realization of educational goals is enhanced--as evidenced by the average credit load carried. Since part-time students offer short-term, rather pragmatic reasons for attending college, the most effective dispersal of financial assistance may be in the form of many small grants, which should be sufficient to encourage students to meet short-term goals. Data are organized into charts and tables, and the survey instrument is appended. (Author/NHM)",

Students in the control group were chosen by the matched pair technique; scores of enrolled students were sifted for scores equal to those of students in the treatment group. Then, one score was randomly selected for each score in the treatment group. Using the records in the office of the registrar, transcripts of all subjects were examined and a variety of  data were collected. Students in the Foundation Program were found to have significantly greater persistence than those in the control group. Students in the treatment group who persisted for a set period of time had higher quality point averages (QPA's) than classmates not enrolled in the program. Whether a student volunteered for the program or was pressured to enroll, his level of persistence was likely to be about the same. A survey of the literature is included and a bibliography is appended. (NHM)",

        "description":"This study assesses the economic impact of the Metropolitan Community Colleges (MCC) on the four-county region of metropolitan Kansas City, Missouri. The total economic impact is composed of a network of interactive cash flows between the colleges, business, government, and individuals, and may be derived by adding three distinct components: direct expenditures, indirect expenditures, and tax income to the counties and schools. For 1974-75, direct expenditures totalled $14,294,490; indirect expenditures totalled $13,865,654; and tax income totalled $1,860,509. Thus, the total impact was $30,020,653, a 51 percent increase since 1971-72. While approximately 82.5 percent of MCC's 1974-75 expenditures were made within the four county area, only 44.3 percent of the funds were provided  by local sources. This means that nonlocal sources such as state and federal aid, and tuition paid by out-of-district students, accounted for the majority of the revenues of MCC, representing an increase in the area's economy of approximately five million dollars. Chapters of this document are devoted to examing MCC's impact on local business activity, jobs and income, capital expansion, local government, and human capital. Data are tabulated and graphed throughout the document, and guidelines for conducting similar studies are appended. (Author/NHM)",

The intent of the study was to provide decision makers with information that they would find useful in recruitment, curriculum and community service development, and evaluation of programs. Data are organized into two graphs and 26 tables, and break down information on enrollment classification, age, residence, demographic characteristics, income, and level of educational attainment by census tracts. The study determined that census tracts having the highest proportion of students generally had a white population, medium to high income, high education level,  and a younger growing population. The census tracts showing a low percentage of student enrollment had a high Spanish speaking population, low income, low educational level and an older population. The methodology described here is in sufficient detail to allow institutions to conduct similar studies, using this document as a model. Five recommendations dealing with recruitment strategy, curriculum development, facility planning, replication, and administrative policy are made based on the findings of this study. (Author/NHM)",

Of 20 schools surveyed, including almost all the Maryland community colleges, 15 offer remedial courses, 18 have remediation facilities, and 15 grant academic credit for remedial courses. All of the colleges have regular English composition courses (English 101), complemented by some sort of exemption plan. While remedial courses concentrate on sentence and rudimentary paragraph writing, English 101 is concerned with the application of standard grammatical English to thought processes involving various levels of inquiry. The case of Charles County Community College is cited as an example of successful articulation between the remedial and regular English  composition courses. In spite of course success in English 101, there has been a decline in the percentage of students choosing to take literature courses. The elimination of the English literature requirement has been partly responsible for this, but the extraordinary growth of technical writing courses, of which the number of sections has quadrupled over the past four years, has had even greater impact. A trend is seen toward English department alliance with the practical rather than the fine arts. (NHM)",

The questionnaire was returned by 1,299 veterans, a 29.9 percent rate of return. Of those responding, 469 veterans (36.1 percent) were discharged before June, 1966, and will lose their benefits in June, 1976. Of the 469 veterans losing benefits, 269 (57 percent) stated that they plan to enroll in fall, 1976, as compared to 496 (59 percent) of the 830 veterans with continuing benefits. Although the reported data indicates that veteran enrollment will not be greatly affected with regard to students already enrolled, the potential market of veterans will decrease. An estimated  drop of approximately 500 veterans in the fall of 1976, and an additional 400 drop in the spring of 1977 is projected. The main impact will be felt in work experience and television courses where, respectively, 82 percent and 68.5 percent of the enrolled students were veterans in the spring of 1975. However, the future enrollment of veterans will be sensitive to the job market and Congressional action with regard to benefits, and could change in different directions. The questionnaire is appended and responses are tabulated. (NHM)",

This study was conducted in order to determine whether or not Chabot should return to the semester system. Questionnaires distributed to students and faculty revealed that whereas 88 percent of the responding students favored the quarter system, 52 percent of the responding faculty members preferred the semester system. The students indicated that the quarter system is better because courses are more straightforward, Christmas recess is improved since courses have ended, there is opportunity to have a greater variety of courses and faculty exposure over a given period of time, greater chance to start over again if you must withdraw, more opportunity to change majors without great loss  of time, and a greater likelihood of finishing a course since the work does not stretch out so long. Faculty members looked on the quarter system with disfavor because it is too demanding on both faculty and students, and students need more time to learn. Following a brief review of selected research on the advantages and disadvantages of the quarter system, the author recommends that no action be taken to change the academic calendar at Chabot at this time. A short annotated bibliography of research studies is appended. (DC)",

The surveys investigate five areas: (1) student academic and demographic characteristics; (2) student goals or primary reasons for attending a community college; (3) student employment experiences; (4) student transfer experiences and performances at other postsecondary institutions; and (5) student perceptions of the community college environment and services. The first survey, conducted in 1974, covered students who  were first-time community college students in fall 1970; this, the second survey, was conducted in 1975 and covers students who were first-time community college students in fall 1971. The report discusses the findings and includes tables of data, comparing the results of the first and second surveys.

Ninety students in 10 sections were given three semester hours of academic credit upon successful completion of the course. Fifteen three-hour classes were conducted. The first 12 sessions were designed primarily to increase the students' self-awareness and self-understanding with a minimal focus on producing behavioral change. The last three classes were designed to help the student build a personal growth plan based on the self-awareness and self-understanding gained from the first 12 sessions. Each class session began with a stated objective, and students were provided with structured activities. Students were encouraged to express themselves freely and to provide  feedback to others. The Personal Orientation Inventory and a specially designed Perception of Problem-Solving and Decision-Making Scale were administered on the first night of class and again on the last night of class. Scores on inner direction, self-acceptance, self-regard, capacity for intimate contact, spontaneity, existentiality, acceptance of aggression, self-actualizing value energy, and time competency increased significantly.

All of the colleges included in the study had negotiated at the institutional level, and had negotiated a minimum of three contracts with a faculty union. Contract provisions related to faculty welfare were divided into seven categories: compensation; insurance; professional and public service leaves; personal leaves; staff development; working conditions; and other faculty welfare provisions. Contract provisions related to institutional decision-making  were divided into five categories: rights and responsibilities; workload; personnel policies; grievances; and institutional planning, research, and budgeting. Nine tables of data were examined to identify contractual trends or patterns of change. Findings support the conclusion that collective bargaining contracts are cumulative in nature. The duration of the contract periods tends to increase after negotiation of the initial contract, and the scope of the negotiations tends to broaden with additional contracts. (Author/NHM)",

The survey was conducted during the spring of 1975, and concentrated on the kinds of equipment and computer programming languages currently in use. Although the initial response was only 121 (21.23 percent), a second mailing resulted in a total of 208 completed questionnaires (47.03 percent). Eliminating educational installations, service bureau users, and terminal users, a total of 179 businesses, with 198 computers installed, were identified in the two state area. From the information gathered, it appears that a student graduating in computer  curriculum in the Minnesota/North Dakota area has a 58.6 percent chance of working on an IBM computer. There also is a 67 percent chance that the computer would be classed as a small computer. The student should, therefore, have a background in the RPG and COBOL languages. Should he not be working on an IBM computer, the COBOL language still equips him with a language used on most other computers. The only exception would be on an NCR computer, which has only 8 percent of the total market. (Author/NHM)",

The 454 usable responses (20 percent) were weighted to compensate for the sampling technique. Adding the 550 students who participated in a similar 1970 study, which provided baseline data, the weighted total of the four-year study population comes to 1,904 students. About half of the non-graduates who transferred enrolled at the University of Maryland. Nearly two-thirds of the transfer students changed majors in the process, with 59 percent of them losing some of  their credits. Over the four-year span, fewer non-graduates seemed to be continuing their education, and more of them were employed, mostly in health-related, secretarial, or computer-related occupations. About half of the students felt that their course work was related to their present jobs. Reasons for leaving Montgomery College were, for the most part, personal, with nearly one-fourth having some intention of returning. Attitudes toward the instruction received at the college were very favorable overall. Data are organized in 22 tables and 5 figures, and the questionnaire is appended. (Author/NHM)",

Twenty-four children from each of four grade levels (kindergarten, second, fourth, and seventh) were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Both experimenter and child had circles which were half white and half black. Under various conditions (1) child seated next to experimenter; (2) child seated at 90 degree angle to experimenter; and (3) child seated at 180 degree angle to experimenter) the children were asked to replicate the experimenter's placement of the circle on the basis of the experimenter's egocentric explanation of its  position. Finally, each child was given Flavell's (1968) storytelling task to assess general role-taking ability. Results demonstrated that listeners actively contribute to the success of the communication problem by compensating for inadequate messages; and that there is a progression in the development of this ability. Conclusions suggest types of listener compensation strategies and advise caution in attribution of listener competence to role-taking ability. (ED)",

        "description":"The purpose of this experiment was to examine lag function developmental parameters and to test a related developmental hypothesis and the predictions it generated. Fourth and eighth graders and adults were shown a series of words, one at a time, with some words presented twice. Between the two presentations of each repeated word there was one of three lag conditions: no lag (Lag O), short lag, or long lag. Items that were not repeated were labelled 1P words and used as a recall baseline. Subjects, tested individually, were given up to two minutes for written recall. Results showed highly significant lag effects for each age. Two predictions were supported: (1) that young children's recall would increase significantly between Lag O and short lag while older subjects' recall would  not, and (2) that the older subjects' recall would show a major increase between short and long lag words while younger children's would not. No significant differences between 1P and Lag O recall levels were evident at any grade, suggesting that the number of retrieval cues for Lag O and 1P terms is identical. It is proposed that the paradigm suggested in this study might be used to explore developmentally the encoding processes used for pictures, words and other stimuli in recognition and recall tasks, and to test Maccoby's proposal that children are not as efficient as adults in using information available in the task to aid performance. The paradigm is currently being used to study how motivational variables affect encoding strategies. (GO)",

A group of 20 5-year-olds was assigned to each condition; each group contained equal numbers of culturally disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged and middle-class children. Readiness scores and achievement test scores for children in both groups were obtained at the beginning and end of the kindergarten year. Subsequent first grade placement and reading level attainments at the end of first grade were recorded. Results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between full-day and half-day groups on any of these measures. When  achievement test scores of the culturally disadvantaged were analyzed alone, there was still no statistically significant gain in achievement by the full-day over the half-day, indicating that the full-day program did not provide any special academic benefit to culturally disadvantaged children. It is suggested that on the basis of these results, the establishment of full-day kindergarten cannot be recommended on the grounds that it would measurably improve children's achievement.

When the infants were 4-5 months old, a long-term program of intensified early language stimulation was implemented by weekly home tutoring sessions with the parents. The tutor stimulation program consisted of an adult-guided model of environmentally specific language activity framed in interpersonally sensitive modes of adult-child interactions. These modes consisted of five types of parent-child activities: routines of daily caregiving, sociodramatic play and sensory motor play, object exploration and manipulative play, periodic trips inside and outside the home, and looking at clear simple pictures in books. In all forms of activity the stress was  on alternating adult modeling with infant initative or responsive behavior, encouraged by adult responsiveness or suggestion. Two measurements were used: (1) periodic tests of cognitive development (including a language quotient), and (2) a system of daily record keeping by parents which included a developmental study of initial vocalization, comprehension, imitations and productions of words, phrases or sentences. Results indicate that the mean levels and rates of language development for the three infants greatly surpassed norms of development, the language acquisition indices developed in the same sequence for each child, and the stimulation program may be facilitating the development of other abilities in the child.

Subjects' mothers were interviewed at the hospital about their housing, marital, financial, health, employment, child care, and familial problems and about specific experiences of the mother and her child. Results indicated that accidents were characterized by high levels of stress due to recent mobility and change in household  composition. Cases of failure to thrive and child abuse shared high levels of maternal historical stress (i.e., frequent family mobility, a broken home, and a history of violence or neglect) and a lack of social support. As a group, families of children at risk for pediatric social illness appeared to have less than regular health care, had experienced many recent moves, had many child rearing problems, a history of a broken family in the mother's childhood, and mother-initiated separations from the child.

Results support two of these hypotheses and the theoretical analysis of the relation between time estimation and discrimination learning. It was concluded that the rate at which a discrimination is learned is a function of the amount of excitatory predominance as measured by the time estimation task, and that a fundamental process which occurs during discrimination learning is the rate at which excitatory processes come to be conditioned to a predominance over inhibitory processes.

        "description":"This report examines the relationship between maternal medication during labor and mother-infant interaction on the third day of life. Subjects were 45 black low-income mothers and their healthy full-term infants. The mothers' perinatal drug history was obtained, and a coded observational schedule was used to record maternal and infant behaviors during two 30-minute sessions on the third day after birth. Results indicated that infants who had been exposed to higher drug levels were more passive and required more responsive effort from their mothers than infants who had been exposed to lower drug levels. The behavior of the more drug exposed infants was more erratic and less continuous, and maternal behavior reflected this by occasional reduction in responsive effort. It is  suggested that even relatively low amounts of maternal medication can affect early mother-infant interaction. (GO)",

The concept of Chomsky's generative grammar is explained briefly and the linguistic approaches of Piaget, Vygotsky and Whorf are compared with regard to the relations between cognitive structures and inner linguistic structures. An enigmatic discussion of language acquisition is presented in order to suggest the scope of issues involved when studying linguistics. The sociological aspects of language are touched upon briefly. Three early childhood programs --New Nursery, Yonemura, and Talk Reform--are compared in terms of goals, teacher role, interactional patterns, level of preorganization, types of activities used, and evaluation methods. It is concluded that teachers need to be aware of current theories of  language development and linguistic research and that they need to be able to listen diagnostically to each child's language.

An additional aim of the program was to upgrade the quality of the training programs in psychiatry and teacher education. College students in a teacher education sequence did the tutoring under joint supervision of clinic staff, classroom teachers, and college faculty. In about half the cases, tutors worked with the child exclusively at his school, for 2 and 3 one-hour sessions a week; other tutors worked with the child in school and at home. Lectures on child development and small group clinical supervision  sessions supplemented the tutors' training. Program strengths and weaknesses are reviewed. (BRT)",

In the original study, 12 infants, ages 7-13 months, were observed to obtain a measure of the frequency with which the infant was held by the mother and others, latency of response to the infant's crying, and the number of times the mother was inferred to have caused the crying. Followup data were obtained on 8 to 11 of the children at 5 years of age. Children's ability on three standardized tasks (perseverance on a puzzle, an embedded figures test, and a name-learning task) as well as in complex tasks and participation in household chores was evaluated. Study findings appeared to confirm that certain early care variables affect later performance of  children. Difficulties in the interpretation of study findings are discussed. (BRT)",

The subjects were four pairs of male twins, four pairs of female twins, four pairs of opposite sex twins, and 24 singletons, 32-33 months of age. Samples of each child's spontaneous utterances were obtained on a two-hour tape recording made in the home setting and an accompanying shorthand record of ongoing action. At the same time measures of articulation and vocabulary comprehension were obtained, a Sentence Initiation Task was administered, and a parent interview form was completed. Birth information was obtained through hospital records. Significant differences between the two groups were found on the language measures,  with the twins scoring lower. Rate measures (overall rate of utterance and rate of utterance to mother) were the major source of difference. No significant group differences were found on the phrase-complexity measure. Twin-singleton differences were found on all of the biological measures. It was concluded that the language development of twins may be handicapped by a biological factor of paranatal or prenatal stress and by too much sibling interaction and too little adult interaction in the acquisition of the basic semantic ideas required in advance of expression.

Analysis of the data is intended to show: (1) the extent to which intervention programs encourage families to change their life styles, (2) the relationship of the mother's personality and self-concept to her overall conception of life in her own family, and (3) the reciprocal relationship already existing between the mother and her 18-24 month-old child before any intervention. There were approximately 40 family participants from each of three housing projects varying greatly in structural  arrangements. Two different parent programs, modeled after those of Levenstein and Badger, were used in each housing project. A third group of children at each site served as controls. (BRT)",

In the initial study, 160 children from preschool through grade 2 received six matrix subtasks (reproduction and transposition subtasks of cross classification, classification seriation, and double seriation) in one of six orders of presentation (the reproduction subtask always preceded the transposition case for a given matrix). The second experiment followed much the same design as the first, except that the class/series matrix was not used and stimuli for one cross class task were rearranged so that neither dimension was seriated across  rows or columns of the matrix. Results, conclusions, and methodological problems of each experiment are discussed in detail.

Researchers agreed that there is a developmental shift in infant behavior at 7 to 9 months of age when the infant becomes more cautious in approaching strangers. However, investigators hypothesize that the presence of the mother, the mother-child relationship, or the context in which the child-stranger interactions occur may affect the strength and quality of that interaction in differing ways. Symposium discussants suggest that infant fear of strangers may not be as prevalent or as unidimensional as once supposed. Suggestions are made for more precise research methods, observational techniques, and behavioral scoring. (BRT)",

An extensive review of the literature on ability grouping, self concept (and self concept tests), and school attitudes related to grouping is presented. In the study, low achievers were defined as students whose grade point fell between 1.6 and 2.6 on the overall reading test scores of the Metropolitan Achievement Test given at the beginning of the school year. Thirty children from each ability group type were given the \"Self Appraisal Inventory\" to measure their self concepts and the \"School Sentiment Index\" to measure their school attitudes. (The texts of these \"yes-no\" answer questionnaires are provided in the  appendix.) Results indicated that ability grouping alone may not necessarily promote a more positive self concept for low achievers. However, homogeneous grouping appears to have a positive influence on the child's attitude toward school. It is predicted that, in a multiple group correlation, the self concept and school attitude of a child will be positively related. (Authors/ED)",

Using Rumelhart's (1974) schema for analyzing stories in terms of a network of information categories and the logical relationships which exist between these categories, a story was constructed which contained 23 informational units. The story was read to 15 first graders and 15 third graders, with recall required after 20 seconds and again after a delay of one week. The data were analyzed in two different ways: (1) analyses pertaining to both the total number of categories accurately recalled by  subjects and to a comparison of the categories recalled in the story; and (2) analyses pertaining to elaborations on the original story both as transformations of the original categories and as additions of new information. Results of these analyses are outlined and it is concluded that Rumelhart's schema appears to have value in directing further research in the comprehension of story material. (ED)",

This project was the third in a series of longitudinal studies using the same population. In all three studies, the essential ingredient was weekly visits by trained paraprofessional parent educators (drawn from the community) who provided the parent with ideas and activities which could be used at home. The HLC program continued intervention through the child's third year (adding a weekly group play session)  and collected data on the effects of this type of intervention on children and parents three years after termination of intervention. A total of 204 experimental and control families participated in this final phase. At age 6, all children were measured by the Stanford-Binet, Caldwell Preschool Inventory, and Task Oriented Behavior Scale. Mothers' attitudes and behavior were measured by their responses on two interviews schedules. Results are given; and discussions on the long-time effects of intervention and the efficacy of the HLC model are presented. (ED)",

Exploratory behavior as an emotional state was rejected because the environmental conditions said to arouse exploration and the behaviors said to manifest curiosity are too general to separate from other kinds of interactions. The drive theory was discarded for two reasons: (1) physiochemical change as the distinction between exploratory and non-exploratory behavior has not yet been clearly demonstrated and (2) the collative stimulus approach, in which the comparison of stimuli is said to arouse curiosity and thus lead to specific exploratory behavior, has not facilitated research. Behavior analysts contend simiply that  exploratory behavior generates repertories that facilitate the development of complex cognitive behavior and is the sort of behavior that is established and maintained by nonappetitive reinforcers.

Age differences were generally confined to the color set. The judgments of the older children were more internally consistent, and more similar to the other children in their age group than were the younger children. The frequency of good-fitting Scaling Solutions was also higher for the older children. The processing of color in a relational manner thus seems to develop more slowly than relational processing of size or shape. Implications of these results are discussed. Forty white kindergarten children also did all  three tasks. Results for these children indicated the same sequence of difficulty, although these children were less consistent and sophisticated than the Chinese children. (Author/ED)",

Group B infants were placed in the same type of hammock but were free to remain still or initiate motion themselves by any slight bodily movement. Group C infants were placed in a stationary hammock to control for variables such as extra handling and the fetal position assumed when in the hammock. Group D was the control group in which the infants received  traditional nursing care. The findings indicated that the infants in Group A had higher pH levels and greater linear growth than the infants in any of the other groups and that the Group B infants showed the greatest weight gain.

        "description":"A scheme of classification is suggested for physicians faced with various prescriptions for remediation of children with learning disabilities. Three models of the causes of learning disability are suggested: (1) the difference model which stresses normal variability in the pattern of development of mental abilities; (2) the deficit model which assumes a limited malfunction of the brain; and (3) the delay model which suggests transitory immaturity or lag in development as the cause for learning disability. Process-oriented and goal-oriented strategies of management are delineated. Remedial methods are classified according to their implicit model of etiology and their adherence to the process- or goal-oriented approach. An atheoretical, goal-oriented approach which works with the  existing pattern of the child's abilities and seeks to tailor individualized instruction to the specific gap in academic understanding and knowledge is advocated.

The research strategies employed in these studies included observations in specified programs (in-class or by video-tape), tightly-controlled classroom experimentation combined with observations and observations under uncontrolled and naturally varying classroom conditions. Research concentrated on the examination of four areas: (1) the relationship between prescribed treatments and classroom behavior; (2) the relationship between teacher behavior and children's classroom behavior; (3) the relationship between teacher behavior and relatively permanent characteristics of children; and (4) the relationship  between children's classroom behavior and relatively permanent characteristics of children. Results of the studies of disadvantaged children indicate that didactic small-group instruction, regardless of which mode was used, was associated with restriction of the range of child behaviors.

The advisor has a variety of duties in her role as a non-partisan, non-threatening aide to participating teachers, in which she must develop a relationship with teachers which encourages their learning and development within the open corridor model. In this capacity, the advisor: (1) assists with planning, scheduling, and room arrangement; (2) leads weekly discussion groups with teachers on curriculum, organization, and children; (3)  helps teachers observe and evaluate individual children; (4) maintains a liaison between teachers and the administrative staff, and between specialists and teachers; and (5) interprets the program to parents and suggests ways in which parents can participate.

The sample consisted of 60 children, 20 in each of three age groups: 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8 years of age. The children were trained to move one hand from a home base to each of three target positions. The positions were learned solely through motoric experience since the children could not see the targets. Once they had learned to find these three positions, the children were tested on their ability to move one hand directly from one target to another without going back to the home base. Each child's accuracy was recorded on a large sheet of paper ( map ) placed beneath the targets. Measures used in the analyses were the absolute accuracy for each position  judgment in training and testing, relative accuracy for each test judgment, and angles formed by lines connecting test judgments. Results indicated a significant improvement in accuracy with age on all four measures, although some 3-year-olds were quite proficient in constructing maps on the experimental space. It is suggested that the induction of spatial relations may be a general characteristic of spatial behavior. (Author/ED)",

The ERE can be programmed in a variety of ways (to talk , play games, read aloud, show pictures and take dictation). The program developed for this study had four phases: (1) child learned alphabet; (2) child learned that letters form words; (3) child learned to read what he or machine typed; and (4) child developed personal stories using his own voice and drawings (for slides). Data collected between 1967 and 1972, on deprived and non-deprived preschoolers, exposed or not exposed to ERE, indicated the effectiveness of this technological approach to the development of prereading skills, considered basic  to continued success in school. Statistics based on the concept of the economic dollar value of potential lifetime earnings (which fluctuate according to the level of schooling completed by an individual) indicated that the potential use of ERE technology as a preschool remedial technique for disadvantaged children is economically significant, even when the costs of purchasing and using ERE equipment are considered in the analysis.

        "description":"In response to the Presidential/Secretarial Educational Objective of 1975 which called for a statement from American Indian communities relative to their educational management preferences, the Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP) established a program for gathering and disseminating educational management options to Indian people. A seven program series was developed by OIEP which included the following: (1) Introduction to the Series: Management Decisions in Indian Education; (2) Selecting Educational Goals and Assessing Educational Needs; (3) The Federal School; (4) The Public School; (5) The Tribal-Private School; (6) The Combination School; and (7) Another Look: It's Your Move (a review of all options). While 78 schools participated in the FY 1975 project, there has  been a reluctance to officially determine community preferences as some people see the right to no decision as inherent in the definition of self-determination. Other Indian people are simply generally suspicious of any government program, believing the only real option to be that of the contract school which is perceived as just another avenue toward termination. Employing a more gradual approach to the transition period and allowing for an Indian definition of self-determination, the OIEP has extended the Objective through FY 1976 and has added 30 more schools to the project.

        "description":"Since small school problems are magnified in rural areas and since small rural schools have suffered, consequently, from the consolidation syndrome, it is important to acknowledge the fact that due to geographical limitations some rural areas cannot consolidate and others simply prefer the small school environment. It should also be recognized that there are both strengths and weaknesses inherent in the small rural school. Weaknesses attributable to small rural schools include: (1) poor organizational structures; (2) difficulties in the recruitment and retention of quality personnel; (3) inadequate facilities; (4) curriculum deficiences; (5) inadequate financial support. Strengths attributable to the small rural school include: (1) an homogeneous sociocultural background; (2) the  potential for close-knit educational organization; (3) close student/teacher relationships; (4) community involvement; and (5) a classroom environment conducive to innovative techniques. While the problems of finance must be met at the local, State, and Federal levels, solutions to many of the problems of the small rural school can probably best be found by coupling inherent strengths with innovative educational practices which encompass use of: the intermediate unit; the shared services concept; media and technology; mobile units; and in-service programs.

Findings indicated that rural chiropractors were: (1) from white collar families with entrepreneural tendencies; (2) pursuing this field out of a need to fulfill an entrepreneural imperative, rather than a specific career calling; (3) practicing in areas comparable to their place of origin; and  (4) trained in or adjacent to their state of origin. It was concluded that the concepts of localism and client control influenced this marginal profession, as competition with and isolation from colleagues renders the practitioner vulnerable to client control while localism furthers community acceptance. It was argued, therefore, that localism and client control were interrelated influences on the chiropractor practice. (JC)",

Among services available to migrant children are tutorial instruction, summer schools, regular school supplemental programs, health education, bilingual education, career experiences for adolescents, and early childhood development programs. These educational programs are linked to the work of other state agencies which provide services to migrant children. During fiscal year 1973-74, emphasis was on identifying  eligible children and on providing them priority educational programs. First priorities in meeting their educational needs were those of reading, mathematics, and bilingual education. Tutorial outreach programs, designed to meet the needs of small numbers of children scattered throughout many school districts, were expanded in order to involve identified migrant children in priority programs. Other activities during the year included a census project, career experiences, use of the Migrant Student Record Transfer System, in-service education, parental involvement, and interstate cooperation.

Analyzing the theoretical and empirical aspects of growth center strategy, Chapter 3 discusses efforts to bring jobs to nonmetropolitan areas via regional development policies. Since problems of creating grater access to economic opportunity are closely bound up with the spatial organization of labor markets, the  rationales behind various delineations of functional economic areas are analyzed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 assesses the roles of substate regional planning and the A-95 review process in coordinating Federal, State, and local policies and programs in nonmetropolitan areas. Chapter 6 discusses the implications of the Comprehensive Employment Training Act of 1973 (CETA). Analyzing the differences in commuting patterns and welfare indicators, Chapters 7 and 8 examine transportation problems.

In both 1947 and 1971 the subjects were asked to respond to an identical series of 12 Likert-type attitude items designed to measure acceptance of selected aspects of traditional morality. While each of the items focused on some aspect of traditional behavior, 5 items referred to young people or youth activities (loafing uptown, staying out late, failure in school, spending money, and using makeup). The remaining 7 items referred to adult or ageless behavior (irregular church attendance, divorce, drinking,  smoking, card playing, Sunday movies, and Sabbath labor). Findings indicated that: (1) in general, responses were more permissive with maturation, though there was less liberalization of attitudes toward the behavior of youth; (2) not all subjects became liberal with age; therefore, experience, rather than age per se, was the more probable explanation for attitude change; (3) of 9 social characteristics expected to influence change, the 1 most consistently associated with lack of attitude change was frequency of church attendance, though there was some positive relationship to place of residence, educational and income levels, and sex.

        "description":"Utilizing unpublished data derived from the Roosevelt Commission on Country Life (1908), national summary reports of a 12-item questionnaire were examined and compared with the commission's published report. For purposes of analysis, the 12 questions were grouped as: (1) economic concerns, (2) farm labor, (3) services, (4) quality of life, and (5) organization for change and social purposes. Responses were tabulated by region (North Central, North Atlantic, Western, South Atlantic, and South Central) and by occupation (farmers, farmer's wives, post office employees, bankers and real estate dealers, etc.). Tabulation of responses revealed that the majority were unqualifiedly dissatisfied with (1) organization for improvement and social purposes, (2) organization to promote buying  and selling, (3) supply of farm labor, and (4) educational training for farm life. The majority were unqualifiedly satisfied with conditions of: (1) farm homes, (2) farm labor, (3) sanitation, (4) communication, and (5) credit. Occupational and regional differences were evident, as teachers proved critical of farm life and the southern regions reflected a comparative disadvantage. While five claims made by the commission were supported, it was found that some of the commission's most important conclusions did not parallel the questionnaire and were not supported by the tabulated data.

Examination was made of the Federal and State programs adopted or sought between 1960 and 1974 and of the factors relative to the differential use of Federal programs. Units of analysis included community, village government,  school district, and individual. Data were obtained via personal interviews with key selected informants in each community and were supplemented by information derived from official Federal and State agency records and from interviews with county-level informants. While all centers were classified &quot;rural&quot; in 1920, 10 remained &quot;rural&quot; by census definition in 1974. The data indicated that growth and decline, stability and change, depended on the individual community, the time period, and community characteristics. While stability and growth were prevalent over decline, vitality was greatest in the noneconomic areas and differentiation had increased. (JC)",

Evaluation revealed a need for: (1) better promotional efforts (up-to-date promotional material; closer working arrangements among Federal, Tribal, and business representatives; and aggressive program administration) and (2) a single agency to direct and coordinate Indian economic development. GAO recommended that the Office of Management and Budget provide for an organizational framework clarifying Federal Indian economic development program and coordination responsibilities and work with heads of departments and  agencies to develop: (1) improved procedures for project evaluation and monitoring (detailed guidelines, critical evaluation by the funding agency, clear documentation of the basis for financing, a monitoring plan, and a followup procedure) and (2) a systematic broad-scale promotional program. GAO also recommended that the Commissioner of Indian Affairs identify solutions to problems of excessive Indian labor turnover. Five Federal agencies generally agreed with GAO conclusions and, except for the Department of the Interior, supported GAO's recommendations. (JC)",

The criteria employed in model development were: (1) Can flexibility be considered a feature?; (2) Can a staff of 12 or 13 teachers readily adapt to the concept?; (3) Is the cost reasonable for a small-school budget?; (4) Is there an authority in the field who considers the identified concept valid?; (5) Would this concept facilitate community instructional goals? Utilizing a format involving inventory of need, statement of need, performance objective, and implementation, the model was designed around the  following stated student goals: (1) to develop a desire for learning now and in the future; (2) to develop skills in math, reading, writing, speaking, and listening; (3) to develop pride in work and a feeling of self-worth; (4) to develop character and self-respect; (5) to learn to get along with people with whom you work and live; (6) to learn how to respect and get along with people who think, dress, and act differently; (7) to learn how to examine and use information.

Seventy-five hucksters were observed at work in three states of Mexico (Oaxaca, Michoacan, and Mexico) and in the Federal District (Mexico City area). Twenty-five sales pitches were recorded and 100 (31 males and 69 females) clients were interviewed. Clients were members of the lower stratum of the Mexican social structure, characterized by low income, poor housing, and little education. Of the 100 respondents, 54 were over 45 years of age, 51 lived in rural areas, 49 resided in small towns, and 87 had resided in the same location for 11 years or more. Names and addresses of clients were obtained by promising to deliver free  samples of medicine to the homes of people who made a purchase. Some findings were: although all the medicines bought by clients interviewed were medicinally worthless (as verified by hucksters themselves), 78 of the respondents reported that the medicines had been effective (11 believed them to be ineffective and 11 were undecided); 87 expressed confidence in the hucksters--57 because they told the truth, 6 because hucksters explained well, and 7 because the medicines were not expensive; and all gave the medicine huckster the highest composite ranking of 10 potential sources of health information.

After securing a 100 percent response, questionnaires were sorted and analyzed by age, education, and administrative region. Eight expected findings were analyzed and compared with the responses. Findings indicated: (1) extension professionals served as the main teaching agent; (2) there was little difference in the number of persons in the 35 and younger and 36 and older age groupings; (3) time for preparation and time for working with the clubs were the  most frequently cited reasons for not participating in Consumerama; (4) there was strong interest in attending Consumerama workshops and consumer education workshops; (5) extension staff members felt consumer education was important and were willing to teach it in some form in their county 4-H programs; and (6) time was a strong limitation in the development of many county Consumerama programs. Since only five counties used lay leaders and since time was the most limiting factor, it was suggested that lay leaders and intensive educational workshops be employed to meet Consumerama needs.

        "description":"Examining 1,815 Pennsylvania rural boroughs and townships, seven variables were employed to determine the places where net migration had been outward 1940-60 and inward 1960-70 and where it had been inward 1960-70 and outward 1960-70. The demographic variables employed were: (1) total population of each selected nonmetropolitan area, (2) absolute changes in the size of the college or military population, (3) percentage of residents 15-24 years old, and (4) population per square mile. The ecological variables employed were: (1) highway accessibility, (2) functional differentiation in industry types, and (3) population potential. Local officials were surveyed via mail to determine if they agreed with the turnaround migration hypothesis (55 percent response). Findings indicated that  most nonmetropolitan minor civil divisions had experienced out-migration between 1940 and 1970, though 10 percent had experienced net in-migration, and nearly 18 percent were termed net migration turnaround areas (three times as many of these places turned around to net in-migration between 1960 and 1970 than places which turned around to net out-migration). It was also found that on the average both types of migration turnaround had occurred about 20-25 miles from an urban center; that reductions in farming, industry, and military installations were evident in places having out-migration turnaround; and that not in-migration turnaround; and that net in-migration turnaround areas had residents employed in relatively specialized industries.

The Kansas State Department of Education has responded to the educational needs of migrant children by (1) establishing goals and objectives for instructional and supportive services; (2) acquiring increasing amounts of Title I, Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) funds; and (3) increasing the number of programs in the State. In 1972, $518,951 was allocated for migrant programs, $594,216 in 1973, and $694,474 in 1974. The number of programs was increased from 11 in 1972 to 13 in 1974. These programs reported increases in the cognitive and affective development of children and an increase in the number of children served. Increases were also reported in  the number of bilingual teachers used and the quality of training provided all personnel. This report summarizes data obtained from the final reports submitted by the agencies operating Title I, ESEA migrant education programs in 1972, 1973, and 1974. Some topics covered are: number of participants by age, grade, and length of time in the program; grade placement; innovative projects used; objective measurement; teacher-developed tests; interrelationship with regular Title I programs and other programs; staff utilization and inservice training; community involvement; and instruction.

During that time, one teacher was hired full time through the Title I Migrant Program. For the next 2 years, the teacher tutored at the labor camp with the help of a teacher's aide. Due to the increase in student enrollment, more teachers were added to the staff in 1973. The project was also moved from the camp to Mesa Elementary School. At present, there are over 50 migrant students, 6 teachers, and 1 teacher's aide involved in the program. Project goals are to: (1) recruit secondary migrant students who have been attending high school in Texas,  California, and/or other states; (2) enroll these students in the Mesa Night School; (3) obtain the students' previous high school schedules and develop corresponding schedules to continue their education; and (4) transfer the students' completed credits back to their original high schools on official North Franklin School District High School transcripts.

The recruitment team works closely with both the school and the migrant family--cooperating with local educational agencies and providing medical, legal, and social service information to the family in need.

This shared migrant student information frees a school to focus its energy on serving a child's needs instead of using it to identify those needs. If the MSRTS is to be of maximum benefit to migrant students and educators alike, the student data it gathers and disseminates must be current, accurate, complete, and promptly transmitted. Thus, the system's success depends on the effectiveness of each link in the data chain--the school, the terminal, and the data bank. This handbook is a guide for MSRTS personnel. It is intended to increase awareness of the migrant student and his need for a transfer  record, and to outline the responsibility of each person employed in the system toward fulfilling that need. School districts served by the Sunnyside and Othello terminals in Washington are listed. (Author/NQ)",

The socioeconomic careers model is utilized as a heuristic device along with suggestions for its modification to make it more useful in the case of the physician. The specific classes of variables employed by Duncan and Blau are described in detail (background, intervening, career contingencies, and outcome variables). Certain of the specific aspects of the physicians' socioeconomic career are discussed. Differences between the generalized model and that found useful  for the physician are pointed out (emphasis is on the use of many, rather than a few, variables). Consideration is given to discussion of path analysis as a type of multivariate analysis. The technique is then applied conceptually to the case of the physician's socioeconomic career. Specific variables are considered along with the conceptual difficulties they may present. Characteristics of actual recruits to medical careers are enumerated as indicative of how the model must be modified to be useful. (JC)",

Papua New Guinean students may have difficulty in science because the basic assumption that the world is regular, which is so striking in Western man's environment, is less easy to make for someone from a natural environment. To test the hypothesis that students from a traditional environment show a lower expectation of regularity, a series of principal situations from each of which a pattern of events emerged were set up. The five situations or tests are explained in detail. The regularity tests were carried out using primary school children  from three distinct populations: (1) coastal children who were familiar with an urban environment, (2) highlands children from a remote area, and (3) Australian children who were born and raised in a Western environment. The results indicated there were no significant overall differences between the three groups. (LS)",

        "description":"Students in Papua New Guinea experience considerable difficulty in dealing with much of their work--especially in science and mathematics. The ability to achieve some acknowledged level of excellence is dependent upon cognitive factors. During 1972 a series of pilot studies were carried out in various secondary and tertiary institutions to investigate students' basic difficulties and to develop a set of testing procedures. These studies formed a basis for an investigation in 1973. A battery of &quot;logic/quantitative&quot; tests was administered to seven groups of high school and college students. The tests are described and analyzed in detail. A series of interviews were conducted with a substantial sub-sample of the groups that had taken the tests. A full analysis of the results has not  yet been carried out. One of the broad findings of the study has been that students in general perform a good deal better (given essentially the same task) in some contexts than in others. It is as important to build upon students' strengths as it is to take steps to remedy weaknesses. Individual students seem to have a preference for a particular context. A project planned for 1974 will investigate the extent to which students have &quot;preferred modes&quot; of information intake and consider the feasibility of presenting materials in alternative forms.

        "description":"This investigation encompassed the implementation and evaluation of Rotating Peer Supervision in a college level science teaching methods course. Rotating Peer Supervision is defined as a process whereby students teach other students and themselves about teaching through observation, analysis and evaluation of their own teaching, as well as that of their colleagues. It employed an adaptation of the clinical supervision sequence with videotaping of teaching presentations. The subjects were 74 college juniors with an elementary education major enrolled in three randomly selected sections of a teaching methods course. Two experimental sections followed the syllabus for the course and used Rotating Peer Supervision along with their 15-minute teaching presentations in class. Students  in the control section followed the syllabus but did not use Rotating Peer Supervision. Two instruments were administered at the outset and conclusion of the course to measure the personality traits in question. The results showed: (1) no significant difference on the inner-direction construct of the two groups, and (2) a positive difference on the internal control construct of the two groups (indicating that the students involved in peer supervision became more internally controlled).

The following null hypothesis was formulated: no significant difference exists in the number of student selected objectives achieved between the mastery and non-mastery treatment groups. Each group consisted of 20 secondary school physics students. Criterion-referenced tests were administered to each student to determine if the selected objectives had been achieved. If a student in the mastery treatment group failed to reach the proficiency level of an objective, a related activity was substituted and assessed before going on to unit two. A student in the  non-mastery treatment group was not permitted to undergo remediation and reassessment but proceeded to unit two. Analysis revealed that students of both treatments selected objectives with the same proficiency levels but different cognitive levels. (LS)",

        "description":"Along with the history and objectives of the Survey of Graduate Science Student Support and Postdoctorals (SGSSSP), the general trend for federal support for scientific research is presented. The first formal program designed specifically to support graduate students began in 1952. At its peak, in 1968, more than 50,000 graduate students received federal support. Presently, the trend for federal support has been away from fellowships, traineeships, and training grants, and toward increased support of research assistantships. Relating to the SGSSSP, the author notes that the Survey provides the only statistical time series of the sources of support of graduate students. The Survey distinguishes between types and sources of financial support, whether private or public. The SGSSSP  dates back to 1967 and has had increased coverage of clinical and medical sciences since 1973. Starting in the fall of 1974, a quick response component was added which enabled limited data to be available by January 1975. Also presented are analytical uses of Survey data. (Author/CP)",

The planning that went into the symposium will become clear to the reader of these four papers, which are quite different in style and content but united by their central concern with the past and future of NSF. Detlev W. Bronk draws on the rich lode of his memory as he describes the Foundation's origins and aspirations. William A. Fowler describes by examples how the Foundation's investment in research has changed our understanding of Planet Earth, the gene, and the universe and is aiding the transfer of knowledge to an attack on environmental and social problems. Joseph B. Platt assays  NSF's education programs in the light of recommendations in Dr. Vannevar Bush's report. Finally , H. Guyford Stever reflects on the directions that the Foundation may take in the years that lie ahead, during a time of growing awareness among scientists that they are also citizens and that their research often affects and is affected by individual and social values.

The report is based upon data from two types of questionnaires. One questionnaire surveyed the need for metric workshops. The second questionnaire surveyed the present knowledge of the metric system. Both questionnaires were administered to a random sample of elementary, junior high, and high school teachers in Nevada and to elementary and secondary mathematics method students at the University of Nevada, Reno. The paper contains eight tables comparing the data from these two questionnaires. Each table is followed by separate conclusions. In general, it is concluded that there is a need for metric workshops for  elementary teachers of Nevada and that more amphasis should be incorporated into elementary mathematics methods courses. Furthermore, it is recommended that a relevant comprehensive questionnaire be prepared and administered to secondary mathematics and science teachers in order to verify the need for further metric education.

A panel of environmentalists and educators identified best responses for the knowledge items, and a common reference point, preservation of homo sapiens, for the belief items, so a composite attitude measure was obtainable. SMOG grading was employed to insure grade 10 readability. A total of 30 students, in 174 schools in 6 Australian states, comprised the sample population. On 10 of 20 items, 50 percent or more students selected the best alternative, with greatest knowledge in the area of population. Misunderstandings occurred in resource use, pollution, and radiation. In 6 of 9 belief items, 50 percent or more agreed  with preservation of homo sapiens, supporting statements about individual rights. Catholic schools were less in favor of family planning; females supported this issue. Metropolitan students were more aware of pollution, and residential students of traffic accidents. A .28 correlation existed between knowledge and belief items--significant, considering sample size. Australian students appeared as knowledgeable as their American counterparts, but deficiencies and misunderstandings are evident. (BP)",

        "description":"The four studies reported in this document deal with aspects of assessing students' performance on computational skills. The first study grew out of a need for an instrument to measure students' speed at recalling addition facts. This had seemed to be a very easy task, but it proved to be much more difficult than anticipated. The second study grew out of a need to develop a test of addition and subtraction which was both machine scorable and not multiple choice. The study reported here compares a new response format to two other response formats. The third study deals with the question of item ordering on tests. The study concerns tests with items ordered from easiest to hardest, hardest to easiest, and randomly, and how item ordering interacts with student anxiety levels. The  fourth study deals with three remedial methods of instruction for students at the second-grade level who were unable to perform two-digit addition with regrouping. One method used the mini-calculator as an aid, the second used a partial sums approach, and the third the traditional regrouping method. (Author/SD)",

As a result of research studies using the checklist, the test authors had developed 24 separate scales containing groups of related objectives. The scale purported to measure such personality traits as self confidence, personal adjustment, self control and dominance. Teacher responses on eleven scales were high enough  to satisfy chi-square levels of significance of .01. In order of decreasing values, these were/ achievement, endurance, order, intraception, dominance, nurturance, defensiveness, personal adjustment, favorable, self confidence, and self control.

It was developed to study the relationship of science attitudes of preservice elementary teachers to subsequent performance in science teaching. During their student teaching period, 38 preservice elementary teachers were observed twice using the IOCSB. Two college teachers, experienced in elementary school science education, encoded teacher behavior as well as pupil behavior. The IOCSB is a six category instrument containing 33 sub-categories that are behaviorally defined and contain examples of what is intended by each behavior. This paper lists the behavioral categories, definitions, and examples used in the  instrument. Behavioral item selection was based on several sources. The relevance of each behavior was rated by judges with categories 1-5 judged relevant and category 6 judged irrelevant. Reliability was estimated by obtaining measures of interobserver agreement between the investigator and the observers; an average of 76 percent was reached. The frequencies of relevant behaviors are compared to those of irrelevant behaviors for both teacher behaviors and student behaviors. Data analysis suggests the instrument be used in the areas of science curriculum development and evaluation in the elementary school and in associated research. (LS)",

The experience and advice of several superintendents, principals, librarians, teachers, and curriculum workers who have recently been involved in textbook censorship controversies are brought together. Their opinions and suggestions are offered to focus attention on community and school circumstances before a problem develops. The key to avoiding major disputes is the establishment and use of a formal, definitive, written procedure for the evaluation and selection of materials. A sample procedure policy is provided which emphasizes comprehensive objectives, direct board responsibility, strong  curriculum-based selection criteria, high level professional review procedures, an advisory committee appointed by the board or superintendent that includes students and parents, and a specific outline of policy and action on challenged materials. Should a complaint arise, suggestions for dealing with it include moving the controversy to the school board level in order to avoid any parent-teacher-principal conflict, and defending the professional selection process rather than the individual piece of instructional material.

The high school used in this study was one of four high schools within a large school district located in the northwest corner of Cook County, Illinois. The research study consisted of nonparticipant behavior observations and administration of statistical instruments. The questionnaires consisted of identifying information (the independent variables) and posing questions about conflict, conflict situations, and conflict-solving mechanisms (the dependent variables). The major conclusions drawn from both the behavior observation and the questionnaires were that conflict was caused by four  distinctive types of behavior: cutting classes, using drugs, smoking cigarettes, and drinking alcoholic beverages. Teachers and parents accepted the authoritarian role given them. However, it was found that some parents would not use this role in certain situations, yet they expected the school to enforce the rules against these behaviors and sought stringent rules against them. The author suggests that efforts to understand and deal with conflict must take place when teachers are preparing for their new roles. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"In the wake of Watergate, this paper purports the need for a new approach to teaching about the American presidency. Traditionally, American government textbooks focus on institutional descriptions and constitutional arrangements of the presidency. This textbook approach to the presidency describes and values a chief executive who is generally benevolent, omnipotent, omniscient, and highly moral. The formal aspect is emphasized to the exclusion of any discussion about behavioral and policy aspects of the office. Recent research in student attitudes towards the presidency after Watergate indicates a significant loss of trust and affect in the president's honesty, trustworthiness, dedication to job, and responsiveness to people. What is needed now is for teachers and curricula  developers to reconsider the president in four basic conceptual ways: (1) as an institution in the context of a more dynamic and conflict ridden political system than has been suggested thus far; (2) as a role of some historical and symbolic importance to our political culture; (3) as a unique personality occupying the role at any given time; and (4) as a political actor who has specific strengths and weaknesses in his role performance and who has successes and failures in his policy efforts.

Three hundred and one teachers of fifth, sixth, and seventh grades responded to the questionnaire. The study revealed minimal academic preparation in political science, with the overwhelming majority of the teachers reporting American government as the single course in their college education. A full 20 percent of the teachers reported that they had no undergraduate training in political science. As means of improving their professional competencies, the majority of teachers expressed a definite preference for more practical, on-the-job  improvement programs as opposed to graduate and summer studies. The teachers indicated that they most desired brief, flexible curriculum materials that deal with political aspects of current social issues. Few called for the usual hardback social studies textbook. As for teaching aids, the middle grade teachers expressed the most interest in guidelines to classroom activities that would provide students with opportunities to participate in group decision making and problem solving.

        "description":"The relationship of socialization, sex differences, and achievement in elementary school is examined in this research. Data were collected from an all black, lower-class, elementary school and a racially mixed, middle-class, elementary school. Results indicate that sex-related student differences follow a general pattern regardless of which school the students attended. Fifth grade boys perceive themselves as more independent and peer-oriented while girls are more dependent on family and teacher feedback and approval. Boys describe themselves as more self-satisfied, aggressive, dominant, work-oriented, and interested in getting along with peers. However, certain attributes which the majority of boys value are counterproductive for academic achievement. The boy who depends on an  aggressive work orientation and endurance to cope with the demands of school is among the lowest achievers. These aggressive achievement motives come into conflict with student role expectations in relation to the authority figure of the teacher. As a socializing institution the school is successful in lessons of self-abnegation, dependency, deference, and passivity and thereby reflects the bias of the wider society. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The paper purports the need to restore the human environment by changing the present consumer-oriented value system toward a value system encompassing a global approach. Since human actions stem from cultural attitudes and values, before the human environment can be improved there must be basic change in the underlying cultural causes of the unsatisfactory conditions. Some of these cultural values include both Eastern and Western attitudes about family size, the concept of individual independence rather than interdependence, and the widespread faith that science and technology could find solutions to the problems of our deteriorating environment. There must be some fundamental changes in our way of living and in our values and beliefs in order to restore the human environment to  a healthy and balanced condition. Our value system tends to equate social acceptance and status with the possession of goods. Many observers feel societies must provide other ways for people to gain status. The logical method for changing present cultural values is through our existing religious and educational institutions. The objectives of both should be developing within each person a sense of being a part of a world ecosystem. Since political parties reflect rather than lead public opinion, basic change must come from public understanding and acceptance of new rules and values necessary for the survival of the world.

International environmental problems require citizens to act politically either by direct participation or through the indirect but often powerful force of public opinion. Hence, environmental education must be education for political decision making. The four basic components of the model curriculum are: (1) knowledge of the scientific foundations of environmental problems, (2) insights into the trade-offs of various natural and social advantages and disadvantages involved in making environmental choices, (3) sensitivity to the public political climate within and among nations in regard to environmental issues,  and (4) practice and skill in applying these other proficiencies to making thoughtful environmental decisions on public policy. Each component area is more fully described by drawing examples from some transnational problem areas of the Canadian-American environment. Course requirements and activities using the model are also described. (Author/DE)",

The three include American Political Behavior, Holt Secondary Social Studies Curriculum, and Investigating Man's World. Curriculum content in each is found to contain dispositions which make social relationships seem unamenable to individual control. The discipline-centered curriculum focuses upon a knowledge that moves students away from the particular and local. The \"scientific structural\" nature of the knowledge serves the latent function of socializing students into a knowledge which discourages connections with everyday realities. This detachment from social relationships can make those relationships less  amenable to individual control and gives more power and legitimacy to those experts who interpret reality. The scientific concepts are by their nature secondary abstractions which move people away from face-to-face contacts, value dilemmas, and conflict situations. Further development of social science discipline curriculum must take into consideration these latent value orientations. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"This paper examines ways in which early childhood education can provide the vital foundation for lifelong attitudes and values toward the democratic process. One goal of early childhood education is to empower the social bonding which brings collaborative relationships to their full potential and gives the child a sense of connectedness to others. In every program there are two levels of curriculum--that which is implicit, the level of life itself, our daily actions; and that which is explicit and planned with conscious goals. In many cases democratic principles are better experienced at the implicit level through the modeling of teachers in their interaction with their young students. Viewing learning and growth as developmental processes, the teacher can practice shared  decision making and consensual group governance on levels appropriate to the child's state of development. For example, if the children make plans for a birthday party, they can experience, even at four years of age, joint planning, airing of diverse thoughts, and movement toward consensual resolution under the guidance of a teacher.

        "description":"The need for investigating, developing, and implementing affective social studies education programs in the classroom is stressed in this paper. Some issues are raised about moral reasoning and values analysis and their relationship to what may be termed affective social studies education. Educators currently place a heavy emphasis on the cognitive approach to values education and moral development in the classroom. However, facing a rapidly changing society, student alienation, and political dissatisfaction with many of the cognitive approaches, educators must develop instructional strategies and methodologies appropriate for affective social education. They need to engage in political effort and provide public support for social studies educators teaching affective social  studies across the country. There is a need for pre- and inservice training programs that at least equal the training in cognitive education. If teachers are in need of practical experience in teaching concepts, conducting inquiry, or presenting a global perspective, they also need practice in identifying and handling emotions and feelings. Social education needs to become symbolic of an incorporative of what appears to be our individual and collective struggle for social being and meaning. Otherwise, we risk the danger of continuing to create people brilliant on the intellectual side but severely lacking on the emotional side. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"Research in the development of musical perception is described. It is crucial to students' experience that they learn to bring to the surface those \"invisible\" ideas inherent in music development such as clapping a rhythm or singing a tune. In this way they learn to bridge the gap between intuitive knowledge and the representation of this knowledge which can lead to greater musical appreciation. One such exercise requires students to arrange a given set of musical blocks into a whole tune. This immediately involves students in active listening, searching for coherence, and thinking about a melody as interrelated parts of a particular whole. A second exercise requires varying melodic rhythms to be represented in their relation to the underlying pulse of the tune. A representation  is sufficiently powerful when students can intuit musical events and relations in a way which they can generalize and transfer to other musical situations. Such representations give the listener a means for actually perceiving aspects of a composition that were previously inaccessible. (Author/DE)",

Also included in the description of some of the activities are sources--materials, films, and books--related to the topic for the teacher's reference.

The first model categorizes values approaches by whether they describe, analyze, or advocate a particular value position. The second model categorizes values approaches by whether they appeal to psychological or logical precepts. The third model categorizes values approaches by whether they manifest a valuative-objective orientation or a valuative-subjective orientation. A fourth model attempts to synthesize the three other models in order to correct deficiencies in all of them. This disclosure approach suggests a new philosophical synthesis among such concepts as subjective, descriptive, psychological, and  logical. It posits that values cannot be adequately explained anymore than the process of cultural function can, without a careful consideration of the individual and collective human being. Because of the metaphoric nature of language, the explanatory form of the narrative is useful to provide some form of concept definition for effective communication. Examples of the application of each model are provided. (Author/DE)",

Three hundred and seventy-eight junior high and high school students from both metropolitan public and private schools in a mid-Southern state participated in the survey. Students judged the degree of rightness and wrongness of six motivations for the break-in. The results indicate that all age groups strongly disapproved of the Watergate break-in, regardless of the hypothesized motivation. However, respondents were more willing to offer some approval of the break-in if the men were helping their country or showing loyalty to the President. The older students were consistently less approving under any condition than the younger group. Younger students had greater difficulty in deciding on the various  dilemmas. Personal profit, personal power, winning the election, and Presidential approval were consistently rejected as justification for the break-in by all age groups. The higher the social class of the students, the more likely they were to disapprove under all conditions. (Author/DE)",

The figures are based on the Current Population Survey conducted in October 1974 by the Bureau of Census. Recent changes in college enrollments are analyzed in the text part of the report. Changes in school enrollment patterns for students attending nursery school through college by socioeconomic characteristics such as age, race, sex, Spanish origin, marital status, dependent family members, metropolitan residence, and level of income are presented in 24 statistical tables. Descriptive analysis in the text is based on the following tables of statistical data: (1) school enrollment rates for persons 3 to 34 years old, by age and sex:  October 1974 and October 1950; (2) characteristics of college students 25 to 34 years old: October 1974; (3) characteristics of students 35 years old and over: October 1974; (4) college enrollment of the population 16 to 34 years old, by year of school, sex, and race: October 1974; (5) college enrollment of the 1971 freshman class: October 1971 to October 1974; (6) college enrollment of persons 16 to 34 years old, by race and age: October 1974 and October 1970; and (7) college enrollment rates for dependent family members 18 to 24 years old, by family income: October 1974 and October 1970.

Descriptive research studies are often simply case studies of the experiences of persons who have field tested, observed, or participated in a simulation game exercise. This kind of research contributes significantly as rich sources of testable hypotheses and potential explanatory variables. Secondly, descriptive studies may identify user problems that help avoid certain common errors in use, choice, or timing of simulation games. Thirdly, they may prove useful in identifying or devising new evaluation methods. Finally, since many descriptive studies are written by researchers in specific academic fields, they may  identify common discipline problems, help to clarify requisite skills and devise educational outcomes, and raise questions about sequencing of activities within courses.

The Bicentennial and the American Issues Forum provide an excellent opportunity to help students develop a better understanding of our society's roots, values, and of the role and inevitability of conflict. A meaningful treatment of the issues raised by the founding of the nation and by the consideration of public policy since then must take into account the nature of values in a democratic society. Basic values of our society conflict with one another because contradictory values lie dormant within each of us. A classic dilemma is equality versus freedom: complete freedom leads  to inequalities, and to achieve complete equality the freedom of some must be restricted. The issues in the Forum can be seen as the history of the continuing struggle over the appropriate mix of values in our nation's policies. The discussion of these issues can provide powerful insights for understanding the present and for deciding about the future. To deal adequately with issues in the past, students will need some of the inquiry skills of historians. Decisions about issues must be made in terms of frames of reference present at that time, not in terms of those of today, in order to provide a basis for understanding why certain decisions were made and how interpretations change.

        "description":"A discrepancy-based evaluation model for international education, developed for a program revolving around a seminar held in Egypt in 1974, is presented. Based on Malcom M. Provus' model, it considered the special problems fo a six-week educational seminar in a non-Western culture, and it questioned what type of individuals can best develop and utilize curriculum resources from another culture. The major problem was that the participants' attitudes and goals conflicted with the project's goals. A questionnaire was formulated and administered several times during the program; a free-response instrument was felt best suited for the evaluation model. It measured attitude by asking for completion of sentences such as &quot;Egyptian people are...&quot; and ranking responses as positive,  neutral, or negative. Also, participant profiles were acquired that measured locus of control, needs achievement, and cognitive development. Results showed that the evaluation model did not answer the question for which it was designed, possibly because the model was not correctly developed for projecting that information or the question was inappropriate. It was concluded that an international program should be altered to fit participants rather than selecting &quot;ideal&quot; participants for a predesigned program. (ND)",

The more course options provided students, the greater the humanistic potential of the school program. During the 1974-75 school year, the vast majority of Kansas high schools continued to offer traditional one- or two-semester long courses. United States history and government are the two most frequently offered social studies subjects. The only other social studies subject area offered in a majority of Kansas high schools is psychology. However, there is an unmistakable trend toward shorter, more varied course offerings as over 29 percent of Kansas high schools are now offering minicourses in the social studies. As in traditional length courses, United States history and government  are the two most popular areas for minicourses. The American Civil War is the most popular subject for American history minicourses, while courses on recent American history, the West, and the colonial period are also being offered in a majority of schools. A specific minicourse in state and local government is the most consistently offered course in government. (Author/DE)",

These factors are: (1) the reading level of the book and/or the range of reading levels within it; (2) long sentences and/or too many concepts within a sentence or paragraph; (3) the use of vague terms, technical vocabulary, and words that have several definitions; (4) too much content and/or textbook is too long; (5) new concepts in familiar material; (6) new content material which is unfamiliar to the teacher or student, especially content from anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology; (7) the need for materials or activities that are not covered in the textbook; and (8) the use of primary source material. Although there are various factors  that make some of the newer textbooks harder to read, reading level is not as much of a problem as it used to be. A comparison of textbooks published before and after 1972 indicates that the average reading level and range of reading levels within the textbooks is decreasing. Results of readability tests for various commercially published texts are included. (Author/DE)",

The rationale for this package organization is that the topical approach allows for in-depth study, group work, and individual projects. A learning package has three parts--basic, small group, and individual levels--that students can opt to take. Steps for building a learning package are described. They are: decide the time, decide the topic, gather materials, decide on basic materials, decide on small group materials, decide on the individual materials, assign grade point values,  determine the cost, produce the learning package, and modifying the learning package. The American Revolution, foreign policy, and Constitution learning packages are given as exemplary nine-week courses.

Those mental traits that today in our society characterize the schizoprenic, in a previous era or in another society may have provided a mechanism for cultural change during the periods of stress when traditional methods of coping with the environment proved unadaptive. In many cases, prophets, shamens, and seers experience the same estrangement and disorganization of the self as does the schizophrenic in our society. This perspective views schizophrenia in our society as an evolutionary anachronism which in a previous society may have been organized early in youth and shaped into a socially useful form. Cultural change has in  recent human history become a dominating ethos and is accordingly valued for its own sake. The particular psychological functions of these sensitive individuals are therefore no longer used to transcend traditional points of view. (Author/DE)",

Observations of six selected television programs over several weeks indicated that the portrayal of Black in integrated and all-Black programs communicates different images about Black Americans. The results indicate that Black characters in all-Black television casts display a significantly greater number of stereotypic Black characteristics, more personal and family problems, and tend to have low social status. Black characters in integrated television casts display a significantly greater number of socially valued characteristics, community problems, and high social status symbols. The study raises questions on the effects of these two types of portrayals on  children's racial attitudes and self-concepts. The all-Black programs which contain negative elements that are traditionally associated with Black Americans may reinforce or instill stereotypic images of Blacks in the viewer. The programs with integrated casts may reinforce the notion that Black people are highly assimilated, upward mobile members of society. (Author/DE)",

This study attempts to provide additional data for the biomechanical analysis of the karate chop. An initial subjective analysis of five subjects using film taken at 200 frames per second identified three fundamentally different patterns of movement. Films were also taken to analyze the kinetic aspects of the study; they show the various components contributing to the accelerometer  output. The various unknowns can also be calculated from film giving an interesting comparison of direct and indirect methods of estimating acceleration. The study uses the technique of accelometry to illustrate the differences in using preferred and nonpreferred hands to break boards. The accelometer recorded considerable differences during this experiment, and this technique may prove to be a useful teaching device which can provide immediate feedback. The study incorporates electromyographic results with kinematic and kinetic data to provide further insight into the movement to be obtained. Although the study is primarily concerned with preimpact phenomena, it also makes very approximate estimates of the forces existing at impact. (BD)",

Death education is defined as the process by which one explores man's relationship with life. The basic philosophy underlying death education is that through the study of death students will gain an appreciation for life which will be reflected in their behavior, and that by understanding death, they can try to prevent needless death for themselves and others. The monograph lists points which should be taken into consideration when planning a unit or course in death education and suicide prevention, and presents questions that teachers of such courses should be able to answer in defense of death education. Sample topics, behavioral objectives, and questions  pertaining to death education for advanced high school students are also presented, along with sample assignments from a college level death education course.

        "description":"With the creation of Public Act 761 in 1967, the State of Connecticut became one of the first states to encourage a program of collaboration and parity between schools and colleges in teacher education activities. The law took advantage of the one point in teacher education where theory and practice meet: the clinical experience of supervised practice teaching. This report analyzes, retrospectively, the various projects and activities generated by Public Act 761 and the subsequent Public Act 230. These projects and activities include a Joint Teacher Education Committee, advisory committees, pilot projects, and conferences. In addition to background sections on each of these activities, the report contains a summary of Public Act 761 and abstracts of the pilot projects funded  under this law. The study highlights (1) some strategies implicit in developing cooperation to the level of collaboration between colleges and schools, (2) some of the changes fostered in the practice and the environment for the student teaching experience, and (3) the support needed to maintain the directions developed. Appendixes include the names of the evaluation team and the advisory committee for teacher education pilot projects; maps of the state, with the distribution of institutions and school systems that submitted proposals; and copies of questionnaires and key questions used in the evaluation study.

The theoretical base for the study was the model of administration as a social process which states that one's need-dispositions and role expectations ideally converge to produce effective behavior. The IIC was examined as an organizational structure which allows for the inclusion of people in the planning of work goals and in the administration of tasks which affect them to benefit the school. The three major variables (extent of involvement in decision  making, representation, and effectiveness) were examined; in addition, six situational variables were identified as being factors which might account for some variation in the dependent variable, effectiveness. Seven hypotheses were developed to test the relationship of extent of involvement in decision making and representation to effectiveness of the I&R unit as perceived by unit teachers and unit leaders. Ancillary questions were posed to compare these perceptions and to examine the relationships of the institutional variables to I&R unit effectiveness. Two instruments were developed to measure the three main variables; data were collected from 48 randomly selected I&R units in IGE/MUS-E schools in 12 states. Nine major conclusions were drawn from the collected data. (BD)",

It was based on the assumption that there must be, within broad categories such as \"explaining,\" both better and worse ways of using language to represent reality and/or to direct student behaviors. The subjects in the study were 20 experienced kindergarten teachers, 20 elementary student teachers, 20 secondary student teachers, and 120 children aged four and one-half to six. The teachers made tapes telling children how to do eight tasks ranging from drawing and tracing figures to moving furniture around the room. Characteristics of each message were counted regarding number of words used, number of utterances, number of communication units, and time in seconds from first to last word. Two  children attempted the task for each recorded message. They were scored as either accomplishing the task correctly, partially correctly, or not at all. It was found that in instructing young children one must include instructions that show exactly what the limits are for the response (what should not be done, as well as what should be done), one must use unambiguous, specific words wherever possible, and one should clearly separate each idea into a separate thought.

The demonstrated achievement over expectancy of both underachievers and serious underachievers in reading suggests that the intervention program with its tasks orientation, problem-solving approach, and system  of monitoring should be expanded to the intermediate grades (4-6) and be given serious study as a model for instruction strategies for all students and not just for underachievers.

Staff development sessions were held for over a year with the assistance of the principal and visiting professionals who taught teachers methods of identifying student problems and averting potential discipline problems. Faculty answered questionnaires before and after the program, rating themselves on a variety of skills indicative  of classroom control. The Fink Interaction Analysis System was used to chart teacher behavior in the classroom in terms of number of positive and negative behaviors related to interacting with students. Analysis of the data indicated that the program was effective in improving teacher competencies, while at the same time student academic achievement improved as disciplinary behavior decreased.

Both of these factors are of great nutritional importance, since there is reason to believe that the growth spurt is sensitive to nutrient deprivation, although our knowledge of the requirements of adolescents for various nutrients is incomplete. The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Academy of Sciences has published successive issues of its &quot;Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA). &quot;The Ten-State Nutrition Survey (1968-70),&quot; which measured food intake of lower income families in the United States, shows deficits among adolescents when  compared with the RDA. The dietary inadequacies of adolescents may sometimes be accentuated by situations causing extra demands for nutrients, such as pregnancy, injuries, and involvement in sports. Excessive intake of nutrients also occurs during adolescence; one of the most common conditions due to an imbalance between food intake and expenditure is obesity. Excessive intake of dietary fat, notably saturated fat, has been associated with elevated blood cholesterol levels. Studies have indicated that the onset of both atherosclerosis and obesity may well occur during childhood, and that the most appropriate time to apply preventative measures and to provide nutritional education is during adolescence.

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 forbids discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities which receive federal funds. This is especially applicable to intramurals. Identical programs and totally coeducational teams are not required as long as comparable opportunities to participate in sports programs exist. Institutions have until July 21, 1976 to evaluate their athletic programs and implement the principles of  nondiscrimination by sex. Equal opportunity includes everything from equipment to coaching to publicity. The most important aspect of a responsible intramurals program is to be sensitive to what the particular students at an institution at a particular time want and are interested in.

The underlying philosophy of the program is that unique cultural tradition can be honored and can be used creatively as the springboard to a meaningful  contemporary life. The institute plans its programs around the special needs of the individual and attempts continuously to expand its understanding of student problems as they emanate from Indian cultural origins. The school offers an accredited high school program with emphasis on the arts, and a college level program as preparation for college and technical schools and employment in arts-related vocations. The age range of the student body is from 15 to 27.

The data was analyzed using a series of stepwise multiple regression analyses. Results indicated that there were both independent and cumulative effects for sex at each stage of a teacher's career. Woman teachers, first of all, had less formal qualifications in terms of years of experience and earned degrees and certificates. But even women with equivalent qualifications to men performed at a lower level. Likewise, lower qualifications  and job performance resulted in women receiving less encouragement to apply for promotion, but even well qualified women were less likely to receive encouragement than men of equivalent standing. The same was true for number of applications, and for promotion itself, with both cumulative and independent effects for sex being present. Data on the few women who were in positions of responsibility showed that they were older, less likely to be married, and held lower level positions than men in positions of responsibility, even though their job performance and level of encouragement was the same.

Pure-tone air conduction threshold levels were measured binaurally at 12 frequencies in three trials prior to exposure, 2 minutes after exposure, and 30 minutes after exposure. Temporary threshold shifts and recovery patterns of the five exposure conditions were compared by analysis of variance with repeated measures. The main effects of frequency and trials were significant (p less than .05).

A series of 10 one-hour ecology lessons were taught by specially trained teachers; the same curriculum materials were presented to four treatments groups. In one treatment group, teachers asked questions divided into 25 percent higher cognitive questions (HCQ's) and 75 percnet fact questions. Group 2 asked 50 percent of each kind of question. Group 3 used 75 percent HCQ's and 25 percent fact questions. Group 4 used no recitation, but involved the students in art activities on ecological themes. Students were examined before and after the course with tests  that included multiple-choice, essay, and oral questions. Results are not to be generalized too broadly because recitation groups were unusually small (6 students) and teachers were taught to present rigid recitation plans. Results showed however, that the students in the 25 percent HCQ sample did slightly better on fact questions and about as well on reasoning questions as students in other groups. This indicated that having students recite facts may prompt their learning more effectively than has been supposed recently. The 50 percent HCQ sample did relatively poorly on facts, but out-performed the other groups on cognitive questions. The art group did not excel in either kind of test. (CD)",

Results suggest that teachers in both high achieving and low achieving schools would be most highly motivated by a system which encourages the conscious application of a variety of intrinsic rewards. Situations which foster a sense of achievement and which lead to increased self-confidence were found to be useful, especially if self-assigned rather than externally-assigned. School administrators can help teachers  analyze their teaching effectiveness as a means of generating these intrinsic rewards by using the techniques of clinical supervision. The study indicates that certain extrinsic rewards are also very important. Some of these take the form of job security and monetary arrangements; others relate to various feedback arrangements which provide the teacher with normative and neutral data describing the administrator's perceptions of his/her teaching effectiveness.

Various guidelines or techniques which may be developed and used in recruiting programs are listed, as is information on  college placement offices and procedures for the collection of data. There are also discussions on the interview, innovative methods for teacher selection, technology and teacher selection, techniques for the applicant, and errors in the selection process.

Nine volunteer and teacher training sessions were held. The volunteers, principals, and teachers were involved in viewing the training of volunteers on videotape. Pupils referred to this project were those who exhibited inadequate coping levels in reading and mathematics. The ratio of pupils to volunteers was dependent on the number of parent volunteers available in the school area. A Communications Council was formed to provide liaison between the project and the community-at-large. A Committee of the Whole, made up of teachers, principals, and volunteers, provided interaction at school parent meetings. Considerable  improvement in the mastery of certain language arts and mathematics skills was demonstrated by 79.3 per cent of the pupils. The principals, teachers, and parents were generally enthusiastic about the project's success with pupils. Although 1974-75 was the final funding year of the project, it was felt that efforts must continue to provide effective use of volunteer skills to pupils who need tutoring in reading and mathematics skills.

In the fall, the subjects had to answer questions about themselves as a child and themselves at that time. In the spring, they answered questions about their actual teaching experiences. Their advisors rated them on the same questions. Some of the results were as follows: (1) teachers' preference for active, aggressive, outgoing children, or shy, passive, withdrawn children was linked to which way they were as children themselves; (2)  teachers who had had more secure, happy childhoods preferred outgoing children; (3) teachers who preferred gifted children viewed themselves as more gifted as children but also as more troubled; (4) teachers judged poor/fair seemed to have had the least resources to draw on in identifying with children or with positive adult role models; (5) \"Myself as a Child\" impressions were better indicators of teaching ability than \"Myself Now;\" and (6) individuals' and advisors' assessment of competence were similar.

An analysis of the demographic structure of the pool of full-time teachers showed that in 1971 30 percent of the teachers were under age 30, and 50 percent were under age 35. It was expected that distribution in the teacher pool by age, sex, and social origin would correlate roughly with those factors over the whole population. However, marked differences were found in teacher density by age group. This was attributed to differences in preparation required for different types of schools. An analysis of net changes in the teacher pool from 1966 to 1970 was also undertaken. It showed that manpower replacement needs are currently  low, but because of insufficient data it was difficult to predict future trends in this area. This analysis also indicated that teachers often do not teach subjects for which they have been trained.

In chapter 2, four school districts present examples of goals and objectives that will ensure a comprehensive and people-oriented program of staff development. The focus in chapter 3 is on the two levels of need that staff development programs are meeting. These needs are (1) teacher needs, and (2) organization needs. Examples of how several districts are meeting these needs are  given. Program evaluation is the topic of chapter 4. Several different approaches to evaluation that school districts are using are discussed in this chapter. In chapter 5 the various roles of those involved in inservice education are defined, and again examples of programs are cited. Chapter 6 discusses the special needs of urban inservice programs, using the Dallas Independent School District as an example. A paradigm for studying teacher development is detailed in chapter 7.

As far back as 1912, administrators were responding enthusiastically to the idea of assessing teacher performance by objective criteria. Currently, the focus of the accountability movement is on evaluation. An evaluation procedure that would assist in the teaching-learning process as well as produce some measure of a teacher's effectiveness must include a clear definition of responsibilities, specific objectives, and assessment of results by these objectives. An evaluation system should be compatible with the mutual job expectations of both administrators and teachers. The individual being evaluated and the evaluator(s) should agree on performance objectives, work for their  accomplishment, and jointly assess the results. Prevailing negative attitudes concerning education and, particularly, the effectiveness of our educational system have prompted education accountability and evaluation mandates. These legislative actions are attempts to mandate quality, and their success depends on the willingness of the educational community to monitor itself and to attempt to improve the quality of the teaching-learning situation.

Analysis of the findings reveal that multiple selection and retention criteria are preferable to any single criterion; periodic checkpoints for review of  student progress should exist; scholastic aptitude is the most widely applied criterion; few applicants are denied entry into teacher education programs; early identification of unsuitable teacher candidates is necessary; and a need exists for an introductory course in education to properly orient prospective teachers to the profession.

There follows a discussion of the philosophical basis of open education and how it can eventually be related to existentialism. The second section of the paper details, at some length, the intellectual importance of another paper which presents the argument that, in order  for existentialism to be applied to education, what is initially required is the redefining or reinterpretation of the notion of education. This section also attempts to answer the question of whether or not existentialism can be applied to education. Section 3 examines how the open classroom teacher views his/her professional role based on the six previously listed learning assumptions. It also discusses how this new teacher role is based on themes peculiar to an existential interpretation. (BD)",

The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) has provided national leadership in the study and encouragement of PBTE and multicultural education. AACTE faces many problems as it contemplates the future of multicultural or intercultural education. First there is the problem of encouraging people to view diversity as a positive factor in society. Also, there are too many people who refuse to accept, to admit, and/or to include the nature of cultural differences as a way of life. Another problem in implementing such a program is eliminating the present narrow view regarding multicultural education. The concerns  of multicultural education are of growing importance to America's society at large, and they should be treated as such. The very nature of PBTE lends itself to enhancing goals of multicultural education. The capabilities of PBTE and multicultural education must be synthesized in a comprehensive program which is applicable both individually and collectively to our multicultural youth. To begin incorporating the ideals and ideas of intercultural education would not only give new (and much needed) direction to American education, but would also enhance America's future. (RC)",

        "description":"This study examined whether or not prospective elementary school teachers can become more positively oriented toward culturally different children after taking teacher education courses that focus on teaching these children. Two groups were taught two courses dealing with disadvantaged youngsters. Group A took the course during the summer and did not have any interaction with such children. Group B took the courses during two consecutive fall and winter quarters and worked with culturally different children. Students were administered questionnaires which dealt with their feelings about minority people both before and after the courses. Conclusions were that students taught courses about minorities without having real-life experience with them became more prejudiced. Students who  worked with minority people became less prejudiced in general. Results indicated that practicum experiences of student teachers should include interaction with children not of the dominant culture if the teachers are to avoid looking down on them or expecting them to fail. This is particularly important because children often live up or down to the expectations of their teachers. (CD)",

They might arise as a result of the geographic origin of the ethnic group; attraction to a particular occupation class; peculiarity of custom; religious or political affiliation; rate of delinquency, crime, or illiteracy; or physical appearance. The subtleties of degradation can take form in the seemingly innocuous omission or casual treatment of the origin of persons of distinguished achievement. Within the parameters encompassing the extremes of subtle and flagrantly obvious discrimination there exist numerous forms of ethnic degradation which might be categorized as (1) occupation class stereotyping; (2) stereotyping by perceived \"natural\"  inclination; (3) stereotyping in terms of illiteracy, crime, or delinquency; and (4) stereotyping by using a generally derogatory characterization. Steps are now being taken to alleviate future degradation and also to provide members of certain ethnic minorities with the justice of a well-deserved positive ethnic identity and heritage on which to look back. The time has come for educators to utilize the diverse cultural backgrounds of their students as a vehicle to enrich American society because of, not in spite of, their ethnic heritage.

Many people have seen this diversity as a divisive force and have therefore adhered to the melting pot theory. Everyone comes out of a melting pot the same. Consequently, (1) intelligence tests have been devised that are only relevant to the experiences of nonminority children; (2) schools have refused to offer bilingual education to Chinese, Mexican, and other children whose first language is not English; (3) courts have only recently considered offering bilingual translation of court proceedings; and (4) teacher training has rarely included anything that would focus a potential teacher's attention on the needs of culturally different children. In fact, many white teachers come  to teaching with unfortunate prejudices against nonwhite children, as was shown by a study in which white female undergraduates consistently gave less praise, encouragement, or attention to black junior high students regardless of whether they had been told these students were gifted or nongifted. Intelligence tests are particularly susceptible to cultural bias; furthermore, they are limited in their ability to assess a child's real potential. The Dove Counter Balance Intelligence Test was created to help psychologists and others think about and design tests that recognize varieties of cultural experience and the different usages of language among different ethnic groups.

        "description":"Everyone in the United States has a cultural heritage which varies from the present mainstream culture of this country and yet, the majority of Americans have lost ties with their cultrual background. This has occurred because of both the melting pot theory and the educational system that has developed under a philosophy. There has been a serious attempt made in our schools to fit everyone into one cultural mold. This cannot and should not be done. Bicultural programs are needed, particularly for groups such as the Puerto Ricans and Chicanos that have been able to easily harmonize with the mainstream culture. The task of the educator should be to ensure that the cultures of these children are not stolen from them in the classroom. There are many problems encountered in trying to  establish culturally pluralistic programs in the schools. Among these are acceptance by the traditional educational system in America, the stereotyping of ethnic groups, ethnocentrism, and the training of teachers with a new awareness. There are also numerous factors which make up a good program but are difficult to achieve. The program must contain bilingual materials--it should include both English as a second language and Spanish as a second language--and must study both cultures. Finally, if a bicultural program is to work, teachers must always try to build the child's self-concept, and parents must be included in the program. [RC]",

        "description":"This study compares the differences in causal attributions of a person experiencing success or failure in an achievement situation (the actor) and someone who read about the situation (the observer). The subjects were given sets of anagrams which varied in difficulty. The results of both studies showed that actors were relatively more likely to perceive their outcomes as caused by external factors (task difficulty and luck), while observers attributed these outcomes more to internal factors (effort). Attributions for both actors and observers were also strongly affected by whether the outcome was a success or a failure. Hypotheses concerning significant differences in attributions made by male and female observers or actors were only weakly supported; however, the data that did  emerge suggested a general tendency toward stereotypic thinking by both sexes, but especially by male observers. It has been suggested that the differential attributions made by an actor and an observer may cause conflicts in educational settings, where the student is the actor and the teacher the observer. However, this present study explores a situation that differs from a classroom situation, and additional research is needed to investigate differential attributions of teachers and pupils. (BD)",

The first participant supported them and felt it was wrong to assume Canadian sports would automatically imitate American mistakes of ignoring the athlete's academic life and allowing too much recruitment activity. The second participant felt athletes do not need special scholarships because in Canada financial aid is available to anyone who really wants a college education. Also, competitive recruiting would mean appealing to Americans to the disadvantage of Canadian boys, and the healthy, relaxed atmosphere surrounding Canadian sports in  the past would be lost. A government spokesman supported third-party scholarships, particularly those in which the athlete gets the money from the government and decides for himself where to go to school. He did not see why sports should be singled out as a cultural activity not worth supporting. He also suggested that offering scholarships would keep promising athletic talent in Canada. The next participant warned that over-recruiting and commercialization in sports would follow, with physical education teachers having to engage in extensive recruiting and noncompetitive sports losing support. He said that the costs incurred in attracting larger audiences to big sports events cancel the profits. Reactors then gave additional views to which panelists replied. (CD)",

Data were obtained for 76.8 percent of the graduates. The findings indicated that students who prepare for teaching at Harris Teachers College do enter and remain in the  profession. Only 4.5 percent of the 1970 graduating class and 8.8 percent of the 1965 graduating class had left teaching for noneducational employment. It was also shown that more men than women and more whites than blacks were likely to leave the profession.

        "description":"This curriculum guide contains a preface and an introduction for each level of learning plus three parts. The preface and introduction make a case for reversing the trend in American schools of teaching children to be well-assimilated Americans. They state, rather, that children should be encouraged to know and be proud of their ethnic heritage as well as the ethnic background of others. Primary level units include a lesson on \"I'm Special\" and \"Differences Equal You and Me.\" The child learns to value his/her own specialness and to understand the things he/she has in common with other children in addition to their differences. General objectives (or rationale) and specific procedures, including suggested songs, exercises, and poems, are included. The intermediate level units  focus on specific ethnic groups such as German, Jewish, black, Mexican-American, and others. These units are more sophisticated than those in the first group, and include maps, bibliographies for students and teachers, and imaginative exercises, one of which, for example, involves children in constructing a hypothetical community. The third part is for secondary schools. The model units are designed to be useful in a number of classes besides social studies. Some of the units that are presented are Asian-American culture, minority literature, folk dances, and European influences on architecture. A list of film topics for philosophical discussion, ideas for role playing, and recipes are included. (CD)",

In September 1971, all elementary teachers in Michigan were instructed to begin teaching substance use and abuse. An Elementary Health Committee was established to design a curriculum guide for health education incorporating most of the Minimal Performance Objectives (MPO) prepared by the Michigan Department of Education. Upon completion of the guide, the Committee needed to prepare teachers to implement the curriculum. A graduate level course (HED 5231) was, therefore, designed and presented to the teachers. The Troy School District was chosen to be a field testing site for the Michigan  Department of Education. Elementary students of teachers who had enrolled in HED 5231 became the experimental group. The control group was made up of classes at the same grade and in the same elementary school as the experimental group, but whose teachers had not enrolled in HED 5231. The experimental group received instruction in the MPOs and were then given assessment tests. The same assessment tests, without instruction, were given to the control group. The study showed that health instruction generally improved ORT scores, that differences on the ORT occurred at grade levels and in content areas, and that a graduate level curriculum in health education was valuable to elementary teachers.

An evaluation was performed to determine which curriculum areas of the New Mexico University Bilingual Teacher and Teacher Trainer Institute were perceived as effective and ineffective by participants. Two questionnaires of differing formats were devised for this purpose. After the participants had completed and returned the first questionnaire, they were interviewed concerning their responses. The second questionnaire was adapted to the respondent's reaction to the format of the first questionnaire. Another interview was held with  each participant to clear up some items. Also, an interrogation letter was sent to seven bilingual program directors in New Mexico about what would consitute a good graduate program for bilingual teachers. The study showed that the following three main areas should be a minimum graduate component for the preparation of teachers for bilingual/bicultural (Spanish/English) programs: (1) culture, (2) language, and (3) pedagogy. The results from this study represent the voice of teachers in bilingual/bicultural programs and should be taken a serious mandate.

Each intern experienced working in both the lower and upper elementary grades. During the inservice, the interns were involved in developing proposals for cummunity projects. During the 1975 summer session, they completed all work required for the bachelor's degree and/or certification.

All those that responded (23) indicated that they had at least one course in this field. Both elective and required undergraduate and graduate courses were offered at different institutions. Courses were usually three hours per week for one semester, and the normal format was the lecture, often with visual aids. Problems identified included overly large classes, insufficient time to cover the subject, lack of qualified faculty and appropriate texts, and student unfamiliarity with history. Recommendations to improve classes included provision of greater curriculum balance, with more attention to humanities; more  emphasis on history; and greater involvement of historical organizations in taking on projects such as producing visual aids. Suggested innovative techniques included having students give mini-papers, going to museums, talking about current events, and using reproduced prints of primary sources. Beginning level classes focused on an understanding and appreciation of sport, while upper level classes dealt with the role of sport in society, and graduate classes stressed methods of historical research.

The paper is presented in a question and answer format. The questions are the types that teachers ask when presented with modular instruction as an alternative approach to teaching, and  the answers are those developed by teachers to explain this approach to one another.

        "description":"Performance is affected by cognitive learning skills, but also by the reasons people perceive as causes of their successes and failures. People with high achievement needs perceive their successes as caused by their own ability and effort, and their failures as caused by lack of effort. People with low achievement needs blame their failures on lack of ability and do not take credit for their ability when they experience success. A change in attributions changes the way people perform. In one research study, high achievers given placebos they thought would interfere with their abilities tried less hard on a task, while people with low achievement needs and little self-confidence, since they had an excuse for experiencing difficulty, did better than usual. In another study,  children subjected to repeated failures kept trying if they believed effort would make a difference. Tendencies to form causal attributions are learned, perhaps differently by different racial and social groups. However, interventions can change people's assessment of their chances for success. For example, tests on children who were reinforced for exhibiting effort attributions showed that their work improved and they became more persistent. Teachers should thus take students' individual attribution styles into consideration as a characteristic which affects achievement behavior, and, at the same time, attempt to change students' attributions in the direction of emphasizing ability and effort.

        "description":"The effectiveness of passive, covert, and overt methods of student response in individual television instruction was investigated. Students were classified on the basis of high and low achievers, then randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Group 1 (passive) was given conventional television instruction without opportunity to respond during the instruction. Group 2 (covert) was given multiple-choice recall questions during the instruction and asked to make a mental selection of the correct answers. Groups 3 and 4 (both overt) were also given questions during the instruction and asked to actively select the correct answers. A two-way analysis of variance of the criterion test scores revealed significant differences on both the posttest and the delayed retention test. On  the posttest, significant differences were found between the passive group and each of the three student response groups in both achievement levels. However, no significant differences were found among the three student response groups. On the retention test given one week later, low achievers in the covert group obtained significantly higher scores than the low achievers in the passive group. These findings, in favor of student response in individual television instruction, support the related research which has generally found student response superior in group instruction. They also support the concept that retention seems to be influenced more by the initial level of learning than by the method. (Author/BJG)",

The subjects in Experiment 1 were black and white females and males (ages 9-12 years) attending inner-city schools in Des Moines, Iowa. Those in Experiment 2 were white females and males (ages 10-11 years) attending school in a predominantly white, middle-class, university community (Iowa City). In both experiments, the subjects as a total group were significantly affected by the models' ratings. In Experiment 1, girls conformed more than did boys; there was no sex difference in Experiment 2. With regard to race, only one obtained effect is of any direct interest (in Experiment 1, black subjects conformed more to white  than to black models). The results suggest that social-class differences may now exist in the conformity behavior of the sexes. The general absence of race effects is viewed as encouraging, from an equalitarian standpoint.

An instructional unit was to be considered successful if over 50 percent of the students who studied it achieved mastery (85 percent or more correct) on a criterion-referenced posttest. Instructional materials to be used in an individualized setting for the remediation of deficiencies in mathematics basic skills were developed, revised, and produced by the project following precise behavioral objectives. In this third year of the project, 2,128 secondary  students and 38 teachers made use of the project's revised materials. Four instructional units were given preliminary trials, and revision was indicated for two of the four units. More than 2,100 students completed 6,937 units in 11 instructional areas. Over 50 percent of the students completing units in each area achieved mastery as shown by criterion-referenced posttests. Percents of students achieving mastery ranged from 52 percent in Area Measurement to 85 percent in Dividing Fractions. These were all students who had been below the mastery level on diagnostic tests of these mathematics basic skills. Recommendations are given. (Author)",

Testing of the children, however, was incomplete and inconclusive. All Title I primary teachers were eligible for the project. Most of the teachers from 25 public and 9 nonpublic schools availed themselves of the services offered by the project during the two years, 1972-74, covered by this report. This evaluation concentrated on the activities of the project and teachers' responses to those activities. Teachers received  over 11,000 hours of inservice training. More than 900 demonstration lessons were given by the Math Team and more than 10,000 sets of instructional materials were distributed. These activities were supported by Title I funds of $155,408 for the two year period. Participation in the project was voluntary. The high number of requests for the Math Team's services was an indication of the need felt by the teachers for assistance in teaching math. Recommendations were made. These included clarification of objectives and development of criterion-referenced tests to measure those objectives. (Author/BJG)",

The goal of the Human Relations Program for 1972-73 was to change the climate in the schools in preparation for desegregation and integration. The object of teaching communication skills was to overcome any communication barriers caused by isolation and to have the staffs serve as models for communicating and interacting. Anonymous questionnaires seeking participant reactions to the program were administered in every school and special site in the district in April 1973. Most of the respondents were nonadministrative certificated staff-teachers, social workers, counselors, and librarians.  Respondents also included teacher aides, clerical staff, administrators, and custodial staff. Most said they found the program useful, improved their communication skills, and thought the program had improved interpersonal relations. While most of the participants thought the program was possibly, though not directly related to desegregation/integration, fewer thought it had made the climate more conducive to desegregation/integration, and fewer still thought it would actually help implement the desegregation/integration plan. Opinions concerning the overall value of the program were about evenly divided between those who said it was worthwhile and those who said it wasn't. (Author/DEP)",

As is well known, the traditional formula score rests on a theoretical framework which is of dubious validity. Two instruments, variant approaches to the assessment of mathematical knowledge, were administered to approximately 1,700 entering college freshmen during an orientation period. The method consists of an iterative computer procedure for calculating split-half reliability of the tests as the weights are systematically varied throughout the region of maximization as determined by essentially canonical approaches. The  results indicate that in contrast to the negative weight for the a priori formula score, a sizable positive weight maximizes reliability. The implications for rate of work as the single most reliable aspect of test performance seem clear. The validity of much educational testing rests on assumptions of fairness to those tested, achieved through optimization of standardized conditions. The study suggests that factors which alter rate-of-work characteristics of performance may be most detrimental to candidate success. (Author/DEP)",

The idea of synchrony has been challenged by Brainerd's initial groupement research, which indicated a two-dimensional structure, corresponding to class operations and relational operations. A review of the literature indicated conflicting views concerning the nature of synchrony and how it may best be investigated. The secondary issue of distinguishing which groupements were operationalized by several traditional Piagetian tasks was explored. Indications from this study were (1) that the class-relational distinction was not a clear-cut one; (2) considering absolute difficulty level, groupements I, II, and III were more difficult than the other five  groupement tasks; however, groupement IV, also a &quot;class&quot; task, indicated an intermediate difficulty level in the older grades; (3) traditional Piagetian performance does not appear to be completely subsumed by the groupement tasks; and (4) nonmetric scaling and clustering techniques aid in the analysis of dichotomous, developmental data.

        "description":"Any theory of information processing must address both what is processed and how that processing takes place. Most studies investigating variables which alter physical dimension utilization have ignored the large individual differences in selective attention or cue utilization. A paradigm was developed using an individual focus on information processing. The purposes of this paper were to: (1) review the essential features of this paradigm, and (2) discuss its use as a beginning step in the investigation of double-aspect, human vs. nonhuman stimuli. Ten double-aspect, human vs. nonhuman stimuli were presented to a heterogeneous sample of 520 first, third, fifth, ninth, eleventh graders, college students, and state hospital patients classified as neurotics, schizophrenics, or  sociopaths, for identification. An individual-differences multidimensional scaling analysis resulted in a four-dimensional stimulus space used to subgroup like perceiving people. Characterization of the responses to the double-aspect stimuli by each subgroup demonstrated the value of the approach in studing selective information processing. (Author/BJG)",

A sample of 264 and 261 persons, ages 17 to 25, responded to the giving care and the receiving care instruments respectively. In both samples, approximately 50 percent of the subjects were studying for caring professions such as nursing, public health, and clincal psychology. Using coefficient alpha, a reliability of .794 and .794 was obtained for the giving and receiving care instruments. Studies of population differences on giving care snow: carers score higher than noncarers, female and male carers score equally well, and female noncarers, score higher  than male noncarers. On receiving care, studies of population differences show no differences obtained between carers and noncarers and between males and females. Results were discussed both in relation to a theory of care giving and sex differences. A review of the literature of help-giving and caring reveals that the first two have received some recent attention. Scant information is available, however, on either the theory or measurement of caring. (Author)",

Teachers were asked to provide data concerning parent attendance at scheduled conferences and parent interest in their child's progress or school activites. In both kindergarten and first grade, preschool graduates were identifiable on the basis of test scores and adjustment ratings. These findings indicate that participation in a language-based preschool program does have positive effects on achievement in cognitive skills and  school adjustment in kindergarten and first grade. A child's participation in the Title I preschool program does not appear to have a positive influence on parental involvement, as measured by parent attendance at conferences or other overt indications of interest in the child's school activities.

        "description":"A novel scoring procedure was investigated in order to obtain scores from a conventional multiple-choice test that would be free of the guessing component or contain a known guessing component even though examinees were permitted to guess at will. Scores computed with the experimental procedure are based not only on the number of items answered correctly, but also on the average quality of both correct and incorrect choices as reflected in the difficulty and discrimination values associated with these choices. The scores resulting from this procedure were compared to number-right and conventional formula scores for predicting guessing-free scores, which are independently determined for the same test. These data suggest that significant increases in reliability can result if score  credit is assigned only to items that were answered correctly without guessing on any type. Since the examinees were not aware that the statistical analysis of their tests included a penalty for guessing, findings should be treated with theoretical interest. (Author/BJG)",

Each of these indices is seen as limited by the failure to adequately consider the correlation between speed and power, but they have the advantage that they are derivable from a single administration of a test. The plausibility of an assumption of a normal distribution of work rates was tested on empirical data from seven tests, and in six cases the assumption was not unrealistic although the fit was only approximate. The analysis of tests for which the assumption is not completely tenable will often be instructive for those who construct instruments. Specific item material seems to govern departures from  normality. The goal of a single, intuitively satisfying index of speededness in tests is important. Without some sort of metric or scale with which to assess degrees of speededness, the evaluation of tests in this important area remains inordinately subjective. (Author/BJG)",

Claiming personal injury as a consequence of the failure of school professionals to exercise reasonable care in the discharge of their duties, he asked the court to hold the school district liable to him for damages in excess of $500,000. This suit reflects the relationship between educational accountability and educational outcomes. School negligence is difficult to demonstrate because of the underlying dilemma as to what evidence is relevant, reliable, and credible. One solution to this dilemma requires that procedures be adopted and modified which rely more on human  testimony than other evaluation approaches. Tne forum for carrying out such a procedure is called an educational hearing, and it may provide a more effective way of adequately seeking balanced factual data, while not replacing existing designs for the collection and analysis of evaluational evidence.

The processor accepts two types of information: (1) sample performance data on magnetic tape, and (2) user information reflecting knowledge about features of the performance that are considered to be important to measurement. The sample performance data input is smoothed by the processor in order to remove or reduce noise factors in accordance with information provided by the user. Criterion performance functions are, optionally, provided by the user or are computed  by the processor using skilled performers' data. The processor then develops a discrete representation of the continuous performance data based on observed deviations from the criterion functions. This discrete representation, in turn, is used to model each performance using state-space techniques. The processor operates on the state-space model to compute vectors which form generators of various conceivable measure spaces. Candidate performance measures are then generated by operating on the vectors with multiple regression algorithms. Empirical validation tests of several types are applied to the candidate measures for assessment of their validity-likelihood. (Author/DEP)",

The parents are very highly involved in the program and generally feel their children have made favorable progress this year academically and socially. Only four parents indicated a desire to change their child to the regular program next year.

Half of the classrooms studied in each site were randomly assigned as viewing classes and the other half as nonviewing. An attempt was also made to evaluate the effects of viewing the program at home in Richmond, Va. and Washington, D.C. In-school viewing classes made significantly greater gains than nonviewing classes in the reading skills the program was designed to teach. The program had a clear and significant impact on its target audience--second grade children who were in the bottom half of their class as indicated by  standardized reading test scores, indicating the program was an effective instructional supplement for children who were beginning to experience reading difficulty. The program was also effective on first grade classes that viewed in school. Significant impact was also seen on third and fourth grade classes. Gains were produced among first and second grade classes across almost all of the 19 major curriculum areas built into the program. Some positive effects on a standardized reading test were also found. Effects were similar on all groups--Spanish, blacks, whites, boys, and girls. Teachers also reacted favorably. (RC)",

The delta-values for the white North Central group were then cross-plotted with each of the other groups to yield an elliptical pattern of points  for each comparison. The major axis of the ellipse for each cross-plot was determined and the distance of each item point from it computed. These distances were used to create a vector index of cross-cultural stability. Items having notable patterns of instability were examined closely for factors which might explain the instabilities. It was concluded that certain vocabulary items were unstable for some Spanish-speaking groups. These vocabulary instabilities were attributed to coincidental cognate influences operating to make some English vocabulary items relatively easier for the Spanish-speaking groups. It was also observed that reading test items containing material relevant to black culture were relatively easier for blacks than were other items in the test battery.  (Author/RC)",

Secondly, parents sit on advisory councils and governing boards which set policy or make recommendations. Finally, a broad base of feedback is sought through systematic interviews or surveys of all parents. This document reports the results of the third all-parent survey effort. Every parent was mailed a questionnaire packet containing six sections--one to be answered by all-parents and one from each of the SEA component schools. Parents were directed to respond to the all-parent section and to those school sections at which their children attended. In addition to responding to questionnaire sections, parents  were urged to supply further comments. All parent responses were anonymous. Questionnaires were computer analyzed, except for write-in comments which were collected and included in feedback information to particular schools. Approximately 45 percent of questionnaires mailed were returned. The response data was found to be reasonably representative of SEA parent opinion. (Author/BJG)",

The role of Educational Testing Service (ETS) in the overall study effort was to provide services facilitating the interpretation of changes in behavior occuring in response to narcotic antagonist treatment. ETS undertook a review of data forms NAS-3, Background Interview; NAS-6, Craving Scale; and NAS-11 Status Interview; and the User's Manual with the intent of editing and  modifying, when necessary, from the standpoint of clarity. Draft reports of the editorial comments are included as Appendix 1. Subsequent comments and suggestions pertaining to earlier revisions of forms and the revised manual are presented in Sections 2 and 3. The second goal of the ETS effort was to develop behavioral scales to provide a simplified summary of behavioral variations during the course of the study. Scales which were statistically feasible are presented in Section 4 along with the statistical information which led to their development. (RC)",

        "description":"Minneapolis Public Schools' Reorganized Junior High School Program completed its third and final year of operation with Title III ESEA funds in June 1974. An additional counselor was hired for each of the schools, Jordan and Marshall-University. A major objective was that the counselor would change from a traditional resource person to more of a team member, program coordinator, and facilitator in creating a positive, student-centered program. Outcome objectives were increased counselor effectiveness, positive student attitudes toward school, and increased parent and student involvement. Questionnaires were administered to teachers, administrative and resource personnel, students, and parents at both schools. At Jordan, teacher contact with counselors increased over all previous  years data were available. Counselors had more contact with students in all three years of the project than in the year prior. Nine of ten parents felt involved and satisfied with the program at Jordan. Less than half the students felt involved in school decision-making. At Marshall-University teacher-counselor contacts reported by the 1973-74 team teachers was less than reported by the team teachers in the two previous years, but more than reported by the non-team teachers in the past. Counselor office contact with students was down in 1973-74, but students reported more frequent classroom visits by the counselors. Parent results indicated that parents were generally aware of the program options available, could identify and describe the programs, and felt well informed. (RC)",

The game consists of a box-shaped target which responds, when the target is hit by a rolled ball, somewhat like a jack-in-a-box. When the bull's eye is hit, the lid opens and a surprise picture appears. After being seen by the child, another picture replaces it. The game is appropriate for children between three and six years; older children have an understanding of competition and success in hitting the target is their only goal. Materials include the target; 21 surprise pictures; a rubber ball; a cloth strip on which black lines at two foot intervals show the distance at which the target may be placed; and two small markers, one marked &quot;easy&quot; and  one marked &quot;hard&quot; indicating the target distances between which the child chooses as he plays the game. During the game, the child shows his willingness to try difficult tasks, making a total of 20 choices between the easy and hard. The score is calculated from the number of balls the child uses and the number of times he chooses the difficult in relation to the number of successes he experiences. The game is adjusted for the ability of each child on the basis of a pretest. Statistical data is included in the report. (RC)",

It combines a picture interview technique with gift-giving, and each child's value in his group is measured in terms of the extent to which his gift-giving is reciprocated by the children whom he chooses. The assumption underlying the choice of gift-giving as a technique for measuring social relations is that an individual wants to benefit someone he likes. Materials needed include a composite picture of children in the group, inexpensive toys, and envelopes, prelabeled with the names of the children in the group. Then the child is given a choice of several gifts, one of which is his to keep. Three gifts, identical to the one  he chose, are then placed before him and he is allowed to choose three friends to whom he wishes the gifts to be given. This procedure is repeated until the child has choosen friends for four gifts, making 12 choices. Scoring shows the relationship between the child's choice of other children and their choice of him. The calculations are illustrated. (RC)",

The test is based on color preferences and is adjusted to the actual preferences of individual children. A pretest provides an opportunity for each child to indicate his color preferences. In the test proper, each child is given opportunities to conform as he constructs a picture booklet, identical to or different from booklets constructed by other  persons (parents, peers, etc.). Scoring consists of a numerical count of the conforming and nonconforming responses made by the child. Scores range from -20 (complete nonconformity) to +20 (complete conformity).

The accumulative effects of bias emphasize the need for care in analysis and interpretation. The class of 3 million persons consisted of about 82 percent white, nine and one-half percent black. About half of the white students were enrolled in academic curricula, compared to a quarter of the black students. Close to half of the black students were enrolled in general curricula, compared to 29 percent of all white students. In a set of six tests, females slightly outperformed males, academic students  outperformed other students, and blacks scored about a standard deviation below whites. The socioeconomic status (SES) of academic students was higher than general students who had a slightly higher SES than that of vocational/technical students. Blacks had lower SES than whites. Students in federal programs scored higher than others in the same curriculum who did not participate in federal programs. Significant differences were seen regarding exposures of various students to various special teaching techniques. About one-third of the sample may face a financial barrier to continued education. Remedial instruction was more frequently provided to blacks than to whites, to general and vocational students than to academic students, and to more males than to females. (RC)",

Academic ability, post secondary school plans, student ratings of their school, psychological variables, values, extracurricular activites, and the influence of various key people were used as independent measures for identifying vocational students. Multivariate methods were used extensively to determine which information from the Longitudinal Study of Educational Effects could be used effectively to distinguish vocational students from general and academic students in the class of 1972. After much work in developing constructs, two conclusions were reached. Academic students were superior to both general and vocational students in terms of measured academic ability. The relationship  between curriculum and academic ability was both strong and reliable. No other variables appeared to distinguish strongly academic from vocational and general students. Although the relationship was less reliable and considerably less strong than was the case for distinguishing academic students, vocational students differed from general students primarily in terms of alienation, focus on the work world, channeling, sex, and race. Typically, vocational students were less alienated from school and focused more on the work world than general students. Vocational students experienced less channeling than general students; they were less frequently assigned to their high school program and expressed more choice in selecting programs than were general students. More women and whites were  enrolled in vocational programs proportionally. (Author/DEP)",

A curriculum guide was developed and instructional materials were produced and identified. The ethnic studies curriculum was implemented in four elementary schools, one junior high school and four senior high schools from each system. Approximately 700 students participated in the project each year. A pre- and post-test attitude  survey taken during the third year of the project revealed that there was a significant change in student attitude toward ethnic groups. No significant change was found in student attitude toward racial groups or toward students from the other system. Participating students made significant gains in cultural knowledge. However, few joint classes' needed to stimulate student interaction took place. Increased cooperation and communication between teachers from the public and parochial systems was noted.

        "description":"Piaget has hypothesized that concrete and formal operations can be described by specific logical models. The present study focused on assessing various aspects of four concrete operational groupings and two variations of two formal operational characteristics. Six hundred twenty-two 9-14 year old students participating in the Human Sciences Program designed by Biological Science Curriculum Study were the subjects. Two 15-item written tests were given on two consecutive days. Twelve items included drawings, 19 were open-ended, and 11 were multiple choice. For analysis seven items were eliminated because of deviant difficulty indices; the remaining 23 items were subjected to an image analysis with the initial factor matrix obliquely transformed using Hofmann's orthotran. Three  factors were exceptionally clean: one including formal operational systematic permutations; one measuring concrete operational addition of increasing asymmetrical relations; and one involving the formal operational logic of making correct implications and denying incorrect implications. Four other factors were mixed within developmental period and across developmental period. Results are discussed relative to tentative support for some of Piaget's logical models, the robustness of Piagetian theory, and the feasibility of a written test of cognitive development.

        "description":"Questionnaires are important research tools despite their unpopularity. They are generally less costly per response than other techniques, may elicit more candid answers, provide more time for respondents to consider their replies, and do not introduce interviewer or observer bias. The rate of return is an indication of the usefulness of a questionnaire. The number of returns are affected by several factors, but only the method of distribution, the kind of information requested, and the status of respondents are considered here. At Emporia Kansas State College, students working on masters research projects who used questionnaires were studied. Of the four methods of questionnaire distribution: U.S. mail, personal distribution by researcher, distribution by other persons, and  campus mail, personal distribution was the most effective method in getting returns. There was little, if any, relationship between the information requested and response rate. Analysis of rate of return and status of subjects was inconclusive, with college and university educators at the lowest rate for any group. (Author/BJG)",

        "description":"Included are three studies, each dealing with an aspect of comparative validity of the American College Test (ACT) and the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) at selective colleges. The first study considered the predictive efficiency of the ACT test scores and ACT test scores plus high school grades at 120 colleges, separated into three groups according to average college ACT composite. The second study concerned four selective colleges where all students had taken both the ACT and the SAT. At all four of these colleges, the mean ACT Composite score was above 24.5; the mean SAT Total score was above 1200. The third study took place at the U.S. Air Force Academy, a highly selective institution. A focus of concern in this study was to correct for selection on one of the tests, in this  case the SAT, by designing the study in such a way that prior selection of students by the SAT would not be an extraneous factor in the analysis of the comparative predictive validity of ACT and SAT. The evidence in the three studies points to the conclusion that ACT and SAT scores typically yield similar results at selective colleges, and where they do not the ACT is usually favored with higher correlation coefficients.

        "description":"In the past years the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has released results from a variety of learning areas. The purpose of this paper is to point out male-female differences in achievement across several learning areas. Hopefully, the results discussed here will be used as a basis for examining the possible existence of social and curriculum biases in these areas. Female and male performance in social sciences, mathematics, and science are nearly equal at age nine, but very different by adulthood. For example, at age nine, both sexes do equally well on numerical operation, geometry, and measurement, while males have a substantial advantage by adulthood. Since females have been found to read and write better than males, skills prerequisite for academic  achievement, the superiority of males in social sciences, math, and science needs further explanation. It is hypothesized that females do not excell in political areas because social studies classes make it clear that females have not been actively involved in their countries' political decisions. No explanation is offered for why females are less able than males to answer questions concerning the location of the Great Lakes, the source of government revenues, and the purpose of the European Common Market. It is concluded that as sex barriers are lifted, females will be given the opportunity to reach their full potential. (BJG) Primary type of information provided by report: Results (Sex).",

        "description":"This paper explains the method used to locate low-income inner-city participants and describes progress during the first fiscal year of the endeavor. Several educational programs are described briefly. Among them are the archaeological summer camp, 4-H teams' participation in a basketball league, 4-H clubs' in the low-income inner-city target area, a 4-H club conference, and the renovation of Grant Park. A special instructor and basic reading and articulation program, which has as its objective the involvement of low income youth in activities considered interesting and educational, is described in detail. Classes conducted under this program include creative crafts, women's awareness, self awareness, basic reading and articulation, musicology, craft ideas, and others. The  program is said to provide a viable means to reach and teach low-income people with great success. A motion film of this program documenting some of the described courses is scheduled for release in the fall of 1974. Success of the programs described is considered to be due to their applicability to both transient and stable life styles. Participation by minority groups in these programs is observed to have increased nine fold. The youth programs offered are held to reflect an applied anthropological approach to ethnic, minority, and majority interests. (Author/AM)",

Considerable attention is devoted to the presentation of materials that highlight the importance of genetic factors in the interactionists' equation. The paper is considered (1) to insure that the reader never loses sight of the biological  components of intelligence, (2) to point out that certain psychological functions may be more amenable to environmental manipulation than others, and (3) to highlight the issues that must be resolved before the manner in which environment affects both the intellectual and the non intellectual components of behavior is comprehended.

Two Academies are found moderately successful, with the remaining two minimally successful in attaining the shared objectives.

Major divisions of the document include a general section, the Boston municipal government, the State government, leadership of Boston's private sector, and the Federal government. Within these major categories, various sub-division are listed and followed by findings and recommendations thereof. The view that court-ordered desegregation of public schools in Boston for school year 1974-75 was disastrous is not supported here. Evidence developed by staff and testimony under oath from over 100 witnesses during five days of public hearings is considered to indicate that substantial progress was made in Boston in 1974-75 in the direction of upholding and  implementing the constitutional rights of children and young people. The groundwork for even more significant progress in the same direction for school year 1975-76 is stated to have been laid. The Boston School Committee is said to have treated the court ordered Phase I school desegregation plan as an administrative problem and refused to take the affirmative steps necessary to desegregate successfully. The attitudes and practices that characterized their approach to Phase I are held not to have changed. Since the major administrative responsibilities for implementing the desegregation order still rests with this committee, the resolution of this unresolved issue is seen as crucial. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This historical investigation explores the foundations of black education in the United States. It focuses on the ideology of the northern whites who labored during and after the Civil War to assure that the ex-slaves -- the freed men -- received proper schooling. The study investigates the role of the Freedman's Bureau, and sets the movement in its economic and social context. It also seeks to provide an accurate narrative history of the freedman's aid movement. One of the major conclusions drawn here is that after a century of dealing with racism and inequality as an educational issue, perhaps it is time to realize those are economic issues utterly beyond the reach of schools. A second conclusion is that liberal educational reformism has, on the one hand, served to drain energy  and attention away from basic criticism and analysis of the social and economic determinants; on the other hand, it has victimized, stigmatized, and objectified its clients as extraordinary and needing special assistance, thereby deepening their own sense of inferiority, Perhaps the overriding finding considered to emerge from this study is the conclusion that it is time educationists and education policy makers begin to understand educational history and to approach their problems with a clear understanding of the role of schools as social institutions within a specific social setting.

The stated rationale which guided the general direction of this alternative program has been to implement strategies of instruction designed to: provide success oriented learning alternatives consistent with the needs of students; avoid labeling students as incapable nonlearners and as social outcasts; remove biases within the school  which impede positive youth development; provide an opportunity for students to make a transition from the alternative program to the regular program; provide the opportunity for vocational training or work experience during their high school careers; and provide alternatives among the elective courses that will provide a wide range of interdisciplinary experiences.

        "author":["Scandura, Joseph M."],
        "description":"In a study of mathematics learning, taking a rule-oriented approach, students were taught to trade objects of type A for objects of types B and C. Children ranging from ages 7 to 9 were given rules for converting A to B and B to C and were then presented with the task of converting A to C. Of the 30, 6 succeeded. Of the 24 who failed, half were taught via a higher order rule to link arbitrary pairs of compatible rules. The other 12 pupils were not given this training. Then, all of the students were presented with a new pair of compatible rules for converting A to B and B to C. Finally, they were presented with a corresponding A to C task. The results showed that all of the students who received training succeeded whereas not one of the other students did so. The results, it is  stated, indicated that knowing the components of a solution (rule) for a task is not sufficient. Integrating components is accomplished by applying higher order rules to lower order ones (e.g., component rules). Component rules and higher order rules, although behaviorally sufficient for problem solving, are not logically sufficient. Presumably, it is asserted, the learner must have some innate capability which tells him when and how the various rules are to be used in attacking a problem. With regard to the last point, an innate mechanism which is basic to a structural learning theory is then discussed. (Author/JM)",

Woodson Senior High School. This program is a third year continuation of the program initiated in 1972-73. The original 300 students entering as 10th graders in 1972-73 have continued in the program and are now in their senior year. The third year program was expected to complete the development of pilot experiences for staff and students alike in the development and implementation of individualized programs. The current year program was designed to be conducted in four phases described in the project proposal: Articulation and Planning  Session, Implementation of the Little School Component, School-Year Workshop and Staff Development, and Evaluation and Redesign. Phases 2-4 were in effect concurrently from the beginning of the 1974-75 academic year while Phase 1 was conducted during the summer of 1974. The results of the evaluation discussed here are considered to clearly indicate support for the Little School Component's achievement of its goals, particulary in the areas of developing a viable program of individualized instruction and in creating a positive atmosphere for learning.

Furthermore, the intent is to isolate areas of variation in what is seemingly common operation and by means of adjustment, whether it be in the form of calculation or definition, provide for decision makers that data which may be compared. The school systems included are seven large city school systems with characteristics similar to those of the public schools of the District of Columbia. The eight systems reported are: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Cleveland, Milwaukee, St. Louis, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. The study began in August 1974 with requests to each of the  participants for copies of school system and city budgets for fiscal years 1974 and 1975. The report is organized into four substudies, each dealing with a major area of high priority interest to the public schools of the District of Columbia. Expenditures per pupil, the subject of Substudy 1, and staffing, the subject of Substudy 2, are key indicators of the level and allocation of resources within each school system. Substudy 3, dealing with special education, and Substudy 4, dealing with capital outlay programs, look at two specific areas of importance in current planning and budget efforts. (Author/JM)",

Special attention will be devoted to examining the relative effectiveness of \"standardized\" versus \"individualized\" instructional programs. The stated purpose of this report is: (1) to develop a conceptual framework within which a meaningful comparison of individualized versus standardized instruction can be made; (2) to identify specific variables which need to be assessed; and (3) to develop and describe specific procedures which should be used in gathering, analyzing, and reporting the results of the research effort. It is proposed that, rather than attempting to sample schools with uniformly \"individualized\"  or \"standardized\" programs, the sampling procedure should involve a deliberate and systematic attempt to sample programs which vary as widely as possible on different dimensions of individualization. The primary sampling unit should be classrooms. The central concern of the research should be the accurate description of what is being implemented rather than how well, and a careful evaluation of how those processes affect student outcomes. The analysis and interpretation of the study should be directed toward providing guidelines and recommendations for policy information, and therefore should focus on program variables (and not merely the programs).

The subjects of the study were kindergarten through grade two children who received compensatory education during the 1972-73 school year. Three questions are addressed: (1) What are the interrelationships of pupil attitudes toward school at the end of the school year and selected other pupil, program, teacher, and school district factors? (2) Does attitude toward school, pre-test reading level, reading test gain, extent of school district disadvantagement, and cost of the compensatory program vary when the data are grouped  according to the grade promotion status of the pupil, the emphasis of the compensatory instruction provided, the size of the group in which the pupil received compensatory instruction, or the specialized background of his compensatory teacher? and, (3) What is the value of using the School Sentiment Index on a year-end basis for pupil, school district, and statewide evaluation purposes? It was concluded that one major value of the School Sentiment Index lies in using it to interpret group scores of young children for compensatory education evaluation purposes. Several limitations of the study, along with definitions of terms, are provided. Results for each question are described in detail. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"Economists have studied the effects of racial prejudice on urban residential structure using a set of models that focus on conditions at the border between the black and white areas. This paper reviews the theoretical literature on these border models and investigates their generality. Section 1 considers the border model developed by Bailey in 1959 and shows that without substantially stronger assumptions than are made in its original statement, this model is internally inconsistent as an equilibrium model of residential structure. Section 2 considers a general equilibrium border model developed independently by Courant (1973) and Rose-Ackerman (1975) and briefly summarizes it. These two models are amended to allow for the possibility of differences in income between and within  the racial groups in Section 3. Section 4 presents the implications of these findings for the appropriateness of border models and makes suggestions for alternative ways of modeling the effect of racial prejudice on urban structure. The main result derived in the paper is that border models are logically inconsistent without unrealistic assumptions either about the incomes of blacks relative to the incomes of whites or about the extent of white prejudice. The paper concludes with several suggestions for more satisfactory modeling of prejudice and urban structure. (Author/AM)",

Three topics are investigated: (1) whether a person intended to quit (a person's intention to quit); (2) whether or not a person actually quit his job; and (3) whether or not a person was laid off. The outcome of these events is analyzed in relation to income derived from the job and the education, age, marital status, and number of children of the job-holder. It is hypothesized that if job shifts represent an interplay between personal characteristics and structural opportunities, then occupational discrimination toward blacks should be reflected in the job shifts blacks undertake. Results demonstrate a pattern where blacks are systematically disadvantaged in their income attainment  process in relation to whites. It is shown that while blacks and whites form their intention to quit in much the same way, actual quits and lay-offs take place according to very different mechanisms for blacks and whites.

        "description":"This study manipulates the variables of children's ethnicity, sex, and ability to ascertain the nature of the interaction relationship between teacher expectancies and student performance. The subjects were urban teachers who were asked to read case histories and then rate the child on a Likert-type family and pupil behavior rating form and a modified Osgood semantic differential scale. In addition, each subject completed a revised F scale of 30 items to assess each subjects' degree of prejudice. Analysis of the ratings given by the 386 teachers confirms the premise that the interactions between teachers' expectancies and students' performance is more complex than originally expected; the variables of ability, sex, ethnicity and prejudice of teachers were found to be of  importance in understanding these interactions. It is further concluded that the global ratings of the Osgood semantic differential scale are more powerful in recording the differential ratings of the teachers than are the particular judgments of the family and pupil behavior rating form. The third conclusion is that low ability students are the particular group of students who are \"victimized\" by the ratings of the high prejudice teachers. These findings suggest the need for administrators to be aware of their staff's prejudices, particularly as they interact with low ability students of minority status. They also suggest the need for retraining of teachers who are prejudicial or the assignment of them to schools where they do not come into contact with low ability minority students.  (Author/AM)",

This was accomplished by investigating the relationship between academic efficiency (e.g., selective cognitive and non-cognitive measures) and persistence (e.g., time spent in college); (b) establishing base rates of learner behaviors for each grade level for selected predictor and criterion measures; and, (c) investigating the relationship between academic efficiency and academic success criteria. The design of the study is based on two premises: that academic efficiency is related to persistence, and that it is also related  to success. Predictors used are academic efficiency measures and biographic data, while criteria used are persistence measures and academic success measures. Major results and conclusions based are: (1) upper classmen perform more efficiently than lower classmen on the measures selected for inclusion in the study, leading to the acceptance that academic efficiency is related to persistence; (2) positive but weak relationships exist between individual academic efficiency measures; (3) relationships between persistence and sex, type of high school diploma, and ethnicity do not exist.

Student development comparisons are made between a group attending Metro and a control group, both randomly chosen from a pool of volunteers who wanted to attend Metro. The major organization changes implemented were: (1) the development of student-teacher relationships based on dialogue and noncompartmentalization; (2) freeing students from conventional school restrictions on personal functioning; (3) use of community-based learning experiences in the educational program; and (4) an increase in the variety of  learning options available to students. The study revealed complex problems of social process in implementing such organizational innovations that have significant policy implications. Basic differences were found among six student subgroups in their perception of and participation in the program. Multiple methods converge which are considered to indicate that the aspects of the Metro experience valued most positively by students as compared with the conventional high school experience are humanistic interpersonal relationships with teachers and fellow students.

At a time of fiscal accountability, the Pennsylvania prototype shows how the cooperative efforts and coordination of activities of two organizations can be combined into an organized attack upon a critical social problem. The five features unique to the Pennsylvania approach include a program that is cooperative, universal, accessible, progressive, and responsive. An important component in the long-range  educational plan is that educational opportunities are planned in 20 off-campus centers for all persons within the State who work with older adults. Minimal cost has enabled more paraprofessionals and volunteer workers to attend. Students deciding to matriculate may transfer short-term training and work experience into credit hours. Likewise, with increasing education, persons can change occupations within an agency or transfer among service provision agencies. The 1974 training plan included three workshops on Normal Aging, Aging Problems, and Alternatives to Institutionalization, with a strong evaluation component planned for the series. (EA)",

Various types of model programs emerged around the country. One type is the State-recognized consortium (University of Michigan and Wayne State University) while a second type is the interdisciplinary and diffused model (University of Chicago). Other types are the center entity model (University of Southern California), the single program model (Washington University, St. Louis), and the functional program orientation model for smaller colleges and universities. Future projections indicate a need for the continuance of multiple models, strong State-oriented programs, and functional, informal  consortiums. The establishment of a National Institute on Aging is expected momentarily, with the Administration on Aging moving toward a role of being a Federal clearinghouse on aging for all Federal funds. State units on aging can currently benefit from the amended Older American's Act. The primary goals of the recently formed Association for Gerontology in Higher Education (AGHE) is helping to formulate national policy on gerontological training/education. An example of AGHE effectiveness was Congressional restoration of $6.5 million for university-based gerontological training/education. (EA)",

Site A was a State-operated facility for psychiatric in-patient care, accommodating 2,000 patients, with emphasis on maintenance and general patient welfare. Site B, a former State-operated custodial care facility with 100 beds, placed emphasis on diagnosis and assessment for subsequent placement in nursing/boarding residences and patients' homes. Thirty trainees at each institution were selected non-randomly by the institutional directors for the training program promoting patient independence. The first training phase consisted of the presentation of environmental therapy principles in 18 two-hour sessions  (lecture, discussion, role playing, audiovisual materials, and small group problem-solving sessions). Two pre- and post-measures, a Negative Attitude Toward Old Age Score and an Assessment of Hospital Score, were used at both institutions. The results of pre/post comparison on the Assessment of Hospital Score showed significant differences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the training program in changing trainees' assessments of direct patient care and of their hospital environment in general. The principles of milieu therapy appear to be sufficiently useful to institutional geriatric service providers to warrant continued dissemination. (EA)",

The Gerontology Manpower Project is recommending a client or consumer-oriented approach, as evidenced by project research. Four participant groups of institutional geriatric mental health workers, representing various sections of the State, were identified. An environmental therapy program was presented to one group, while the other three groups received basic gerontology information; two of the groups received an expanded program. Evaluation relied on pre- and post-testing for attitude changes and increased knowledge, subjective reactions of  trainees and trainers, and agency assessments. Two factors which were predictors of change were the agency's philosophy of aging as it affects care for the aged and the degree of structure existing in the organization/agency. Interpretation of the results led project staff to believe that some degree of structure is needed for trainees to implement new learning and new approaches. The individual trainee needs to be considered in relationship to the job performed and the institutional setting and needs to be actively involved in determining the training objectives and training process.

The training attempted to provide participants with a clearer understanding of the implication of visual and hearing loss in the elderly and to encourage more positive attitudes and empathy toward their client population. The three-hour training module consisted of lecture, film, discussion, and simulation. Participants were over 300 women, 18-74 years, working in institutions, agencies, or community programs as institutional staff, agency workers, and interested volunteers. Using a non-equivalent control group design, the  program was evaluated for content effectiveness and techniques of adult instruction. Pre- and post-testing was conducted to measure knowledge gain and attitude change. Although complete data analysis is in process, there appears to be a definite indication that older people began the training with a more negative view of aging than younger groups in all categories of attitudes. For all age groups, training seemed to change attitudes concerning stereotyping in a more positive direction. However, training also resulted in higher anxiety about aging in all age groups. (EA)",

        "description":"The purpose of the special project, operated by the City Board of Education (Huntsville, Alabama), was to perfect a career decision-making model that could be used by Adult Basic Education (ABE) teachers to help the disadvantaged adult upgrade himself educationally and to make a realistic career decision based on his and his family's personal value system. Career counselors trained the ABE teachers in the use of the career decision-making model, using preservice, inservice, and on-the-job training. The teacher and the counselor worked with adult learners in developing the thinking processes needed for career decision making. The document explains in detail the adult career decision-making processes and provides an example of a career decision-making chart, briefly describing each  of the 18 points on the chart. Also discussed are the four counseling techniques used: (1) behavioral techniques, (2) educational media, (3) group techniques, and (4) vocationally oriented curriculum. The remainder of the document consists of lists of materials: an annotated bibliography covering occupational information, job search, and study guides for job entry; local community resources; and an annotated list of tests useful in counseling adult learners.

A community health program's general goal is to assist individuals and communities in identifying and meeting their health problems. In order to accomplish this goal the American Public Health Association has developed general objectives for future planning. Further, an understanding of the concept of basic human needs as it is related to community health programs is essential to a health program. The resolution of community health problems can be facilitated by understanding and dealing with the five processes (planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, and controlling) required for effective administration. Any  program to be effective and efficient must be accountable for six program aspects: prevention, detection, appraisal, treatment, rehabilitation, and evaluation. With these program objectives, processes, and aspects in mind the eight procedures (establishing goals, clarifying goals, restating program goals in official written form, developing an action plan, establishing enabling objectives, collecting materials and resources, establishing evaluation criteria, and relating to program goals) should be utilized in implementing a health program that is relevant to human and community needs. With all these elements functioning properly health programs can expect success. (Author/BP)",

        "description":"An analysis of the Chicago businessmen's Association of Commerce's great influence in the public high schools, 1914-25, reveals Americanization and labor control as primary goals. The association organized and operated a vocational guidance bureau and three important high school clubs. A concerted enrollment effort netted the membership of roughly two-thirds of Chicago's students by 1920. Given a free hand in the schools by the superintendent, the association held direct control of the clubs' ideologies and activities through a centrally devised program which the schools' faculties carried out. A press club controlled the content of school newspapers. Original club objectives, civic pride, and community involvement faded before the major emphasis: sympathy and respect for the  businessman's role and position. The Federation of Labor noted the association's motives; it argued that the close affiliation between the public school and the employers violated democracy, and that the psychological influence was worse than open and direct capitalist propaganda. The clubs were organized to fit the student into a classist, racist society; the association's vocational guidance counseled students to adopt the businessman's stereotype of the lower working class immigrant; and economic and political values were taught which would stablize the economy to guarantee continued profits.

The questionnaire was sent to social service agency personnel holding at least a bachelor's degree and performing or administering social services; the individuals were identified through agency liaison persons. Total response was 196 of 244, or 80 percent. The findings of the needs assessment research, contained in the brief document, offer apparent evidence of the need to develop a first year graduate program for the area. The findings clearly indicate that the personnel surveyed would participate in such a program. They are appropriately qualified in terms of professional  experience and grade point averages. Their preference is to take evening courses; a majority, in fact, would enroll in two courses per quarter. On the whole, they would finance this education by themselves. The findings were submitted to the Jane Addams School of Social Work at Chicago Circle Campus (University of Illinois) with intentions of continuing the effort toward program delivery. (Author/AJ)",

It contains information about the legislative and regulatory framework for Section 131 (a) of Part C Research Program, as stated in the Vocational Education Amendments of 1968 Act. Five research priority areas were determined: (1) administration of vocational education at the State level; (2) administration of vocational education at the local level; (3) comprehensive systems of guidance, counseling, placement, and follow-through services; (4) educational personnel serving the educationally disadvantaged, handicapped, and minorities; and (5) curriculum, demonstration, and installation studies. The processes used to  implement the award program are outlined, and the award outcomes are discussed in terms of an overview of the purposes and expected results of the funded projects. A total of 361 applications were received for consideration. Synthesis papers are presented for the priority areas with the exception of the fourth. Abstracts are included for all funded projects, arranged by priority area (22 in State level administration, 16 in local level administration, 19 in guidance and counseling, 17 in administration for the handicapped and minorities, and 12 in curriculum) and for eight special projects of national significance.

Two programs that are parts of the CODAP system are described: the Ordering of Hierarchically Grouped Case Data (KPATH) program which reorders case data permitting identification of background variables having similar values for all or most cases in the group and enabling the generation of composite job descriptions for any hierarchical group; and the Print KPATH (PRKPTH) program which produces a printed report of case data elements for any selected background variables from an input-ordered or KPATH-ordered history data tape. The report discusses the application of these programs with supporting diagrams,  tables, charts, and examples.

Some aspects of instructional innovations are discussed based on the responses gained from the national survey, particularly the responses of 78 local supervisors directly involved with high school programs. Business education has become an important part of the general education of students and more courses in this area are being offered. To meet employment needs of various industries new courses are being taught on word processing, micrographics, reprographics, electronic calculators, and data processing. Job training for students in some schools is being achieved through simulation,  block-time patterns, and performance-based business education. Changes in business education curriculum have also been the result of greater emphasis now being placed on career education, human relations in business, metrication, recordkeeping, vocational youth organizations, and individualizing teaching and learning. The discussion of these changes in business education is supported with brief descriptions of actual high school programs. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"The report is a study of the utility of social reinforcement for improving Air Force training. It was conducted through a field evaluation of social incentive instructional systems which would serve to improve student motivation, classroom performance, and attitudes. The participants included a total of 300 trainees from two Air Force bases; 25 instructors were involved, two of whom participated in two experimental treatments. Data were collected on performance records, instructor evaluation, and trainee attitudes. The experimental treatments attempted to increase the incidence of student leadership behaviors and included the Baseline Control Condition, the Leader Attitude Training System, the Leader Recognition System, and the Classroom Behavior Development System (CBDS). The  activities, covering a period of approximately three months, are described for each experimental system. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess their impact. The general finding was that none of the classroom social leadership systems had any important positive or negative effect on block examination scores, on completion time, on trainee attitudes, or on instructors' assessment of student performance. The CBDS had a positive effect on student attitudes toward fellow trainees. Twenty-two tables supplement the discussion. Appendixes (132 pages) present the instructors manuals used in the four intervention systems and additional tabulated data. (Author/EC)",

A sample of graduates from Lousiiana high schools in the period 1956-65 was selected. A multiple choice questionnaire was mailed to 4,700 graduates with a 3,035 return of which 2,895 forms were completed (1,383 males and 1,513 females). Data were sought on the high school experiences, postsecondary education or training, and employment experiences of graduates, and on the relevance of high school experiences to later experiences. The findings from the questionnaire focus on 32 areas and are discussed and analyzed item-by-item, with 37 supporting tables. Conclusions and recommendations based on the study are presented, and it is suggested  that they might provide useful information for educators concerned with the planning and development of high school programs that would meet the particular needs of high school students. A 171-item bibliography is included. Comments and suggestions offered by respondents, the participating parishes and guidance counselors, and the questionnaire used for the study are appended. (EC)",

Differences in earnings functions among smaller, homogeneous labor markets are examined in terms of urban and regional location and black and white individuals. Aggregate statistics about the structure of earnings, characteristics of earnings functions, regional variations in earnings, and black-white differentials are analyzed; 10 tables supplement the discussion. Conclusions state the estimated effect of schooling and ability differences is low, with an additional year of schooling worth about 5 percent  higher income and one decile move in the AFQT score matched by 1 percent increase in earnings for whites, lower for blacks. The estimation of separate earnings functions for labor markets across the country is significant, with the choice of region for employment often equivalent to the marginal earnings of several years of schooling. Racial difference in earnings stems from differences in the earning functions for blacks and whites, not in schooling, ability, or experience levels. Sample and population characteristics are discussed in the appendix. The nonrepresentative character of the sample is emphasized. (LH)",

Three major assumptions which form the basis for CBE are: (1) an educational program should prepare the student with competencies to effectively do the job he is learning to do; (2) an educational program should make the best use of all resources; and (3) an educational program should be designed, developed, implemented, and revised by management approaches which effectively and efficiently operate all of the various parts of the program in concert. Occupational competency may be classified as skill oriented or process oriented. Personal attributes complement the training of an occupational  competency. The preparation of statements for competencies requires more detailed descriptive statements to help others understand what is meant when the competency statement is used. Four sources for identifying competencies for any given occupation include job performance, analysis of job description, product analysis, and consensus.

        "description":"Analyzing the changing needs of young people today can be helpful in designing future nutrition education programs. Studies indicate that 40 percent of today's 18-26 year olds have considerably different values/attitudes from past values/attitudes. Technology may determine what is possible, but values and attitudes determine what people will accept. The influence of three major value-teaching institutions, the family, church, and school, has been changing in recent years. Changing family influences include the impact of preschool education, increased numbers of young people leaving home to attend college, and the increased number of working mothers. Decline of the influence of institutionalized religion is reflected in 1971 Gallup surveys of decreased church attendance. Two  important changing school influences are the analytical teaching approaches and a new breed of teachers representing a broader spectrum of society than previous groups of middle class teachers. Among numerous other influences are television, the trend toward life simplification, and the growth of consumerism. A relevant, challenging nutrition education curriculum is needed from preschool to adulthood, with greatest emphasis at the elementary level. Professionals must serve as catalysts to make nutrition education basic to school curriculum design and an integral part of teacher training. (EA)",

        "description":"The harmonizing of occupational development with academic learning is not a passing fad. A primary aim of early 17th-18th century colleges was to supply regions with knowledgeable professional workers. The functional role of education continued to remain strong, as evidenced by the Morrill Act in 1862. The Smith-Hughes Act (1916), however, was an instrument of divisiveness separating the academic and vocational. The Vocational Education Act of 1963 gave new impetus toward reconciling general and vocational education . Its amendments provided many of the major dimensions for career education as did the Educational Amendments of 1972 and 1974. The College Board has responded to evolving laws and practices by providing and offering new dimensions of testing. Currently, the College  Board is conducting a study that will include a listing of existing effective career education linkage systems in States, an identification and analysis of the most critical linkage areas, models of career education delivery systems, successful implementation approaches, and legislative recommendations. In conclusion, the career education movement needs liberal arts defenders and vocational/occupational development specialists; the labor/business/ industry community; Federal leadership; and the leadership of teachers, professors, and students.

The object was to inculcate and improve reading skills among 25 percent of the American population who either lacked or were deficient in them. Has this goal been at least half-way attained? Midway through the 1970's it must be admitted that the goal has not been realized at all. In fact, there is every indication that the situation is actually more severe than was initially posed, and the gaps between readers and nonreaders may actually be widening. The crux of the reading failure syndrome lies in the creation of &quot;conditions for reading&quot; or a &quot;reading environment,&quot; implying a need for organized intervention among population groups not attending schools  (parents and preschool children). Parents, who must require reading skills in order to function and who are the pivotal factors in the creation of home environments, are those most neglected by organized reading instruction efforts. Reading instruction within the framework of recurrent education is the theme expounded. The target remains vitally desirable; the remedies are in need of alteration. With a fresh look at strategies, &quot;Right-to-Read&quot; is attainable. (Author/AJ)",

The bonding program provides fidelity bonding for individuals who are normally excluded from insurance policy bonding, including ex-offenders, enabling them to work at jobs for which they would be otherwise ineligible. The program's origins began with the passage of the Manpower Development and Training Act in 1962, with subsequent legislation authorizing the bonding program in 1965. An analysis of program design includes the adoption of the basic program and administrative structure, eligibility criteria, development of a procurement document, the United Bonding Insurance Company's bid, and the  negotiation of a contract. Program implementation is traced from the initial site selection through development of reporting systems, expansion to the status of a national program, modification, legislative developments, and funding. Appended materials take up approximately half of the report and contain historical documents, including excerpts from the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962, Department of Labor documents, materials from State and local employment services offices, and an article on the Federal Bonding Program.

The book is designed to motivate teachers to include career education as part of their classroom techniques and content and to provide illustrations and examples to implement career education. Interspersed throughout the book are sections of various classroom activities and related occupational information. Individual chapters link career education to mathematics; English; social studies; visual arts; foreign languages; and health sciences, recreation, and physical education. Today's  science teacher is faced with developing a scientifically literate population and meeting society's increased need for scientific technicians. Career education in mathematics tends to reinforce and motivate mathematical learning, and English communications skills are vital for work and leisure, while both social studies and career education have intimately related objectives. Career education in art emphasizes the broad functions of a wide variety of occupations; effective career education development in foreign languages implies close contact with guidance personnel. Reorganization of physical education into three separate disciplines has increased the opportunities for career education. (EA)",

Students were randomly assigned to one of the following: a Pre-Driver Licensing (PDL) course (instruction in the minimum requirements for a license), Safe Performance Curriculum (SPC), or a control group (no formal instruction). Intermediate criterion measures of performance, knowledge, skill, and attitude were administered to students in the first two groups. Program effects were measured in terms of curriculum (SPC versus PDL), sex and scholastic achievement level. Evaluation of knowledge and performance  measures indicated a general trend toward higher scores by the SPC students, by students in the upper half of their class, and by male students. Recommendations are for further revision of the intermediate criterion measures and for a followup study.

Trends influencing the demand for professional home economics are presented. The trends involve: growth of the labor market, opportunities in industry and business, the growth of consumerism, the need for services including day care, the need for higher education (especially for doctoral and master's degree graduates), and the increase in the number of graduates. The career outlook for graduates in nine speciality areas is detailed. These areas are (1) business, communications, journalism; (2) child development, family  relations; (3) extension, welfare, community service; (4) foods-nutrition, dietetics; (5) housing, equipment, home management, family economics; (6) home economics education; (7) institutional, hotel, restaurant management; (8) environmental art, interior design; and (9) textiles-clothing merchandising.

It examines the methodology employed and the scope of analysis in nearly 400 forecasts made in the period 1965-73. It assesses the adequacy of the theoretical and empirical knowledge base for forecasting in three analytic areas: the forecasting of sector outputs, the estimation of human resource input requirements, and limitations of occupational classification systems in specifying the relationship between manpower requirements and supply systems. The study concludes that the major limitation on the current state of the art is conceptual and institutional, and improvements in the knowledge base are not sufficient to policy needs.

Not causal factors, limiting variables simply place some boundaries on students' educational and career futures. Information about the educational background, future plans, parental economic status, and other factors which influence students' decisions was gathered through an American College Testing Program (ACT) 121-item questionnaire administered to a 10 percent random sample of Kentucky high school juniors and seniors in 1973.  The results of the survey data analysis are reported and discussed with reference to each of the two types of decisions. The decision to enter postsecondary education was found to be related to: students' high school curriculum program, their high school average, their expected postsecondary education cost, and their family's annual income. The many findings concerning relationships of factors limiting the institution-choice decision include the discovery of wide disparities between expected and actual costs of postsecondary education, and between expected and computed parental contribution.

Standards and a rating scale developed by the author to evaluate and compare consumer education programs and curriculum guides are presented and subsequently applied to several programs and guides; the criteria are based on the author's personal experience and on recommendations from experts as expressed in the literature. Consumer education programs are evaluated in four areas: implementation, involvement, pupil exposure, and instructional program. Curriculum guides are rated according to their implementation suggestions, rationale and general  objectives, content, and resource materials. The standards require meaningful ideas that are broad enough to be used in a variety of situations, as well as specific content and resources. The selected consumer education programs evaluated with reference to the criteria are Lincoln High School, in Yonkers, New York, and the Westborough and Newburyport, Massachusetts, public schools. Only partial use of the instrument was made, as the evaluations were based only on written program descriptions. The curriculum guides evaluated are the New York Department of Education's and the President's Committee Guidelines. (Author/AJ)",

Two seven-skill level specialties within the career field, General Accounting (67131/51) and Disbursement Accounting (67133/53), were studied. Research methodology involved three phases: (1) occupational analysis of two previous job inventory studies of the two specialties, including a job inventory by job incumbents and work experience information regarding supervisors; (2) identification of task importance by supervisors, with supervisors rating tasks in the area where they had the most experience; and (3) evaluation of  supervisory career work experience in journeyman-level tasks. Results indicate that the present accounting and finance management structure may be too broad for a supervisor to gain sufficient experience on all required work activities. A system of career work area rotation of assignments is suggested as possibly leading to improved career development of the supervisors. Five tables supplement the discussion and extensive data regarding the percentage of career work experience on desirable journeyman-level tasks is appended. (LH)",

Data were drawn from annual surveys, beginning in 1966, of the entire entering freshman classes at a national sample of higher education institutions and from followup studies, at subsequent intervals, of smaller subsamples of the same students. The growing popularity of the health fields of study, gains and losses in specific fields, and the impact of changing enrollment patterns are described. Health career aspirants are compared to nonhealth aspirants, and trends in the characteristics of health aspirants over a six-year period are identified. Patterns associated with stability in, recruitment to, and defection from a major in the health fields are focused on in reference to health majors. A final  section profiles aspirants to specific health careers (physicians, dentists, nurses, laboratory technicians, and therapists) with emphasis on those who planned to become physicians. The report concludes that such factors as demographic attributes, socioeconomic backgrounds, academic ability, self-image, values, and institutional characteristics play an influential role in student choices of probable major, actual major, career, and specialty within a career.

MISOE sought to combine three large data sets (a census data system, a longitudinal sample data system, and an ex post facto data set) on a single computer with interactive capability, bringing to the policymakers' fingertips a range of psychological, economic, and demographic data and providing them with a knowledge base for &quot;parametizing&quot; forecast models. Designed primarily for secondary education, the system is considered to be generalizeable to postsecondary and adult education. MISOE  developed and/or organized a substantial number of tools required to implement a comprehensive management information system; the paper describes these and cites sources for full documentation. The guide assumes familiarity with the general MISOE structure in its references. (Author/AJ)",

Chapter 3 briefly outlines the important information types of the census data systems which provide minimum information for statewide management of occupational education. The sample data systems which provide information necessary for policy development are presented in chapter 4. The economics of public investment in education and MISOE cost analysis systems are  discussed in chapter 5. Chapter 6 describes interactive computing systems and the flexibility of MISOE data files. Interacting with MISOE data, operations, and output indices is the subject of chapter 7. Planning for occupational education using MISOE is dealt with in chapter 8. Educational policy and system dynamics are described in chapter 9. The final chapter offers assessments of MISOE from the professional perspectives of a State manager of occupational education, an educational researcher, and an economist. A two-page reference list and brief notes about the 10 contributors conclude the journal. (Author/MS)",

Informal discussions with the directors of several occupational schools in Massachusetts provided the base for the model. Intended as a tool for educational managers, to stimulate new thinking about policies and practices, the model can be described in precise mathematical terms, so that computer simulation can be used to test various policies and hypotheses. Not a detailed description of any single program, the discussion emphasizes aspects of all such programs important for an understanding of any single program. The model is experimented with, using different potential employment curves, and the  response is shown for each of three possibilities. The study is framed in the system dynamics methodology of Jay W. Forrester, explained in the appendix, where a precise mathematical formalization of the assumptions discussed is given. (Author/AJ)",

The types and purposes of the census and sample data to be collected and maintained are described. The descriptive data (input information,  process information, product information, and impact information) and analytical data (cost accounting information, process product data, cost product information, product impact information, process impact data, and cost impact data) included in the sample data system are discussed at length, defining each type and showing how each data type is related to the census.

The IPPI model is designed (1) to provide a structure for integrated State and local decision-making within occupational education and for decision-related descriptive information which accounts for reality by decision types within the model, and (2) to provide a framework for analysis of relationships between inputs and process with product and impact. The system also permits decision-makers to simulate the interactive effects of the total system over time. The model describes the totality of occupational education; links to the larger world occur with input and impact. The paper establishes some  differentiations, distinctions, and definitions, and thereby provides a structure for project development which not only stipulates developmental tasks, but ties consultants and staff to development in a functional way. Eight tasks are described in the paper, related to space differentiations, variable selection, instrumentation, the sample, the information system, analysis types, simulation, and other information needs. The final section of the paper suggests an integrated procedure for task development, including a schedule for the planning conference. (Author/AJ)",

Part 1 presents the need; Part 2 develops a schema for classifying process variables (human, physical, and organizational); their interactive nature is reflected in a dual classification system which enables users to get at process variable information in two ways: each variable in the process space is referenced by a causal decisional factor and a learning-occurrence factor. A total of four hierarchical process levels (State, and three local levels) are identified for discussions of these factors. In summary, the process space is conceived of as an interactive two-dimensional entity divided vertically into three columns of process factors and  horizontally into four hierarchical levels. In Part 3, the use of a numbering system for process space is explained, and in Part 4, a system is suggested for classifying and storing process information. An index to be compiled for users of the system, for retrieval of process information, is described in Part 5. Most information contained in the model will be provided by a representative sample of vocational education shcools and programs; census data will also be included, minimally. (Author/AJ)",

Finally, the MEII asks permission of the respondent to contact his or her supervisor on the current or most  recently held job and to provide the name and address of that supervisor. The supervisors are contacted by way of the second impact instrument, the Massachusetts Job Evaluation Inventory (MJEI). This two-page form seeks some information about the rater and asks for a job rating of the former student in general and specific terms.

        "description":"The publication describes the process by which a portion of the Management Information System for Occupational Education (MISOE) Census Data System (CDS) was field-tested in a sample of six Massachusetts schools. It is intended to provide guidelines for those who will be responsible for the planning of statewide implementation of the fully developed Census Data System. Transcripts of the presentations and discussions among MISOE and school staffs at an introductory presentation, in a workshop, during an individual contact, and during a data collection experience comprise a large part of the document. The workshop transcript includes instructions for reporting information in the CDS terminal objectives (TERMOB) Fall reporting booklets. These instructions applied only to  experimental reporting booklets used in the CDS Fall Report field test and are not necessarily in the sequence required by the final version of the Fall Report, as the intent of the document is to provide only a basis from which a full-scale plan for workshops may be modeled, not to provide a step-by-step process applicable to the Fall Report as developed. An outline of the field test plan and visual aids which were utilized in the field test are included in the document. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"The document reports a pilot test of the feasibility of the MISOE Census Data System (CDS) for estimating the costs of individual programs in a regional vocational school setting. The test determined that the data collection forms can be completed by a regional vocational school but that they can be simplified, and the costs of individual programs can be determined from the data collected. As the system is structured to be applicable to all schools offering occupational programs, this determination implies that per-pupil costs for individual programs would be available to school managers within-school analysis and between-schools comparisons, and, used with program evaluation data, would provide a basis for cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness studies to be conducted on an  operational scale. The balance of the report is directed to describing the mechanics of estimating the costs of individual occupational programs in a typical regional vocational school and is supplemented with general discussions of analyses of program costs and implementation alternatives. Fifteen pages of tables are appended. (Author/AJ)",

In order to meet this objective, the job classification plan of the Altadena (California) Library District was examined. A theoretical discussion of the principles, methodology, and techniques of job analysis as it applies to job classification is presented. Important in the process is determining what the worker does and the level and difficulty of the work which determines the job requirements. An overview of the principles and techniques of position-classification are presented as a guide for formulating a job classification plan. The Altadena Library District represents  a typical case of how job classifications are developed in smaller public agencies that have limited funds and professional manpower to analyze the organization's positions. A critical analysis of the library's job classification plan concluded it was not a desirably effective instrument. Several specific and general recommendations are presented. A bibliography and glossary are included. Appended materials contain much of the data used in the position-classification performed on the Altadena Library District. (Author/EC)",

Subsections of the literature review include: enrollment trends, completion rates and factors, student profiles, comparisons of correspondence work to residence work, methods of presenting and conducting correspondence courses, and a partially annotated bibliography of cited references. The IMSSS study involved a selected number of highly gifted 10-14 year old students (with IQ  scores of at least 165 and a wide range of outside activities) from eight school districts surrounding Stanford University. The students participated in home-based teletypewriter courses in mathematical logic and related parts of mathematics, including programing courses, and an introductory Russian course. The high dropout rate of the gifted group was characteristic of high dropout rates of home-study courses. Further home-study evaluation is needed in course structure, the use of predictive student trajectories, and the costs of various technologies to alter the high dropout rates. (EA)",

It provides a means for giving current occupational information at a local level. The State of Michigan has made the VIEW project available to every junior and senior high school in the State with the participating schools responsible for providing their own microfilm readers and an implementor. The basic services provided by the State include two VIEW microfiche decks, an orientation filmstrip, newsletters, an inservice training session, and the VIEW handbook. The handbook contains samples of the collection's occupational information materials; self-exploration, career planning, career exploration,  and decision-making worksheets for use by counselors with students; and supportive classroom worksheets for use by teachers. Preference tests and occupational fact-finding exercises comprise most of the counselor's materials, while games such as scrambled words, 20 questions, and crosswords are representative of the collection of teacher's materials. The VIEW indexes, however, comprise the largest part of the handbook (66 pages). These indexes are alphabetical listings of job titles on which information is contained in the VIEW collection.

        "description":"There is an increasing need to prepare women for careers other than the traditional roles they have had in the past. Statistics referring to the occupational needs of women today and the lower position they hold in the labor market document this need. Women have tended to occupy positions in elementary and secondary schools, nursing and medical laboratory work, library science, and home economics. Changes in educational programs and school curriculum are necessary to increase the number of opportunities available for young women in choosing a career for themselves. For example, sports facilities should be equally available for both boys and girls; the choice of textbooks, especially in the lower grade levels, should avoid sex stereotypes; counseling for female students should  focus on their importance in the work force; and both sexes should be represented when outside resources are brought in the school. Suggestions to try new experiences outside the school through summer jobs can also provide new interests. School programs directed at increasing the awareness of female students regarding their place in the world of work should be encouraged so that they can have more control over their life decisions and plans.

The primary-level activities are intended to increase students' awareness of self and others; the intermediate-level activities emphasize awareness of occupations. Two page special education and remedial reading career education guides supplement recommended commercial materials by indicating very briefly, in the former, learning activities related to 10 occupational clusters; in the latter, activities related to farming and home-making. The section intended for use by junior high and high school  teachers is organized by academic or vocational education subject, with several career-related lesson suggestions offered for each. It assumes that only female students will be taking certain sections of the home economics curriculum. The concluding section lists the career education resources available to teachers in the school which produced the career education guide. The book also contains an outline of the career education responsibilities of the guidance counselor at each grade level from 7 to 12 and an overview of the vocational curriculum available in the area vocational-technical school.

The project was originally designed to test the effectiveness of a specialized form of instruction for specific groups (physically and mentally handicapped, the incarcerated, ethnic minorities, and other socioeconomically disadvantaged) and to demonstrate their instruction to agencies which serve these groups. To deliver these programs of entry-level skill training or vocational assessment and orientation, four mobile units dealing in business education, distributive education, small engine repair/auto tune-up, and vocational evaluation were utilized. An outline of the project's  10 major objectives and their status and disposition are presented. A third party evaluation was conducted to assess the productivity and effectiveness of the project in reaching and dealing with five distinct groups: corrections, retarded, handicapped, disadvantaged, and racial and ethnic minorities. The evaluation was uniformly quite favorable. A rationale for the continuation of the project's concepts and operation as a private non-profit organization are presented. Tables and charts supplement the discussion on the project's operations and activities. (Author/EC)",

Career education may be implemented with the use of three primary committee structures: (1) the steering committee, with district wide representation, provides an organizational structure that is responsive to community needs; (2) the building committee for each school building provides plans for the inservice training program; and (3) the  community advisory committee provides the school system with access to community resources.

It was found that 48 percent of the respondents were employed in the field of training, and also that part-time work experience as a student increased the related employment to 80 percent. Also revealed was that part-time work experience increased the percentage of students who sought additional education. The program aided 88 percent of the students in making career choices, and 79 percent felt prepared for all occupational experiences. A  high degree of job satisfaction was reported. The most frequent suggestion for course improvement was for more &quot;hands on&quot; experiences during class time. Overall, the program was found to be effective in meeting its objectives.

The literature supports the following conclusions: (1) all definitions of CRM stress score interpretation as representing what the individual can do relative to instructional objectives rather than other individuals; (2) criterion-referenced information is valuable  in making certain decisions based on what a person can do at a given point in the training cycle; (3) CRM has focused much attention on behavioral objectives and training outcomes; (4) behavioral objectives must be carefully written to effectively direct and measure instruction; (5) more than one measure should be used to validate any CRM to decrease the error associated with its measurement; (6) it is difficult to develop objective procedures necessary for CRM of complex behavior; (7) CRM supplements but should not replace normative tests in training; and (8) more research is needed before extensive use of CRM in instructional programs can be recommended.

The sample population included first and second generation Mexican-American secondary school students. A six-item questionnaire was administered to 720 students from one junior and one senior high school. The results were categorized according to 15 occupational clusters. A composite of all six grade levels showed the most desired careers seem to be in the areas of health, business and office, public service, environment, and communications and media. Upper grade students were more specific about careers. The largest number of students undecided about a career are in the 12th grade and the smallest in the 7th grade. It appears that a large portion of  the student population is not prepared to step into a career at graduation. In this community of relatively low economic status, the apparent need for a practical, realistic career education program is evident. Tables display the distribution of desired careers according to grade level, and the six-item questionnaire is appended. (Author/NJ)",

The report attempts a summary evaluative statement as to the impact of the project and the probable future of career education in the district. In spite of the difficulties encountered, some accomplishments were achieved. A fully developed and implemented placement service at the high school is in operation, curriculum development has become a high priority area in the district, and career education  instructional materials have been incorporated into the library system and are in use by classroom teachers. The major lesson learned in the course of the project was that too much effort was expended on program content and too little on the process of educational change.

        "description":"The project, conducted from June 1973 to December 1974, was designed to further the development of career education activities in Rhode Island. The goals and objectives of the project were as follows: (1) a synthesis of statewide and national information regarding career education models; (2) development of three model types focusing on the specific problems of urban, rural, and suburban settings; (3) establishment of a broad based advisory committee for the State; (4) a conference involving representatives from each local educational agency in Rhode Island; (5) a career education state of the art paper; and (6) three plans for the implementation of career education in local school districts. The body of the report explains in detail the procedures involved in carrying out the  project objectives. The third party independent evaluation entails both formative and summative analyses of the various process and product objectives. The method for collecting information for these analyses principally consisted of review and interview of project staff at critical stages. The conclusions are that through the activities of the project, career education awareness has reached business leaders and the public sector and more people have a better understanding and are more receptive to the concept. Appendixes, making up the body of the report, include instruments and products developed in the course of the project. (Author/NJ)",

It was designed to be compatible with high school graduation requirements and offer experiences related to postsecondary education that would lead to a paraprofessional or professional goal. The main features of the program were the \"hands-on\" experiences, career planning, and a broad educational foundation based on the student's career objectives. The activities were designed to provide the students with an understanding of careers related to the program offering, to introduce them to the personal and educational requirements of their choices, and to promote understanding and acceptance of their  abilities and aptitudes in light of future occupational aspirations. Field experience comprised a large part of the curriculum. The engineering segment of the program is touched on briefly (2 pages) while the body of the document (60 pages) consists of a curriculum guide of health occupation learning activities developed by the project. Organized into a 36-week continuum of second year activities, the curriculum materials outline developmental and behavioral objectives, student assignments, and activities designed to introduce the student to the varied career opportunities in the medical fields.

        "description":"While the Personalized System of Instruction introduced by Keller individualizes the college classroom, it may be impractical when time is limited by administrative rules, without modification. Having students pace themselves within a fixed academic time period usually leads to procrastination and cramming at the end of the semester/quarter. The present system attempted to correct the problem of cramming by providing students enrolled in a course in physiological psychology with &quot;self-charting forms&quot; to permit precise feedback early in the semester. It was found that emphasizing the use of the forms increased their effectiveness and adding point contingencies increased the effect still more. Sections of the course (which combined modified Keller elements with a point-token system  and a lecture-discussion classroom format) exposed to the contingencies did more early work in both qualitatively graded and ungraded categories, crammed less, and did better during chart-submission contingency intervals on instructor-paced, graded, objective exams. Student responses to course/instructor-evaluation forms were slightly superior as a result of the treatment. The system is simple to use. (Author)",

Subjects who were presented with validated counselor photographs representing the three ethnicities then assumed both administrative and personal problem situations and made counselor selections. Significant differences were found in student preference for Mexican American, Black, and White counselors for both problem situations. When provided a choice Mexican American, Black, and White students tended to prefer a counselor of their same ethnicity. In general, students also wanted to speak with a counselor of their same ethnicity more for the personal than the  administrative problem situations. The results clearly support the view that counselor ethnicity is perceived by students as a significant variable in counselor selection. (Author)",

The reading specialist then recommends that the classroom teacher individualize the student's reading program. The specialist provides appropriate materials and suggests teaching methods geared to the individual's specific reading problem. Often an aide or volunteer tutor works with individual students to  improve reading skills. Since several different approaches to instruction are used in the district, the student may be placed in a basal text classroom, a structured phonics classroom, or another type of classroom which meets the individual's needs. If the problem remains, the student is assigned to remedial classes of no more than three students. If the problems are multiple and severely handicapping, the student is placed in a special classroom. (RB/AIR)",

        "description":"This thesis explores some difficulties associated with the use of the cloze procedure, particularly in relation to the interpretation of an individual's score on a cloze test. Cloze tests were administered to 112 grade-six children in four schools. The results indicated that for the children in this study the easiest words to replace were those that are one syllable long, or articles, or conjunctions, or prepositions, or pronouns. It is suggested that there is likely to be considerable overlap between the expected scores for the independent and instructional reading levels. Some of the limitations of the study are discussed.

Nine teachers were selected for observation in each school; teachers filled out questionnaires, and principals were interviewed. Significant differences in favor of schools with high pupil achievement were found in teacher expectations for pupils, in teacher attitudes toward pupils, in the use of positive reinforcement, in the cognitive load of materials presented, and in a number of related variables. Principals in schools with high pupil achievement generally saw their teachers as more competent. Implications of these findings for further work on variables of teacher behavior are discussed.

The students come from several ethnic groups and are from low-income families in a small rural town. They represent various age groups, including adults returning to school after years of absence. Begun in 1971, the program consists of a series of individualized laboratory reading courses offered for credit by Wharton County (Texas) Junior College. The program is designed to assist the student in becoming a better reader by supplementing regular reading classes. Four semester-length courses focus successively on word attack skills, vocabulary development, and comprehension; critical reading and newspaper reading skills; various other study skills; increasing  speed and comprehension; and skimming and scanning and further work in critical reading skills. Each student takes a diagnostic exam and has an individualized reading program prepared by the reading specialist based on the results of the exam. The student then enters into a contract with the reading instructor, who establishes the guidelines for student objectives and responsibilities. (AIR/RB)",

The hypotheses were supported. It was concluded that a visual perceptual deficit is probably not a major factor in reading disability. (TS)",

A principal objective of an ideal teacher training situation would be to establish a vertical integration of the various types of exposure to reading both prior to and during contact in classrooms with children learning how to read. An integrated time frame competency development model includes elements of information, skill development, and application. The model must be evaluated to determine its construct validity and internal consistency. Validation of the competencies required of preservice teachers is important. Studies of teacher behavior have not been consistent. The trend is to define teaching competencies  in reading in terms of pupil performance in reading. An approach to the validation problems of a competency-based preservice reading education program being developed at Northwestern University consists of nine points concerning competency categories as hypotheses which must be exhaustively analyzed.

The following four basic systems are involved in the center's programs: a diagnostic system, in which each child, upon entering the school, is tested thoroughly by a reading guide to determine reading accomplishments, needs, and potential; a prescriptive system, developed by the professional staff using results of the diagnostic tests and including a variety of materials and activities; a staffing system, consisting of three kinds of  staff--directors (credentialed public school teachers), guides (one for every five children), and clerical workers; and a motivational system, using three methods of motivation--extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and positive environment. Results of posttesting of a random sample of children after two years show an overall positive growth pattern, with accelerated rates of growth showing an average increase of 25 percent in reading achievement.

Adults learning English as a second language might be taught by a language experience approach. Building upon the learners' experiences and needs will help them relate to the community and to their social roles. The orientation of a group of second language learners should be reflected in the curriculum and its philosophy and methodology. Current research suggests that children and adults learning English as a second language use common strategies and process linguistic data in fundamentally similar ways. While it is not appropriate to use the same teaching methods with  children and adults in a native language learning situation, some of the ideas that have worked with children learning a second language may be transferable to adults in the same situation. Various language tests and readability formulas are discussed. (LL)",

A pretest was administered to all of the children and then each child was grouped according to his or her needs. Two classes were involved in the study, one labeled control and the other experimental. In the experimental class the children were retested and regrouped according to their needs at three-week intervals. The children in the control class remained in the same groups throughout the program. At the end of the study a t-test was used to compare gain scores of both groups. The results of this study support the hypothesis that children in a continuous regrouping program will achieve greater success in  performing reading readiness skills than those who are exposed to a non-regrouping program. Although both groups made significant progress, the gain scores of the experimental group were considerably higher than those of the control group. Based on the findings of this study, and from the findings of previous research, it is recommended that this method of grouping be implemented in other kindergarten classrooms. (Author)",

Functional literacy is defined here as the use of the mechanics of reading for different information purposes. A test battery was administered to 2600 students in grades six through twelve. The test battery was intended to represent a sample of important skills needed for functional literacy in a modern industrial society. The battery included comprehension tests of normal prose, tables, forms encountered in everyday life, difficult prose such as text from a home insurance policy, and a reading rate score. The tests were administered twice with an interval of one year between testing. Some results were an increase in reading comprehension  from grade to grade at all levels, with the exception of the highest percentiles in grades eleven and twelve, and wide overlapping of scores between grades. Questionnaires were sent to 950 head teachers asking for their opinion of the value of the skills measured by the test battery and asking them to indicate a minimum score for satisfactory ability. Partial data results are discussed. A majority of the teachers who responded indicated that they felt the skills measured were important. (MKM)",

That these exams are true aptitude tests is a myth repeatedly deflated when students study for the tests and manage to score significantly higher on a second testing. Factors in addition to intelligence which can influence the outcome on these standardized tests are familiarity with the exam and type of question likely to be encountered; practice in taking a mock exam under timed conditions, since working speed is a vital consideration; and reduction of anxiety level. The skills tested tend to be in two general categories for most qualifying exams, verbal and math. Specific suggestions for teaching these skills, such as practice in  working analogies, are given. A program offered by UCLA's learning skills center to prepare students for the Law School Aptitude Test is described. It consists of the following five parts: a trial test using an old LSAT examination, a seminar providing general information about the test, a demonstration of how to prepare for the test (recommended study guides are listed), a cases-and-principles workshop, and essay preparation tutoring.

Teachers should then work to foster environments and experiences in which females and males are equally endowed with strengths, weaknesses, capabilities, options, and potentials. A variety of approaches and exercises have been developed to accomplish this, such as analysis of books for sex role stereotyping, reading exercises which reverse conventional images of male and female, or research reports on subjects dealing with women inadequately covered in the textbook. Several sources offer suggestions for helping students and teachers focus  on patterns of sex stereotyping and prejudice. (JM)",

A brief review of the past 50 years of research on questioning levels indicates a need for attention to the cognitive level of queries as well as to their sequence since investigators have found a high percentage of questions asked by teachers could be classified in the category of rote memory. Unless a teacher is able to shift emphasis to higher cognitive levels, expecting a spirited and thoughtful discussion of a reading assignment may be futile. A model of questioning which takes into account all levels of thought and provides students with a means of digesting prose material is needed. Examples are given which follow a  modified version of the Bloom taxonomy, with questions moving from specific facts to broader generalities. A sample sequence moves from questions of knowledge, comprehension, and analysis to questions of evaluation. Suggested guidelines for proper questioning include phrasing questions carefully, not answering one's own question, and allowing wait time for students to prepare answers. (MKM)",

In this way, children can engage in dramatic play; then discuss their activity, relating it to the informational source (such as a film); and, finally, explore the consequences and alternatives so that the activity becomes a reflective experience.

An examination of a number of pieces of writing by elementary school pupils shows that some are highly imaginative while others are informative reports, simple statements of events, colorful descriptions, or various forms of poetry. Style is generally informal and relaxed, as it relates closely to speech and implies that the reader or listener is interested in what is being presented. As the pupil becomes more aware of the English language and its syntactical structure, this knowledge can help give form to ideas. The question naturally arises whether the study of grammar can help improve writing. Over the past decade attempts to prove that the study of grammar can  improve writing were not significant, but research on generative grammar instruction increased the proportion of well-formed sentences and the complexity of sentence patterns. More recently, a study reported that sentence-combining practices have a favorable effect on the writing skills of students. (RB)",

Characteristically, only the mean rate of nonstandard usage for the group is reported for any linguistic feature. Such reporting obscures the possibility of linguistic heterogeneity within the group. Data from Los Angeles school children show that school classrooms are heterogeneous with respect to different forms of agreement usage. An alternative analysis is proposed in which children are grouped on the basis of linguistic criteria. Members of these groups share a common grammar. There is an implicational relationship among the grammars employed by such linguistically determined groups. The linguistically determined groups do not map exactly onto traditional sociologically  determined groups. This relation may be expressed as the probability that a member of a sociologically determined group is a member of some linguistically determined group. This interpersonal variation may be distinguished from intrapersonal variation, or the probability that a rule of a particular grammar will apply. (Author)",

Biographical data was collected from the reference source \"Something About the Authors\" concerning sex, social class, education, place of birth and residence, marriage, children, political and religious affiliations, reference groups, and nonliterary or artistic occupations of authors. Findings show that authors of children's books tend to be white, middle-class married women with some college education, residing in the United States' northeast or west. They also tend to have children and to be occupationally identified with the higher, but not  highest, prestige occupations. It is possible that the majority of these authors have held common social perceptions, but evidence shows that the recent demands of society have introduced authors from backgrounds in conflict with the established order who are now writing a different type of children's literature.

        "description":"The technique of subliminal information giving has been considerably broadened in recent years so that magazine ads now employ it by carefully hiding images where they are not usually perceived with the conscious eye. In his recent book, &quot;Subliminal Seduction: Ad Media's Manipulation of a Not So Innocent America,&quot; Wilson B. Key demonstrates that subliminal messages in ads are perceived and do have an impact on attitudes and actions. After conducting his own personal search to find the &quot;hidden persuaders,&quot; the author of this article was convinced that advertisements are full of hidden information, which is usually of a sexual nature. He suggests that it is important that English teachers become aware of this phenomenon, since it is a part of communication. Furthermore, he contends  that we cannot accept or reject such information until we become conscious of it and are able to act on it in our normal, rational ways. (LL)",

The convergent communication situation is a two-person problem-solving task which ensures that all communication is verbal since the participants are seated on opposite sides of a visual barrier. The subjects, one pair of Anglo students in each grade K-3, were given tasks involving matching and sequencing pictures. The kindergarteners did not complete the tasks, and data from their interview has been excluded. The linguistic aspects investigated were the use of the copula, the use of questions, the use of possessives, and the use of comparative  constructions. The relative frequency of these uses was compared with a study by Legum which elicited data from black children by naturalistic observation. The convergent communication technique appears to have value for use by those studying dialects. (MKM)",

Some of the advantages of the CBTE movement are that it specifies student and teacher outcomes, helps individualize instruction, brings about cooperation between the public schools and the colleges in working out plans for improving education, and focuses attention on some of the major areas in education that need improvement. Some of the problems with CBTE are that there is an inadequate research base for identifying the factors which produce effective teaching, and any attempt to relate teacher skills to student achievement does not offer an empirical basis for the prescription of teacher training objectives. To the extent that  CBTE omits consideration of variables like school, community, and home factors related to student achievement, the movement cannot support its claim of being scientific. Industry can teach some lessons about competency that are useful to the CBTE movement, but it also must be remembered that education is not a production process. Finally, it must be remembered that working to improve teacher education must not divert educators from working for overall reform. (RB)",

This report describes the results of the tryout of the first-grade spelling component. In most instances, weekly performance in tryout classes approximated or exceeded the 80 percent level. Posttest scores for tryout classes averaged 62 percent, 17 percent higher than the average of the comparison classes. The decline in performance from weekly test levels coupled with differences in performance on practice and transfer words suggests that the program's word  attack procedures should be strengthened.

        "description":"This paper describes a graduate course for language arts teachers at Georgia State University in Atlanta, titled Social Dialects and Language Learning. Classroom procedures and activities in the course were organized into five cumulative, related phases to engage the teachers in useful fieldwork in order to achieve major objectives of the course. In the first phase of the work, teachers were asked to write a linguistic autobiography. The second phase of the work aimed at expanding the teachers' awareness of phonological, lexical, and grammatical contrasts in the idiolects of members of small groups formed in classes. The third phase was the preparation for the actual fieldwork, using a questionnaire as an instrument for investigating the language usage of others. The fourth phase  involved the organization and management of language data for investigating the variation of language in several dimensions. The fifth phase involved speculation about the causes of language variation in terms of historical, social, and psychological factors. It is concluded that teachers showing respect for the speech of all students in their classes may provide an excellent way of combating language prejudice by affecting the attitudes of the next generation of adults.

The study is based on the analysis of transcripts of four testimonial meetings of a branch church, interpreted through knowledge of Christian Science official literature, informal interaction with Christian Scientists, and knowledge of other testimonial meetings attended by the author over a one-year period. While traditional social science and linguistic approaches are drawn on, this study differs qualitatively from these approaches by focusing primary attention on the situated production of these speech acts as accomplishments of a particular community. The purpose of this ethnography is to demonstrate how the management of these acts achieves the communication of a  complex, shared transcendence which is analyzed as a coparticipation in a transcendent province of meaning which unites Christian Scientists as a community. While this study focuses exclusively on particular speech acts of one community, it is suggested that the methods used are applicable to the study of transcendent communication in general.

Human behavior can then be viewed in terms of process. Smith, in discussing the idea of process in communication research, states that \"more complete explanations will be developed through attempting to employ more wholistic perspectives rather than by accumulating the results of individual analytic studies.\" It is suggested that through this view the complexity and multidimensionality of man can be considered. One statistical multivariate technique that attempts to view the interrelationships of components is factor analysis. The use of principle axis factor analysis is common in data reduction to  simple structure. Another use for factor analysis is hypothesis testing. It is also suggested that greater use of this tool in determining the strength of an attitude in relationship to other attitudes would be of great help in communication. (LL)",

These aids have characteristics which make them appropriate for different facets of a theatre program, especially in classroom instruction. However, some of them may also be used successfully in reporting research results, particularly those of performance reconstructions. Theatre historians must give more attention to reconstruction through actual performance and to recording those reconstructions for the benefit of other historians. Thus, graduate theatre programs should  include basic photography and videotaping techniques. (JM)",

Established in April 1974, the SPC is the product of a multifaceted attack on three critical and interrelated problems: (1) an increasing scarcity of funds for national programing; (2) a need for long-range financing for public broadcasting; and (3) political opposition to a centrally administered public television system. The SPC provides a mechanism for the nation's public television stations to select desired programs from a pool of available offerings, thus dimishing central control of national program selection. By sharing the production costs of the programs they select, the SPC taps a new source of funding for national  programs, thereby providing programing that might otherwise be unavailable. And finally, by addressing itself to the problems of political opposition to a centrally administered system and developing a strategy for internal economic stability, the SPC indirectly addresses the problem of long-range financing.

Part 2, \"A Paradigm: 'The Ecology of Film,'\" presents a global paradigm which takes into consideration the whole film process from inception to reception, regardless of the historical period the film is received in. The film as a system is divided into six distinct aspects or subsystems of the film process, and the relationships between these subsystems is elaborated on. The third part, \"Categories  of Audience Response in Film Viewing,\" offers a second paradigm in which film response is broken down into the following types: simple, compound, complex self-reflective, and complex self-critical. Each of these types of responses is further subdivided into emotional, intellectual, and a combination of both. It is asserted that there is no such thing as a \"pure aesthetic\" response. (LL)",

In recent years numerous judicial decisions have overruled the practices of school districts that have excluded developmentally disabled children from educational programs. This monograph examines these cases and discusses their underlying legal principles, including the emerging \"right to education\" and the Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process. The implications of the cases are explained for school authorities, who must identify, evaluate, and place handicapped children in appropriate educational programs. State constitutional and statutory provisions for educating the handicapped  that help to explain the development of the legal aspects of educating the developmentally disabled are also examined.

Also, the actual nature of the candidate's behavior varies systematically along both qualitative and quantitative dimensions during the period of anticipatory socialization. The concepts of anticipatory socialization, interpersonal orientation, perspective, situational adjustment, and organizational space provided the basic theoretical framework. Four contextual properties characterize the behavioral situation of  candidates: (1) candidates were processed through this period of their career as individuals rather than as members of a group; (2) the organization tended to view this period as one in which candidates could be tested in \"live\" situtations; (3) the organizational role prescriptions for acceptable candidate behavior were ambiguous and not clearly specified, and (4) the behavior distances between candidates and members of the positive reference group varied systematically as a function of either individually initiated candidate behavior or organizationally directed changes in the role-set of candidates.

Most of the literature deals with malicious vandalism. Perhaps because security appears to be the only way to control malicious vandalism, it is often made the focal point of antivandalism programs. The most important consideration is the relationship between the cost of a security system and its potential value to the school. A comprehensive antivandalism program using security devices as part of an overall plan is often suggested. Unfortunately, the literature is full of suggestions and assertations, but remarkably short on concrete facts documented by scientific research. There are two basic approaches to controlling malicious vandalism.  Deterrent programs treat vandalism symptomatically, usually by emphasizing school security. The diagnostic approach attempts to prevent vandalism by attacking its causes. Thoughtful building design can greatly reduce nonmalicious vandalism. The well-designed building will be less vulnerable to all kinds of damage--malicious, nonmalicious, and even wear and tear. (Author/JG)",

Chapters 5, 6, and 7 discuss various aspects of SEE's climate as seen by students, parents, and teachers. Chapter 8 presents another perspective by contrasting SEE students with a sample of students who applied but were not selected in the admissions lottery.

Under the approach developed by the Educational Management Development Center (EMDEC), several school systems develop similar PPB systems, with EMDEC as the coordinating hub. District personnel are first familiarized with the program concept through the development of the program budget. Only after a year of budget work are personnel asked to develop goals, objectives, and targets. Cooperation by several districts permits the distribution of costs across the districts and encourages an exchange of information. The EMDEC approach is presently being tested with three school districts in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The three districts have had good success  with the development of the program budget; the most difficult problem during the initial months was a lack of detailed information. To introduce program analysis and evaluation, the EMDEC approach uses two pilot programs for each district, so the implementation process can be easily modified for maximum effectiveness. The subsequent development of goals and objectives for the entire district simply involves the full application of guidelines designed during the pilot phase. (Author/JG)",

Although the primary purpose of the SPECS project in South Lane School District was developmental, a limited study of teacher attitudes was carried out in each of the first three years of implementation. Both informal discussion with teachers and survey results showed the existence of three groups: those who were strongly pro-SPECS (approximately 45-50 percent), those who were strongly anti-SPECS (approximately  25-40 percent), and those who were apparently indifferent (approximately 15-25 percent). With one exception, there was little real change in teachers' perception of SPECS-related problems between 1971 and 1973. Furthermore, there was little change in teachers' views of SPECS' impact on organization, supervision, and administrative receptiveness within the district. (Author/JG)",

It also offers a framework and a methodology for a community to use in arriving at its own set of evaluation criteria. The proposed measures and data collection methodology were devised primarily for municipal and county officials and their staffs who are involved in land-use matters. The suggested measures and how they are formulated are presented in Chapter 1 of Part 1. Chapter 2 discusses the role of the measures--that is, how they may be used by local decision-makers. Chapter 3 focuses on key methodological issues that have  not been totally resolved but that should be kept in mind when applying the measures. Chapter 4 indicates how the measures may be used to consider explicitly the impact of development on different population segments or clientele groups. Chapter 5 suggests some ways of presenting or displaying the findings from the impact measures. Part 2 deals with the more technical details of applying the proposed measures. It discusses the rationale, limitations, and alternative forms for each measure and outlines procedures for data collection in each instance. (Author/MLF)",

Federally supported measurement organizations should be established in each state to develop indicators of goal achievement relevant to national social service goals. These indicators should be common to all states and should become the basis for sanctions against those states that, by comparison, perform badly. The federal role ought to be the enunciation of broad policy, the measurement of its achievement, and the development of sanctions for failures  in achievement. The state-local role ought to include the specification and execution of interventions appropriate to national goals, with an absolute minimum of federal interference.

A survey of current literature reveals a concentration of models for producing long-range national forecasts, but few models for generating short-range forecasts disaggregated to the regional, state, and local level. Since there is not much evidence on the accuracy of predictions, attention is focused on the reasonableness of the model structure. Models are also evaluated on the basis of their potential value in policy-formation. It is assumed that this value depends on the value of supply adjustments in the labor market, but a review of the literature on supply reveals that  evidence on adjustment is mixed. The conclusion is drawn that existing manpower forecasting models should be modified, so that they are more reasonable representations of labor markets. (Author/JG)",

Progress toward integrated schools and changing sex roles make the perception of educational goals by groups defined by race and sex of practical significance. In three studies involving panels of community leaders, educators, and high school students respectively in metropolitan Atlanta, convergence in perceptions of goals was examined within each panel as a whole and among groups defined by race and sex within panels. It was found that both individual and group perceptions generally tended to converge. Goals reflecting serious areas of disagreement were identified. (Author)",

The data, derived from the author's participant observation in the Detroit Public Schools, indicate that (1) corporal punishment has been an accepted and practiced control mechanism in many schools; (2) most large school systems have a machinery for protecting teachers who may be jeopardized because they have administered physical punishment; and (3) parents filing civil suits have found that both teachers and administrators have liability insurance and are represented in court by attorneys for their professional organizations. Where corporal  punishment is sanctioned, educators are shielded effectively even when overzealous, ill-advised, or sadistic. The removal of that shield, the primary target in any political effort to bar corporal punishment, is the concern of the remainder of the paper. (Author/MLF)",

The local education agency is now faced with the need for management of the requirements for accountability.

The discussion of the role of project manager includes an examination of his job description (function, principal responsibilities, authority, duties, and techniques of management) and of the problem areas of the role.

Chapters 5, 6, and 7, concern interpersonal &quot;first-level&quot; skills; conditions facilitating interpersonal responsiveness among teachers, communication in schools with collaborative teaching structures, and preconditions necessary before training produced constructive adaptation. Chapters 8 and 9 concern &quot;second-level&quot; skills that serve to enhance the functioning of systems; collaborative decision-making among teachers, and power-sharing between principals and teachers. Chapters  10, 11, and 12, move to &quot;third-level&quot; skills--the capacity of the school for performing as an entire system; a substudy of the school as a processor of innovations, the work of the cadre as an agent of constructive adaptation, and the cadre as a system in itself. Chapter 13 probes the strengths and weaknesses of the data, research design, and analysis techniques used in the study. Chapter 14 contains a summary of the project and recommendations.

General characteristics of Down's Syndrome and other retarded children are reviewed and compared with the two girls' growth and development (according to Piaget's proposed stages). The Montessori emphasis on sensorial activities and on individual freedom to choose tasks is seen to enhance the retarded child's development. Analyzed are the girl's progress in such skill areas as language, reading, and math. The children are said to be functioning in Piaget's preconceptual and intuitive stages. Emphasized is the need for an approach which includes raised social and academic expectations along with instruction in independence and self-direction. An  appendix lists suggested Montessori materials and activities for handicapped children. (CL)",
