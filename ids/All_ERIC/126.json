The report includes a description of the sample design, instrument development, examples of the survey forms, data collection, file preparation, and analysis procedures used in the survey as well as the results of the study. Topics covered in the report include state and local supervision; course offerings; federally-funded curriculum development efforts; textbook usage; instructional materials and techniques; facilities and equipment; teachers' needs for assistance; information sources; and factors affecting science, mathematics, and social studies education. Among the findings: (1) The amount of time devoted to science and  social studies instruction in the elementary grades is considerably less than that spent on reading and mathematics instruction; (2) Federally-funded science curriculum materials are being used in a majority of the nation's school districts, the usage of federally-funded mathematics and social studies curriculum materials is much lower; (3) Sizable numbers of teachers would like additional assistance in obtaining information about instructional materials, learning new teaching methods, implementing the discovery/inquiry approach, and using manipulative materials.

        "description":"The research investigated the relationship of a person's sex to his or her public policy preferences, with particular regard to women's issues. Women's issues are reflected in public policy which directly affects women's lives. Examples are day care facilities, sex bias of educational materials, and abortion facilities. The study was conducted to ascertain whether women's interests are concentrated in certain areas and whether female politicians place women's policy issues on a higher level of importance than male politicians do. The hypothesis was that female politicians would not indicate more concern or more expertise in women's public policy areas than would men. One hundred Connecticut municipal council-members (50 female and 50 male) were questioned about policy  preferences, interests, and areas of expertise. Findings indicated that although women were more concerned about social problems than men, their interests were not limited to this area. Also, women expressed more support for feminist issues than did men; however, they did not maintain a higher level of support of these issues over other issues. In summary, women were more influenced by their role as politicians than by their role as women or supporters of women's policy. There was insufficient evidence to confirm or deny the original hypothesis. The recommendation is for additional research on other manifestations of policy preferences such as introduction of legislation or votes in the council chamber. (Author/DB)",

Course objectives are to help students understand the pervasiveness of popular culture in American society, its historical development, the business aspects of the popular culture industry, the effects of mass media on its nature and quality, the emergence of rock 'n' roll music as a reflection of a growing youth culture, the historical tendency of popular culture to perpetuate false stereotypes of ethnic minorities, and the growing trend toward cultural diversity reflected in new communications systems. The guide integrates the themes of newspaper articles and primary source readings from the accompanying materials. Presentation of learning  objectives and discussion of key concepts enable students to pursue the course independently as well as in groups. Divisions in the guide correspond with the four major units in the reader. Each unit in the guide contains a list of appropriate newspaper articles and selections from the reader, learning objectives, overviews of newspaper and reader materials, discussion of key concepts, factual questions, and discussion questions.

        "description":"An 18-month project assessed social studies in British Columbia during 1976-77. Part of a general educational assessment program of the British Columbia Ministry of Education, the project was carried out in four major phases. During Phase I, an assessment framework was established which represented viewpoints of teachers, students, and the public regarding content, goals, and practices within the social studies. Phase II involved a survey of teachers, administrators, librarians, students, and the general public regarding social studies goals. The survey instrument consisted of a section with open-ended questions, two sections with rating scales, one section with multiple choice items, and a section illustrating the social characteristics of each group. Phases III and IV entailed  analysis and interpretation of the survey results. Findings from the survey indicated that: (1) teachers need better training; (2) social studies should deal with knowledge about the past and present and should include study of Canada; (3) teachers desire stronger participation in curriculum revision; and (4) students have difficulty seeing relevance in social studies courses. The conclusions are that the Ministry of Education should encourage teacher participation in social studies curriculum development, provide adequate financial support to local districts for instructional improvement, give serious consideration to public reaction to the assessment study, and continue to investigate high priority educational research questions.

        "description":"This study deals with attributional theory, a factor of special concern in achievement theory, which focuses on specific behavior as caused by the subject's attributions to the perceived causes of such behavior. This study investigated whether an individual's attributional biases were predictive of task selections he or she made. Furthermore, it investigated the influence of task outcome, grade level, sex, and sociocultural identification upon the relationship between attribution and task selection. A total of 743 students from fifth through twelfth grades participated in the study. The students were drawn from both rural and urban school systems. A specially composed questionaire was employed to assess the students' attributions. Each item described a performance outcome for  which the student would attribute the cause: to ability, to effort, or to luck. After the assessment, each subject was presented with three identical games. They were told that in one game you do best by trying hard, in another by knowing what to do, and in the last by being lucky. Subjects selected their first and second choices. It was found that subjects who believe their own success on achievement tasks are attributable either to their own ability, effort, or to luck will likely seek tasks which are compatible with such beliefs. This general tendency is relatively unaffected by experience of success or failure at a task and generalizes across age, sex, and sociocultural groups. (Author/JK)",

Data were taken from the Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the Bureau of the Census. Highlights of the report include: (1) the voting rate in the 1976 Presidential election was lower than in any Presidential election since 1948, in spite of the fact that more people voted than ever before; (2) an increase in the proportion of the electorate under 35 years old (traditionally, a low-turnout age group),  has contributed to the decline in voter turnout since the 1964 Presidential election; (3) the voting rates of men and women are now approximately equal; (4) voting turnout for both whites and blacks in 1976 was about 10 percentage points below their respective levels in the 1964 election; (5) voting turnout for persons of Spanish origin was six percentage points below that of 1972.

The first part briefly traces the interregional migration of blacks, the black return migration to their region of birth, the interregional migration of whites, and the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan migration of blacks and whites. The second part contains 43 detailed tables. The tables are divided into five subject areas: detailed mobility, general mobility, mobility for standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's), mobility for central cities of SMSA's, and regional mobility. These five areas are further subdivided by social, economic, and general characteristics such as age, race, Spanish origin, years of school completed, marital  status, household relationship, families, employment status, occupation, income, receipt of public assistance, and above or below poverty level. The third part, the appendix, includes related reports, allocations of mobility status, definitions, and the source and reliability of estimates. Also included are tables on the standard errors of estimated numbers and percentages, factors to be applied to generalized errors, and parameters for estimated numbers and percentages.

Content and teaching methods of community civics are reviewed. Objectives of the program were to help children understand their roles as members of various social groups; to establish habits of order, cooperation, and service; to emphasize the relationship between the individual and society; and to develop political intelligence. Interdisciplinary in nature, the program involved activities and problem solving in grades one through eight in areas of history, geography, and arithmetic. Subject-area outlines by grade level and sample problems illustrate the depth of the program. In order to prepare students to be informed community members, classroom problems covered  costs of public services, industrial operations, and home management. In order to prepare students to be responsible and cooperative, extracurricular activities included participation in school administration and community cleanup. Teaching methods emphasized class discussion with participation by all students and delegation of degrees of responsibility in order to foster mature behavior. (AV)",

The objective is to help teachers understand the formulation of content-centered learning activities so that they will be able to plan and produce their own value sheets or moral dilemmas. The paper begins with a schematic illustration of major components of all value/moral activities. Three phases are identified: concept formation, relation of the concept to moral issues, and moral reasoning. The second section identifies five types of issues which serve as the basis of value/moral activities: a neutral issue, a moral issue, a moral issue in conflict with another moral issue, conflict between choices allowed by a  moral issue, and a situation in which two or more moral issues are applicable. Procedures for choosing among these types of issues are discussed and five activity formats are described (standard, forced choice, affirmative, rank-order, and classification). The third section presents one learning activity for each format. Topics are regulations against importation of wildlife, allocation of project funds, noise level control, ecology vs unemployment, and choices for decreasing energy consumption in a school district. For each format, information is presented on the context, discussion questions, follow-up question areas, and considerations for arriving at a decision. Decision sheets are also presented for each activity. (Author/DB)",

The opening sections outline the immediate benefits of having a school orchestra; effects on later adult life of student participation in orchestras; goals of a school orchestra program; and program needs in terms of school board, parents, community, and program development. Subsequent sections present separate checklists for student skills, curriculum offerings, and materials and facilities for each of three levels: elementary, junior high, and senior high. The checklists enable teachers and administrators to rate their school's program on a scale of one to four for specific elements. Among student skills are tone  production and bowing, intonation, fingering, reading/interpretive skills, rhythm, melody, theory, harmony, improvisation, conducting, listening, and stage presence. Among curricular offerings are opportunities for solo, small, and large group playing; proper ratio of teachers to students; and student exploratory experience on a variety of instruments prior to renting or purchasing. Evaluation of materials and facilities considers adequate supply and tuning of instruments; chairs, stage, and music stands; private practice areas; and soundproofing. A final overall evaluation form for the entire school program concludes the document. (AV)",

        "description":"The Housing and Land Speculation Game provides students in college microeconomics courses with an opportunity to learn about market adjustment toward equilibrium and investment strategy. Students are divided into a land tax only group and a land and property tax group. They analyze the market situation and determine game strategy in accordance with data generated from a classroom housing and land market. The setting is a residential area that contains houses and vacant land. Each student receives an initial endowment of land and houses along with a debt and net worth position. Students change position by demolishing, building, buying, and selling. Sources of income to student landlords include rent, gain in land value, and interest on bank deposits. Costs to student landlords  include property tax, capital losses, and depreciation. The winning student is the one with the highest net worth at the conclusion of the game. Response among students who have participated in the game through intermediate microeconomics courses has been generally favorable. Shortcomings of the game include hesitation of students to break away from an arbitrary initial land value and a tendency to ignore data generated in the game. The conclusion is that the game has the potential of helping students increase their understanding of issues related to buying and selling property. Suggestions for alleviating the game's shortcomings are offered. The computer program and data input are available from the author. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Given the decline in birth rates, which will produce a steep decline in the youth population by 1990, this paper examines the possible effects such a population shift will have on the achievement motivation of children. It is reasoned the increased adult/child ratio could result in either of two possibilities: the greater attention paid to the individual child might effect a greater sense of personal causation, leading to increased achievement motivation; or, the greater adult/child ratio could overwhelm the child, eventuating in a decreased sense of personal causation and/or motivation. Based on these two possibilities, this paper discusses two scenarios describing how it might be when \"children of the 60's and 70's\" hit the job market. In the first scenario, it is assumed that  socialization in a small family increases achievement motivation. These highly motivated individuals will probably expect to accomplish great things in their employment. However, an analysis of the population trends indicates movement to upper level positions may be retarded because of a large older age group. Therefore, one might expect these children to be a frustrated generation. In the second scenario, it is assumed that socialization in a small family reduces achievement. In this case motivation to excell and do well at a job might be reduced. This latter situation might lead to a more peaceful coexistence between generations. (Author/JK)",

        "description":"Presenting models based on the philosophies of Carl Rogers, John Dewey, Erich Fromm, and Jean-Paul Sartre, this paper proposes a philosophical approach to education and concludes with pragmatic suggestions concerning teaching based on a fully-functioning-person model. The fully-functioning person is characterized as being open to experience, living in an existential fashion, and finding his organism as a trustworthy means of arriving at the most satisfying behavior in each existential situation. If the philosophies of Rogers, Dewey, Fromm, and Sartre were distilled into a model for curriculum development, the curriculum would be narrowed to the most relevant subjects, the introduction of new subjects would be dependent on the stage of development of the students, and emphasis  would be placed on motivation. In the author's classroom, where the fully-functioning-person model is used, student interest is the goal, with skills being a by-product. Discipline is not imposed by the teacher, but self-discipline is encouraged. Students help determine the grading criteria, select class projects, write performance contracts, and discuss and evaluate their achievement. Educators are encouraged to emulate this model or to experiment, remembering their goal is to get students to function as independent persons capable of exercising choices to determine their own destinies.

No, the vocational education community is not responsible for youth unemployment rates, the shifting labor market demands, the baby bulge, women in the labor force, the oil embargo, or the economic recession. Then what role does the vocational education community have for the unemployed youth of our nation? The answer is none. Neither the network of secondary and postsecondary schools, grade school career exploration, nor the vocational education system can create jobs. The vocational education community can be one of many institutions reacting positively to the conditions causing youth unemployment. However, claims to do more than what is possible are damaging to all the actors. The recently  enacted youth legislation is a product of too many promises. Vocational education must be cautious about claiming the ability to deliver the variety of services these youth may need. Vocational education must decide some basic directions, be coordinated, and work with other agencies to change the statistics of youth unemployment.

        "description":"Professionals in the educational field have recognized the special problems of the mentally retarded and since the early part of the 1950s have attempted to find out just how to intervene between the limitations of the retarded and the demands in the world of competitive work. Since some retarded individuals become competent employees while others do not, studies have examined differences between these persons. Studies have also examined problems which have caused retarded individuals trouble on their jobs--poor personal and social skills, poor work habits, and fault of employers, coordinators, or parents. Professionals have attempted to take into account these conditions. For example, attempts are being made to broaden the range of training opportunities through cooperative  efforts with other disciplines--notably vocational rehabilitation and vocational education. This occurred in the 1960s at about the same time change began to make itself felt in many social institutions influenced by humanism, resulting in the concept called mainstreaming--the integration of handicapped into regular classrooms. But is integration the best policy? Studies show that there appears to be a real danger that handicapped students will become lost in regular classes, or they will not receive the special support they need from instructors and students of regular classes. Research suggests what educators should be doing with the mildly retarded: (1) Label the students, but not refer to them as \"mildly retarded\"; (2) give them a highly structured program which recognizes their  delayed readiness and their slower than average academic progress; (3) present material in a competency-based, individualized format, and (4) plan enrichment experiences.

        "description":"The part-time job market now employs about 12.5 million persons who are voluntary part timers--those who customarily work one to thirty-four hours a week on their own volition. Data from the Current Population Survey (March-May, 1973) was used to examine the cross-sectional distribution of the employment and wages of part timers, and an analysis was done to determine the principal factors of supply and demand. An intersectoral model of the supply and demand of part timers was used (process of which is described in this report) to explore interactions between differences in the reward to part timers and in the utilization of part timers. Findings include that part timers are paid much less than full timers, due primarily to the employment of part-time workers in low wage sectors  of the economy. The statistical analysis supported the view that there is a large market for part timers, which serves both the economy and the marginal members of the work force. However, employers are generally unwilling to train or promote part timers and those with high level credentials are usually barred from upward mobility. Conclusions and policy implications included that the part-time labor market serves a very useful purpose in providing jobs for millions of persons who might not otherwise find employment, and since the part-time market is very diverse, regulating it by means of quotas as advocated by some federal and private sectors would be a rather inefficient proposition.

        "description":"Females who were poor outnumbered males by more than four million in 1975. The 15 million females living in poverty accounted for three out of five persons (fifty-eight percent) who were poor in the United States. Advance data for 1976 indicate that more than ten million women aged sixteen and over had low incomes, and that these women accounted for nearly two out of three poor persons. About one-third of all families headed by women were poor (median income: $2,926)--more than five times the rate for male-head families--and although women were only fourteen percent of all family heads, they made up forty-eight percent of all poor family heads. The poverty status of a female-head family is directly related to the number of family members; fifty-four percent of the families with  five members and sixty-five percent with seven or more persons were poor. There are several reasons why poverty is more prevalent among women: (1) Women characteristically have lower earnings than men (1976 median earnings--women, $8,312; men, $13,859); (2) women have higher unemployment rates; (3) responsibilities for the care of children restrict their employment; and (4) women have greater longevity than men (poverty is greatest among the aged).

The first is a research investigation being conducted by the Center for Prisoner of War Studies, and the second is the extension of services to families. The volume encompasses three major periods: the waiting period (early 1960's to February 1973); the repatriation period (February 1973 to April 1973); and the readjustment and reintegration period (April 1973 to the present). Chapters are organized and presented in the context of these periods. Introductory chapters provide a historical perspective of the Prisoner of War (PW) and Missing in Action (MIA) situation in Southeast Asia, as well as a demographic profile of the men and their families. In the second section, the casualty and waiting period, the complexity of family  adjustment to father absence is emphasized. The third section is devoted to repatriation and the returned prisoner of war. The fourth section, which covers the readjustment and reintegration period, describes major dilemmas and factors involved in adjustment, such as adjustment of families of returned prisoners of war, and adjustment of relatives of servicemen missing or killed in action. The final section examines underlying assumptions, theories and concepts characterizing the military outreach and follow-up program for returned PW's, their families, and families of MIA servicemen.

This study attempted to assess the effects of learned helplessness--a possible laboratory analog to reactive depression--on alcohol consumption. Thirty-eight female undergraduates were randomly assigned (within drinking category blocks) to one of two conditions. Half were given unsolvable problems (learned helplessness condition) and half were given solvable problems (control). Relative to controls, subjects in the learned helplessness group reported increased depression and hostility. In addition, they drank more beer in a taste-rating task. Finally , although the manipulation was one previously reported in the literature, expected anagram  solution deficits were not exhibited by the learned helplessness subjects. This failure, coupled with the findings of increased hostility and depression in the helplessness group, may suggest that a frustration/stress reaction rather than a state of helplessness characterized the subjects.

        "description":"Studies which have investigated males' and females' attitudes and behavior in organizations have yielded apparently contradictory results. In some studies, individuals have followed traditional sex-role stereotypes; in others, they have not. A proposed explanation for these inconsistencies is that sex-role identification is a more important variable than sex. Individuals who adhere to the stereotypes may be highly sex-typed (masculine or feminine), and those who do not may be less sex-typed (androgynous or undifferentiated) in sex-role identification. One hundred-ten graduate students with jobs in the business community and 575 undergraduate business students completed the Bem Sex-Role Inventory containing &quot;masculine&quot;--self-reliant, competitive--and &quot;feminine&quot;--sympathetic,  shy--characteristics for both themselves and a &quot;good manager.&quot; As expected, individuals' sex-role identifications significantly affected their perceptions of traits desirable for management personnel, while sex had virtually no effect. The study concludes that sex-role identification is a variable deserving of further attention, particularly when sex-related differences are examined. Also, graduate women revealed more masculine traits than feminine in their self-descriptions, suggesting that a masculine standard for management may nullify the femininity of women in or aspiring to management positions.

It included two groups of people, community workers (N=21) and non-workers (N=22), from each of two settings, Model Neighborhoods Areas (MNA) and Central Area (CNA). The MNA is a black area, while the CNA is a white area. All participants were age 50 or older (average age = 62.6). The following measures were administered: (1) a Life Satisfaction Index; (2) a Behavioral Attributes of Psychosocial Competence (BAPC) scale; (3) an Internality-Externality (I-E) Scale; (4) a Trust Scale; and (5) a community survey, assessing familiarity and satisfaction with the community, and perception of its needs. Results indicate that for residents of MNA, life  satisfaction is correlated significantly with the BAPC measure of coping style and with internality. Thus, for black residents in a low-resource area, life satisfaction appears highly dependent on an individual's competence characteristics. For residents of CNA, with greater resources, life satisfaction is not related to being more competent. In summary, individual competence is an important factor in person-environment &quot;fit.&quot; Life satisfaction by itself is not an adequate criterion for evaluation of programs for the elderly. Competence must also be included. (Author/JLL)",

Exam scores for 459 beginning psychology students were examined. Each student took four exams, but only on the third was copying made impossible. The results appear to suggest an inverse relationship between exam scores and the degree of cheating. As grades decrease, the amount of copying increases. The author concludes that without an item-by-item analysis, and a seating chart, inferences about cheating must remain probabilistic. (Author/PFS)",

It was hypothesized that students with an external locus of control who also showed a discrepancy between expected and actual grades would distort ratings in the direction of the discrepancy. Regressions were performed on data from 200 Ss. In four regressions, the interaction term was significant; thus the hypothesis was partially supported. As these four items had been shown to be particularly important, the influence of locus of control is interpreted as a reduction in validity of student rating instruments. (Author)",

The presence of such large numbers of addicted offenders poses special problems for the correctional administrator. The long-range aims of correctional drug programs are to reduce drug abuse and related criminal activity--goals that have not generally been achieved. However, as this manual points out, drug treatment programs can contribute to the efficient management of correctional institutions by improving the correctional environment and enhancing the relationship between inmates and staff. According to the authors, this manual is less than prescriptive in some ways, because thinking in this field is in a constant state of flux and change as new approaches to treatment and rehabilitation  are introduced, modified, or abandoned in the light of the realities of the correctional setting. Many innovative programs are now being undertaken, and correctional agencies and institutions should encourage initiative and experimentation in their programs. This prescriptive package should be useful to correctional administrators as well as those who set policy and direct drug treatment programs at the federal, state, and regional levels. (Author)",

As a result, many teachers are frustrated and dissatisfied with their job, and that means that their teaching suffers. Support for classroom teachers is needed to revitalize the troubled secondary school. A moderate restructuring of the secondary school or organization--a restructuring that includes a new stance for counselors and school psychologists--can become a source of providing direct support for teachers. Discussion focuses on: (1) three motivational needs of teachers; (2) counselors and school psychologists as systematic change agents; (3) four subsystems for school-wide problem  solving; and (4) a consultative model for problem diagnosis.

Each student's writing process was tape-recorded and observed by the instructor in four sessions. The tapes and written observations were charted and analyzed for exhibited behavior patterns in comparison to the written products, inferring from the words on the page how the ideas developed. Results show that the students exhibited consistent behavioral patterns and stylistic or syntactic concerns, that they were more fluent in the reflexive mode, that they used little planning or prewriting, that they had little sense of audience, and that they were unable to explain stylistic changes. The study concludes that the students had not yet internalized all of the  rules that would make them skilled writers, nor had they learned how to judge their writing objectively. However, by looking more closely at how such students compose, teachers can increase their understanding of the entire writing process and can improve instructional methods by which students can achieve composition skills.

Variables measured included education, political interest, campaign interest in the 1972 presidential campaign, public-affairs mass-media usage, knowledge of the political system, and ability to identify the major-party candidates' positions on major issues. Results supported four general conclusions: (1) Network news viewing has no discernible impact on either political accuracy or political system knowledge of first-time or older voters. (2) Public-affairs newspaper use has an  independent effect on both accuracy and political system knowledge for young, inexperienced voters but not for older voters.

Selection procedures matched children on grade level, sex, ethnicity, economic status, and residential mobility; nonetheless, at three of the four sites, the Follow-Through children tended to come from more-disadvantaged homes than did the non-Follow-Through children. Scores from the PLAT, which includes both narrating and reporting tasks, indicated that, by the end of third grade, Follow-Through children wrote more-fluent and more-complex  reports and narratives than did children enrolled in non-Follow-Through classrooms.

Shows were coded at 30-second intervals on four measures of program complexity and two measures of the relationship between verbal and visual content. Children's visual-attention levels were measured individually and averaged over the sample. Single time series analysis indicated the predictability of children's attention levels to be no more than 30 seconds. Younger children's attention in adjacent program segments was found to be more highly interdependent than was older children's attention. Multiple time series anlaysis indicated the attention of older children could be explained very well, based on the program  variables measured. Older children also appeared to be affected more by variations in program complexity and, in particular, by visual complexity. Younger children were more affected by verbal variables, and attention levels were found to be more due to children's consistently attending than to program variables. Forty-four percent to 58% of the variance in attention was explained by these models. (Author)",

The course is a unitized sequence of three five-week sessions. The first session discusses the theoretical product model and process model for the whole essay and for paragraph development. The second unit is more practical than theoretical in approach, developing skills needed for writing style, such as sentence structure, word choice, proofreading, and revision. The third unit emphasizes reading and research techniques and requires help from teachers in other disciplines. Students provide samples of their writing and elect to participate in any one, or all, of the sessions,  depending on their needs, goals, and available time. (RL)",

Responses to the survey are listed within these categories: administration, business, graduate study, labor, law and medicine, library work, miscellaneous professional, self-employed, social work and counseling, teaching, writing and publishing, and unemployed. The observations most often made by the graduates were these: The ability to communicate is essential in most jobs. Classes that encourage analytical thinking and writing develop important skills. Studying literature enables readers to understand human  behavior, thereby assisting in job performance. Many English majors should take one or more business or technical courses.

The polls were conducted between 28 September and 6 October 1973, during June 1974, and in August 1974. The data suggest that political variables--particularly support of Nixon, party affiliation, and ideology--were the most important determinants of press criticism during the Watergate period, and sociological and psychological variables were of lesser consequence. The study concludes that the press may be limited in its ability to criticize popular government and political leaders, fulfilling its role as governmental watchdog and protector of the public interest only when a popular political figure is a weak leader.

Data were collected in a survey of 400 randomly selected Korean households in the Chicago area and were analyzed for interethnic communication (between immigrants and members of the host society), intraethnic communication (between immigrants and other members of their ethnic community), numbers and types of acquaintances, and the immigrant's individual characteristics. Six major findings are discussed: immigrants maintain a stronger involvement within the ethnic community than in the host society. Participation in the host society increases with time. The number of casual friends (both non-Korean and Korean) that an immigrant has increases during the first nine years, after which association  with ethnic friends decreases. Immigrants exhibiting greater interethnic communication are also active in their own ethnic community. Older immigrants do not participate in interethnic communication as much as do younger immigrants. Satisfaction with living in the host society is more closely related to interethnic communication than to intraethnic communication. A sample questionnaire is appended. (RL)",

The theoretical analysis shows that fewer communication links are associated with less uncertainty, more redundancy, and greater stability. In the empirical study, 94 members of six organizational groups provided sealed responses to questions about their organizations' perceived stability and openness of communication; the correlations for the two variables, computed separately for the subjects and for the groups, were negative and statistically significant.

The following conclusions were drawn from the analyses of the data collected: Television production courses involve the students with television production formats identical to those found in the broadcast industry. Expensive and elaborate television productions are not encouraged, due to limited money, personnel, and facilities. Courses dealing with video experimentation in both narrative and electronic forms are less popular and have a very low priority in television production course curricula. Advanced television production courses (and, therefore, advanced television production projects) are extremely scarce, almost nonexistent in the broadcast  curricula. The study concludes that the television production curriculum in colleges and universities in the United States is insufficient and unrealistic in view of the technological advancements and the educational and sociological needs of the times.

Fred Fiedler's Contingency Theory of Leadership Effectiveness emphasizes that a leader's effectiveness is determined by how well his leadership style fits the specific situation. Fiedler uses this theory to analyze the impact of training and experience on leadership effectiveness. Daniel Kunz and Wayne Hoy focus on the leadership behaviors of \"initiating structure\" and \"consideration\" and examine which behavior is more influential on teachers. Donald Piper compares the quality of problem-solving decisions made by individuals with the decisions made by groups and concludes that groups did consistently better  than individuals. By comparing group members' reactions to three types of participative decision making, Carl Lowell demonstrates that the success of participative decision making depends on the method of governance used. The implications of these studies are that principals can do any of several things to increase their effectiveness as leaders, but insofar as leadership needs vary with different situations, there are no absolute guidelines for effective leadership.

Part 1 defines CBE, examines its underlying assumptions, and traces the concepts and practices from which it has emerged. CBE is defined both formally and operationally, and the concept of alternative, partial, and approximate models of CBE is examined. Part 2 outlines a framework for organizing the information needed to make decisions about the content of a CBE program and the procedures for implementing such a program.  Part 3 defines three alternative CBE models and traces the implications two of the models have for the complexity of program operation. All three models are discussed in relation to the variety of possible CBE models and the types of programs possible for any particular model. (Author/JG)",

The second section explores alternative school district responses to decline and argues that the key difference between effective management and simply holding the line lies in the capacity to manage change. The last section offers recommendations for a National Institute of Education agenda on problems of enrollment decline. Three phases of change management are discussed: mobilization of support, implementation of plans for  retrenchment, and institutionalization of change efforts. (Author)",

The researchers discovered that successful staff development program implementation was characterized by three major components: local materials development, online planning, and concrete, ongoing training. Their research indicated two basic types of staff development models--the deficit model and the \"developmental strategy\" model. The developmental strategy model involves teachers and principals in preparing for change and is not standardized. The school district offers consistent financial support and relies on local resource people to guide innovative efforts whenever possible. The researchers conclude that effective staff development depends much  more on the district's point of view about principals and teachers as learners than on the specifics of the staff development program.

This collection of case studies of five urban areas undergoing court-ordered desegregation of schools is intended as a preliminary to more extensive study of the financial problems that school districts encounter in estimating and paying for the cost of school desegregation. The five cities examined are Buffalo, New York, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton, Ohio. In all five cities, the courts have held that the schools have violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The case reports summarize the history of desegregation litigation and the efforts by plaintiffs  and defendants (city and state) to comply with court orders.

This comprehensive measure brought into existence a major federal agency to correct the problem of desertion and nonsupport of children: the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE). The goals of this office are to assist the states in obtaining child support owed by absent parents to their children, in locating absent parents, in establishing paternity, and in enforcing support obligations of absent parents. The purpose of this manual is to prepare OCSE auditors to conduct the first annual audit of child support enforcement programs required  under the law. The independent audits provide key verification of state compliance with federal standards and with federally approved state IV-D plans. The manual serves as the focus and central resource of an intensive training course for OCSE auditors and becomes a reference document and guidebook for performance of the annual audits.

This report analyzes enrollments and expenditures for 1974-75 and those projected for 1980-81 and 1985-86 in terms of these seven goals. It shows that in 1974-75 approximately 82 percent of the expenditures for public education from state and local tax sources was spent on programs in the areas of basic skills and general education. Expenditures per student, however, were highest for programs in advanced and professional skills. Although the report presents a number of statistical findings, it also points out that it is almost impossible to differentiate expenditures between certain of the goals. This  is particularly true for the first two goals, basic skills and general education, since both are often fused together within the same program. (Author)",

It shows that education expenditures will continue to increase while real revenue will actually decrease. It concludes that, consequently, either the growth of education expenditures must be curtailed or the system for financing education must be changed to provide for more revenue. The report includes some of the cost-keeping options open to the state. These options represent extreme measures meant to show the lengths the state education system would have to go in order to reduce expenditures to the level of projected revenue. (Author)",

These three approaches include the &quot;equity through uniformity&quot; approach, implemented through a Full State Assumption school finance model; the &quot;equity through fiscal neutrality&quot; approach, implemented through a Guaranteed Tax Base model; and a &quot;partial&quot; approach to equity, implemented through a combination of a Foundation Program and a Guaranteed Tax Base model. Florida's present school finance distribution system is examined in light of these three approaches, and several alternatives for improving the equity of Florida's school finance system are discussed.

The analysis involved measurement of changes in revenue collections and their relationship to changes in income, changes in population, and changes in prices. More specifically, the analysis involved: measurement of the selected changes over time to determine their long-run average effect on revenues; estimates of the short-run response of revenues to the selected changes; and an analysis of growth and predictability of each revenue source. Findings of the  study indicate a major part of Florida's revenues are structurally inadequate to deal with the present and future needs of the state. If population growth or inflation continues, as is commonly assumed, the state will be faced periodically with revenue shortages. Even if price stability is achieved and economic population growth are slower than expected, these sources cannot be expected to provide stable revenues. (Author/JG)",

This report traces the planning and development of the school's goals, which included involvement of the entire school community, from 1970 through 1974. The analysis is based on a varied data base, which included examination of reports, attendance at planning events, interviews with key individuals, and questionnaires tapping parent, teacher, and student opinion. In examining implementation, the researchers looked at four specific innovative aspects of the Bayridge program and their implications for those concerned about implementing similar programs in their own schools: (1) the flexible  structure, (2) the flat administrative and organizational structure, (3) community involvement in planning, and (4) the emphasis on student responsibility. On the basis of their examination of Bayridge, they identify a number of the elements of a partial theory of planning and implementation of educational change. (Author)",

The program centered around four Educational Management Development Centers consisting of school districts working alone, with other school districts, or with a nearby university. Each center was expected to search out and test new approaches to improving leadership and management in the context of operating schools and school districts. The overall aim of the program was to monitor the search and development efforts of the various centers and to analyze the reasons for their success or lack of success. The report briefly recounts the  history of the program and presents some general conclusions based on the experiences of the centers. The appendix contains an interim review of the program that was prepared near the end of its first year, as well as a summary of a related effort to establish a National Collegial Learning Team on School District Based Administrator Renewal Program, which was made up of representatives of six state departments of education.

The unit of analysis is the organization set, defined as consisting of those organizations with which a focal organization has direct links. Two models of organization-environment interaction are considered--the resource dependence model and the natural selection model. This paper examines the differences in emphasis placed on autonomy versus constraint, and uses it to raise some questions about public policy and the design of human service delivery systems. Examined are two properties of the organization sets of manpower organizations: the size of the set, and the extent to  which organizations in the set are concentrated in particular sectors of the organizational population of a community, or are dispersed across the entire range of possible organizational types.

Three factors are multiplied to compute the basic subsidy that applies to all districts. These factors are the number of students to be educated (weighted average daily membership), local wealth (the market value/personal income aid ratio),  and a measure of local tax effort (earned base). Three additional factors affect some school districts' total instructional subsidy--sparsity factors, density factors, and poverty factors.

Provided in the introduction is a statement of purpose, a brief history of child abuse, a definition (from the federal law), and incidence estimates. Identification is discussed in terms of general signs (such as incongruities in a parental report); signs of abuse in children (broken down into abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse and by whether or not emergency action is required); signs of abuse in the caregiver (such as current behavior, current living situation, and care of other children); and the need for a detailed medical work-up and a non-judgmental interview with the parent. It is stressed that the abuse  need not be proven before being reported. Procedures, followup, and treatment in planning for the abused child and his family are examined. Possible preventive measures such as providing support services to very young parents or parents of handicapped children are suggested. The need for inservice training, orientation of new staff, coordination with other agencies, and education of the public is emphasized. Recommended is an evaluation procedure consisting of the collection of service statistics, process evaluation, and program evaluation. Stressed is the importance of community coordination among agencies, lay groups, and providers of such services as \"hot lines\". Appended is a list of resources including sources of general information and audio-visual aids, parents organizations, and  bibliographic references.

        "description":"The most significant criterion for classifying spelling errors is whether the erroneous form yields the same pronunciation as the intended word. Five categories can be discerned: (1) non-identical pronunciation, non-existent English word; (2) non-identical pronunciation, confusion of existing words; (3) identical pronunciation, English spelling rules broken; (4) identical pronunciation, confusion of homophones; (5) identical pronunciation, overgeneralization of existing English patterns. These can be further subdivided on the basis of omissions, additions, substitutions and transpositions of letters and whether the letter used is pronounced or can represent the intended phoneme in another native English word. An analysis of a corpus of 1,758 English spelling errors made by Finns  and Swedish-speaking Finns reveals that most spelling errors made by Finns are errors of types (1) and (2), due largely to perceptual difficulties, whereas the errors made by Swedish Finns are primarily overgeneralizations of existing English patterns. Whereas Finns make more spelling errors than Swedish Finns at an intermediate stage of learning, they seem to have mastered the English spelling system better than the Swedes at an advanced level. One explanation for this might be that Finns, who, unlike Swedes, have a near-phonemic spelling system in their first language, depend more on the written form of words when they memorize them.

Twenty students enrolled in a third-semester Spanish class at the University of Colorado were simultaneously given multiple choice tests and cloze tests on four cultural essays they studied during the course. Correlations between the two instruments were highly significant and ranged from .32 to .67. It is concluded that the cloze test is a better discriminator of the acquisition of cultural knowledge and is much easier to construct than a multiple choice reading test. Other advantages and disadvantages of using the cloze procedure in the classroom are discussed. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The linguistic literature contains many studies of the structure of the noun phrase. Syntactic structures that occupy NP position but which don't have the internal characteristics of a substantive (infinitives and THAT clauses, for example) are distinguished from lexical structures that occupy NP position and do have the internal characteristics of a substantive (derived nominals, for example). This study is restricted to the morphology of deverbal lexical structures that may occupy NP position. The first part of the study considers the theoretical solutions that have been proposed for treating lexical nominalization. Particular attention is paid to the treatments that lexical nominalizations have received within the theory of transformational grammar. In the second parts of the  study, the morphology of the principal deverbal suffixes in French is analyzed, and the lexical redundancy rules required are stated. In the third part, this study's derivational model is compared with that of Aronoff (1974). This study has led to a distinction between a morphological and morphophonological modification, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, a morphophonological modification and modification that is strictly phonological. Moreover, this study provides reasons to doubt the purported universality of the three morphological laws of ben Moshe. (Author/CLK)",

Chapter one attempts to relate the cross-cultural learning of this program to future vocational, academic, and career objectives. Chapter two identifies the various disciplines and majors in which students are enrolled where significant educational benefits will result from exposure to foreign students. Chapter three identifies seven specific learning objectives: (1) the elite system and study of socialization and leadership; (2) country and area studies; (3) cross-cultural learning; (4) cross-cultural communication; (5) study of national and international  conflicts; (6) cross-cultural dimensions of education; and (7) cross-cultural perspectives on development and underdevelopment. A bibliography of readings is indicated at the end of some learning objectives and modules. After a learning objective has been selected, the student should consult chapters five, six, and seven, which contain specific learning modules or units of learning, designed to implement the learning objectives. The 32 modules are divided into three categories: (1) interviewing foreign students (one-to-one learning), (2) classroom and curricular enrichment programs, and (3) experiential learning projects.

Drill exercises, the second type of activity, include substitution, repetition, transformation, conversation, and question-and-answer drills. Analysis of the language is the third type of activity. Realistic language usage is the fourth type. The text is divided into six sections, each consisting of cycles, drills, and  grammar notes, which concentrate upon a limited number of sentence patterns and structural items.

The participants, a group of secondary teachers of French, German and Spanish, attended courses in cross-cultural communication and language-teaching methodology, in which they acquired ideas about approaches and techniques in language instruction. During the fall of 1976, these teachers put into practice many of the ideas obtained during the summer workshop. They were requested to bring to the January 1977 in-service follow-up meetings one example of an instructional idea used in their classrooms, and to attach commentary which would help others profit from their experience. Sections I - IV contain examples of curriculum  developed in or inspired by the course in cross-cultural communication. These sections provide: audio-motor units, cultural assimilators, &quot;cultoons,&quot; and mini-dramas. The bibliography from this course is attached as Appendix A. Sections V and VI contain material which stems from work done in the course in language-teaching methodology. These sections concern cuisinaire rods (&quot;algebricks&quot;) in the language classroom and personalizing language instruction. The bibliography for this course is attached as Appendix B. The final section, VII, contains units of instruction which did not fit well into any of the first six sections, but appeared to merit inclusion. (Author/CFM)",

Services provided may include student or faculty recruitment, records processing, program development, or program and faculty review. Four basic elements are described that have contributed to the development of educational brokering: general societal factors, characteristics of the educational climate, institutional factors, and the profit motive. The status of educational brokering in  California is reviewed along with its future outlook and policy issues it raises. Among the appendices are a broker questionnaire, institutional questionnaire, list of educational brokers, agent permits, and a list of out-of-state institutions operating in California. (LBH)",

The aim is to develop an environment of collaboration around major areas of concern out of which a wide range of collaborative efforts could develop.

The Hearings method is based on a collaborative-consortial arrangement, where the partners have a broad general concern and where neither the specific needs nor capability of responding are clearly defined. The Hearings were one of four elements funded through a National Science Foundation grant given jointly to the City of Detroit, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State  University, for the purpose of developing consortial means of collaboration in dealing with city problems and making available scientific knowledge and personnel for that purpose. This report describes how the hearings were organized, what happened at them, and what is coming out of that experience. A brief description is also included of collaborative projects resulting from the hearings that will need funding support. (LBH)",

The satisfactions and dissatisfactions of faculty and administrators were determined in on-site interviews. Among the findings and conclusions: (1) medical practice plans have become an essential element in the structure of medical schools; (2) although the primary use for income from these plans is the support of clinical faculty salaries, the income increasingly supports school-wide programs; (3) the importance of an organized and written plan is evident for harmony within the institution; (4) good management is as important as good initial planning; (5) preoccupation with fiscal matters is troublesome to faculty  members; (6) in a number of instances faculty practitioners are provided malpractice insurance, space, and staff without paying full cost; (7) inadequate or widely dispersed physical facilities for ambulatory care are felt to be major problems at some schools; (8) greater flexibility in the use of practice funds has become essential in meeting the program commitments of all schools; and (9) although relationships between full-time clinical faculty and non-faculty community physicians can become strained, the practice plan can become a useful mechanism for achieving a favorable referral policy.

A stratified random sampling of 2,700 faculty (representing over 28,000 full-time medical school faculty members) was used for the survey. Findings show that: (1) faculty have had little formal preparation for their teaching roles, with only 21 percent having taken education courses and 39 percent having attended an educational workshop; (2) faculty make considerably more use of traditional than innovative teaching techniques such as lecturing; (3)  faculty are not thorough in their management of the instructional process; and (4) they express interest in improving their teaching by reading and attending educational workshops, especially in the area of instructional evaluation.

Results show that 22 percent planned to enroll in graduate or professional school immediately after college graduation, and 23 percent planned to enroll sometime later. Another 29.5 percent definitely did not plan to continue at a later time. A lag between the southern states and the rest of the nation in post-college education aspiration was found.

One specific solution--A Network Access Machine (NAM)--is described in detail. It is a minicomputer system that acts as a network access point for a user at his terminal, and assists the user through the automatic execution of access procedures. It allows the user to specify (or to have specified) his own network command sequences for execution on a specified network and host. Computer responses are analyzed to assure agreement with those  anticipated for specific commands. Conditional parameterized expansions allow the use of the same command on different host computers and different networks. (Author/DAG)",

Selection variables are summarized in a matrix of user values and interaction effects. The researcher prefers original documents, and tends to choose subjectively. The operating manager more often stops with abstracts and emphasizes quantifiable factors. The planning manager wants a digest of ideas, not references, and tends to judge a service first as to its reliability. These three functions attach entirely different connotations to the same words for key parameters. They can be linked to the structure of language:  operations is the present participle (doing), research concerns the verbal adjective (state of the art), and planning is in the subjunctive mode (could or should). Apparent conflicts, which may be resolved by dimensional analysis of difference in values perceived, are illustrated by case histories, interviews, and questionnaire results. (Author)",

Critical incidents are defined in terms of four criteria. Then, more than 125 case histories of critical incidents are documented. They are organized by topics which will serve as a taxonomy of matters or issues critical during project development. The report includes summaries and analyses of the processes and procedures and their subsequent effects. CBE was implemented most smoothly when there was  a conscious effort to develop good relations with instructors and administrators. Successful projects were those which had initial plans for procedures, organization, objectives, and evaluation. Evaluation was essential, throughout lesson development as well as after lesson completion. Successful staff members were those whose expertise was not limited to a single area. (Author)",

Students checked out each lesson, viewed it at stations for accounting students, and returned it to the circulation desk. Within several years, three problem areas became evident. First, equipment failure constantly occurred in the form of warped slide mounts, jammed slides, burnt out bulbs, and jammed audio tapes. Second, human frailties  resulted in rearranged or borrowed slides and equipment malfunctions. Third, increased enrollments compounded already existing management problems of equipment shortages, limited supplies of slide-tape sets, and limited staff time to monitor and repair equipment. Finding a solution to these problems led to the use of 4 x 6 color microfiche, each containing 98 images, and the use of portable and stationary microfiche readers. The advantages of the use of color microfiche included: (1) fewer equipment problems under heavy use, (2) fewer student problems, (3) reduced management problems, (4) increased flexibility in student use of study materials, (5) lower software costs, (6) greater compatibility of course materials with existing library microfiche collections, and (7) a greater  compactness in the storage and use of materials.

        "description":"The failure of television research to affect broadcast policy is attributed partially to its methodological inadequacies and its narrow audience. Research tends not to take into account such variables as the program selection behavior itself, the natural viewing context, and other non-content influences. Existing research suggests that television viewing is a parallel rather than an interactive process, but too little has been studied about the effects of television on family interaction and the mediating effects of the family context. These suggest a number of areas which could be profitably investigated. The concept of ecological validity, the sociopersonal as well as the physical context affecting a subject's behavioral system, is a potential strategy for bridging the gap  between research and action. It might overcome both methodological and dissemination limitations. The latter problem might be alleviated by making research more comprehensible and accessible to concerned laymen and thus recruit their help in influencing broadcast regulation. (VT)",

The stimulus materials were slides in three categories: (1) original color (realistic), (2) black and white, and (3) non-realistic color format. Subjects were individually shown 140 stimulus slides for intervals of .5 seconds each. As an immediate post-test each subject was shown the series of stimulus materials plus distractors. A similar recognition session was conducted two weeks later. Analysis of variance procedures were applied to a treatment by subjects design, and in those cases where a significant F-ratio at the .05 level was indicated, further analyses were conducted between all  possible pairs of means via a modified \"LSD\" test. Both color modes were superior to the black and white mode in facilitating immediate recognition of visuals. After a period of two weeks, however, only the non-realistic color mode resulted in significantly higher recognition scores. (VT)",

        "description":"If the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is eventually to serve all citizens with public radio and television, technological and regulatory innovation will be required. Service to rural America and service to specific groups within urban areas cannot be accomplished within the limits of existing technology and existing spectrum allocation policy. Improved service can come from several areas. Cable, video cassettes, and discs can be new spectrums for new audiences. Cable can recreate the entire spectrum as many times as there are cables, but now it is too expensive for complete nation-wide coverage. Video cassettes and discs are spectrums of a sort which can relieve problems of scheduling and transmission in the airways. Yet they, and the equipment needed with them are  expensive, bulky, and not widely used. Communication satellites have three potential uses toward expanding the broadcasting spectrum. In order of increasing complexity and cost, these are the provision of: (1) network service to television stations, (2) signals to unattended &quot;ministations&quot; located in remote areas of the country, and (3) signals to individual home receivers. The spectrum is the critical element to the existence and expansion of public service. The current problems of the UHF band and the FM spectrum will be solved through the development and integration of new satellites, an increased efficiency in any present spectrum usage, and a commitment to today's stations.

Attitudes of lecturers to training were used as the dependent variable. Independent variables were the feedback medium (CCTV and audio) and the type of feedback (low and high structure). The feedback type relates to systematic observation to describe and analyse lecturing. This high structure technique was used in opposition to the normal microteaching supervisor low structure practice of non-directive sessions. Due to the smallness of the factorial cell size, no statistical treatment of the data was possible; however, available data suggest no observable difference between treatments. (Author/DAG)",

The system provided a highly structured technique that the lecturers could use to systematise their discussion of microlectures or real lectures, either recorded on tape or live. Three parameters were \"observed\": non-verbal, verbal, and content aspects of lecturing. These categories were used after the trainees learned the system and could reliably code a lecture into these components. This information was then used by the trainer and trainee as data in analyzing a lecture. A small scale study is reported in which the attitude of the trainees to each of four treatments (systematic observation vs. conventional feedback  and audio vs. closed circuit television augmented feedback) was measured.

Interaction analysis or the systematic observation of lecturing is a technique that has been used in conjunction with microteaching to facilitate the trainer's job in shaping the teaching behavior of the lecturer. A category system was devised to describe the content of lectures, focusing on teaching points, examples, instructional asides, and non-instructional asides. The paper reports on how university lecturers are trained in the system and how they learn to record data collected from their lecturers. These low inference data are then used in microteaching sessions where the lecturers record on videotape their  performance for peer and trainer criticism. The systematic observation data are used to make more objective the trainer's criticism of the microlectures and to provide evaluative data for improving teaching performance. (Author)",

This study timed a sample of 933 citations, drawn from items cited in publications of members of each academic unit within the university. The hypothesis that the optimum size for a specialized collection is between 30,000 to 50,000 volumes was not proved by the results. The significant result of the study is the demonstration that approximately 50% of the time in all libraries but the central collection access time was less than three minutes and approximately 45% less than two minutes. With such a large number of very fast accesses, library policies should be adjusted accordingly. Procedures which increase or  decrease each access by but a half minute significantly affect the time. Travel time to the library in better than half the cases where such a speed of access obtains may be the most significant patron expense. Further research into other factors which may affect speed of access; e.g., shelving arrangement, catalog arrangement, and placement, is recommended. (Author/JPF)",

The study investigated the following questions: (1) Is online search of use to the patrons of a public library? (2) What impact does such a system have on both the library and the patron? (3) What conditions are required for successful use of online reference search in the public library? (4) What are the financial and marketing aspects of such a service? The four participating Cooperative Information Networks libraries performed 2,173 searches during the project. The principal user groups were graduate students, educators, technical  professionals, and librarians. In planning for online search in the public library, nine key requirements were identified. It was determined that a market exists for public library searches of existing data bases among employees and operators of small businesses, college students, and local government officials. The traditionally trained public librarian does have skills that are applicable to the skills required for online searching. Contrary to expectations, no problems were experienced in the mechanics of billing and fee collection, and comments from patrons were favorable to paying for the service. (Author/JAB)",

        "description":"This paper considers three aspects of federal legislation and policy that are critical to an understanding of federal dissemination of research and development and exemplary practice information in education. One of the major difficulties is the variety of viewpoints on what constitutes dissemination. These range from one-way flow of information to all possible activities that might result in desired educational improvement. The second aspect is the complexity of dissemination introduced by federal legislation. Fifty-four different individuals and agencies have responsibility for dissemination in education--from the President to state and local agencies. The third factor is the funding of dissemination. In fiscal year 1975 research and development funding represented less than  half of one percent of the total investment in education. The funding for dissemination was ten percent of all research and development. There is also a mismatch between agency responsibility and agency funding level. The National Institute of Education (NIE), taking these aspects into account, concentrates on four strategies to assist people and agencies with dissemination functions. (Author/KP)",

Section II of this paper outlines the context for continuing library education in terms of: (1) the citizens and their library and information needs; (2) the libraries (public, school, university, institution, special) of the state; (3) the librarians themselves. Section III focuses on eight important Ohio library development issues (funding, interlibrary cooperation, improved library services, library management, public relations, technology, audiovisual services, library standards) and identifies the implications of these issues for continuing  library education. Section IV discusses the resources available to meet the continuing education needs identified. Section V is a statement of the major problems which may inhibit the most effective application of these resources. The next section identifies the major strategic options available to the State Library, including a statement of the relevant goals and identification of some constraints relating to each. The paper concludes with a recommended plan of action and specific program objectives. (Author/JAB)",

Questionnaires were sent to a stratified random sampling of all public school superintendents, principals, and teachers in all school districts with enrollments of 300 or more; the private sector was also represented. General implications suggest that some patterns are beginning to emerge. A major implication apparent even this early is that ITV is being used regularly by 15 million children, about one in  three of school age.

Of the 478 colleges for which the level of participation could be determined, funding distribution per year indicated that 241 colleges (51%) received between $1-$99,000, 150 colleges (31.4%) received between $100,000-$499,000, and 28 colleges (5.9%) received $500,000 or more. Knowledge of the members and institutional voting representation on prime sponsor Manpower Planning Councils appeared to be related to  the level of participation, with those receiving more funding being more informed. Respondents indicated that they viewed the CETA administration as confusing, that they felt the system fails to give adequate emphasis to job training programs, that CETA may not be serving the most needy, and that there is a lack of concern for individual participants. Recommendations for legislative and procedural improvements are included and a statistical summary of survey results is appended. (LH)",

This is followed by a discussion of resource requirements vs. revenue, recent state funding problems, and proposed funding changes developed by an Ad Hoc Committee of community college representatives, with major differences juxtaposed for 1978 and 1979. A rationale for  funding changes is followed by the assumptions used to calculate funding needs, the proposed l979 state community college budget, a revenue/cost illustration, and the board's central office budget in narrative and statistical form. Instructional unit costs by funding categories and full-time equivalent enrollments, college assessed valuations, tax rates, tuition and fee revenue, tax collection loss rates, proposed budget design refinements, grant proposals and projects, the data processing budget, and personal and contractual services budgets are appended.

Bell; here planning, organizing, staffing, direction, and control become conferring, linking, contacting, persuasion, and coordination. B. J. Hodge proposes that college administrators should choose an organizational climate (either traditional, human relations, or human resources) that will produce job satisfaction and organizational productivity. The functions of planning,  organizing, directing, and controlling as they relate to the management of scarce resources is presented by Richard D. Tellier, followed by a discussion by S. V. Martorana and Eileen Kuhns on the subject of team management. Included are role definition, role coordination, team member identification, recruitment and selection, team member professional development, and evaluation of team productivity. Finally, Kichiro K. Iwamoto discusses the management of interpersonal conflicts, arguing for a \"problem solver's\" style in which conflicting persons both achieve personal goals and maintain an effective personal and/or working relationship.

Valid student responses numbered 968. Of this group the average student age was 28, with approximately 60% under 24 years, and half were classified as evening students. Younger students showed greater preference for both peer and teacher affiliation in the learning environment, inanimate (working with objects) content, iconic (pictorial) and direct  experience modes, and overwhelmingly rejected reading as an educational technique. Older students preferred a structured environment stressing organization, detailed instructions and competition, qualitative (verbal) content, and listening and reading modes. The student population as a whole rejected numeric content or qualitative ideas. The disparity indicated in the preferred learning styles of older and younger students suggests a need for new instructional strategies aimed at the younger generation. (LH)",

LACC applicants were significantly lower than the national group in terms of high school grades, number of years study of various subjects, and high school  class rank. Test score means and standard deviations for the SAT verbal, SAT mathematics, SAT verbal sub-scores in reading comprehension and vocabulary, and the Test of Standard Written English (TSWE) indicated that LACC applicants ranked below the 20th percentile in each of these tests.

        "description":"The phenomenal growth in enrollments in occupational courses since the early Sixties signals a new direction for the community college movement. From a predominantly baccalaureate-oriented institution the community college has become an occupational-oriented institution. The statistics on the college, state, and national level attest to this phenomenon. Until the Sixties enrollments in the vocational and technical courses ranked a low second to enrollments in the transfer courses. Today, it is not unusual to find colleges, even entire state systems, whose occupational enrollments exceed transfer enrollments. It is too early for obsequies over the transfer function but the evidence indicates that occupational education is becoming the community college's major function in terms of  credit enrollment. For the next five years enrollments in vocational education will at least equal enrollments in transfer education, a realistic balance in terms of the aptitude and economic status of students and the differentiation of functions among higher education institutions. Enrollments in both of them however may be lower than enrollments in community, adult and developmental education. The danger to the transfer function lies more in the growth of the community education movement than in the growth of occupational education. (Author/LH)",

While the idea of the community college being a center for community activities and providing a wide range of services to the community is appealing, there is considerable discussion about the appropriate role of community colleges as service agencies. An illustration is provided by the more than 100 community colleges and technical institutes in the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) area that have developed programs, services, and activities for older citizens, including: training programs in paraprofessional counseling at Dundalk Community College (Maryland) and Tri-County Technical Institute (South Carolina); a Retired  Senior Volunteer Program at Snead State Junior College (Alabama); a pre-retirement education program at Daytona Beach Community College (Florida); a nutrition education program at Catonsville Community College (Maryland); and the Senior Aides program at Copiah-Lincoln Junior College (Mississippi) which places senior Citizens in public service jobs. Continuing education programs requiring little or no tuition are provided by 38 colleges in the SREB region. While few would question the worth of such programs, there needs to be consensus on what the community service role of the community college is and what it is not. (LH)",

Student services suggestions include pre-counseling services for high school seniors, career counseling centers on campus, academic counseling, testing services, and exit counseling. Actions by state agencies which can help promote student mobility include monitoring community college practices in such areas as equal access and equal opportunity and organizing statewide workshops on student mobility. In the area of curriculum and instruction, suggestions are made for suspension and probation policies, provision of general education in career curricula,  grading, articulation policies, modular instruction, and credit for experience and by examination. Two implementation procedures are presented, stressing a strong commitment to maximum student mobility within a sound educational framework and a program for faculty and staff development.

Students enrolled in eight concurrent developmental writing classes were similarly tested. Those from both groups showing phonic disabilities were utilized as experimental (n=106) and control (n=113) groups to test whether the &quot;typical&quot; community college developmental reading course, which does not pay special attention to phonic skills, is effective in remediating such deficiencies. Post-tests with form 2 of the instrument showed that both groups made small but significant gains, with the experimental group achieving only slightly  higher gains. Sex, instructional time of day (day/evening), and duration of course (semester/summer session) were not significant influences, but pre-test scores were highly predictive of course withdrawal. It was concluded that students completing a typical developmental reading course do not receive treatment that significantly reduces their phonic disabilities and that students who are grossly disabled are not likely to survive such a course.

Local conferences were then developed in four sections of Illinois, using as input video tapes of the material presented at the regional conference. In an attempt to evaluate the effect of the material on the attitudes and opinions of the participants, a pre-/post-test opinionnaire was created to assess the increase or decrease of importance of statements appropriate to the conference objectives. While resulting differences between pre- and post-tests were not statistically significant overall, shifts  toward increased importance were shown in the areas of career counseling, adult opportunities, communication and cooperation with community agencies, placement activities, family life improvement, the provision of cultural activities, and the need to respond to senior citizens. Remaining constant with high importance were job training, transfer programs, service to the disadvantaged, student intellectual ability, community service, and the relevance of the college to the community.

Fifty videotaped sessions of infants during two conditions - eyes covered with an opaque cloth and with a clear cloth - and control periods were conducted. The experimental design combined both longitudinal and cross-sectional observations using a total of 12 infants during the age range of 2 days to 26 weeks. Data analysis involved detailed narrative descriptions of the videotapes; quantitative measures of behavior patterns; and formulation of developmental phases. Four developmental phases for the opaque cloth  defensive reaction are outlined. The infants initially reacted vigorously, swiping at the cloth and closing their eyes. They gradually inhibited agitated movements and maintained longer alert periods. Finally, they removed the cloth by grasping. The clear cloth provoked a much diminished defensive reaction. The infant's ability to actively use visual input in organizing his behavior and the relevance of the observed developmental pattern to theories of repetition of adaptive behavior and of skill development are discussed.

The paper advocates a shift from the current norm of privacy concerning parents' child rearing practices towards increased openness and freer community-family communication. In view of the increase in physical and psychological child abuse and increasing evidence that violence in the home is related to children's tendencies towards aggression and violence, the paper suggests that the society has a responsibility to concern itself with a family's socialization practices, particularly disciplinary practices. It is suggested that a change in this direction should come in the form of social rather than legal sanctions.  Communication concerning socialization practices would then be encouraged through informational and educational programs, through increased availability of professional resources, and through increased community involvement. Intervention into an unhealthy family situation would be considered the responsibility of the community rather than an invasion of privacy. The paper suggests that a family's legal and psychological rights to privacy would not be compromised by the social sanctions for disclosure and communication concerning the single area of child rearing. The paper presents ideas for encouraging family-community communication in this area. (BD)",

Also discussed is the impact of the theories of psychologists G. Stanley Hall, Lewis Terman, and John B. Watson, all proponents of a scientific approach to child rearing. Hall, an evolutionist and a proponent of child study, was responsible for bringing Freud and Jung to the United States. Terman's contributions were the most influential in the measurement movement and in the area of intelligence testing. According to the paper, John B. Watson exerted the greatest influence on parents during the 1920s. His behavorist orientation was  reflected in his emphasis on strict schedules, habit training, and a mechanistic approach to child rearing. Other writers reflected this same orientation. Not until the late 1920s and early 1930s did Freud's theories of unconscious motivation and impulse expression affect child rearing practices. It is suggested that parents were influenced not only by these conflicting theories, but also by memories of their own Victorian upbringing. (BD)",

The educational experiments conducted were of three general types: (1) home-based parent education programs; (2) center-based preschool programs; and (3) combined preschool center and home visit programs. Data discussed in this report include (1) data collected independently by each research group at the beginning of its program and over a number of years after the program ended; and (2) follow-up data collected in 1976-77 when the subjects were 9-18 years old. Measures used in the current follow-up study  include Parent and Youth Interviews, IQ tests, achievement tests, and data from school records. Data were collected for program children and their control or comparison group. Combined results indicate that (1) early education significantly reduced the number of children assigned to special classes; (2) early education reduced the number of children held back one or more grades; and (3) children from all three types of programs surpassed their controls on IQ tests for up to three years after the end of the program. Results, conclusions and implications, methodological problems and further analyses are discussed. (SB)",

Subjects for the study were 16 boys and 16 girls at each of the ages of 7, 10, and 14 years. Each child was administered two types of imitation tasks: an objective task on which children judged the age of unfamiliar persons from photographs and a subjective task on which children judged the attractiveness of unfamiliar persons from photographs. Tasks were also varied by having models agree or disagree on the age and attractiveness judgments. The model dimension was varied by attributing judgments about selected photographs to parents or to strangers. The first hypothesis for the study suggested that older children would be more capable of  differentiating between subjective and objective tasks than younger children and that this in turn would lead to differences in imitation. This hypothesis was confirmed in the models agree condition. The second hypothesis suggested that developmental differences in affective ties to models would influence imitative responses. A more complex interaction was found, however. Results indicated an increase in imitation with age in the strangers agree, strangers disagree and parents disagree conditions, but no change with age in the parents agree condition. Other results indicated significant main effects for age, model and model agreement. Taken together, the results from the study suggest that imitation is influenced by development in interaction with situational factors, including type of  task and type of model. (BD)",

A second goal was to compare children's self reports with their reports on parent emotional responses and also with parents' reports on their own stress-related physiological symptoms. A group of 47 boys and 51 girls, seven to ten years of age, were individually presented with a story of a hypothetical child's confrontation with an anxiety-arousing situation. Each child was asked to imagine being in a similar situation and to rate the degree to which each of ten common physiological responses to stress would be experienced. An adaptation of the Somatic Perception Questionnaire (Children's SPQ) was the  measuring instrument used. The child was also asked to imagine his/her parent(s) in a similar situation and to report what physical symptoms the parent might experience. One or both parents of approximately half the children completed an adult SPQ in reaction to a story psychologically similar to that used with the children. Children's responses revealed no relationship between response and sex or age (in contrast to sex differences noted in the adult responses). Symptoms most often reported by children for themselves were increased heart rate, restlessness and awareness of heart activity. Children's reports on expected parent symptoms differed significantly from their reports on their own experience. In general, the rank order of symptoms based on frequency of response was similar for  child and adult responses. (BF)",

Sixty migrant and non-migrant children participated in the LEAD program. The reading program was evaluated using interviews and field observations to obtain data on congruence testing; student-staff interactions; and perceptions of tutors, teachers, and students. Both pre- and posttest scores on the  independent and instructional subtests of the Spache Diagnostic Reading Scales were obtained for 160 of the 390 children. The LEAD component was evaluated using pre- and posttest data collected on 43 students for reading, 49 students for self assessment, 48 students for school sentiment, and 43 students for self concept. Findings indicated that both programs were strongly supported by all involved. The most common problem in the reading component was the lack of communication between tutors and teachers on a regular basis. Data from the LEAD component showed that the children evidenced significant growth on measures of motivation, attitude toward school, and self concept. (NQ)",

Primary data were collected during a four-year longitudinal study of students attending small schools serving rural areas (Project Rural). Survey questionnaires were mailed to 1,028 high school graduates in 9 rural school districts one year after they graduated. Only 289 of the 1974 graduates responded. Selected data from a national probability sample of 16,000 cases was used to assess the representativeness of the smaller sample, and to compare the differences in attitudes between urban, suburban, small town, and rural senior high school students. Information from a  questionnaire on the activities, ideas, and feelings of the students during their senior year was analyzed to determine which of the items most clearly predicted what the pupils would be doing a year after graduation. Among the major conclusions were: few rural graduates one year after graduation were leaving their home communities to seek jobs elsewhere; graduates usually left to continue their education; patterns of postgraduate activities were very different across school districts and not easily explained by community demographic differences; when district variations were averaged out, rural, small town, suburban and urban graduates were &quot;surprisingly similar&quot; in terms of values, attitudes and in their evaluations of the schools.

The rationale for extending the instructional process beyond the school building itself is as sound today as it was a quarter century ago. Direct experience learning relies heavily on sensory awareness. From a beginning of two summer courses in outdoor education offered in 1954, the curriculum has grown to a total of 21 courses today, 7 of which were added in the last 12 years. Six courses are offered by the department on the undergraduate level. A major in the subject is offered in the graduate  curriculum. During the 1976-77 academic year, 165 students were majoring in Outdoor Teacher Education and in 1976, 339 students attended the summer session. In the past 12 years, the department offered 81 extension courses in 38 communities, and 4 foreign study tours and 4 travel courses were conducted during various summer sessions. A total of 314 students have completed graduate degrees in the department.

During the year, 12,124 migrant children were served. Regular school term projects focused on supplementing and reinforcing instruction in language arts and mathematics for elementary school students. Instruction was essentially tutorial in nature. Minimal health and social services were provided when other funding sources were inadequate or unavailable. Summer programs provided a full range of instructional and  supportive services. Secondary school students were involved in prevocational and occupational instruction. Language arts, reading, and mathematics were emphasized in the elementary school. Instruction varied from tutorial to large group activities. All available information indicated the program was adequately meeting its objectives. Using project evaluations, test data, monitoring reports, and other documentation, this 1977 report presents data on the program objectives, new projects, enrollment, grade placement, instructional and supportive activities, program coordination, staff development and utilization, community involvement, dissemination, interstate planning, test results, exemplary programs, and state and local education agencies program management.

Specifically, this document presents information on: the development of the land grant institutions and subsequent campus involvement in rural development; recent state action (attempts by southern states to train local manpower for jobs with incoming industries); Federal action (the Rural Development Act of 1972 and resultant research and extension programs); private action (the joint efforts of private organizations and colleges prior to 1972); current campus action reflecting multidisciplinary approaches in  agriculture, medicine, veterinary medicine, nursing, mental health, law, engineering, social work, librarianship, child care, and adult education; and a new era for education (the new emphasis in rural development is quality of life improvement, rather than economic improvement, and the implementation of this task is perceived as involving careful planning, cooperation, and coordination on the part of government, universities, and other interested groups). Also included in this newsletter is a list of rural research centers at southern institutions (University of Texas, University of North Carolina, University of Georgia, University of Florida, North Carolina State University, Tuskegee Institute, West Virginia Wesleyan, University of Kentucky, West Virginia University, etc.)  (JC)",

The guide covers innovation and its relationship to education's goal and objective; factors affecting educational change within the school, community, and administration; and the community's role in the educational change process. The implementation of an integrated career education program is described in terms of the administrative plan, curriculum development, instructional development teams, pupil personnel services, school organizations and activities program, placement services, staff development, community involvement, advisory committees, and evaluation. Three levels of career education programs are discussed: the elementary  school program which should be developmental; the junior high school program which is basically explorative; and the senior high school program which provides opportunities for investigating careers in depth. Key considerations in making a cooperative vocational education program operational are suggested. Four types of community-based experiences in career education are also described: interviews, shadowing (when a student spends a day with a worker at work), field trips, and resource speakers. For the most part, these activities involve the teacher, a single student, a group of students, or the entire class, parents, and the community. (NQ)",

Section II (February 1970) addresses the problems of alcoholism prevention, control, and treatment (direct personal services via both professionals outside the community and nonprofessionals within the community; thorough, coordinated training for those providing services to alcoholics and/or their families; major health education principles and methods; community relationships which utilize  the Indian Health Service as a catalyst for program development; the importance of data collection, research, and evaluation in any alcoholism program; and a suggested approach to program planning, including 12 specific recommendations). Section III (April 1970) is a reference guide to alcoholism programs and resources (includes a glossary of common words used in literature on alcoholism, short descriptions of a few of the modern methods of alcoholism treatment, and a list of organizations and agencies which can provide information, consultation, and, in some cases, financial support for community alcoholism program development).

Although changes are necessary in all facets of the administration of the justice system, substantive progress is being made. For example, the Office for Improvements in the Administration of Justice has been established to study various alternative approaches to bringing the justice system closer to the people. This office has already set up experimental neighborhood justice centers in three major cities to serve as local citizens dispute resolution centers to keep minor crimes out of the state court systems so the major crimes may be given priority. Among the more specific proposals that may,  in the future, affect corrections employees are: the proposed legislation to update and revise the Federal criminal code; the legislation which would grant the Attorney General authority to institute civil actions in the Federal courts to redress deprivations of constitutional rights, and to intervene in litigation where it has been alleged that prisoners have been deprived of such rights; and the ongoing development of standards for Federal prisons. Many corrections administrators are viewing these proposals in the light of problems that might develop after their enactment. (NQ)",

The Library Work Order Processing System, as tried between January and March, 1974, was designed to permit each worker more variety of jobs. The technical services department was divided into three levels: a librarian, a technical assistant, and three clerk typists. Under the new system, all jobs in the department were divided into small units so that a library assistant could finish a unit in a few hours or a day. Each unit carried a written work order with a detailed job instruction issued by the librarian, and each unit was to be finished by one person. The workers responsibility and a sense of the importance of  the assigned work because they knew that their evaluation or promotion would be based on these work records. The three month experiment with the system was evaluated in three aspects: production statistics; absenteeism; and workers' job attitudes as measured in personal interviews. The results were considered outstanding on all three measures, and permanent implementation of the system was recommended. (Author/SL)",

These collection and staff figures are accompanied by specific confidence and tolerance levels. An evaluation of the products of these formulas tends to substantiate the study hypotheses which states that the new standards are apt to move libraries toward a common level of mediocrity. Modifications needed to make the current  formulas effective and suggestions for further standards' research are presented in the form of conclusions and recommendations.

These characteristics were examined in light of interlibrary loan criteria set forth in a major report on library cooperation by the Audits Division of the California Department of Finance. Circulation data gathered from the libraries of UC, Berkeley and California State University, Sacramento formed the basis for the examination. Using a classification algorithm developed by the Audits Division, it was ascertained that 82 percent of the books in the sample were high-use, while only 13 percent of the sampled books would have been available or eligible for  interlibrary loan. It was determined that the highly dedicated delivery system recommended in the auditor's report could not be justified without a substantial revision of the resource sharing criteria. Statistical tables include status and location of materials, and use patterns. (Author/DS)",

They connect works of art with sources and documents referring to their origin, their artists, and their techniques, and are interested in biographies and the reconstruction of the original environment of a work of art. Art historians of the past, on the other hand, did not call themselves by that name. They were poets, mimists, historians and chroniclers, architects, painters, naturalists, travelers, biographers, statesmen, members of the clergy, or private collectors, who in their writings touched one or another aspect of our present complex method of writing art history. By combining bits of information offered by  authors from Homer to the 19th century, present historians can collect descriptive and historical information about ancient art works. Rare books are primary sources for such information. (Author/LS)",

Students proved to be well prepared, highly motivated, and well received by other inmates and the security guards. Students were paid the same remuneration they would earn in state use industries. This money, supplemented by federal grants, veterans benefits, and scholarship funds, helped to pay tuition costs. Despite the fact that the college and prison are located in different counties, inmates were permitted the in-county tuition rate, on a contract basis. A full range of library services was afforded to the inmate students by  providing a computer print-out of college library resources and by supplying ordered materials by means of a regular van delivery service. While there was no budget available for a full-time college counselor, a select group of counselors were organized into a &quot;pool&quot; system. The program seemed to accomplish two things: it engendered a feeling of self worth and pride in the inmate-students; it afforded the students a new, positive perspective on traditional values and the institutions of society.

In order to ascertain faculty attitudes toward innovative curriculum and instruction, 74 social science and English/foreign language instructors at five Florida community colleges were interviewed and asked to complete a questionnaire, one section of which required objective responses, and the other subjective, open-ended answers. About 75 percent of the respondents, in varying degrees, indicated that the rate of innovation in community college curricula should be reduced, at least for the immediate future. Many of the respondents pointed out that many innovative teaching  formats have resulted in such phenomena as academic grade inflation, erosion of academic standards (including reduced student ability to write and, thus, to succeed in formal subjective or written examinations), and too little emphasis on cognitive learning. Respondents were not opposed to innovations per se, but felt that new formats should be required to prove themselves before their wholesale adoption. More uniform faculty and administrative policies are called for in order to prevent further erosion of academic standards. (NHM)",

The planning process begins with an estimation decision, i.e., whether the program idea is worth investigating. This decision can be divided into seven sub-questions or systems: (1) Identity--what should be the general content of the program? (2) Articulation--does the program fit college, local, regional, and state plans? (3) Resources--does the college have the resources to conduct the program? (4) Students--how many and what kinds of students will the program attract? (5) Employment--will graduates be able to obtain jobs commensurate with their training? (6) Support--will the program be supported within the college and community? (7) Evaluation--how will the program be evaluated?  The second stage of the planning process is the precision phase, when the decision whether to implement the program is made. This phase requires a more rigorous investigation of the proposed program and involves four steps: strategy, detailed investigation of the seven subsystems, assessment and decision, and, when necessary, the preparation of a final program proposal. Part II of this document outlines the historical and theoretical context of the system, and Part III presents a simulation of the system at work. (NHM)",

The developmental stages in the process included brainstorming, needs assessment, resource specification, strategy development, evaluation, and redesign. The instructional strategy involved an interactive setting in which each of several small groups simulated a college committee confronting a sample staff development problem. Twenty-three problem situations are presented in this manual with selected tentative solutions developed by the symposium study groups. Five position papers written by workshop consultants are included, which  served as the theoretical and informational background for the symposium. These papers cover: (1) the need for staff development; (2) incentives for participation in staff development programs; (3) instructional development as a major ingredient of staff development; (4) specifying objectives, developing strategies and evaluation; (5) instructional design as a team process. Working forms and guidelines are included, and bibliographies and reference materials are appended. The workshop design is conceived as a prototype for organizing similar workshops on two-year college campuses. (Author/NHM)",

Selected personal dimensions of the sample population were examined to chart each individual's personality, theoretical learning preferences, modalities of inference, and intellectual disposition. Faculty were additionally administered a Teaching Styles Inventory. The findings were utilized in an inservice training program which contrasted student and faculty learning styles with faculty teaching styles; as a result, faculty were committed to a more creative concept of quality and efficiency in teaching. Two strategies were employed in assessing the effectiveness of this commitment: first,  students ranked instructors on a number of instructional practices; second, grade point averages were compared at entry and exit levels, revealing a significant rise. On the basis of information gained in the study, a Classification of Instructional Competencies was devised which categorized professional behaviors (technical, therapeutic, conative) in six areas (curriculum, instruction, evaluation, college service, professional activities, continuing education) into a series of detailed goal statements. A survey of the literature, bibliography, and cognitive mapping instruments are appended. (NHM)",

The effective implementation of the Uniform Accounting Manual by the colleges establishes reasonable continuity between classifications. The community colleges furnish data on midterm enrollments, course credits in semester hours, direct costs for instruction, and other departmental costs. Indirect costs are reported in total dollar amounts which are allocated to each instructional  area on the basis of the proportion of course credit hours generated in the given area to the total credit hours generated by the college. The bulk of this report is made up of reorganizations of the data to show various interrelationships. The study is designed to provide information necessary to planning, evaluation, and management.

Among five alternative formats for the evaluation instrument, those polled preferred a multiple choice format.  The selected characteristics of effective instructors closely paralleled the characteristics cited in the literature of the field.

Duplicate questionnaires were sent to Academic Affairs and Student Affairs offices in each of the community colleges polled. Results indicated that more than 50 two-year institutions in the survey region are in some measure involved in foreign study activity. Unfortunately, few community colleges engage in follow-up studies on students who take part in such programs, which hinders further programmatic development. Community colleges, unlike many senior institutions, tend to provide short-term programs abroad (under  eight weeks). Most community colleges stated that foreign programs were \"organized and administered by the institution in cooperation with private travel agencies.\" This plan seems to explain the decided travel rather than foreign study character of many community college programs, which tends to cause credit transferral problems with receiving senior institutions. The development of college-wide advisory committees and more interinstitutional cooperation between community colleges are recommended. (NHM)",

A team-teaching method of instruction, supplemented with audio-taped lectures, was used in medical-surgical nursing classes in 1974 (77 students). Compared to classes the year before (73 students), when the traditional one-teacher lecture method was used, the experimental, team-teaching group scored significantly higher on the National League for  Nursing tests for Medical-Surgical Nursing II. In addition, the proportion of students passing the State Board Examinations was significantly higher for the experimental group (94 percent) than for the control group (77 percent).

The participants also engaged in microteaching experiences, concentrating on skills of fluency in asking questions, reinforcement, probing questions, and various higher  order questions. This procedure allowed participants to focus on individual technical teaching skills. Other activities included audio-tutorial programs, multiple-choice test construction and test-item analysis, independent listening, assigned readings, behavioral objectives, small group discussions, and simulation.

Descriptions of individual projects, along with evaluations by the grantees, an analysis by college and amount of funds, and an analysis by objective are presented. The funding strategy for the IDG program was based on the assumption that a small amount of money ($3,500 per grant) would be sufficient to stimulate faculty experimentation and, at the  same time, allow a larger number of faculty projects. Recommendations include: an improved evaluation system for individual projects; a change in project emphasis from instructional resources; an increase in project visibility from one campus to another; steps to assure comprehensive, rather than individual, faculty development.

        "description":"Educational television is one part of a coordinated instructional system which also utilizes faculty Course Advisors, texts, syllabi, and the instructional support services of the Los Angeles Community Colleges. Educational television extends access to students who are not enrolled in on-campus programs and provides an alternative mode of instruction for students who are attending classes on campus. Data for campus and television enrollments from 1970-74 are presented for five courses: Art 1, Astronomy 1, Geography 1, Health 10, and Psychology 1. The data reveal no significant decrease in enrollments on campus which could be caused by the television courses. The data also reveal that the distribution of grades earned by students enrolled in television courses does not vary  significantly from the distribution of grades in on-campus sections of the courses. Graphic depictions of the data, which make up over half of this document, cover enrollments and grade distribution. Appended are tabular formulations of the same data. (Author/NHM)",

There are four steps required to initiate such a program: (1) Identification--each college must identify the general types of organizational entities and population segments (private industry, residential areas, government agencies) within its area with a high potential need for general or specialized educational programs; (2) Qualification--a detailed examination of identified potential customers in order to select those best suited for analytical investigation; (3) Subdivision--a determination of the most accessible and  desirable segment of the customer's educational needs in order to specify objectives and time frames and to forecast costs; (4) Implementation--the selection of a delivery system that best meets the needs of the target population. An educational telephone network is described as representative of a media-oriented delivery system which may be utilized in place of traditional classroom instruction. Appended are a summary of an evaluation of an educational telephone network course and a cost-effectiveness study. (Author/NHM)",

        "description":"A 10-month study by a select committee of students, faculty, and staff in 1973 resulted in a new form of student government at El Camino College (California). The new governmental format features five to seven member student councils in each of the 12 academic divisions of the College. Each of these 12 councils sends two representatives to an all-student Senate which attends to the interests and needs of the total student body. The Senate selects a president who is assisted by three vice presidents, relating to the areas of instruction, student personnel, and finance. This report summarizes some of the activities of the 12 divisional student councils and the Student Senate during the 1974-75 college year and identifies participants in the student government program. An evaluation  of the program reveals that most of the recommendations of the select committee have been fully, or to some extent, implemented during the 1974-75 college year. In addition, former criticisms of student government have been relieved, while the objectives of the new government are being achieved. The new system provides increased opportunity for student input into the life of the college community, and its strength lies in the relationship which is developing between student government and the instructional program.

In the summer of 1975, the same group was surveyed again in order to compare the perceptions and aspirations reported by the graduates one year after graduation with those reported immediately after graduation. The 1974 survey had a 73.9 percent response rate, while the 1975 follow-up had a 60 percent response rate. The graduates had encountered no difficulty in finding employment. All but one were working in Kern County, and most of them expected to remain in Kern County. Acute hospital nursing was the present and anticipated future type of employment. All had encountered on-the-job orientation in their hospital  jobs, and most felt it to be effective. The enthusiasm that the graduates exhibited toward the nursing program in 1974 had not diminished a year later. However, 57.1 percent did rate their total nursing program only adequate as it pertained to the real world. Most desired continuing education courses, particularly in coronary care. Most nurses were enthusiastic about their jobs. In view of the nursing shortage, an expansion of the nursing program is recommended. A sample of the questionnaire and cover letter is appended.

        "description":"The degree to which Fresno City College (California) is meeting the curricular needs of its students is examined in this study of 234 students and 26 faculty. An analysis of student preferences toward 20 selected learning modes is compared to the amount of time which faculty devote to each. High correlation between preference and practice exists in the use of demonstrations, slides, discussion, small groups, tutorials, and programmed materials, while wide discrepancies occur in the areas of laboratory time, lecture method, homework, flexible course length, attendance options, and the availability of a modular calendar. Whereas faculty report that homework and lectures are the prime methods of instruction, students ranked these 15th and 20th, respectively. In addition, the student  survey revealed a strong desire for greater flexibility both in the time spent in class and the length of the calendar; however, faculty rated these areas quite low. It is recommended that faculty be made aware of these discrepancies and be provided with incentives to modify their approaches to learning. A review of the literature dealing with faculty resistance to innovation is undertaken and survey instruments are included. (LO)",

This self-contained course in elementary formal logic is designed for use in conjunction with Kalish and Montague's &quot;Logic--Techniques of Formal Reasoning&quot; (1964). Upon completion of this course, the student is expected to: (1) translate between ordinary literal English and formulations of symbolic logic, using Kalish-Montague notation; (2) construct valid derivations in the sentential and first-order predicate calculi; (3) lay a foundation for subsequent studies in mathematics as a systematic study of the properties of numbers; (4) learn how to study logic and mathematics  independently. Although there are no formal prerequisites, it is recommended that the student complete a course in informal logic, read with considerable skill, and be able to interpret terse, non-redundant, literal English. The basic course is divided into four units, with a fifth optional unit available to students who wish to work for an &quot;A&quot; grade. All testing is done as the student proceeds from one unit to the next. For each unit of study, the student must perform one translation from English to logic and one derivation selected from the text. The basic course is expected to require about 165 hours. (NHM)",

The prototype is designed to allow flexibility at any point in order to accommodate the needs of different locales. In order to avoid over-specializing the student and limiting his horizontal mobility,  an occupational cluster or job-family approach is employed. However, the curriculum is sufficiently specialized to meet the demands of the employer as to job entry skills.

Meanwhile, a comparison of enrollment trends was made from officially audited enrollment statistics covering the period 1970-75. This comparison depicted total enrollments, full-time and part-time equated students, and full-time and part-time enrollments. In addition, a hand count of the first 50 percent alphabetical sample of individual part-time student registrations was made to determine the ratios of daytime to nighttime students, and male to female daytime part-timers. The Nominal Group Process was applied to an evening Education 101 class of part-time  students to determine what problems such students experience at HACC. The part-time student enrollment at HACC has increased from 33 percent to 50 percent during the past five years. A survey of the related literature indicates that this trend is nationwide. Although the literature stereotypes the part-time student as an evening adult student, a large number of young daytime students are enrolled part-time at HACC. The author recommends that programs be developed to accommodate contemporary part-time student needs. (NHM)",

        "description":"As a field learning experience, 14 students at College of the Mainland (Texas) examined the structure and components of community leadership in Texas City, Texas. The students were divided into two groups, under the direction of a humanities staff member. The first group, using the reputational study technique, asked community residents to identify the leaders in the community. The second group, using the decision analysis technique, approached leaders in public health, planning, zoning, education, and business. Each leader was asked what the most important decision made in the last five years in his particular area had been, and who had made that decision. After obtaining a list of 24 influentials, the two groups combined to interview the identified leaders. After discussing  interviewing procedures, and role-playing both interviewer and interviewee, each student was assigned an interview. After the first round of interviews, the list of community leaders was narrowed to 13. Final interviews were conducted with nine of these leaders. The leadership emerged as loose, informal, and somewhat jurisdictional. It is hoped that the study findings will be of some use to the college leadership in planning community services. Copies of the project proposal and its &quot;statement of use&quot; are appended, as are copies of survey instruments. (NHM)",

At the end of the semester, each student was interviewed using a structured interview  technique. Neither course grades nor GPAs differed significantly among the three groups. However, significantly fewer students in the tutored groups withdrew from the course. In addition, the structured interviews showed that student attitudes in the tutored groups were significantly more positive toward both mathematics and all other courses. The pattern of increased persistence and positive attitude of the tutored group continued during the two years following tutoring. Data are organized into charts and tables, and a bibliography is appended. (NHM)",

The sample, representing over 90 percent of the students enrolled in ADN programs, were generally from middle and lower-middle socioeconomic backgrounds, but students from all areas of Illinois and the full range of ethnic groups were included. Students in the older age range achieved GPAs approximately one grade point higher than the younger subjects. Similarly, married women achieved GPAs one grade point higher than their single counterparts. However, the GPAs of those with  previous nursing experience as compared to those without experience were almost identical. On the second order interaction, older married women without experience had significantly higher GPAs than older married women with experience. The author associates the results of this study with the need for nursing students to make a definite commitment to their field of study. Data are organized into three tables and charts.

(1) Pre-retirement Education: courses should include the psychology of aging, family structures, estate planning, federal laws that affect the elderly, employment opportunities, and leisure time activities. Pre-retirement counseling programs should be developed. (2) Continuing Education: a comprehensive campus-based education program for the aged should involve free transportation, convenient locations, and flexible hours; similar courses should be offered at nursing homes, senior citizens centers, and community schools. Enrollment should be increased in vocational education programs which could lead to rewarding  second careers or part-time jobs. (3) Para-professional Gerontology Programs: existing nursing courses should place greater emphasis on dealing with older people, special seminars on dealing with the aged should be offered, and an in-service training program should be developed in nursing homes. A two-year associate degree and certificated programs in geriatric care should be established. The report concludes with a discussion of possible federal, state, local, private, and public funding sources. (NHM)",

In addition, a questionnaire was designed and administered to obtain data pertaining to the inmates' personal, educational, and incarceration histories and their personal goals. The psychological profile indicates a need to enhance the inmates' concepts and understanding in the areas of responsibility, tolerance, socialization, self-concept, and personal well-being. Curriculum development in these areas is recommended. Interest in courses as indicated by the inmates suggests curriculum expansions in English, drama, speech, and human relations. An exceptionally high level of interest in the business area suggests a need for increased course offerings in this field as well.

Prior contact with community colleges was  limited, although 42 percent held community college teaching certificates. Nearly half of the respondents indicated that they learned of the position through the grapevine, and many others were contacted directly by the college; formal placement offices and programs were rarely cited as having played a role in obtaining the positions.

The concept of incorporation of the classroom setting with individualized instruction i n the learning center, utilizing the discipline instructor, as well as the specialist, widens the impact of educational aid available to the student. Dr. Fea examines six affective elements of study which yield  evidence that the affective component may be more potent than the cognitive component. His categorizations include: the unfinished task, busy work, remebering and forgetting, time planning, rationalization, and personalization of material. The majority of the conference was planned as group discussion with four designated topics: reading, mathematics/science, English, and developmental centers. Two paper s are included on reading. The first discusses content areas and informal diagnosis of level of reading attainment, and the second provides a confluent reading/writing fundamentals curriculum. (NHM)",

This paper focuses on three variables which contribute to the presence of subjectivity in performance evaluation. The first of these is psychological and includes such factors as judgment, power relationships, and the influence of rumor. If \"getting along with others,\" a category which can only be judged subjectively, is omitted as a performance objective, assessment is neglected on the criterion most often at the heart of dismissal. Judgment also enters the evaluation process when performance objectives are being set, and when assessing how well the administrator has achieved his objectives. The second variable which contributes to  subjectivity is the atmosphere of the college. Socioeconomic and political variables must provide adequate time for the long and demanding evaluation process, and the atmosphere of the college must favor those who participate. Third, factors external to the college, e.g., laws which mandate achievement of balance in ethnic or sex categories, and supply and demand of administrators play a subtle , but significant, role in reducing objectivity.

Four forms of community intervention are identified. (1) By its participation in college programs and services, the community is the primary determinant of institutional success. (2) Two-year colleges must rely on local and state support for their operating revenues. (3) College development can be influenced through community support on key financial issues. (4) College resources, staffing, and facilities depend on community-initiated legislation. These identifications lead to a series of recommendations that will need to be implemented if the challenge of community-based  education is to be met successfully. (1) There must be an expansion of community involvement in the institutional decision making process. (2) Research and planning techniques must be applied to the assessment of community need for nontraditional programs. (3) Community-based pilot programs should be started in carefully selected off-campus locations. (4) Participative systems of management should be implemented in community learning centers.

Honors programs occur most frequently in rural community colleges, and least frequently in newer, nontraditional suburban colleges. The administration of honors programs is  usually through the academic affairs rather than the student affairs sector of the college.

        "description":"As part of a student follow-up system, a survey was conducted of employers of 1973-74 career program graduates of Montgomery College (MC). The survey was divided into three major areas: the value of an associate degree in the working world, an evaluation of the job preparation given to MC graduates, and suggestions for improvements in individual curricula. Although there were 280 graduates of career curricula, only 96 of them (34 percent) gave permission for their employers to be contacted. The 77 responses represent an 80 percent return rate. Graduates were working to a great degree either for private firms or local government agencies, primarily in Montgomery County. While most of the employers employ other two-year college graduates, the majority of them indicated they did not  give preference to associate degree holders. On the other hand, earning an associate degree while on the job increases promotion chances and upgrades one's position in terms of job tasks and responsibilities. Job preparation and performance were viewed as adequate to more than adequate overall. Respondents indicated that they would hire other MC graduates in the same skill area. The findings of this study were seen as virtually identical to those of a similar employer survey conducted in 1973. Data are tabulated, and the survey instrument is appended. (NHM)",

The data presented here represent responses from 577 institutions (88 percent). The survey instrument consists of nine questions designed to elicit responses in the areas of special curriculum and program design, funding, the availability of a women's resource center, community-school interrelationships, publicity, the degree of concern for women, and the need for a national clearinghouse on women's programs at community colleges. Over half of the responding institutions offer special programs for women which currently take two  major forms: specialized credit courses in academic areas and non-credit offerings. Most of these programs are financed directly by the colleges or by student tuition. Respondents reported that various methods are employed to inform women about programs and campus activities. Only 73 institutions (12.7 percent) have women's resource centers in operation. While there is considerable concern for women students in the colleges, one-fifth of the deans still perceived \"little concern.\" Almost half of the respondents believe that a national clearinghouse would be helpful.

Dr. Hakanson, a community college president, believes that unless we can successfully introduce the human dimension into our technologically based and production oriented culture, we will continue to see increasing disaffection among larger and larger segments of the population. He postulates a \"creative society\" in which social units will be structured so that people can and will identify with them, and with each other. If schools are to take a leadership role in structuring such a society, they must expand many of the activities going on today under the banner of community services. Schools and community colleges will become distribution centers for social and health services. Carl Hough, a Boeing Company administrator, focuses  his remarks on the technological forces which may influence change, including lasers, computers, and satellites. Miner H. Baker, a working economist, stresses human elements rather than technological forces. He sees a movement toward an older, more stable population, living in a social structure without racial or sex discrimination. He sees an end to environmental and energy problems, but a continued inflationary thrust in the econom y at a level well above the historic average. (NHM)",

Dr. Cosand's paper seeks to define what constitutes a top quality community college president. There are many styles of presidential leadership; however, the possibility of a president's providing strong and enlightened leadership depends on his effectiveness in listening, planning and research, delegating responsibility, and on his personal integrity and consistency. The president, by nature of the office, has the never-ending responsibility of coping with both internal and external problems, including problems on the board, with other administrators, with the faculty, and with students. In addition, there are continuous problems of differing complexities to work out with the community, with  local and state politicians, with business, industry, labor, the professions, and the media. The first reactor, the president of a small rural college, amplifies upon Dr. Cosand's remarks, especially with respect to the relationship between the college and the state and federal governments. The second reactor defines the setting as the dictator of the extent to which certain skills are requisite for effective leadership. The third reactor provides his own definition of a community college president, based on Dr. Cosand's model. (NHM)",

The program at Mendocino focuses on the World Food Crisis, an area of study which is well-suited to the agricultural character of the local community. In order to achieve consensus on the curriculum goals of the program, the planning team participated in a modified Delphi study. Three goal categories--Knowledge, Skills and Abilities, Attitudes and Values--were considered separately, and formed a basis for further development of specific instructional objectives in each of the related disciplines of the project. An explanation of the Delphi technique employed and the results obtained in  one of the goal categories, Knowledge, are included in the document.

The population included higher percentages of older students, married students, veterans, and military personnel than in national norm group populations.  Most new students had been in a general or college preparatory curriculum during high school. Although high school class standing did not prove a reliable indicator of general program choice, many students' career and academic choices and goals seemed to reflect their parents' socioeconomic background.

The class was divided into three age groups--20-29, 30-39, and 40 or older--and four hypotheses were tested. (1) The American College Test scores proved to be significantly higher in the younger groups than in the older group. (2) The mean test scores on the National League for Nursing tests at the end of the course did not differ significantly among the age groups. (3) The final grades of the course were slightly higher in the 20-29 age group than in the older groups. However, the  final grades of the older students were adversely affected because all the test grades for the course were averaged. Grades for the older groups generally improved as the course progressed. (4) Evaluations of clinical performance made by hospital instructors showed that older students were rated higher in performance, attitude, and attendance. Since older students make more progress and increase skill in test-taking after getting \"back into training,\" the use of test scores as an entrance requirement would seem to be discriminatory.

This study compares the data generated in the California survey to data generated by administering a Spanish language version of the same survey to 76 faculty and 86 students at a private urban junior college in Puerto Rico in 1975. The traditional Hispanic deference values of obedience and politeness are more important to the Puerto Rican students and faculty than to their Californian counterparts, who placed a higher value on freedom and independent action. In contrast to the California respondents' rankings, the welfare values in Puerto Rico (a  comfortable life, sense of accomplishment, ambition, capability) are disvalued in relation to the deference values. The high rank given to salvation in Puerto Rico reflects traditional values. Comparing Puerto Rican rankings to those of an American sample in the same economic group reveals that culture, not economics, is the differentiating factor. The implications the results carry for the importation of teaching strategies from the mainland are analyzed, and a series of recommendations for adapting teaching methods to Puerto Rico are presented.

(2) Are there discernible differences between the effects on children of a HSPV experience and a conventional Head Start experience? (3) Do PV models differ in their effects on Head Start children? Five outcome measures were used: three measures of cognitive achievement, one of  general intelligence, and one of motor control. Major findings indicated that: the Head Start experience substantially increased children's test scores on all five outcome measures; that children who had prior preschool experience gained less overall than children whose first year of preschool was in Head Start in 1970-71; and that there seemed to be no consistent differences among Mexican American, black, and white children in their Head Start gains on the five outcome measures.

Results show an absence of sex differences in means and sigmas of BI scores; however, reliable differences in the correlational  patterns associated with BI as a function of sex suggest that instrumental behavior in response to barriers is moderated by different psychological structures in boys and girls at age 4. These findings imply that analysis of covariance is essential in the evaluation of sex differences in barrier research. (GO)",

        "description":"An investigation of changes in functioning of mothers and fathers following divorce is presented in this paper. Subjects were 24 white middle class boys and 24 girls and their divorced parents, from homes in which custody had been granted to the mother, and the same number of children and parents from intact homes. A multimethod approach, including interviews, observations, diary records, and personality measures, was used to assess parent characteristics, child characteristics, and family interaction. Parents and children were administered these measures at two months, one year, and two years following divorce. Results show that when a father leaves the home following divorce, the family system is in a state of disequilibrium. Disorganization and disrupted family functioning  seem to peak at one year and be restabilizing by two years following the divorce. Stresses in family functioning following divorce are reflected not only in parent-child relations but in changes in life-style, emotional distress, and changes in attitudes toward the self of the divorced couple. It is suggested that these changes in the parents may be mediating factors in changes in the child's behavior. (Author/BRT)",

The social behaviors of 14 children from 1 to 2-1/2 years of age were observed at home and in a laboratory playroom. The social context was varied along three broad categories of stranger characteristics: familiarity to the child, personal qualities of the individual, and type of behavior performed by the stranger. Data were analyzed by sex of infant, by the degree to which infants demonstrated social competence with their mothers, and by infants' familiarity with the observed situation, as well as by characteristics of the strangers. Results were interpreted to illustrate the need  for experimenters to take into account characteristics and behaviors of testers and observers in assessing infant social development. In addition, it was suggested that by the time children are 14 months old, and increasingly over the next year and a half, they spontaneously initiate positive social behavior and are appropriately responsive to adults whom they have never met before.

        "description":"This paper describes the rationale for the Defining Issues Test (DIT), an objective test of moral judgment which attempts to improve upon three aspects of Kohlberg's research: data collection, categorization of moral judgments (the scoring system), and method of indexing a subject's progress in a developmental sequence. In each case, the way in which the DIT overcomes problems in the Kohlberg system is described and explained. In the DIT, the subject is given a moral dilemma and asked to classify his own thoughts. Results of the DIT show subjects to be more advanced and to display more principled thinking than would be expected from Kohlberg's data. This discrepancy is explained in terms of differences between the DIT task and Kohlberg's task. It is thought that the latter may  seriously underestimate people's recognition and discrimination of principled thinking. In addition, it is argued that an accurate system for indexing an individual's development must go beyond stage typing (the categorization of the individual in terms of one developmental stage). A theory of decalage is called for, to describe the interplay of variables related to uneven acquisition of characteristics associated with a given stage. For the present, it is suggested that moral judgment data be preserved for later reanalysis, and that various indices be examined for best fit with the empirical properties expected of the construct moral judgment. Appended are two tables: (1) the DIT format, and (2) major validity questions and comparison of findings with Kohlberg's Test and DIT.  (GO)",

Piaget's assertion that children's logic, prior to the stage of formal operations, is structurally adequate for dealing with objects and their properties, but is inadequate for fully competent propositional reasoning, is challenged on three grounds: (1) the data base from which Piaget's theory about formal reasoning has been developed comes from a scientific task domain with its specific task requirement and associated psychological factors; (2) the theory cannot, a priori, be extended to other propositional task domains, and empirical support for generalizing it has not been provided; (3) findings from adult studies show that adults tend to rely on empiric (rather than  propositional) reason whenever it is possible to do so. Therefore, there are interesting similarities between child and adult reasoning which the Piagetian outlook has de-emphasized. A linguistically oriented view on the development of propositional reasoning is proposed, based on the idea that acquiring propositional competence is an achievement of the same nature as acquiring competence in grammar or syntax. The theoretical and methodological consequences of this view are examined. (GO)",

The key questions of this research were: (1) Are certain experiences encountered by the young child in his everyday life more important to his intellectual development than others? (2) If so, does the source of these experiences matter? and (3) Is the question of timing important? A total of 23 children were observed repeatedly in their homes and neighborhoods and the observations coded using the HOME Scale. Results confirmed that (1) the class of observed experiences, classified a priori were intellectually valuable to the child, (2) it does not  matter how the child's intellectual experiences are derived, and (3) different sources of intellectually valuable experiences become important at different periods in the child's life. It was found that child-person interaction correlates highly with test performance at age 3, modeling becomes important at age 2, and self-directed intellectual experiences become important at age 2 1/2. Investigation of experimental antecedents of the child's spontaneous expression of intellectual competence yielded results which duplicated the findings for tested intellectual competence, with the exchange between child and interactor being most highly related to the child's later intellectual competence. Aspects of the interactive situation and interactor role are discussed in terms of the critical role  early interactive experiences play in the child's intellectual development. (GO)",

Interactional designs allow a convergent approach to specifying processes underlying the interaction of variables. In contrast, current methodologies contain two inherent disadvantages: they have limited utility in specifying the processes underlying development, and their results are difficult to interpret. Interactional strategies were used in the design of two experiments on the development of formal operations competencies. The results of these experiments suggest that applying interactional strategies to the study of formal operations growth allows direct comparison between the strengths of existing age-related performance differences and the strengths of the  experimentally manipulated treatments. This research design may also reveal catching up and readiness interactions that could result in new interpretations for developmental differences, allowing precise statements as to the nature of the interaction of maturational and experiential factors which determine formal operations development.

        "description":"This investigation examined strategic and semantic aspects of the answers given by preschool children to class inclusion problems. The Piagetian logical formalism for class inclusion was contrasted with a new, problem processing formalism in three experiments. In experiment 1, it was found that 48 nursery school subjects nearly always performed better on percept inclusion than on concept inclusion. This result supports problem processing formalism and contradicts logical formalism. Experiment 2 used 11 of the same subjects to investigate three questions: whether the children's counting strategies would produce the same response patterns as in experiment 1, whether the answer &quot;the same number&quot; (essential to any correct coextensive comparison) was available in their response  repertoire, and whether expected responses to coextensive problems in concept and in percept sets would be obtained. Results offered consistent experimental support for SCAN and MATCH components of the problem processing model. Experiment 3 utilized 48 new subjects and a design which crossed four categories with four problem types, to clarify the reasons for the difference observed between the difficulty of percept and concept problems. Interpretations of the results are discussed in terms of the children's semantic strategies and counting strategies. The general conclusion offered is that problem-solving strategies, not logical deficits, are the source of young children's inclusion of errors. (GO)",

It was hypothesized that high anxious children would glance away from a task more often than less anxious children, in light of research literature which suggests that high anxious children are inattentive to tasks in order to avoid evaluation. Subjects were 48 fourth and fifth graders. The children were videotaped through a one-way mirror while they performed timed anagram tasks in the presence of a male experimenter working on a similar task. Results showed that less anxious children performed better at the anagram task than anxious children. High anxious children also were observed to engage in significantly more off-task behavior and more glancing away from their  task than less anxious children. Research on family interaction patterns associated with high and low levels of anxiety and distractibility in fourth and fifth graders is discussed in view of the results of this study. It is suggested that parents of highly distractible and anxious children may be teaching their children to respond to problem-solving situations with task-inappropriate and dependent behavior, at the expense of task performance.

Videotapes of seven infants' faces were coded using an ethogram; the movement of the eyebrow, eye direction, eye openness, mouth shape, mouth position, lip position, and tongue protrusion were assessed independently. Nearly the whole range of facial movements was observed during the neonatal period, thus indicating that all the movements generally called smile, frown, angry grimace, excitement, boredom, sorrow, joy and shame are possible from at least the second or third week of life. Electrocardiogram data were recorded simultaneously with videotaping of the infants' faces during periods when the infants were attending to novel stimuli and were  habituating to these stimuli. Analysis of these data revealed substantial co-occurrence of facial change and heart rate change, which suggests that observed infant affect is a reflection of the infants' internal state rather than a random patterning waiting to be organized.

Second and eighth graders were shown edited versions of a television program that differed in complexity and the difficulty of inferring causal connections between the scenes. In addition, the scenes in half of the showings were kept in the original narrative sequence while in the other half they were randomly ordered. After watching one of the four versions of the program, each child was asked to answer multiple choice questions about discrete scenes in the show and the causal relationships among scenes. The results showed that second graders were poorer at answering inference questions than eighth graders. However, second graders who had watched one of the simple  versions of the program did better than those who had seen a complex version, regardless of whether the simple version was ordered or jumbled. Eighth graders did best when the scenes in the program were ordered, regardless of the amount of information in the program.

According to statistics reported in 1969 nearly 43 percent of all children under 6 in Appalachia were categorized as poor and likely to require some special services, while only 5 percent were receiving such services. The Appalachian Regional Commission has concentrated its efforts on job training, transportation, and upgrading the quality of education in Appalachia. Several Appalachian programs are described briefly, including day care centers which offer child development services such as parent counseling, health and medical services, family planning, and pre- and postnatal care, and home-based outreach programs available for families of nonworking mothers who  receive public assistance. Also described is the Black Appalachian Commission, which gathers information about the black population in Appalachia, identifies community problems, and mobilizes available resources.

Topics include excerpts of Head Start (e.g., available services, children's educational gains, parent participation), services provided to the handicapped, and problems in administration. Grantees were found to be marginally successful in facilitating parent participation, and it is recommended that alternative means of involving parents be developed. Examination of services provided to handicapped children by the Office of Child Development and Head Start grantees indicated that Head Start programs lack the  professional staff, training, facilities, and equipment needed to serve the severely handicapped. It is recommended that this situation be remedied and that professional confirmation of classification of handicapped children be obtained to avoid misclassification. Administrative problems discussed include low enrollment, low average daily attendance and service to ineligible families. These problems are said to continue because of inadequate monitoring of grantees by the regional offices. Appendices to the report give information from selected studies relating to the impact of Head Start and comments from HEW pertaining to the draft report by the General Accounting Office entitled &quot;Assessment of Project Head Start.&quot; (GO)",

Cognitive perspective taking was found to increase between second and third grades. Affective perspective taking, in situations controlling for the likelihood of the subjects' projecting their own affective responses to story characters, decreased with grade level. Perceptual perspective taking showed no grade changes, and empathy was curvilinearly related to grade level. Males were found to be better perceptual and affective perspective takers than females. Task intercorrelations were low and nonsignificant, supporting the view that perspective taking and empathy are multidimensional social-cognitive constructs.  (Author/BRT)",

Questionnaires were developed and used to collect data on the parents of about 1,300 families and the children (7-13 years old) of approximately 400 families in West Germany. Results of studies using the questionnaires showed that there is a very complex relationship between the parents' concept of the child's personality and the parents' self-perceived parental attitudes. Specific childrearing attitudes seem to be related to general personality characteristics of the parents. Child-perceived maternal attitudes appear to be more strongly related to the child's intelligence than child-perceived paternal attitudes. However,  perceived paternal goals seem to be of higher value than perceived maternal goals in predicting the child's intelligence. Another study analyzed children's internal vs. external control orientation and its parental antecedents. Future research is anticipated which will examine parental socialization behavior and children's personalities, and intervention programs to change certain aspects of parental behavior are planned.

Several experimental home teaching programs conducted by the High/Scope Foundation and based on the third assumption are described briefly: (1) the Ypsilanti-Perry Preschool Project, a preschool combined with weekly home visits; (2) the Ypsilanti Home Teaching Project, a 4-month program of weekly  home visits; (3) the Ypsilanti-Carnegie Infant Education Project, in which educators or untrained women visited homes weekly for a 16-month period; and (4) a comparison of three preschool curricula combined with weekly home visits. Longitudinal data from several of these studies is already available, while data from other projects is still being analyzed. In general, it has been concluded thus far that the combination of preschool with home-based components yields impressive immediate and long-term results. Implications and considerations for preschool educators are discussed. (ED)",

The first stage proposed in this scheme is empathic distress, the involuntary experiencing of another person's painful emotional state. Empathic distress results from the infant's complete fusion of self and other, so that he cannot distinguish another person's distress from his own and thus responds to it as though it were his own. The second stage, sympathetic distress, is divided into three levels. The first level occurs when the child knows that others are separate physical entities but does not realize that they have thoughts and feelings different from his own. At this level,  the child can sense the distress of others, and tries to confort them in the same way he himself likes to be comforted. The second level occurs when the child becomes aware of others as sources of thoughts and feelings in their own right and tries to find means of comforting them that are suited to their individual situations. The final level occurs when the child can be sympathetic to the overall life situation of a person or class of people. (Author)",

At the time of the report Mississippi was one of five states having no state-supported kindergarten program. Research is cited to show the cost-benefit of kindergarten programs and the benefits of preschool education in cognitive, affective, and health areas. Criticisms of preschool education and counterarguments are reviewed, and it is concluded that research to date supports the importance of early childhood  education, especially kindergarten. Figures are given for low kindergarten attendance and high drop-out rates in Mississippi schools, and suggestions are made for initiating and implementing a kindergarten program in the state.

Eight pairs of colored pictures were presented in each experimental condition. Incidental instructions were varied with respect to the absence vs. presence of a concurrent intentional task. Within both instructional conditions, pairs of stimuli were either conceptual, perceptual, or unrelated. Results showed that selective learning patterns of both younger and older children were significantly  modified by type of incidental instruction and type of stimuli presented. Developmental differences were obtained with respect to amount of retention. Instructions omitting a concurrent intentional task were more effective with older children; instructions including a concurrent intentional task were more effective for young children. (Author/GO)",

        "description":"This paper documents the social changes that have taken place in the American family during the last quarter century and suggests that these changes have created the need for new directions in both public policy and developmental research. The general trend reveals progressive fragmentation and isolation of the family in its child rearing role, as evidenced by more working mothers, more single-parent families, a decline in academic performance, and a rise in the rates of child homicide, suicide, drug use, and juvenile delinquency. It appears that the critical factor in these trends is not race, but the conditions under which the family lives. Changes are occurring more rapidly among younger families with younger children: Cross-sectional differences in the well-being of families  are strongly linked with economic status, but the longitudinal trends seem to be a function of increasing urbanization. It appears that the destructive effect of these changes derives from the progressive segregation by age in American society, resulting in the isolation of children from those responsible for their care. The key to correcting these problems is seen in the development of support systems for families and in research which studies development in context. (Author/JMB)",

        "description":"This study attempted to determine whether attendance at a traditional preschool resulted in significant cognitive gains for young children over a 3-year period. The experimental group consisted of 59 children at four preschools. Each was matched with a nonattender on such variables as age, sex, intelligence, and family characteristics. The mean Stanford-Binet IQ was approximately 119. Testing was done before the experimental group began preschool, at the end of their preschool year, at the end of kindergarten, and at the end of first grade. The Stanford-Binet (S-B) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) were the main instruments used in the testing. These were supplemented by tests on reading, mathematics, spelling, and Piagetian concept attainment. The results indicated:  (1) significant differences between the two groups on the S-B at the end of preschool, kindergarten, and first grade, with the experimental mean higher than the control; (2) significant PPVT increases by the experimental group but not by the control group; (3) no significant difference between groups on the Piagetian test of operativity at the end of kindergarten, but a significant difference in favor of experimental children by the end of first grade; and (4) no significant differences between the two groups on tests of school performance.

The major components of the project described and discussed are: (1) establishment of an early childhood education program for children six months of age and older, use of empty classrooms in the project school; (2) reorganization of the entire school into an extended day school, open from 6:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; (3)  development of a framework of cooperation between a university and the local school district for supervision of the project; (4) involvement of the families of enrolled children in all aspects of the project; (5) encouragement of positive researcher/teacher relations by requiring all researchers to spend some time working directly with the children; (6) establishment of a health program for the school (later terminated); (7) revision of the student teaching experience for senior interns to feature a developmental approach; and (8) creation of a viable staff development program.

They were also asked to make deviance judgments on two story characters whose behaviors exemplified qualities that typically evoke an attribution of psychological disorder on the part of adult judges. One story described loss of control and aggression, the other a distorted and paranoid perception of social reality. The pattern of reaction to the stories was consistent with age-related shifts in the basis for deviant status. First graders generally failed to think in terms of group norms; the transition from the middle grades to adolescence was marked by greater emphasis on social consensus, both in psychological perspective and group behavior.

To best achieve these goals, a 3-faceted approach was initiated: a program for mothers, a children's program, and a service component. From January 1972 to June 1974, 126 mothers and 250 children participated in the program. The program was evaluated to  identify the participants' social and demographic characteristics, their utilization of existing community resources, their attitudes toward the program, and the program's impact on the mothers' child rearing repertoire and self concepts. Some data were collected on a comparison group, consisting of mothers whose children participated in the 1972-73 and 1973-74 Headstart Program. Overall, it was found that mothers increased their participation and sense of responsibility at the Centro, had better resources and skills to solve their problems, and valued their child's and their own learning process. This report discusses the program's goals, progress, and evaluation. (NQ)",

The social and ideological bases of community elite support for liberal development policies were also examined and relevant comparisons made with 231 community elites in 32 communities ranging in size from approximately 1,000 to 50,000 residents. Respondents were chosen by a combination of the &quot;positional&quot; and &quot;reputational&quot;  methods of selecting community leadership. Data on growth center policy preferences among a random sample of four Northwest Wisconsin counties, bordering that of the community elites, were collected during the summer of 1973. Some findings were: community elites and non-elites in the Northwest region were divided on the policy of implementing growth centers; elites strongly favored consolidation of service delivery by community and county governments; and growth centers were more favored by community elites and low income, nonfarm families.

        "description":"The study's purpose was to determine the degree to which homogeneous rural youths living in an economically impoverished region might be vulnerable to anomia, powerlessness, and deviance given varying levels of perceived limitations in opportunity and self-ability. Comparative data relative to earlier studies in rural areas was also provided. Analysis was conducted in accordance with a specially constructed multi-causal social psychological model which provided a plausible causal argument to link the influence of structural factors and adolescents' deviant behavior through 8 social psychological and associational variables. These variables were: deviation-proneness, anomia, powerlessness, perceptions of opportunity and ability limitations, peer-group ties, parental education, and  father's occupation. A structured questionnaire was administered in 1974 to 1,074 seniors (605 males and 469 females) from 9 high schools located in the Upper Cumberland Region of middle Tennessee. All respondents were white, Protestant, and living in a poor rural area. Some findings were: adolescents who perceived that the structural and personal means for their achievements were limited tended to experience greater senses of anomia and powerlessness and consequently become more deviance-prone; and the effect of peer-group ties toward deviance-proneness was highly significant, especially for males.

The sequence followed in this analysis is an initial clarification of some conceptual perspectives surrounding the problem followed by a survey of current economic conditions and growth potential for the Borderlands region. Following a brief overview of the salient factors associated with Borderlands poverty and those most closely associated with the economic activity of the region, the 3 dimensions of poverty in the Borderlands are outlined. These are: (1) &quot;real&quot; (or absolute) poverty, based upon arbitrary economic criteria; (2) &quot;regulated&quot; poverty, the differential rates of poverty existing among the dominant and minority segments of the Borderlands population; and (3)&quot;relative&quot; poverty which results from the use of varied, non-economic criteria for determining the degree of economic well-being.

Data were obtained from a longitudinal study of 144 high school seniors who graduated in 1948 from 9 rural high schools in Iowa. Completed in 1948, the original study obtained data on the students' background characteristics, migration intentions, educational and occupational aspirations, and  attitudes toward farming. Data obtained in the follow-up studies, conducted in 1956 and 1967, concerned occupational and educational attainments, migration performance, occupational and educational aspirations for their children, and their attitudes about the Iowa Area Vocational Schools. Utilizing the 1948, 1956, and 1967 data, this study tested various hypotheses. Among the findings were: (1) migrants changed jobs significantly more frequently than non-migrants; and (2) the expected differences in occupational prestige between migrants and non-migrants were, on the whole, not significant.

        "description":"The study examined the changes in the quality of life of country families in four eastern Kentucky counties between 1960 and 1973. Since quality of life is an abstract concept, the changes were assessed with respect to income, occupation, and level of living. The aim was to assess the changes in both objective and subjective terms as the families in the country areas of the Cumberland Mountains saw them when surveyed in the late spring and early summer of 1973. Surveys were conducted in 1961 and 1973. In 1961, inter-family differences were examined. Families were classified by family life cycle stage: working age families without children (head under 60 years); families with young children (oldest child under 10); families with adolescent aged children (oldest child 17 or  younger); families with mature children at home (oldest child 18 or older); and older families without children (head aged 60 or older). In 1973, 317 families living in the country in the same counties surveyed in 1961, and for the most part in the same sample segments, were surveyed. Some findings were: (1) levels of living as indicated by household possessions improved dramatically in 1973; (2) median family income nearly doubled between 1960 and 1972; and (3) despite the improvement in income and levels of living, mountain families still lagged behind those elsewhere in income, education, and levels of living.

        "description":"The hourly wages of migrants in Wayne County, New York in 1968 were higher than state or Federal legal requirements. However, for many migrant workers, the irregularity of migrant employment made it less profitable over the harvest than a steady job at the lower legal rates. Moreover, a person who could be employed at a steady job as a nonagricultural laborer in Florida (the home state of many Wayne migrants) would be better off doing so than coming to Wayne as a migrant. This was true because his potential hourly wages, regularity of employment, and, consequently, total earnings were likely to be less in Wayne. This report provides information on the income migrants earned in Wayne County, New York in 1968. A discussion of some of the easily committed errors in the measurement  and interpretation of the earnings of these workers is also provided. (Author/NQ)",

This study examined the differences in mothering between those who live in urban areas and those who live in rural areas. Although the study drew on work currently in progress on the relationship between mothering and infant health, the focus was on the mother's characteristics and her social setting. Both an urban and rural sample were chosen, using the resources of the City of Milwaukee Department of Health and the county public health nurses of 4 Wisconsin nonmetropolitan counties. The nurses selected families with whom they had had some prior contact, who had had a baby within the past 3 months, and where the mothers were willing to be interviewed  about themselves and their baby's health. Data were obtained through interviews with 101 mothers in Milwaukee and 47 in the rural areas and from the nurses' observations and evaluations. Some findings were: there was more of a tendency to have &quot;traditional&quot; family patterns such as being married, going to church, and running a home with more regular schedules for the baby's eating and sleeping patterns in rural areas; the rural nurses evaluated their mothers higher on quality of mothercraft than did the urban nurses; and there were no differences in the utilization of medical services.

The 928 children participating in these migrant programs were identified and recruited by social workers, local ministers, project staffs, and the Pennsylvania Council of Farm Workers. School records were used to identify 5-year migrants (those remaining in the state for 5 years). In many programs, children were grouped by needs; and classrooms were ungraded. Bilingual teachers were employed so that they could identify cultural and social needs. In-service training was conducted by each program for all staff prior to its opening, and  weekly staff meetings were held for program development and problem solving. A post-session was held to evaluate the programs. Program evaluation was conducted through weekly visits by 4 monitors and at least one by the assistant coordinator, who used evaluative criteria based on the 11 national goals for migrant education. To varying degrees, the 10 projects met the needs of the participating children. This 1974 report presents the evaluation summaries of the: State, individual projects, 11 national goals for migrant education, and Reading is Fundamental Program. (NQ)",

The historical changes were examined in reference to (1) oral speech with parents in the home, with neighborhood friends, and with school friends outside of class; and (2) language utilized for mass media such as radio, newspaper, and magazines. In 1967, interviews were conducted in 7 schools located in the counties of Dimmit,  Maverick, Starr, and Zapata. In 1973, 2 of the schools were deleted from the 1967 data set due to lack of cooperation. Both years identical questionnaires were given to all high school sophomores (341 in 1967 and 379 in 1973) present on the day of the study. The 1973 questionnaire contained an extended section on language, reading, and writing patterns. Some findings were: females read more magazines and newspapers in Spanish than males; and in 1973, boys indicated use of Spanish more frequently in all settings than girls, and for both, the frequency of Spanish used decreased from the home setting to the neighborhood, and then to the school setting.

It was based on the concept that equal emphasis would be placed on the delivery of effective client services and the development of professionals from among the program's client population. Initially, learning centers were established in the 4 largest Choctaw communities. Each center was open for two, 3-hour flexibly scheduled evening sessions per week. However, due to the initial response, evening classes were opened in 2 other communities and day classes were also established in the 4 larger communities. Commercially made worktexts were used due to the adult's preference for them. However, when the adults were ready, teacher-made materials were used.  Individual student gains were evaluated through analysis of nationally standardized general ability measures, observations, affective measures, teacher records, and questionnaires. The program's progress was evaluated via formal and informal gestures, mostly informal. This volume describes the project's history, intent, design, staff training, demonstration functions, and results.

Using published and unpublished literature, a preliminary instrument consisting of 206 criteria was constructed. Twenty-five recognized Canadian experts in residential outdoor education were randomly selected from 3 subsample areas (the Maritimes, Quebec-Ontario, and Western Canada); these were asked to act as jurors. To validate the preliminary instrument, the jurors were sent a copy of the instrument with instructions to rate each criterion on a 7-point scale: essential, very desirable, desirable, acceptable, questionable, unacceptable, not feasible, and an eighth scale, not applicable. Twenty jurors (80 percent of the total number) responded. Of the 206  criteria, 3 were excluded because their average ratings were lower than the required 4.0 and 1 because of the jurors' comments. The overall average rating of the 202 criteria retained in the instrument was 6.0 or very desirable. The final instrument was given a 6-point scale which included: met completely, great degree, moderate degree, small degree, not met to any degree, and not applicable. In addition, the average rating received from jurors for each criterion was included immediately following that criterion in the body of the instrument. (Author/NQ)",

No purified legal theory such as contract law or the law of damages emerges from the field of Indian law. While some of the legal theory must come from the ratified treaties, statutes, and case law defining the relationship of the United States and the Indian tribes, a great deal of the legal theory must come in tracing developments of a continuing nature in the actions of the U.S in fulfilling its legal obligations about which no doubt whatsoever exists. This paper presents: (1) a chronology of the Federal-Indian relationship; (2) an analysis of treaty responsibility for education of Indians; (3) a chronology of delegation of legal responsibility of the U.S. to  government departments and agencies; and (4) interpretation of the legal responsibility of the Federal government in the field of Indian education. Some historical developments which were relevant in determining the Federal government's legal obligations in Indian education are traced. Discussion of the development of Federal policy in the field of Indian affairs deals specifically with the gradual merger of 2 different forms of obligations--treaty rights and the general concern for Indian welfare as seen in statutory law.

        "description":"Characteristics of 295 federally funded rural community mental health centers (CMHC) in 1971 were documented by examining differentials relating to various utilization indices and funding, expenditure, and staffing patterns. The centers were classified according to: (1) rural--a center serving a catchment area consisting exclusively of rural counties; (2) nonrural--a center serving a catchment area containing no rural county; and (3) part rural--a center serving a mixed catchment area with one or more rural and one or more nonrural counties. The rurality classification of catchment areas, and consequently of the community mental health centers serving them, was made on the basis of metropolitan influence and population concentration (i.e., community size). There were distinct  contrasts in utilization patterns at federally funded CMHC's in rural, part rural, and nonrural locations. Contrasts were especially marked as between rural and nonrural facilities, with part rural facilities often falling between the two extremes and thus suggesting the possibility of a continuum in utilization of CMHC services according to rurality. Rural CMHC's received relatively more funding from governmental sources and less from receipts from services than did either part rural or nonrural centers; there were differences in expenditure patterns as well.

Its objectives were to: (1) prepare personnel in higher education who are concerned with the needs of students from low income and ethnically different families; (2) identify and document problem areas affecting Chicanos at the higher education level of the educational process; (3) identify proven and innovative solutions to the problems; and (4) effect the implementation of the proven solutions by decision-making bodies in the educational process. The National Advisory Board for Chicano Mobile Institutes, state coordinators,  project director, and staff met at the National Evaluation Conference (held at Ghost Ranch, Abiquiu, New Mexico) to assess and write this final report for CMI FY 1973-74. This final report consists of the individual state report summaries for Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and California.

        "description":"Participation and status achievements of Spanish origin persons and American Indians in the labor market were evaluated relative to the participation of whites. An ultimate aim was to identify factors contributing to intergroup differences and to determine whether participation differences reflect discrimination. Factors examined were age, sex, education, job training, marital status, fertility, and family size. Within the labor market context, inequalities and discrimination were examined in terms of labor force participation, occupational achievement and mobility, and earnings from wages and salaries. Data were derived from the United States census' Public Use Sample files for 1970. The sample consisted of all persons 14 to 69 years of age who were not residents of institutions  nor enrolled in school in 1970. Evidence led to 4 general conclusions: (1) color-ethnic-sex inequalities in status permeated the labor market; (2) Spanish origin, American Indian, and black men were discriminated against in their labor force participation, occupational achievement, mobility, and earnings; (3) women in these minority groups, along with white women, were subjected to severe discrimination, the magnitude of which was far greater than that experienced by minority men; and (4) inequalities among women in the labor market were comparatively small and the status of minority women was not consistently inferior to that of white women.

Persons identified as having some influence on the education of Chicanos in New Mexico were invited to participate in two 2-day institutes. Since participants had to pay for their own expenses, they were asked to participate through correspondence if unable to attend. Of the 158 persons identified, 62 did not respond, 59 corresponded by mail, and 38 actually participated. The first institute  identified, defined, organized, and documented all problem areas affecting Chicanos at all educational levels. The second reviewed the problems identified in the first institute, then identified, defined, and related proven innovative solutions to the problems. Both institutes were conducted in a very successful manner. A synopsis of both institutes is given in this paper.

The project involved two major activities: the design and implementation of a survey to determine the extent and consistency of data collected by the states as well as the frequency and source of data collection and a study of results of the survey in order to make recommendations for improved data gathering and utilization. Results indicated the available data in state data banks would not be useful in determining training needs of teachers or teacher competency. There was little correlation between kinds of  data collected and problems related to science teachers and teaching. Some of the recommendations made were for the upgrading of state data banks to collect information which will be useful in making educational policy decisions.

Supplementary water resources will need to be developed in keeping with the growth of the economy and population. The author, chairman of the Honolulu Board of Water Supply, authoritatively discusses types of ground water in Hawaii, and areas of interest in water development throughout the Islands. This is followed by an in-depth historical accounting of Oahu's water supply system. The present water resources, population, land use situation, and projects for the future are examined. The Board of Water Supply, which has amply provided Oahu with high quality water, has carried out its responsibilities inefficiently. Management, in terms of utilizing computer technology, is  indicated to deal with increasing problems. The issue of whether to combine water supply operations with sewerage functions is presented. Institutional responses to water supply needs, desalination, water recycling and treatment, and energy are other topics thoroughly treated. Although technological innovations can be used to increase supply, specific development projects, conservation measures, and institutional reform are recommended to meet Oahu's water supply needs beyond the year 2020.

        "description":"A collection of activities used successfully at the Environmental Learning Center in Isabella, Minnesota, are contained in this guide. Areas of study are perception and communication, mapping, weather, snow, soil, aquatics, trees, and animals. Within these areas is a number of related activities, each to be adapted to the appropriate grade level. The exercises contain a brief description with a statement of purpose. Equipment checklists indicate what the center furnishes, and what you are expected to provide. Procedures explain specifically how to go about each activity. A series of discussion questions serve as a follow up to the exercises. The lessons provide a degree of flexibility, so that they can be used when designing a resident program, or modified to accommodate  individual or group needs. A number of the activities suggest the use of activity cards which can be reproduced from the lesson sample. Notebooks are also indicated as being important in most areas. Included in the appendix is a detailed account of available equipment at the center, including those items for camping, recreation, measuring, optics, astronomy, terrestrial needs, aquatic needs, test kits, and audiovisual aids. The bibliography contains a collection of materials used to develop environmentally oriented lessons. (BP)",

Twenty-nine junior high students in a high-ability mathematics class completed varying numbers of the kits in five 48-minute sessions during a two-week period; ten selected junior high school mathematics teachers worked through the entire series during a two-and-one-half month period. Pre- and post-tests were designed to evaluate subjects' ability (1) to detect the relevance of a particular idea for solving a problem, and (2) to evaluate a mathematical expression involving that idea. Both groups made significant increases. A significant amount of \"unencountered learning\" was noted. It was  suggested that significant effects may be anticipated with less competent subjects than those involved in the pilot study. (Author/JBW)",

Experimental and control classes of seventh- and eighth-grade students taught by the same teachers for both semesters participated in the 1972-73 study. The experimental learning environment contained three components in addition to regular mathematics instruction: (1) the mathematics game EQUATIONS; (2) a twice-a-week tournament; and (3) the organization of the classes into teams. The student absentee rates were selected as the measure of students' attitudes toward the learning environments. Results indicated: (1) the mean absentee rate in nongame classes was significantly higher than in game classes; (2) the mean absentee rate of students  switched from first term game classes to second term nongame classes was significantly greater in the second term; (3) the evidence for a carryover effect of participation in a games class for one term in lessening absenteeism in a nongames class in the second term was tenuous.

Mathematical equations that meet certain game rule constraints constitute a problem space. A resource is a component of these equations, i.e., digits and operations symbols. Allocating resources is performed by a player's move within the well defined limits of game rules which may have the effect of altering the problem space. In this paper, forms of the mathematics game EQUATIONS are described and analyzed. Player strategy is analyzed, and the relevance of that analysis to the study of mathematical behavior is discussed.

The tournaments had been taking place on a weekly-basis for several weeks. The study compares four basic pedagogical assumptions behind the tournament structure with student opinion of the tournaments. Student responses to the survey were analyzed in the form of frequency and percents of alternate responses and with chi square tests. It was concluded that students view their place in the tournament hierarchy as reflecting their ability, but they are willing to meet stiffer competition. They view winning as being under their control. The assumptions behind tournament structure for EQUATIONS appear to be consistent with student opinions of the EQUATIONS tournament.  (Author/JBW)",

Twenty-four secondary school students were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Students in the control group studied programmed units of the PMI program first and then programmed units on the recursive definition program. This procedure was reversed by the experimental group. Data were obtained from a posttest and a subsequent retention test. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance was used to analyze data. Changes in score were analyzed using \"t\" tests.

ASEP has developed 41 separate science units for junior secondary students, 6 service booklets, and a comprehensive handbook for teachers called &quot;A Guide to ASEP.&quot; The purpose of the bibliography is twofold: to help libraries determine reference needs resulting from the introduction of ASEP materials into schools, and to provide teachers who are using ASEP materials with a comprehensive reference list so that they can identify their own library needs. It is also hoped that such a bibliography will be useful to other teachers who are developing their own junior science materials. The entries in the bibliography are organized according to the subject  content of the 41 ASEP science units and include science books, sourcebooks, journal articles, and non-ASEP curriculum materials.

The questionnaires were used to determine (1) the need for inservice and preservice metric education and (2) the present knowledge of the metric system of Nevada teachers. The data indicated: (1) a need for inservice metric workshops for both rural and metropolitan elementary levels, (2) the need is not as great for workshops at junior and senior high levels, (3) elementary mathematics methods students are not adequately prepared in the metric system, and (4) secondary mathematics methods students and junior and senior high teachers are more adequately prepared in the metric system than their elementary  counterparts.

This is a compensatory program to meet the needs of students residing in areas where socio-economic conditions contribute to low achievement. From the 4,700 students, random samples were selected for the experimental and control groups. The project staff consisted of one project director, one resource teacher, 104 Title I teachers, and one clerk-typist. The assessment procedures utilized in evaluating the program were based upon process and product evaluation. The process evaluation gave qualitative evidence about the program based upon responses to questionnaires by project teachers and principals,  classroom teachers, and parents. Additional qualitative evidence was obtained from a workshop for teachers. Product evaluation was obtained by measuring three performance objectives via the Metropolitan Achievement Test, The Attitude Inventory, and Individual Progress Reports. The report draws the conclusion that all grades achieved two of three objectives set and that students, parents, project teachers, classroom teachers, and principals were very supportive of the program.

Twelve conditions of verbal mediation were randomly assigned to students. Conditions were defined by presence or absence of introductory discussion (2 levels), number of worked examples (2 levels), and type of rule (3 levels: specific, general, none). After instruction, subjects were tested for three types of transfer: specialization, generalization, and reasoning by analogy. The use of a concrete model as introductory was found to have a significant (p less than .05) facilitating effects on specialization and a less-pronounced effect on generalization. For all three levels of transfer, the groups given specific or general rules performed better than those given no rule.  Limitations of the study and suggestions for further research are discussed.

A carefully selected set of construction problems was subjected to rigorous a priori analysis by mathematics educators to determine what basic and second-order rules might be used by able high school students in their solution. Categories of problems analyzed include: patterns of two loci, patterns of similar figures, combined two loci and similar figures, patterns of auxiliary figures, and patterns of loci, similar figures, and auxiliary figures. The analysis was successful in making more precise the heuristic approach of George Polya. Overall, the viability of this method of analysis was demonstrated. The authors cite some  limitations of the study and future directions for their work. (SD)",

Field-based activities in the program involved actual teaching for a period ranging from one to five quarters, organized at different levels--elementary, junior high, and senior high schools, and in different settings--urban and suburban. The sample was composed of 86 graduates employed as full-time science teachers in Ohio during 1974-75. Preservice data included each subject's score on Science Classroom Activity Checklist: Teacher's Perception (SCACL: TP), grade point average (preprofessional, professional, and cumulative). Inservice scores were collected by administering instruments to the teachers, their students, and administrators. Data  analysis showed no significant difference in changes of teachers' views regarding the appropriate type of classroom activities. No significant differences were found in the type of activities implemented by teachers with one to five years of teaching experience. Administrators' views regarding science teaching and support given to science teachers was a strong independent predictor variable. It appeared that the views of the graduates toward inquiry-oriented teaching and the use of such activities in the classroom remained stable five years after graduation. (Author)",

Four were multiunit schools located in settings ranging from small town to large city; the remaining schools were conventionally organized and located in large urban areas. The purpose of the field test was (1) to determine the effectiveness of the instructional program in terms of student achievement, and (2) to document the usability of the program. The field test focused on the third level of the program. The results indicated a mastery level of approximately 81 percent on the specific objectives of the program. Overall performance was retarded by poor results in one topic. On the latter portions of the program, maintenance of the mastery level reached a level of 83  percent. The data on standardized test achievement did not conclusively favor either DMP or its conventional counterparts. The field test established that (1) teachers will expend the effort to attend frequent inservice meetings, to prepare instructional materials, and to plan for the several instructional modes in the program; and (2) students will enthusiantically participate in the learning activities. On the basis of the data gathered in the field test, DMP was demonstrated to be a viable program for second-grade children. (Author/SD)",

The subjects of this study were 10 children from an intact class designated EMR. The children ranged in age from 7 to 12 years. The 1972 Developmental Edition of the DMP program was used in this trial, which encompassed three months. Placement into the program was guided by the data from the program's placement inventories supplemented extensively by teacher judgment. Selected topics and activities from Levels 1, 2, and 3 were used in the course of instruction. The test data attested to the appropriateness and effectiveness of the DMP materials for these subjects; the objectives of each topic attempted  were mastered with few exceptions. Children's interest was evidenced by a general willingness to begin new activities and by their maintaining appropriate behavior. The teacher's evaluation of these materials was very positive, but inadequacies were cited in the placement processes. The most important single factor in the opinion of the teacher of these children was that every student experienced success at his own pace and level. (Author/SD)",

Before defining the basic terminology of information processing research, he provides a brief literature review, describing some of the results in the study of capacity and search times for short-term and long-term memory. He then describes the basic methods by which the computer simulates mental activity, and the \"thinking-aloud\" methods by which human problem solving and computer problem solving are compared in the laboratory. Illustrating his theses with discussion of six types of problems (Katona's matchstick problem, towers of Hanoi, geometry proofs, algebra  word problems, understanding instructions, and chemical thermodynamics), Simon describes various approaches to problem solving, and weighs the relative merits of each in terms of memory load, generalizability, and transfer. He distinguishes between the notions of problem solutions as a sequence of states or a sequence of operations. Other issues discussed include the importance of the semantic content of a problem or class or problems and of the schemata available to the problem solver. (SD)",

The effects of four conditions of social comparison are measured with respect to the children's self-reinforcement, self-confidence, and task persistence. Also evaluated are the effects of contingent versus noncontingent reward in the social comparison situation. The results indicate that positive social comparison yielded more self-reinforcement than negative social comparison. Younger children displayed more self-confidence than older children. This finding closely resembles the effects of repeated failure experiences on children and lends support to the  contention that the social comparison process is related to the dimension of success and failure. It appears that the effects of an experimented manipulation of social comparison are somewhat different for children from black, lower socioeconomic status than for white children from similar backgrounds.

Each activity explores a recurring theme in the United States' Development--dedication to a cause, humor, frontiers, and loyalty. Lesson 1 concerns George Washington and the problems he encountered during the Revolution. Lesson 2 contains representative examples of American humor. Lesson 3 deals with the idea of conquering frontiers as evidenced in the life of a noted 19th-century American astronomer. The last lesson deals with roles played by the Japanese Americans while serving the Allied cause during World War II, raising the question of conflicting loyalties. Each lesson plan presents the intended student audience,  suggested time, materials, questions, concepts and objectives, teaching suggestions, references, and additional materials. The materials can be used as presented or as models for teachers developing their own similar activities for the Bicentennial. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"A conceptual framework and a unique data collection technique are proposed as a means for studying the relationship between cognitive structure and political awareness in children. Most researchers have dealt with cognitive development and political socialization research by examining children in different grade levels at one point in time. However, in this study, the same children are interviewed at three different points in time: pre-Watergate, during Watergate, and post-Nixon. The sample population included two urban school districts and six rural school districts, representing two contiguous counties located in the geographical region commonly known as the Ozarks. The project required the administration of interviews to students in the third, sixth, and ninth grades followed  by a second set of interviews with the same students as fourth, seventh, and tenth graders and a third set of interviews with the these students as fifth, eighth, and eleventh graders. This study represents an attempt at longitudinal research on the acquisition of political orientations by children and suggests a key technique for determining whether childhood orientations have any effect on adult political actions.

        "description":"The primary objective of this research is to explore whether black student activism can be presumed to indicate a relative lack of socialization among activists. Contrary to the popular belief which argues that widespread challenges to established authority and dominant groups should be seen as an index of social disorganization among the disadvantaged, the theory presented argues that sustained periods of collective activity such as demonstrations are indicators of intense socialization and organization building. The research was conducted in a large all-black public Chicago high school. The strategy was to select an array of school organizations and attempt to interview each available member. Two race-focused organizations, the Afro-American History Club (AAH) and a group  termed the Militant organization, were the primary focus of the study. Through interviews, the author sought to specify how the social environment and activities of students in the two groups differ from that of other students. It was found that significant similarities exist between students in the AAH and Militant samples in their exposure to race-conscious interactions and writings; in this respect, they both differ markedly from nonrace students. In conclusion, it may be presumed that black student activism indicates positive political socialization among members of race-conscious groups. (Author/JR)",

In a time of downward economic spiral, the Labor Party is committed to education for social justice through the redistribution of resources and research priorities, as well as the reorganization of the educational system. Budget decisions have redistributed funds from elite British universities to the comprehensive secondary schools and vocational colleges. Postsecondary reorganization involves efforts to merge the patch quilt of polytechnical schools, colleges of education, and colleges of further education under a single local authority. At the secondary level, comprehensive schools and semiprivate, direct grant schools are being merged to provide  a strong alternative to expensive and exclusive private schools. Research and development funds are being shifted from open-ended cultural and scientific support to programmatic research designed to rescue a beleagured political economy. More money is being infused into trade union projects, workers' economic cooperatives, adult education programs, and vocational training. The belief is that worker incentives are critical to economic productivity and recovery. (Author/DE)",

It collects, describes, and evaluates the museum's acceptance, use, and impact of psychological learning theories within educational programs. The study reports that most museums can give only a portion of their time, space, and imagination to educational programs. Throughout the literature review, a number of guiding principles point out psychological learning theories which museums use to provide exceptional learning experiences within their own institutions. The guiding principles which museums use include (1) the recognition of relevancy between museum visits and school experiences; (2) the use of visual objects as perceptual materials to reinforce learning; (3) the promotion of  activity, discovery, and inquiry as useful techniques in developing and refining discriminatory skills; (4) the acceptance and utilization of organized experiences which facilitate learning and retrieval; and (5) the recognition of the value of stimuli and feedback as part of an exhibit to enable visitors to respond and attend to the exhibit as a learning experience.

Particular emphasis is placed on analyzing the &quot;age-education&quot; interaction effect of migration on flows of human capital. Migration was highly selective of the young and/or highly educated adult. Age, education, race, and sex characteristics of migrants moving in and out of the Western divisions were determined from census data. The detailed flows were multiplied by the appropriate value of human capital (discounted earnings approach) and were then summed to determine the effects of age and education on flows of human capital. Results of the study indicate that (1) the &quot;age-education&quot; interaction effect is highly significant; (2) the  West experienced a large increase in human capital as a result of the large net in-migration of adults from the Midwest; (3) more recently, this flow has decreased somewhat; (4) the West has been experiencing a large gain in black human capital from both the southern and northern states; and (5) a significant portion of the economic growth in the West appears, consequently, to have been subsidized by other regions, especially the Midwest. These rather large flows of human capital imply that the other regions are underinvesting in education, especially higher education. (Author)",

Although most students thought that learning all three subjects was important, they believed that learning social studies was less important than learning mathematics and English. The majority thought that their grade in social studies was more important than learning the subject. The students felt that their parents, counselors, and friends supported these views. Fewer than one-third of the urban students were high on measures of articulation between social studies and future occupations. Social studies teachers were generally perceived as little different from other teachers on affective measures and only slightly higher as interested in students  as people. Social studies was perceived as being easier than mathematics, a finding which tends to be reflected in students' grades. Problem areas for teachers of social studies are noted, and suggestions for dealing with them are offered. (Author/ND)",

The survey is one of a number made on behalf of the life insurance business by the Institute of Life Insurance. Data for the survey were collected in personal interviews with 1,500 to 3,000 adults. Scientific procedures were followed to make the samples representative of the United States population 18 years old and over. Findings report the public's view on new attitudes toward the family, changes in traditional sex roles, people's orientation toward the present versus the future, feelings of personal control or lack of control, consumerism, civil rights, birth control, gun control, marijuana legalization, and communal living. The  findings are reported in statistical percentage charts, along with brief narratives which analyze and interpret the data. (Author/JR)",

The unit tells the story of the black American from his viewpoint, adding dimension to both American history and black history. The primary purpose of the course is to introduce students to the individuals, forces, and events that make up the experiences of the black people in America. Following an introduction describing the African background, the guide presents sections on the role of the blacks in the New World until Emancipation in 1863, Reconstruction to World War II, and the Black Revolution.

These changes affect the lives of the largest single group in the United States and have resulted from a movement aimed not only at increased access to society's resources and power, but also at a redefinition of the identity of American women. Topics reviewed include women in the labor force, entry into male-dominated occupations and professions, competence and criteria, consequences of women's movement on professional and occupational practice, apprenticeship, minority women, women and education, women and money, women and politics, changes in the family structure, fertility, changing living arrangements, pressures on the family, and child care. The emphasis of this report is on economic changes because it  is an important area in defining women's equality. Access to occupational opportunities has given women significant leverage in politics, as well as in the home. Their attitudes toward work have stimulated new versions about marriage and family life.

        "description":"The writings of 33 authors in either curriculum theory or social studies are analyzed to determine whether each author supports structure-discovery views, reflective-inquiry views, or expresses views that tend to reflect both positions or neither position regarding the new approaches to teaching social studies. The structure-discovery method is designed to teach substantive concepts and procedures from the knowledge structure of a specific discipline. Students, through problem solving, hypothesis testing, or some other involvement, determine the concepts or generalizations for themselves. The reflective-inquiry method is designed to develop each student's ability to make decisions about personal and societal problems. The \"content\" to be studied is not predetermined but is  comprised of data needed to investigate the problem and make decisions about it. Reflective-inquiry emphasizes student values analysis, reflection, and classification in order to make a decision on a specific societal problem. Thirteen writers in the sample favor the structure-discovery approach; twelve favor the reflective-inquiry approach; while eight are inconsistent between the two approaches. Although some of the authors' views may have changed since completion of the study in 1971 and more materials have been recently written, the descriptions of positions can help teachers to conceptualize social studies teaching alternatives.

Six categories of community resource learning experiences are examined, consisting of study strips, resource persons, community services, community resource maps, community surveys, and camping (outdoor education). Each activity is nonbook in character and usually takes place outside of the formal classroom situation. Most effective use of these resources requires advanced planning and a formalized use sequence including selection of the resource, preliminary arrangements, teacher-student planning and preparation, student experience with the resource, checking and follow-up, and evaluation. Full and proper use of community  resources depends upon adequate administrative support. Funds should be allocated for the production, periodic updating, and distribution of community resource directories. Not only students but also community residents with leisure time can take advantage of these local resources to continue their education. The author suggests that all agencies in a community cooperate in publicizing their resources and helping people to explore them. (Author/DE)",

Variables for study were selected from each of the three sub-subsystems of the senior class social system: grade point average of the subjects was selected from the formal sub-subsystem; amount of cocurricular activities participated in by the subjects was selected from the semiformal subsubsystem; such family and community characteristics as sex, SES, and residence (town or farm) of the best friend of the subjects were selected from the informal sub-subsystem. Although more variables showed significant correlations with SES for girls  than for boys, the boys showed higher correlations on those variables that did reach significance. It was concluded that the social behavior of adolescents in the subsubsystems of the River City High School senior class social system appears to be related functionally to the positions their families occupy in the social structure of the community.

The major problems investigated are to determine which areas of human geography are of most interest to upper elementary students, and to assess the perceptions of these students regarding the best place to learn about those areas of interest. The test sample was composed of 30 students each from fourth, fifth, and sixth grades of a lower middle income, urban elementary school. A questionnaire consisting of 32 inquiry questions derived from \"Focus on Man: Social Studies for Utah Schools,\" a prospectus published by the Utah State Board of Education, was used because it is inquiry oriented, focuses on the human aspects of geography, and is  the basic reference for social studies in Utah elementary schools. It was concluded that the man-land approach is appropriate for geographic inquiry in the upper elementary school grades. Recommendations for teaching the man-land approach to geography for upper elementary students are given. (Author/ND)",

The data base for this investigation is the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) of women aged 30 through 44 by the Bureau of Census. The basic hypothesis is that education will affect fertility and that fertility and marriage decisions will affect educational choice. Results indicate that a woman marrying and having her first child at age 16 will complete 3.5 fewer years education than a woman who never marries. Educational choice is significantly affected by the individual's socioeconomic status--as reflected in parents' education and occupation--and by attitudes towards housework and child care activities. The total cost of  children, both explicit and implicit, varies not only with family size, but also with the timing of family formation. It is apparent that if child births are delayed until the mother has completed her formal education, then the foregone education costs of fertility will be minimal. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to investigate response to the film, \"Parable,\" a 20-minute color film which depicts a clown in a circus setting and which has no dialog but evokes strong emotional/affective reactions. Postviewing reactions to the film by 141 adults from age 20 to 70 of United Methodist churches in southern Indiana were researched. Although the film is more frequently shown to youth, adults were queried because it was felt that adult theological belief systems are more fully developed. The study attempts to describe their reactions and relate the reactions to patterns of theological belief. Theological belief was measured by having participants complete Lee's (1965) Religious Belief Inventory before they watched the film. Emotional/affective reactions were measured  by (1) previewing and postviewing completion of Buros' Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (1972), and (2) postfilm semantic differential responses to 11 film-related stimuli. Despite the film being subject to various interpretations, it was concluded that most people who are conversant with the Christian tradition see the film as an obvious allegory in which the clown represents Jesus Christ and the circus represents the world.

Projecting for three different fertility rates, the report suggests that the population will continue to grow throughout  the remainder of the twentieth century at rates which could fall below the current low rate and which are unlikely to reach the relatively high rate of the 1950s. The black population is projected to grow at a higher rate than the white population because it has a younger age structure and higher fertility rates. (Author/DE)",

The first category of research interprets sex differences as the result of anatomical differences which later affect psychological roles. The implication of this category is that sex differences are difficult if not impossible to change. The second category interprets sex differences as the result of group roles which an individual culture assigns to the different sexes. The implication of this category is that sex differences are minor and subject to change once a culture changes. The third category interprets sex differences as a process where the child develops gender identity as a part of a  natural tendency to organize observations of the physical world. The fourth category interprets sex differences as the result of behavior reinforcement by parents and society. The implication of the last two categories is that sex differences can vary according to degree of sexism within a society. (Author/DE)",

People with musical and/or athletic backgrounds through that marching style was more important than musical style. Most people preferred precision drill to pageantry shows; popular music, jazz, and Broadway show tunes to marches, rock, and serious music; and felt that majorettes and flag carriers added to a halftime show, but did not claim to  watch the flag routines.

The study is divided into three main parts, each dealing with a key question of world food supply: (1) What Is Hunger? (2) Why Is There Hunger? (3) What Is Being Done? Section 1 defines hunger in terms of nutrition, humanity, and development, providing a brief history of the food shortage. Section 2 analyzes the factors responsible for the present condition of the world food supply including the role of nature, the role of agricultural production, and the role of government policy. Section 3 discusses research and relief programs and the United Nations World Food Conference. Also included in the study is an instruction guide  which suggests techniques and resources giving greater depth of understanding to the issues. The guide contains a discussion of key teaching strategies, tips on methodology, suggestions on topics and questions for classroom discussion, and information on resource materials and organizations.

Two key questions were addressed throughout the workshop concerned with the goals of a global studies course and the issues, concepts, and problems which such a course should address. Four goals for global studies were identified along with recommendations and suggestions for further action.

        "description":"The impact of school desegregation policy on community voting patterns and white flight in northern school districts is analyzed. Both voting behavior and white flight are considered two indicators of the success of school desegregation in achieving community social integration. School board elections, school tax referenda voting trends, and school racial composition data in the northern school districts over a 10-year period are examined. The results indicate that school desegregation increases voter turnout and dissent voting. While the increase in school board election turnout appears to be fairly permanent, the increase in dissent voting is only temporary. Therefore, in many communities school desegregation has more socially integrative characteristics than disintegrative  with regard to voting behavior. In 86 northern school districts, school desegregation has little or no effect on white flight, as measured by the change in percentage of white students enrolled in public schools. Even in the two high desegregating school districts, white flight is minimal and temporary. While one cannot conclude that school desegregation has increased social integration by the third year after a major desegregation plan, the opposite conclusion is not warranted either. (Author/DE)",

The basic program is a population projection model which can forecast the population of over 120 countries, based on either constant or changing 1970 demographic parameter assumptions. Basic data are 1970 total population, age composition categorized into 18 five-year intervals, period age specific fertility rates, and a cohort specific mortality rate schedule. Other programs in the series contribute additional parameters including economic  development, educational development, food demand and supply, energy demand, labor force analysis, migration and urbanization, population history, and birth control use. These materials explain how to use the system; provide information on concepts, definition, and the program algorithms; and provide suggestions for the practical applications of the program.

The second article examines early marriage and pregnancy in traditional Islamic society. An expert on Chinese population policies, in the third article highlights the priority which the Chinese have given to raising the marriage age to increase female participation in national development and to reduce population. Sex  and reproduction, which are constantly rising, among American teenage women are examined in the fourth article. The fifth article presents the problems of teenage pregnancies as high risks for infants. Marriage law reform in Indonesia is examined in the sixth article with respect to the struggle for equal rights for women. The last article presents the biological aspects of teenage pregnancy.

It is felt that schools must prepare students at all grade levels to develop an understanding of the economy in which they live. This guide was specifically prepared to assist secondary school teachers, preservice students, and others interested in economic education with the identification and location of important economic concepts that are contained in the vast array of teaching materials and texts available in the social studies, and gives suggestions as to how these concepts might be taught at different grade levels. Fifty-seven economic concepts such as city planning, land or natural resources, taxation,  and economic systems are included in this guide.

        "description":"This document summarizes the experiences and results of four years (1972-1975) of work in nonformal education in Ecuador. The project grew out of informal discussions in 1970 between several members of the Center for International Education at the University of Massachusetts and a group of Ecuadoreans and Americans in the USAID mission in Quito. These discussions led to the realization that both groups were dissatisfied with the focus on the formal educational system as the major vehicle for human development. The project is a series of subprojects linked together by a common staff and a corresponding similarity of basic philosophy concerning goals, staffing, and processes. Throughout the project are two general programmatic thrusts: creating and testing an approach to working  with village facilitators, and adapting materials and methods to be used by the adult education staff of the Ministry of Education. Two objectives of the project were to create or redefine methodologies and processes within which might be produced a learning-growth relationship and to demonstrate that these processes are valid as instruments for social change. Emphasis was on generating processes that foster the phenomenon of transformation rather than pure modernization. The document proceeds generally from a discussion of the conceptual framework and the philosophy toward a discussion of the more specific techniques and materials used, such as gaming and radio.

A number of recommendations are made to insure that NSF officials and recipients of its funds follow sound business practices in administering science education projects. A major point is that the U.S. Congress may wish to tighten  project administrative controls by requiring NSF to report on income produced from science education projects which it authorizes its grantees and contractors to use. The Congress could then consider such income when reviewing NSF appropriation requests. (Author/ND)",

Increasingly, social work graduates have reported moving into social service administration and managerial positions without these skills. A survey, which gathered information from graduates over a three-year period, indicated a need for competence in the areas of middle management, organization, planning, financial management, personnel administration, program development, and evaluation. The intensive three-day training course was interdisciplinary in nature and designed to provide managerial skills that could be immediately useful to the participants  on their jobs. Student evaluations of the course were positive which in turn has led to the incorporation of a similar course into the undergraduate academic curriculum. (Author/DE)",

According to social learning theory, the development and emergence of sex-typed behaviors and attitudes can be described by the same learning principles used to account for any other aspect of social behavior, generally principles related to reinforcement and imitation. The cognitive developmental approach adds that an important factor in sex role development is children's awareness of their own sex and their understanding that gender is a basically constant physical attribute. This research is about the effects of sex and vicarious reinforcement on imitation in first-grade children. The results indicate that children in pleasant settings observing non-sex-typed tasks with  vicarious verbal reinforcement tend to imitate same-sex models. In threatening settings with vicarious verbal punishments between a male controller and a female model, children do not imitate the female since the male has ruled that she was wrong in the task. Further research under progress by the author is about the effect on children's attitudes of reversing the role in sex-stereotyped occupations in children's literature. (Author/DE)",

Special emphasis is given to the problems of political ideology and education in Zambia; but as Zambian socialist ideology and educational history show similarities to other African nations, the author's interpretations may be applied to other areas. Discussion focuses on the processes of ongoing decolonization in Africa's education systems by a movement from an oppressive, authoritarian system introduced by former colonial powers to a system emphasizing freedom and self-reliance. Chapter 1 analyzes the philosophy of educational innovation from the perspective of the teacher and from African socialism. Chapter 2 outlines key areas of change  in order to make Zambian socialism work throughout the educational system. Chapter 3 examines the current neocolonial system of school management and provides a strategy for innovation in light of socialist objectives. Chapter 4 remarks on how the processes and conditions for the democratization of school management in general equally apply to the subsystem of classroom management. Chapter 5 provides a strategy for revising extracurricular activities to meet socialist goals. (Author/DE)",

The first section of the paper is a discussion of the cognitive theoretical approaches to anthropology of Goffman, Barth, Le Vine, and Goodenough that are combined and applied in this research. An extensive analysis of a case study follows that provides data on ethnic stereotyping and the cognitive dimensions of behavior. Questionnaires with open-ended responses were given to 121 children in grades 6 and 7 and secondary school in an ethnically heterogeneous area--Youri Division, Northwestern State, Nigeria. Their responses showed that ethnic groups are  stereotypically ranked, reflecting well-understood rules for socioeconomic positions and rights, duties, and privileges of each ethnic group. The study concluded that members of an ethnic group see themselves as people who have access to a number of culturally defined social identities, the possession of which entitles them to certain rights and duties in interaction with members of other groups. The last section investigates the usefulness of the combination of cognitive and behavioral approaches and suggests some implications for further theoretical development and research. Data obtained from the study are included as tables in the paper. (Author/ND)",

This segment of the evaluation has the following two objectives: (1) to describe in behavioral terms the differences among programs as observed in classrooms, and (2) to relate these dimensions to pupil growth. Observation was carried out in classrooms from each of seven programs and a comparison sample. Observers recorded such things as the teacher's classroom management techniques, expression of affect, the social-emotional nature, and the cognitive level of the interaction. Results were then factor analyzed, reduced to factor scores, and the factor scores  tested for differences between programs by the multiple range test. The factor scores were also related to classroom mean pupil regressed gain which had been factored to identify different levels of complexity. Although there were inconsistencies, the linear relations between the classroom measures and pupil gain suggested that some factors, such as effective personal communication and intrinsic motivation, related to all levels of complexity, while others were specific to a certain level. In general, there seemed to be a trend that abstract growth was related to teaching that was less controlled and less focused but had some structure, while skill growth was related to more focus and structure, with concrete growth positively related to still more highly focused teacher behaviors and  negatively related to extreme pupil freedom.

The major challenge that higher education faces is that of governance. Many constituencies in the education community, but particularly teacher organizations, are voicing legitimate interests in professional preparation--a matter which until recently was completely under the influence of college-based educators. Accreditation is the second major issue to which higher education and AACTE must respond. Accreditation has developed as a means of quality control in teacher education largely through the efforts of member  institutions of AACTE. Currently, however, questions concerning who will set standards and what will be judged are increasing. A third major concern is collaboration. The sharing of governance in teacher education is an idea whose time has come, and collegiate institutions must ensure they are involved. Government relations is another important issue, and higher education must retain its place in teacher education by taking effective action at both state and federal levels to strengthen its power base. AACTE is responding forcefully at both levels. A fifth area of concern is continuing professional development, including supply and demand and governance of inservice education. (PB)",

It was administered by dentists to 16 randomly selected fifth grade elementary classes in a Midwest community. A pretest and posttest design, with experimental and control groups, was utilized in the study. The Navy Plaque Test was shown to be an unreliable measure of plaque indices in this case.  Due to the unreliability of the instrument, the behavioral aspect of the ADA's program could not be evaluated. The investigators are presently in the process of conducting a post-post NPI measurement of the same subjects rerandomizing the dentists in order to distribute the variability of the plaque measures among the various treatment groups. This will provide an opportunity to determine (1) any experimental effects that might have resulted from the program and (2) which effects remain six months after the students were exposed to it. By using a measure of dental health status, this program could make an important contribution to the validation and evaluation of classroom health education experiences. (Author/BD)",

The group wanted to form an organization which did a better job in teaching students, training adults, and pursuing research than existing institutions. They held discussions in which they formed their ideas, and they wrote a proposal which they submitted to approximately 350 institutions and school districts. They received a number of enthusiastic answers and began to narrow down their choices. The Portland, Oregon school district became their final choice. From the time of inception until the final choice was made, the membership of the group changed for various reasons. As group members came and went, the  composition of the group altered accordingly, and became more routinized and hierarchical. A year after the idea was first conceived, four of the educators finally went to Portland to plan Adams High School which opened in September 1969. (RC)",

The first section of the booklet defines informal education, identifies its requirements and examines the underlying assumptions derived from these requirements. This section also deals with how the teacher can (1) improve his/her understanding of children, (2) change the way one views subject matter so that it becomes more relevant, (3) experience and appreciate processes in learning, (4) change perceptions of learning materials, and (5) present the guidelines for reorganizing the physical aspects of the classroom to facilitate informal learning. The second  section deals with coping with new teaching roles and includes a discussion of the special responsibilities a teacher in an informal classroom assumes in order to further children's learning. These responsibilities include (1) creating appropriate conditions for learning, (2) relating to the children and guiding their learning, (3) challenging the children to learn and encouraging them to do more and better work, (4) asking critical questions, and (5) coping with behavior problems. The third section of the booklet offers methods to facilitate an evaluation of learning and includes a discussion of record keeping, goals, and planning.

An additional purpose was to determine the relationship between the individual  mean scores of students exposed to the three feedback procedures with age, sex, marital status, hours in education, total hours in college, and overall college grade-point average. Three groups, consisting of a total of 20 secondary education majors at the University of Texas at El Paso during the spring semester of 1973, were used in this study. It was concluded that there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the three microteaching feedback procedures. Accordingly, as far as enhancing the attainment of the technical skill is concerned, it seems to make no significant difference which of the three feedback procedures is employed as a part of the instructional sequence.

Instead of having to deal with problems one at a time, a systems approach allows one to solve several problems at the same time. This paper focuses on the first three steps of the process--the specification and examination of assumptions, theoretical model, and competencies. The first section of the paper includes information related to terms associated with systems in general and assumptions in particular, the logical as well as the psychological value of assumptions, methods of identifying and grouping assumptions, and factors to be considered in assessing the acceptability and usability of  assumptions. The second section deals with a theoretical model for teacher education, that is, a structural design of the conceptual and functional components of the total system. It discusses the following three major classes which are included in the concept of a theoretical model for teacher education: (1) professional bases, (2) professional actions, and (3) professional contexts. It also explains how one develops a theoretical model. The third section defines competencies and refers to them as the terminal objectives of a teacher education program. This section also includes a discussion of the seven basic approaches to the specification of program competencies, the operationalization of a competency statement, and how competencies should be sequenced and evaluated.

        "description":"This presentation provides an historical sketch of the All-American Girls' Baseball League (AAGBBL). The League was created in 1942 as the All-American Girls' Softball League, by Philip K. Wrigley. He initiated the League as a non-profit organization governed by a board of three trustees. Mr. Wrigley's basic motivation for creating the AAGSBL was to organize substitute entertainment for men's professional baseball. In 1943, Mr. Wrigley began de-emphasizing the League's identity with softball and emphasizing its identity with baseball. The League was renamed the All-American Girls' Professional Ball League, but unofficially it was referred to as the AAGBBL. The League grew from its four original teams in 1943 to a maximum of ten teams in 1948. By 1954, it had dwindled down to five  teams. The organizational structure of the League underwent three basic changes, all due to changes in administration. There were also both real and imagined problems with male managers and female players. To solve this, chaperones were hired. The League administrators maintained strict conduct rules for the players. The demise of the AAGBBL came after the 1954 season. Post-World War II social changes combined with intra-league changes to contribute to the League's demise. Many instructive lessons can be ascertained from the League's experience, however, for current and future application to women's professional sport. An appendix is attached which contains charts and tables on structure, salaries, and participants. (RC)",

The guide discusses solutions to various problems which might arise from the creation of a diagnostic program for these children in the school. The notebook also includes brief descriptions of several tests and evaluations which teachers may use with these children. The notebook then presents diagnostic reports written about four children who represent composite pictures of  certain characteristics. The procedures followed for each child are the same and include referral by a teacher conference with the classroom teacher, diagnostic teacher, and administrator; and a conference with parents to let them know what has been done and what procedure has been suggested. The notebook presents various classroom techniques to be used by the teacher in order to sharpen children's receptive and expressive processes. It also contains a discussion of how children with learning problems differ from slow learners, and how to make this distinction by observation of their overt behavior. The notebook also includes guides for parents which contain activities and exercises for children to practice during the summer.

A broad concept of curriculum includes the totality of experience which a child undergoes during his schooling. Curriculum development under this definition is concerned with developing materials, practices, and organizations which affect this experience. The task of CDC is seen as being concerned with this development in areas such as resources, sequencing of learning activities, teacher-pupil interaction, organization of the learning situation, and the teacher's general approach to children and teaching. The proposed operations of the centre are defined in terms of the following six functions: (1) the conduct and support of  projects; (2) the provision of a clearinghouse and information analysis service; (3) field development; (4) the provision of advisory, technical, and evaluative services; (5) the provision of opportunities for training in curriculum development skills; and (6) arrangements for the printing and marketing of materials. These functions are interdependent. Together they provide a framework for determining the services and leads that a national center can provide to schools and other curriculum agencies. The structure to carry out these functions envisages three branches which include the CDC Information Centre, the Curriculum Development and Research Branch, and the Administrative Branch. (RC)",

The report contains summaries of talks by the principal speakers and a list of the discussion groups. Many of the speakers stressed the need for &quot;humanness&quot; in all educational development and made a plea for community living, respect for others, the sharing of responsibility, and the nobility of work. Others expressed the need for a greater &quot;exactness&quot; in the approach to learning, indicating the importance of interaction, integration, and careful evaluation of progress made. Another speaker emphasized the philosophical nature of the  educational process and damanded a transfer of knowledge by students to the outside world so that they might answer their own questions about &quot;relevance&quot; in a practical manner. One speaker showed the importance of a properly organized school situation. Another participant spoke of the organization planning, self-questioning, and honesty required in the teaching of mathematics. Finally, one of the participants demonstrated that &quot;survival techniques&quot; for education in the seventies were already being used in many schools. The report also contains an appendix which includes working and other bibliographies by some of the participants, books and sources for audiovisual methods of teaching, and commercially available curricula from the Learning Research and Development Center at the University  of Pittsburgh.

The second section is the major part of the paper. It is in the form of an outline and is a guide containing general descriptive examples of items that might be included in teacher observations. The major headings are (1) \"the teaching process,\" (2) \"non teacher-controlled factors which influence the teaching process,\" and (3) \"special strengths of teachers.\" Subheadings under the teaching process include: \"preparation,\" which lists  topics to be discussed with the teacher; \"delivery,\" which lists things to be observed in the classroom; and \"observational evaluation,\" which lists things to be discussed in conference with the teacher. The second major heading includes the subheadings \"physical factors,\"\"scheduling,\" and \"extracurricular activities and responsibilities.\" Each of these subheadings is broken down into items to be evaluated. The last major heading is divided into the subheadings \"personal and professional,\" and each of these is broken down into characteristics to be observed.

Historically, there has always been a desire on the part of people for sports participation. Several years ago a questionnaire was compiled and sent to universities, colleges, and junior colleges. Eighty percent of the respondents had sports clubs. People want to be active and play, and therefore there is a demand for club sports. No other area in a school's curriculum gets the voluntary participation of such a large percentage of the student body, faculty, staff, and community as does the health, physical education, recreation, and athletic complex. This participation takes the form  of both active sports participation and spectator participation. If the opportunity for physical activity is provided to students, they will take care of the rest. It is now necessary to meet the challenges of providing these opportunities for physical activity. (RC)",

Since one of the ways to investigate cardiac function is to analyze the time intervals between particular events of the cardiac cycle, various time intervals of systole and diastole of the left ventricle were measured from simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram, phonocardiogram, cartoid pulse wave, and apex cardiogram. The relationship of the time components was determined by factor analysis. The results showed that the six nonoverlapping intervals, which included the (1) isovolumetric relaxation phase, (2) rapid filling phase, (3) slow filling phase, (4) electromechanical lag, (5) isovolumetric contraction phase, and (6) ejection phase, are relatively independent of  each other and of cycle time (with the exception of the slow filling phase). They reflect the factors that account for the variance of all the time components of the left ventricle. These relationships among the intervals appear to be similar for different ages and sex.

It examines the present status of behavioral objectives and reviews a recent assessment of most empirical studies on behavioral objectives. It then presents a comparative consideration and assessment of the following teaching models: (1) the impression model, (2) the insight model, and (3) the rule following model. It also discusses a systems analysis of human behavior, specifically thinking. The paper then uses this analysis of learning activity and the examination of the distinctions which can be made between training and education to form some conclusions concerning competency-based education. These conclusions are: (1) a distinction can be made between learning as a training process and  learning as new concept formation, (2) training is useful in the acquisition of skills, (3) machines must only present material that one is sure of so that the pupil is left the freedom essential for the formation of \"art images\", (4) knowledge is impossible without thinking, (5) thinking is futile without knowledge, (6) goals are to be used for focusing purposes only and not to become the overriding concern in education, and (7) competency based criteria are only relevant to training if they are an outgrowth of the individual's own activity.

The next section is a discussion of the methodology he used in preparing the paper. Section 3 is the largest section and discusses the tasks of schools of education. There is also a discussion of the types of people who have traditionally been attracted to teaching. In this section it is asserted that schools and colleges have been sending men and women into the world who no longer understand the creative principles of western society. The theme in the fourth section is that modern  education is based on a denial that it is necessary or useful for the colleges and universities to transmit the classical culture of the west from one generation to the next. This section also notes that the university experience cannot and should not be an exact mirror of life. It is stated that real scholarship always moves in a realm where choices are more numerous and the possibilities more varied than they are practical. The final section emphasizes that teacher education must not allow itself to operate outside the perennial concerns of western civilization, and that those who teach in higher education must have some convictions about what is worth learning.

        "description":"It is important to counteract the collectivist and totalitarian trend which is currently the source of our educational problems. These problems are due to the impersonal, institutionalized communication which results from totalitarianism and collectivism in education. There is now a new movement toward personalism which focuses on love, community, critical consciousness, radical re-thinking, and anarchy, and which characterizes a trend away from the impersonal, functional, totalitarian approach to life. This personalist philosophy which has arisen from a dissatisfaction with established institutions can be discussed in relation to the socio-economic realm, the political scene, science, philosophy and theology, and finally, American education, which has ignored the personalist  movement. The first step of a plan to de-sociologize American education would be to de-socialize schools (i.e., take them out of reach of political authorities). The second step is to de-sociologize education--in other words, to organize the contents and direction of our educational efforts around concrete reality and not according to the pre-established ideology of sociology. The goal of education must not be to alienate man from his existential roots but to make him able to pursue happiness through desocializing and de-sociologizing our schools. (BD)",

To achieve this, the writings of Greek historians were systematically examined for words, phrases, sentences, and comments pertaining to or mentioning Greek athletics and athletes. These were recorded on separate cards, and eventually classified according to topic. Topics were then grouped under the following three headings: (1) the individual and athletics; (2) festivals; and (3) outgrowths of athletics. Concepts related to the role of athletics in Greek society were derived from these groupings of quotations and references. In relation to the first topic, it was found that the individual athlete in Greek society benefited from athletics both  intrinsically and extrinsically through individual exercise and public honor. Concerning the second topic, it was found that attending festivals and athletic contests was a way of life for the Greek people (historians mentioned 37 different festivals and countless other athletic contests which were not given specific names). With regard to the third topic, it was found that almost everyone in the Greek world was affected by athletics, either directly or indirectly. For example, time was measured in Olympiads, locations were given in relation to athletic sites, and artists used athletes as models for their works. In conclusion, the author states that athletics and sport were integral to the thinking and concerns of Greek historians. (Author/BD)",

It goes on to say that teachers must be trained in all these activities.  The next essay discusses the teacher and curriculum instruction. It states that teacher trainees and experienced teachers must become involved in building school programs in order to develop the necessary skills and understandings related to this process.

The research is divided into two studies. The first is a developmental study of teacher competency and the second a study of the influence of teacher trainee learning styles on the development of teacher competency. In the first study, models of teaching are described and three types of competencies (planning, teaching, and terminal) are identified. It is reported that  practice increased the level of teaching competency in each model. In the second study, four learning styles are identified and tests are made to show the influence of trainee learning styles on response to training and on pupil outcomes (recall and concept attainment). It was found that, for all learning styles, level of competence varied with the complexity of the model, and that some styles are stronger in planning than in performance. (BD)",

Several papers examine various theoretical concepts and their applicability to health education practice. The papers emphasize people and the predominant position they play in decisions about their own health actions.

The author's model is based on the assumption that over a period of time one's teaching practice not only improves but also increases in dimension and scope. The stages of preparation, induction, and retention are presented as a collaborative process. The author then summarizes the features, results, and implications of her proposal and provides a description of the components of her model. The second paper views the role of the inservice supervisor, using five major assumptions about professional programs for teachers. The authors state that there is a direct relationship between what we believe about people and the kind of  supervisory practice and inservice programs that will be developed. The last paper focuses on supervisory influence and suggests that attention be given to \"direct\" and \"indirect\" models and qualities.

        "description":"Teachers' centers were developed in England and Wales, and although American educators have been quick to adopt words such as teacher center and resource center, they do not understand the basic of teachers' centers. In England and Wales, the centers are established in response to very subjective local teacher needs. Teachers' centers for primary teachers are the most common type, and they all serve both the social and professional needs of teachers. There are also technical and science centers for teachers, operated by specialists who are not teachers. Resource centers are like teachers' centers, except that the major emphasis is on the professional side as opposed to the social side of the teachers' lives. Miscellaneous centers include materials centers and centers which are  very narrow in their interest and tend to be operated by one person. Establishment of professional centers has also been proposed. These centers would be similar to teachers' centers, but would be responsible for the supervision of the probationary teacher. In America, the teachers' centers are for the teachers but are not under teacher control. Teachers may recommend, but they do not control the financial aspects, hire the center leader, or decide what materials and equipment are to be secured or who can use the center. If a free society is evolving, then American schools need the type of educational changes presently underway in England and Wales. (RC)",

Four teachers each taught eight groups of sixth-grade students using eight different variations of the classroom recitation strategy. The eight variations differed in the amount and kind of structuring, soliciting, and reacting behavior used by the teachers. Classes that were asked more recall questions during the lesson (low soliciting) performed better on the achievement posttest than did classes that were asked more thought questions (high soliciting). Classes taught with a high level of structuring did slightly better than classes given little structuring. Classes that received praise for correct answers and reasons for the wrongness of an answer (high reacting) did  slightly better than those classes given neutral feedback and no reason for an answer's being considered wrong (low teaching). Although the results of the study showed variations in the recitation strategy did not make a dramatic difference, they also did not show that the recitation strategy itself was a weak teaching approach. The results for student achievement and attitude showed that the effects of the teacher were sometimes greater than the effects attributable to the teaching variations. (Author/RC)",

The task of the Committee was to create an effective system of improving professional performance which could be put into practice in any school situation in Kentucky, a system which could be utilized with all professional staff members whether they be classroom teachers, administrators, or other professional personnel. A State Board Regulation was passed on September 10, 1975, which required each local board of education to provide for the involvement of every professional school employee in an individualized program of self-evaluation and performance improvement through the application of the Kentucky Plan. The Kentucky Plan is designed to assist in the development of a system tailored  to the particular needs of a school district. For successful implementation of the Kentucky Plan, there must be harmony between participating parties in the development of local school district plans. The resources of the State Department of Education and the Educational Regions must be effectively utilizing to provide the necessary skills needed in a program of this magnitude. The Educational Region is designed to provide ancillary service to the local school districts under the approval of the State Department of Education. The Educational Region can be an effective delivery system in the implementation of the Kentucky Plan. Professional organizations and higher education must also be involved in its implementation.

In practice, these children have been those who public school systems could not or would not teach. The history of education for exceptional children is a simple story of massive nelgect, denial, and rejection. The first institutions organized for the blind, deaf, and retarded were residential. Some distinctive programs for exceptional children were organized in public day schools at the turn of the century. But it was not until after World War II that a remarkable surge of activities on behalf of handicapped children began. Currently the field of special education is negotiating a more integrated place for  exceptional children in both the public schools and the communities in which they live. There are many new trends in special education taking place today. Since 1970, parents have returned to the courts as a means of promoting public action. Individualism and mainstreaming have both emerged as important trends in this decade. Lastly, a more open view of human capacities seems evident. Special education is in the early phases of a major transformation. An unusual set of opportunities challenges special educators to influence their future and that of the children they serve. (RC)",

In a six week program, the static group (N=5) participated in daily high intensity, short duration, isometric exercises while the dynamic group (N=5) participated three times weekly in low intensity, moderate duration, isotonic exercises. The control group (N=4) did not participate in an exercise program. Pre- and post-test SMU firing patterns were recorded by means of 26 gauge tygon coated monopolar needle electrodes. In order to assess the degree of impersistence or periodicity of motor unit firing, an interspike interval (ISI) longer than 260 milliseconds was defined as a lapse in motor  firing. An individual ratio of normal ISIs to lapses for each SMU three minute recording run and the mean ratio for each subject (MLR) were calculated. Significant differences were found between MLR pre- and post-test values for both groups (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that changes in motor unit firing can be produced by specific exercise programs. High intensity, short duration exercises produce more variable than normal firing rates, and low intensity, long duration exercises produce firing rates less variable than normal. (Author/BD)",

Fifteen subjects participated in the study. The treatment was effective in producing increases in the amount of adult communication dealing with logic and with communication  which supports learning (p less than .059). The treatment was also effective in producing increases in the amount of child initiated communication (p less than .059), of child communication dealing with logic (p less then .059), and of the total volume of child communication.

        "description":"There are several critical five minute periods in any lesson, and it is important for teachers to know how to use them. No matter how long a period may be, the most important five minutes, and no more, should be written out. This writing forces the teacher to put down on paper only the most important items. The first five minutes of a period should be extemporaneous. Any teacher who has carefully written out or thought out the most important five minutes of a lesson is in a good position to look over the group and decide where to begin. The last five minutes of every encountered session should be used to sum up what has been done and to clarify future expectations. The ability to establish some sort of human contact with the class before beginning the professional contact is a  sign of a good teacher. The teacher should look around for a friendly face to focus in on before beginning the lesson. If a teacher does a good job in presenting a lesson to at least one learner, there is a great possibility that the rest of the class will catch the main idea. The teacher who looks around for more friendly faces during the five minute warmup will find the class more receptive to what the teacher has to present. Staying around for at least five minutes after the end of a lesson provides the teacher with an opportunity for a followup between self-fulfilling teachers and agressive learners. (RC)",

The first section of the document discusses the following seven steps to be observed in writing better behavioral objectives: (1) write a simple behavioral objective; (2) edit your verb to make it an action verb; (3) revise your objective to make it learner-centered; (4) remove ambiguities to attain operational clarity; (5) chop-up the criteria into degrees of excellence; (6) pinpoint the conditions under which the learner will perform; and (7) ask a total stranger for his/her opinion of your objectives on steps 1-6 above. Three examples are presented in which these seven steps have been applied to a general objective in order to better define it. The  first section also discusses applying these steps to allied health modules. The second section discusses the application of the material presented in the first section to a course outline. It covers gathering and classifying materials, determining categories and subcategories, and evaluation. The last section is a workbook which applies the seven steps outlined in the first section to nursing and health-related fields. (BD)",

The program emphasizes consistent use of instructional design and the instructional processes of assessment, goal setting, determining objectives, developing teaching strategies, and evaluating. During this two-year program, students spend 50 percent of their time in an internship at a Lansing elementary school and 50 percent of their time in completing degree requirements. Additionally, the interns receive field-based bilingual training and are involved in a variety of community based activities. In the spring of 1973, 30 interns were selected for this program from populations which included Mexican-Americans and/or  Spanish-speaking, blacks, American Indians, and economically disadvantaged whites. On examining the academic achievement of these interns, it was found that the mean grade point average for these Teacher Corps interns was the same as for the seniors in the College of Education at Michigan State University. Fifty percent of the minority interns had grade point averages equal to or better than the average for the seniors in the College of Education. The nonminority interns had the highest grade point averages of any of the groups in this comparison. When the interns were grouped by sex, the male interns appeared very similar to the minority interns, while the females closely resembled the nonminority interns. (BD)",

The preceding teacher training program contained an excessive number of weaknesses, primarily involving lack of direction for the student teacher and lack of self-evaluation procedures. It was hypothesized that a set of guidelines could improve the efficiency of this program. These guidelines were designed to give th e desired direction wihtout hindering the initiative and creativity of those involved. Evaluation of this practicum was based on three sources of information. First , cooperating teachers were asked to compare the student teacher training program before and after the guidelines were put  into use. Second , questionnaires about the guidelines were answered by all participants. The third source of information involved observation by the author, including analysis of checklists provided within the framework of guidelines, as well as observation of participants in action. Increased efficiency and effectiveness were indicated by all three sources; the practicum was, therefore, deemed successful. (Author/BD)",

One hundred twenty grade 7 students were selected to make up the Mentor Program group (experimental) and 120 grade 7 students were identified as the Comparative group (control). The Mentor Program children were involved with faculty Mentors during the school year. The Comparative group received no special kind of treatment. Throughout the school year the Mentors and children met as individual and group needs dictated. Each of the 240 students was administered the Student Attitudinal Instruments in the fall (pretest)  and spring (posttest). The responses were then analyzed. The Mentors monitored their own behavior for negative acts. Questionnaires were also developed for the student and faculty groups, and the responses were analyzed. The investigations showed that the teacher group involved in the program improved their classroom behavior and that the child's perception of the teacher also improved. (RC)",

Much has been written on topics such as testing, selection, prediction and wastage, with findings and conclusions which appear to have varying degrees of relevance to contemporary problems in Victoria. This literature review does not attempt to discuss or even list every article ever published in this area. It does attempt to define a limited area in terms of those aspects which seem more relevant to the circumstances of the present problem. Some early studies are discussed in relation to the changing perspectives and the historical developments in methods of analysis and  suggested solutions. Overseas studies have been selected when their findings have been general and transferable to the current Victorian situation, or when they have appeared to influence other important investigations. Although some non-congnitive studies are reviewed, the general emphasis is on studies dealing with cognitive factors in testing and selecting. (Author/RC)",

The most important finding of this study is that a simplex model which allows for measurement error, fits a variety of longitudinal academic data quite well. This allows for attenuation corrections when only one measure is available at each time. More importantly, the results suggest that the commonly used split-half or parallel form procedures for estimating reliability may typically yield overestimates or reliability due to &quot;method&quot;  variance, i.e., nonindependent measurement errors resulting from the use of closely similar item types. The simplex model appears less subject to this problem because both item format and content change over time. It has been demonstrated that accurate corrections for attenuation are essential to a study of the determinants of academic growth. (Author/RC)",

This paper grew out of the need to find and use standardized tests that would depict accurately the performance of various cultural groups in America. In order to make judgments about performance, it is wise to examine the theoretical structure from which most of the existing tests were developed. Accordingly, the paper traces the development of the various strategies and theoretical structures, explaining why they have met with limited success. Through a paradigmatic analysis of the literature, it identifies the existing testing paradigm as a monocultural one, and it relates the various efforts to produce a culture-fair test. The paradigmatic analysis is extended to encompass a proposition, based  upon the coalescence of the scientific (theoretical and measurement) and policy contexts. The analysis suggests a procedure by which tests can be developed and/or evaluated if they are to depict accurately the performance of various cultural groups. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper reports the findings of an attempt to improve test-wiseness (TW) through direct instruction in selected test-taking strategies. TW was defined as \"a cognitive function, subject to improvement through both general exposure to a wide variety of test items, and specific training in test-taking skills.\" The total investigation included: development and validation of a test instrument to measure TW; evaluation of the level of TW in an adult occupational group; program development and refinement; investigation of the psychological correlates of TW; and, formative and summative evaluations of a TW program. A program was developed to provide training in responding to multiple-choice and essay test items. The program combines instruction and measurement in a workbook format,  with diagnostic testing and some branching. It was designed for use by adults, and focuses on strategies applicable to a wide variety of occupational or licensing examinations. Rules and strategies are emphasized, rather than practice in specific item types. Included are rules related to accuracy of item interpretation, deductive reasoning to eliminate absurd, similar or contradictory options, and cue-using strategies. A complex, multi-sample design was used for formative evaluations and additional evaluations will be completed. General findings to date have shown an increase in TW both on an internal and an external criterion and a decrease in test-related anxiety, after use of the program. Trends for increased consistency in test performance over time were noted. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"An &quot;undesigned&quot; experiment is one in which the predictor variables are correlated, either due to a failure to complete a design or because the investigator was unable to select or control relevant experimental conditions. The traditional method of analyzing this class of experiment--multiple regression analysis based on a least squares criterion--gives rise to a number of interpretation problems when the effects of individual predictors are to be assessed. Some difficulties and their effects on the quality of information are discussed. Two methods are described in this report for improving the information obtained from the undesigned human factors experiment. One is to collect more information at a few data points selected at locations that improve the orthogonality of this  non-orthogonal design. The other is to use a ridge regression analysis in place of the conventional least squares analysis, in which a slight bias is introduced into the data in such a way that the combined bias and variance error is smaller than the variance error of unbiased estimates from the least squares analysis. The ridge analysis produces more stable and meaningful regression coefficients. Computational aids--both references and complete computer programs--are supplied. (Author)",

The Student Attribute Study as a whole was designed to follow up on earlier work relating teacher expectations and attitudes to differential teacher behavior with different kinds of students. In part, it has been a replication and extension of previous work identifying important expectations and attitudes that teachers hold and relating these to differential treatment of different students. In addition, it represents a movement in focus from identifying  differential teacher-student interaction patterns related to teacher attitudes and expectations toward investigation of differential student attributes and behavior which presumably trigger these differential teacher expectations and attitudes in the first place. Thus, in addition to identifying differential teacher-student interaction related to teacher attitudes and expectations, the Student Attribute Study tries to answer the question &quot;What student attributes do teachers notice and use in forming expectations and attitudes?&quot; (Author/RC)",

Using factor analyses, contingency analyses, and regression analyses, interrelationships among the reading scores on the two tests were compared. It was hypothesized that the norm-referenced test would show more bias as indicated by differential relationships among scores. The regression analyses indicated some bias in all the tests used. The contingency analyses, made of the CRT only, suggested little bias. The factor analyses  suggested parts of the CRT were not biased but the remaining parts and the NRT measures were.

A variety of different types of meetings were distributed throughout the 37-week schedule: building meetings, citywide meetings, curriculum meetings, human relations meetings, etc. This report summarizes the overall findings. An evaluation strategy was developed with two major considerations. First, it would provide a vehicle for systematic planning and documentation of released time meetings. Second, it would provide outcome measures of released time benefits in addition to surveys of staff opinions. The evaluation strategy proceeded through five steps: needs assessment,  objective setting, activity planning, process evaluation, and outcome evaluation. Evaluation findings indicated that many positive activities occurred during the Tuesday Released Time Program and that the participants had generally favorable views of the program. Several recommendations for improvement are given. (Author/RC)",

Individuals were selected for examination so that the levels of achievement they demonstrated would be representative of the achievement of the entire country. Individuals were selected from four age levels--nine, 13, 17 and 26 through 35--which correspond to four key stages in the education of most individuals: the end of primary school, junior high school, high school and a few years past the end of formal schooling. The individuals were also classified according to region of the country, sex, race, parental education and size and type of community to provide additional  information about types of schools and students. Achievement levels of young Americans in seven assessment areas are described in this volume--science, social studies, music, literature, reading, writing, and citizenship. Results of the seven assessments indicate that there are serious disparities in the achievement levels of various groups within the nation. The results indicate the degree of that disparity.

The main activity being reported is the development of &quot;factor-referenced&quot; or &quot;marker&quot; tests for several recently identified cognitive factors. A secondary activity involves the study of possible relationships to factors already established. These developmental activities include a field study of these measures for improvement of the items in the tests, the determination of the reliabilities of the tests, and some clarification of these cognitive factors. The five newly identified factors are: concept attainment, figural fluency, integrative processes, visual memory, and verbal closure. Because it seemed especially important to determine whether the new factors could be separated  from other somewhat similar factors, marker tests for six other factors were included in the study. These established factors are figural adaptive flexibility, logical reasoning, general reasoning, number facility, spatial orientation, and speed of closure. The results indicated that the attempt to find the verbal closure and figural fluency factors had been successful, that the visual memory factor had been adequately replicated, that there was confusion between the integrative processes factor and some of the reasoning factors, and that the attempt to replicate the concept attainment factor had failed.

The paper outlines a means for both developing an affective goal structure and identifying measurable indicators of affective behavior. To achieve this, it defines and discusses concepts related to educational affective context, affective objective hierarchy, affective learning objectives and affective classification matrix. Each of these concepts is further explained through the use of examples taken from an elementary and secondary school setting. The paper concludes that the application of these concepts to curriculum development will result in a more humane, as well as affective, education experience. (Author/RC)",

The overall objective was to conduct research in the area of factor analysis directed toward the identification of tests and other instruments that can serve as markers for well-established factors. The term &quot;factor referenced&quot; was introduced in this project to call attention to the factors as the construct of interest. This usage is in keeping with the general concept of criterion-referenced tests. It is the sense of clarifying something that is being measured that the factor-referenced measures are offered to researchers and practitioners  concerned with assessing human abilities. It is hoped that the results of this study will aid in the development of structure for the cognitive domain of human abilities and a beginning for a comparable structure for the temperament domain of personality. Such theoretical structures are founded on empirical evidence and are amenable to continued challenge and verification. Researchers could be expected to use a small number of the resulting factor-referenced tests as markers for testing conjectures about factors in their studies. Summary lists of the 23 cognitive factors with the recommended marker tests, and the 28 temperament factors with the scales proposed for them are given in the appendix. (RC)",

        "description":"The Employability Skills Program (ESP) at Edison High School was designed to serve 10th grade students who were considered to be potential dropouts because of basic skills deficiencies, poor attitudes toward school, or individual adjustment problems. The major student-related objectives of the project were to improve basic skills, improve attitudes toward school, improve self-concepts, and to clarify educational and vocational goals. About 100 students participated in ESP during the 1972-73 school year. One-third of the students were identified as eligible for instruction through the Special Learning and Behavior Problems (SLBP) Program. Ninth grade school records of the ESP students indicated poor attendance, poor behavior ratings, and mainly grades of D and F in academic  subjects. Between September 1972 and May 1973, ESP students made modest gains on the STEP Reading and English Expression Tests and greater gains on the Social Studies test. The majority of the ESP students felt that they benefited academically from participation in ESP, that they improved their self-understanding, and that they learned about careers and jobs. ESP students appeared to have more favorable views of their teachers, the relevance of the curriculum and their own learning progress than did two comparison groups of 1972-73 students. Eighty percent of the students would select ESP over the regular high school program in 1973-74 if they had an option. Recommendations were made to continue the program. (Author/DEP)",

This report describes junior and senior high student responses by achievement in school, racial/ethnic background, and sex. Students who identified themselves as high academic achievers had substantially more positive attitudes toward many aspects of school than did students who saw themselves as low achievers. Black students at the junior high level expressed more favorable attitudes toward school than did white and Indian students. A greater percentage of blacks than whites and Indians said they liked school, that the curriculum was relevant, and that they were involved in decision  making. At the senior high level these differences between racial-ethnic groups were not as pronounced. Senior high blacks were not as positive as junior high blacks, while senior high Indians were more positive than junior high Indians. Few substantial differences between females and males occurred. Males had less positive attitudes than did females on the items related to unfair punishment and racial attitudes. Females expreseed greater anxiety about speaking in front of the class, and tended to have more positive attitudes than males toward school in general and the presence of positive reinforcement.

An additional counselor was hired for each of the two schools in the project, Jordan and Marshall-University. A major procedural objective called for the counselors to place greater emphasis on team member, implementer, and facilitator functions. The outcome objectives of the project were increased counselor effectiveness as viewed by teachers and students, positive student attitudes toward school, and increased parent and student involvement in the school. Two seventh grade counselors at Jordan assumed responsibility for the usual administrative role in the area of student behavior. Working contacts between counselors and teachers were increased by team meetings held twice a week  during the second semester, counselor visits to classrooms, and informal meetings in the seventh grade conference area. At Marshall-University teacher-counselor teams consisting of one counselor and four teachers, were set up to work with 160 eighth graders and 100 seventh graders. Daily team meetings during the team teachers' common preparation time were the core of the project. Generally, both teachers and students expressed more favorable attitudes toward their counselors after implementation of the Reorganized Junior High School Program. (Author/BJG)",

Attempts to measure impact were made, and a number of individual projects were evaluated. Substantial gains for children in grades 7-9 were noted, but these gains could not be attributed solely to the Title I effort. Gains were also noted for several projects involving elementary school children. Three of the five program objectives for 1973-74 were reached. Title I children in 1973-74 did at least as well as Title I children in 1972-73. Title I children maintained their distance relative to non-Title I  children. Students in secondary school programs made substantial gains. Long term test score trends showed growth in grades 1-3 for Title I and non-Title I schools. Achievement trend lines for grade 5 and 6 appear flat. Data were not available for grade 4. Evidence suggests that although Title I children in Minneapolis are not falling further behind their non-Title I classmates, changes in student populations suggest that the gap will widen. Recommendations are made. (Author/BJG)",

The &quot;Reading: Teacher Observation Scale (TOS)&quot; has been designed to be used with a corresponding observation instrument which focuses on the behavior of the students. The TOS can either be used by itself; or it can be used concurrently with the &quot;Reading: Student Observation Scale (SOS)&quot; by having two observers present in the classroom, one using the Reading TOS and the other observer using the Reading SOS. When both observation instruments are used at the same time in the classroom, the pair of trained observers would observe so that one observer codes the teacher's behavior  in ten-second intervals while the other observer codes the behavior of a different student every fifteen seconds. The time intervals for these two instruments are different because the pilot tests of the instruments indicated that it was too difficult to do reliability studies of student observations within any shorter time-interval. The manual which was used by the observers during the training program appears in Part I of this report. The trainer's manual which was used during the training program appears in Part II of this report; the trainer's manual contains additional practice exercises and a detailed training schedule.

By capitalizing on baseline data collected from a similar, prior class and focusing treatment on difficult test items, the instructor can develop sensitive within class designs for the detection of treatment effects. An experiment using written objectives given to the students to aid their learning and using the single classroom design shows that objectives significantly improve learning. Written objectives are also shown to interact with item difficulty. The experiment leads to the recommendation that instructors engage in personal inquiry into their efforts to influence student learning and that such inquiry be added to the educational research literature.

Of the seven objectives measured, all were met. Requests for materials were responded to, teachers were actively encouraged to integrate consumer education into their regular curricula, and a competency guide was developed, distributed, and evaluated. Also, new curricular  materials were evaluated and parents, businesses, and governmental agencies were included in project activities.

It differs from other studies in that it is based on a comprehensive body of data, including information about state-supported contracts in Michigan and California; it is focused on the role of monetary incentives in education rather than on the particular instructional programs; it made a special effort to collect information about teacher-contracted projects; and it is especially concerned with the long-run effects of performance contracting in the districts where it has been tried. The data base consists of interviews held in ten school districts and at three state departments of education, and with representatives of three private firms; documents furnished by the school districts and the state departments; and 42  responses to a questionnaire sent to the 79 school districts which were apparently all that might ever have had a performance contract (other than the ten in which interviews were held).

The paper is considered to show that this model is seriously misspecified due to its omission of aggregate levels of academic ability. Based on achievement test data from the 24 school district of the state of Maryland, the report finds that estimates of the influences of community resources and organizational characteristics of districts are markedly inflated due to the omission of aggregate levels of student ability from the analysis. One 5-10 percent of the total variance in student achievement in Maryland is estimated to lie between school districts. This figure establishes an upper bound on the importance of any and all district-level  variables for academic achievement. These findings are held to seriously undermine the utility of the Bidwell-Kasarda model of school district-level academic achievement. It is asserted that specific results cannot be generalized for any other State because of the small number of school districts in Maryland and the fact that districts are coterminous with county boundaries.

        "description":"This document describes the development of an instrument to identify and diagnose developmental deficits at age 5 and the planning of a deficit centered training curriculum to prevent learning disabilities. An evaluation of the effectiveness of this curriculum, based on measures of the children's developmental growth and their academic achievement before and after the intervention program, indicates changes in intelligence, bodily schema, perceptual function, language development, and academic achievement for experimental and control groups following their first grade experience. Since the academic results are considered to be meaningless at this time, a followup study at the end of the children's second year of schooling will be made to ascertain differences based on both  groups' exposure to the same reading program. Although the developmental gains are stated to be impressive, the degree to which the experimental children are able to compete in school is held to be the determinant of the program's ultimate success. Further investigations of the effect of special grouping, smaller class size,and the curriculum as they relate to this study are urged. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This study tests the influence of various combinations of housing environments with both the participation and nonparticipation of disadvantaged children in a special enrichment program. Three hypotheses are put forth: (1) children living in public housing will exhibit greater growth and development than children living in substandard housing; (2) children in Head Start programs will exhibit greater growth and development than control children; and (3) there will be no interaction effects. Two predictions derived from the hypotheses are made: (1) children living in better housing and participating in Head Start programs will exhibit greater growth and development than children in other groups, and (2) children living in substandard housing and not enrolled in Head Start programs  will exhibit the least amount of growth and development. Only the second hypothesis was confirmed indicating Head Start's tremendous impact on the participating children. Three conclusions are drawn from this study: (1) Head Start, as compared with the housing environment, can produce more dramatic immediate results; (2) the significance of the housing environment as a factor in human growth and development remains inconclusive and needs further research for verification; and (3) the housing environment, rather than acting as a direct controlling influence, may simply provide the setting which encourages or inhibits the influence of other variables.

        "description":"The initial part of this paper summarizes the bases for the assertion that the most immediate, overwhelming, and stubborn obstacles to achieving quality and equality in education lie as much in the character and way of life of the American Negro as in the indifference and hostility of the white community toward blacks. A discussion of prenatal damage, father absence, an impoverished home environment, and dysfunctional patterns of child rearing are included here. These inadequacies are considered to present problems not only to the Negro child but also to his white companion in an integrated classroom setting. Findings of social-psychological research, calling for a counter-strategy of active involvement in work with disadvantaged children on the part of middle class children and  adults of both races, are presented. These results are seen as benefitting not only the disadvantaged but also the advantaged child, by providing him with needed training in actual behavior consistent with the democratic values of human dignity and social responsibility.

Issues discussed here are culture conditioning and marginality, self-concept, social perception and attitudes, interrelationships between attitudes and perceptions, and the influence of cultural values and beliefs. Problems and attitudes that blacks might bring to the counseling session are dealt with next, followed by a discussion of the philosophical base or rationale for the counseling process. Suggested steps that counselors might immediately take as individuals and collectively as professionals to counsel these minority populations include an acceptance and encouragement of change, a recommitment to the goals of human fulfillment, and the development of a  true respect for diversity. A number of suggestions directed to those individuals desirous to counsel minorities are: (1) counselors must move out of the cubicle into the community; (2) counselors' reliance on remedial services must be replaced by active preventative and developmental strategies; (3) counselors must become sensitive to the need to be involved in a greater diversity of services; and (4) counselors must begin to see themselves as facilitators of self-evaluation and decision-making.

This paper discusses one locale which has a large proportion of recent Portuguese immigrants, and emphasizes how women, in particular, are important in the formation of new networks, through the utilization of a well-known Portuguese technique of \"making a cunha.\" The data are stated to suggest that in the migration process women are significant in the formation of both general and optative-set networks. The study is said to raise a number of questions such as: (1) whether there is bias in the data which minimizes the female role in network formation; (2) whether women play more  important factorial roles during periods of instability and/or rapid cultural change; (3) how institutionally significant the cunha process is cross-culturally; and, (4) how the cunha process relates to patronage.

The general hypothesis tested is that migration and residence in a place where low fertility is the norm results in lower fertility among the migrants than among those who remained at the place of origin. In general, the effect of migration to the mainland is considered to reduce fertility, but to a very small extent. Some evidence that this effect of migration on fertility is diminishing is stated to exist. Results of the analysis of the relationship between the ability to speak English and current fertility for urban  island residents is held to indicate that those who speak English have considerably lower levels of current fertility than those who do not. The ability to speak English is seen to be an indicator of a whole cluster of attitudes and behaviors associated with what is labeled \"modernism.\" The importance of micro-census data when addressing the issue of migration and fertility is stressed.

        "description":"This report contains a tabular summary of the results of the April 1974 city-wide reading test administered in Grades 2 through 9 in all New York City public schools. Test results are presented at three levels for comparative analysis: New York City with other major cities, community school districts within N.Y.C., and community schools within districts. Test results data are presented in arithmetic means, medians, and percentages allowing for varied means of analysis. Results indicate that citywide averages improved from 1973 to 1974 in Grades 3 and 7 and declined in Grade 9. The remaining five grades remained at the same level. Citywide percentages of pupils reading at or above grade level decreased two-tenths of one percent. Taking into account the reading achievement  statistics for the city as a whole and for its component community school districts, the report concludes that there has been a high degree of stability in reading achievement over the past four years.

The availability of achievement data for the entire black and white population, along with the 13-year time span between observations are seen as principal advantages. Data show that the academic achievement gap between white and black children was smaller in 1974 than in 1961. The amount of decrease in the gap is stated to be small, yet of practical significance for the four subject areas examined: reading, vocabulary, math computation, and math problems solving. Of these areas, convergence in the black and white distribution was greater for math computation than for the othersubtest areas examined. The use of  different tests in 1961 and 1974 is held to make assessment of changes in the absolute performance level of black or white children difficult. It is suggested that the study be viewed as an evaluation of a social action program rather than a scientific experiment. (Author/AM)",

Delivery of service is seen to have become more concentrated with fewer schools identified as Title I targets and with fewer programs being  continued.

A two-pronged attack to combat these problems, including a placement committee to control the academic program and workload of all incoming freshmen, and an intensive orientation and the academic program and workload of all incoming frewhmen, and an intensive orientation and academic counseling system, is described. The orientation and pre-registration goals are considered  to have been achieved by means of a program to which entering freshmen are invited at the end of the previous semester in groups of about one hundred. Following a general introduction and orientation to the college, counselors proceed to counsel and pre-register students in groups of ten, with the technical assistance of a student aide. To serve the number of students who remained perplexed after the large scale orientation and pre-registration, an individual approach consisting of informal briefing and question and answer periods is suggested. Results of a pilot survey sampling students' reaction to this approach suggest that it successfully accomplished its objectives. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This report is the sixth in a series of longitudinal studies describing the College Discovery and Development Program aimed at identifying disadvantaged and under achieving ninth graders and developing their college potential in five special high school development centers. The sixth year brought the completion of the discovery and development cycle for the first of its students, those who had completed their studies with associate degrees, and the mid-college point for the first baccalaureate students. Various sections include descriptions of the sixth year of the program, personnel, facilities, the sixth population of students, attendance and achievement for all classes in 1970-71, college progress for classes I-III, high school graduation and admission to college for class IV,  and a summary. Class VI resembled the previous five on all variables except for a lower income. The general findings for program students whose college records can be studied show a pattern of progress not greatly different from that of nonprogram classmates in each college. A number of newly stated specifically expressed behavioral objectives were added to the proposal for funding for the sixth year. (Author/AM)",

The data provided in this report provided the basis for a class action suit which resulted in the establishment of the Pilot Schools bilingual program. The Community Service Society began to gather the available facts in connection with legislation introduced in the 1973 session of the New York State Legislature. Consideration of the proposed legislation required information on the kinds of programs the New York City Board of Education and Community School districts are providing for these pupils, the number of students being served, and the effectiveness of these programs. Major findngs derived  from such data as Board of Education reports, interviews with administrators of programs for non-English speaking pupils in the New York City public schools, a content analysis of evaluations of selected bilingual programs, and observations of bilingual programs in city schools, include the following: (1) between 1971 (the date of the first published report on the Board of Education's language survey) and 1973, the proportion of pupils with English language difficulty increased from 8.9 percent to 12.9 percent of the total school enrollment, and (2) by 1973-1974, only about half of those with language problems were receiving special language instruction. Other findings are also highlighted. (Author/JM)",

These schools were to  provide a complete bilingual program for all students within each school who had been identified as needing the program.

        "description":"This paper focuses on changes in the occupational levels of black and white men in the decade between 1962 and 1973. For each race taken separately, and then for both in comparison, shifts are described in the mean levels and a dispersion of occupational socioeconomic status of men in the experienced civilian labor force. An attempt is made, it is stated, to account for these intercohort and racial shifts in terms of commensurate compositional changes in factors of family background and regular schooling. An inquiry is made into the allocative processes which distribute men into their current occupational statuses from their family backgrounds and in terms of their schooling. These allocative processes are understood as the basis of social differentiation and inequality, and they  are called processes of socioeconomic stratification. New data has been made available, and partly analyzed here about the socioeconomic origins and destinations of black and white men based on a 1973 replicate of the 1962 Occupational Changes in a Generation Survey (OCG). These data are considered to provide clearer insights about the sources of socioeconomic change for both races. They also permit some purportedly intriguing speculations about the course of racial inequality and about the evolving roles of families and schools in a maturing, postindustrial society.

        "description":"This essay treats inequality in access to schooling in demographic perspective. In constructing a brief history of educational inequality in the U.S., the 1962 and 1973 surveys of \"Occupational Changes in a Generation\" are drawn on heavily. It is found that among men born in the U.S. during the first half of this century, inequality of schooling has declined sharply, even as educational attainment has increased to levels unprecedented elsewhere in the world. Not only has total inequality in the distribution of schooling declined, but both the variability in schooling which may be attributed to differences in social background and the variability which is independent of social background appear to have declined. Moreover, these increases in educational equality appear to have  occurred within black and Spanish minority groups as much as in the majority population. There is a mixture of change and stability in the effects of social background characteristics on schooling. On the whole, social origins have become more favorable to high levels of schooling with minority groups, as in the majority population, but large differences in social origins persist among these groups, and in some instances the social origins of majority and minority populations have diverged. For cohorts of U.S. men born in this century, half or more of the variance in schooling must be attributed to the influence of family background. (Author/JM)",

The analysis begins with an overview of the market--past, present, and future. From there, future prospects for the school business are estimated. Declining enrollments, a tight job market for college graduates, the role of schooling in the development of personal and national wealth, cybernation, and changes in techno-structure are seen to have adverse effects on schools. Positive measures such as an increased emphasis on school improvement based on accountability, market development, restricting access, and charging higher prices to those admitted are cited. Preventive steps to improve the position of the  schools are urged such as the discouraging of certification services outside the formal school system, of school discount houses, and of movements that propose a de-schooling of society. Broadening the concept of work to include categories presently excluded is seen as a way of returning to schools the function of educating. (Author/AM)",

Phase I of the study consists of a literature-generated delineation of larger societal factors which create student unrest and give impetus to the development of alternative schools. Utilizing student and faculty interviews, the second phase derived three basic categories of concerns--curricular, bureaucratic-organizational, and interpersonal. The final phase of the study uses direct observation of three levels of complexity: the physical setting, the programmatic regularities, the analytic description. These are described in detail and analyzed. Four tensions confronting the alternative schools studied are identified  as having as a shared theme the larger issues of the individual versus society. The alternative school is refused endorsement as a forerunner of the future. Students are encouraged to participate in these settings, but until a balance which promotes individual freedom along with group responsibility is achieved, it is held that its potential as a serious contribution to American education cannot be judged.

        "description":"The 15-year effort to decentralize New York City public schools and thereby implement basic changes in the school system is briefly sketched in this study. The structure of the school system, powers of local boards, central board, and chancellor, school board elections, keeping the public informed, educational impact, and effect on truancy and crime are among the issues discussed. Structural change is found not to go to the root of most serious school problems which appear to be basically social and economic in nature. Although decentralization in New York City has created new job opportunities for minorities and brought control of schools closer to the community, it is considered not to have affected quality of education in schools. Likewise, Detroit's efforts toward  decentralization are described. Intended as political rather than educational reform, decentralization here has produced a grass-roots school board, and it has involved more people in school affairs. Yet significant reforms in the schools are seen not to exist, and a new structure that includes both the management and political skills of the city's top leaders and the knowledge and vitality of the neighborhood representatives is urged.

It was developed as an adjunct to on-the-job training for use without direct instructor supervision. Directions and suggestions for using the manual are provided. The content is presented in three major sections. The first deals with the definition of a tumor registry, general introduction to tumor registries, types of registries, confidentiality of patient records, and functions of registries (data collection, patient follow-up, education, and research). Descriptions of job activities and job aids of the tumor registrar are contained in the second section. The final section  presents the relationship between the tumor registry and the hospital in general, other hospital departments, and outside medical organizations. The material is presented in paragraph and outline form. Objective and subjective test items are interspersed followed by answers. Important words in tumor registry vocabulary are underlined and defined. Sample medical record forms are included in the text. Also contained are a two-page glossary, a selected bibliography for learner use, and a subject index. (MS)",

        "description":"The literature review focuses on the nation's current readiness to incorporate the 15 USOE occupational clusters into the nation's evolving career education. This readiness first simplifies job complexity by grouping a multitude of jobs into occupational awareness, career orientation and exploration, and career selection and preparation. But knowledge of career development is needed to make career education work. So is a vision of education as a continuing arrangement of means by which individuals challenge their environments to make them speak back to them honestly. Systems knowledge is required. Management by objectives becomes an acurely needed technique. Titles cited in the review (the documents are contained in the ERIC or AIM/ARM collections) indicate the considerable span  of career education. The program must be organized and administered in the school as a whole because the subject must be taught in elementary, middle, and high school and in postsecondary education as well. Occupational clusters must be introduced into the curriculum at all levels and reflected in the functions of career guidance, placement, and follow-up at various times. Some products of the cluster development efforts have been entered into the ERIC system and are identified and briefly described; projects developing material are described in the appendix.

Emphasis is placed on the interrelatedness of implementation to both planning and evaluation of career education. The 11 subsystems involved in implementing career education are discussed: establish conceptual framework to conduct public relations/information service; establish enabling legislation/set policy; allocate/provide funds; establish advisory committee/organize staff; arrange community participation; arrange institutional participation; scheduling time; develop program guide; recruit/select/develop staff; develop/obtain software/hardware; and arrange facilities/sites. The initiation  of the career education delivery system is concerned primarily with the pilot test and field test. To maintain the system, there must be a closed loop from system operation to evaluation to provide continuous feedback and direct adjustments in the operating system. The model assumes a foundation of local initiative fostered and reinforced at regional and national levels. (Author/EC)",

The first part involved mailing questionnaires to 600 students randomly selected from 897, and was supplemented by the arbitrary selection of 150 from the same number for personal interviews. A closed-answer format, 12-item questionnaire was developed to gather information on: student educational completion, education as related to employment, student views of educational quality, and student concern regarding counseling and others. Results, based on 229 returned questionnaires and 36 conducted interviews are summarized in narrative and graphic  form for each question. They show an overall satisfactory rating of vocational education by former students. An area of particular student concern was desire for school responsibility in providing job placement. The comment section of the questionnaire yielded a large number of suggestions and criticisms for improving vocational education. Sixteen response trends are identified as part of the conclusions. Appended are the questionnaire, computer print-out of total responses, correspondence forms, and acknowledgements. (MS)",

Among the conclusions are these: A curriculum infusion model appears to be a viable strategy for introducing career education elements into a school; intensive sessions with intervals between them and interaction among participants from different districts facilitated the training. That participant teacher and counselor aides did not effectively support teachers' implementation of units is attributed to the omission of a specific training module for aides. (AJ)",

The first includes six steps: exposure-reflection; problem identification, analysis, and data gathering; goal setting; strategy and planning; implementation; and evaluation. The second focuses on the broad situation but can use the same steps as the first.  The attitude to volunteer work should be that of professional commitment to the particular job and should be accompanied by a commitment to interpersonal skills in working with others and sometimes also advocacy for community health.

Since the objectives were pupil-centered and flexible it proved to be impossible to write objective items. The subjective nature of the test exposed an unanticipated problem of scoring, which was solved by the development of an explicit scoring key to be used by two  independent scores. The final form of the test contains 25 self and work-related items calling for written responses and is to be used at the ninth grade level.

Part Three presents four illustrative case of proposed location areas and their projected impact on existing schools to demonstrate the  implementation of the new methodology. Part Four presents detailed consideration of the various factors within the new enrollment projection methodology, their limitations and accuracy, and also considers potential improvements to the methodology through improved data collection and analyses. Summary conclusions and recommendations resultant from this study are discussed in Part Five. (Author/EC)",

Observations indicate that lifelong learning will be a central concern of education in the future, and much needs to be done to make lifelong learning available to all. A proposed &quot;agenda for action&quot; focuses on examination throughout the State of the Areas of: (1) financing, (2) information, (3) counseling, (4) adult learning goals, and (5) the role of the media, particularly television. Additional State or Federal financing for adult part-time students, information dissemination of adult education opportunities,  and increased educational/vocational counseling are all viewed as major areas of concern. Proposed focus on adult learning goals has been narrowed to the initial key topic of adult knowledge regarding children and youth, with later emphasis on public affairs, occupations, and the elderly. Special attention is being directed to the role of television in adult education. Working papers on the five areas are being compiled to be used in future proposed consensus building conferences.

An approach to financing adult learning that has generated much interest has been a universal lifelong educational entitlement plan to guarantee access to education for individuals throughout their lives. Several State papers related to the concept are presently being considered at the national level. Other possibilities being explored are  the opportunities available through private resources. Effective information dissemination appears to be through existing agencies. Additional study is needed to determine how augmented vocational/educational counseling services can be provided. Only preliminary probes have been made into the issues of adult learning goals and the role of educational television. Action plans include discussion at State/regional adult education conferences, continued participation in the national exploration of the entitlement concept, and increased publicity on the lifelong learning concept.

The paper is intended to stimulate further discussion of the idea of Educational Entitlement (EE). Main provisions of the hypothetical bill would entitle every adult American to receive an annual EE, beginning three years after last enrollment as a regular high school or college student and remaining available throughout the individual's life, to be used for any of a broad range of educational activities. Funding possibilities would be annual funds appropriated by Congress or a special tax to pay for EE.  Basic reasons cited for public subsidy of adult learning through EE include: (1) reducing the cost barrier for more adults to participate; (2) seeking to change the fact that those who now participate tend to be those who have already had more education; (3) providing adults with maximum decision-making in determining their education; and (4) adjusting public financing policy for education toward a position of &quot;age neutrality&quot; for adults.

Lack of adequate outreach and counseling services in different agencies and schools have contributed to the 14 percent unemployment rate of Vietnam veterans. A continuing increase in veteran population is projected with 80 percent eligible for postsecondary educational opportunities. A characterization of the Vietnam veteran is given in terms of location, age, educational background, and employment. Discharge procedures, available counseling, and G. I. benefits are  described with reference to the various State agencies that offer information and assistance to veterans. Problems encountered are also discussed. Examples of programs that assist the veteran and a model program are given as a guide for veteran counselors. Problem areas in meeting the needs of the veterans are identified as related to limited federal funding, lack of interagency cooperation, and lack of outreach and counseling services.

This legislation opened public service jobs and established Federal programs for special unemployment assistance. The role of manpower programs in alleviating the unemployment situation and the need to develop human resources to meet employment needs in the future are discussed. Aspects of the implications that these programs have for research and development issues in the making of comprehensive manpower plans and the establishment of planning councils are reviewed. Some of the research and development  needs arising from current public service employment programs are raised. Suggestions for major efforts under manpower programs include: special programs for disadvantaged clients; providing income assistance to ex-offenders; placing trained minority women in jobs commensurate with their skills; and improving the employment service. Other areas for research and development concern the transition from school to work for young people and the increasing unemployment rate of black teenagers. (Author/EC)",

These basically involved building institutional structures such as those found in developed nations and the introduction of investments and industrialization. The Interuniversity Research Program on Institution Building studied various aspects of institution-building, development, and problems encountered in building agricultural research, teaching, and service institutions in developing countries. The need for more knowledge of technical assistance methodology resulted in various research projects to study ways of improving technical assistance and institution-building based on a new model. A design perspective approach to institution-building concerns effective arrangements within  the domain of technical assistance encompassing implementation and evaluation. Designing is a unique process for a particular problem where technical assistance is often affected by the characteristics of agencies and enviornments. Questions concern the applicability of the design approach on a practical level, its basic assumptions, and what impact it might have on the field of education. (EC)",

Tasks related to the job functions of service, production, sanitation/safety, menu planning, procurement, supervision, and management were studied for five job categories of full-time personnel: middle-level service, upper-level service, middle-level production, upper-level production, and manager. Questionnaires, personal interviews, and a task list were used to obtain information from managers and employees in 32 restaurants, 20 hospitals, 14 nursing homes, 23 colleges/universities, and 21 schools in Iowa which met the selection criteria. Data from 339 of a possible 525 tasks lists are analyzed in detail and are also presented in tabular form for each job  category, classified by establishment type, to show the percent of personnel performing the tasks, relation of task patterns to job category and establishment type, and frequency of performance. A detailed summary presents specific conclusions supporting three general outcomes: Tasks for the job categories and establishments were identified, commonality and uniqueness in their performance was demonstrated, and probable changes in task combinations were shown. A three-page reference list and appended data collection materials and tables of data are included. (MS)",

(5) Objectives are unclear and in need of development. (6) Evaluation explores the variety and amount of evaluative programs used. (7) Resources Utilized notes a lack of co-ordination between resources available and their use, and inadequate equipment and facilities.

The subjects of the research were 218 women (144 black and 74 white) employed in the new clothing manufacturing industry and in three traditional jobs in the community (unskilled factory work, domestic work, and teaching). Personal interviews were used to ascertain the background, evaluation of work situation, and the effect of employment on such areas as childcare patterns, child development, leisure time for the family, social life activities with other workers, and family planning for the subjects. In addition, results on the Metropolitan Achievement Tests were used to  assess the academic performance of the children of the subjects. In general, few findings were related to length of employment (one year vs. three years) in the new industry. Although racial factors affected some results, the families of both black and white workers were satisfied with the workers' jobs, and their children showed improvement in reading and mathematics over a one-year period. Two appendixes include the interview questionnaire and the Occupational Level Rating Scale used to determine workers' socioeconomic status. (JR)",

Assuming that students' career preparation is minimal, both must strive to compensate for this deficiency, and both levels sorely need faculty and staff inservice. At the secondary level alone there is a need to look at every student as having a career goal and as needing help with career planning. Career education implementation activities at the high school level include: career guidance and counseling, job information, career exploration opportunities, job preparation opportunities, cooperative education experiences, placement services, and realistic and relevant learning opportunities for dropouts. At the higher education level it is necessary to meet students' needs through  innovative and flexible programing. A model for career education in higher education recently developed by the author and his students contains seven components: faculty-staff inservice, counseling and guidance, instructional program, field experience in the world of work, community involvement, placement services, and evaluation. Dealing with students as individuals who have stated and unstated career development needs is basic to program development in any institution. (Author/JR)",

The argument has four parts. First, it examines recent definitions of career education as an education calculated to ask with particular clarity what a person's vocational and life purposes are. Second, it examines the history of liberal education from the twelfth through the eighteenth centuries as an education also calculated to refine people's vocational skills and shape their life purposes. Third, it examines deviant nineteenth century traditions which argue for the separation of education from the formation of vocational or life purposes in the  interest of a pursuit of knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Fourth, it displays how the older marketplace version of liberal education also persisted through the nineteenth century up to today and how effective modern versions of this sort of education have emerged which emphasize that a liberal arts education must be open to the real world. It concludes that the new career education and a reformed liberal arts study can and must support one another. (Author)",

Extended Naval tenure was associated with lower verbal and clerical aptitudes (Naval Test Battery); higher levels of activity preference, pride in work, personal relations, and satisfaction with supervision and the work itself; a less explicit description of the future; and a belief that others shape and control one's future. The Attribute Preference Scale/Attribute Description Scale (APS/ADS) was developed to measure descriptions of current jobs and job structural attribute preferences. Results showed that Naval personnel who indicated a greater discrepancy  between preferred and described job attributes characterized their current jobs less favorably. Twenty pages of appendixes explain and provide copies of the APS/ADS scales, a biographical information sheet, and descriptive statistics for APS/ADS.

Also presented are a summary of the Dietary Technician program and an outline of remaining work on external degree and upper division program development. Material that was reviewed in the process of conceptualizing the paraprofessional role is presented to clarify Hotel and Food Service/Dietary Technician programs as fundamentally paraprofessional from a functional standpoint.

Assuming that Congress provides a national forum for inquiry into the progress of vocational education where evidence from the States is reflected, selected House and Senate committee hearings and reports on education were reviewed to produce a list of representative questions. The questions presented deal with: those served by vocational education, curricula, staff resources, facilities and equipment, costs, and outcomes. These are followed by a 17-page section listing specific questions structured around the following components of a conceptual framework for vocational education: (1) the context (population, employment, education, economic, local government economic,  school revenue base, and training resources information); (2) the inputs (revenue and new student information); (3) the process (enrollment, expenditure, program, staff, and site information); (4) the product (completion and withdrawal information); (5) the impact (post-school employment, job satisfaction, employer satisfaction, and school satisfaction information); and (6) the interrelation between the framework components. The report concludes with a brief description of information available through existing management systems and an epilogue stating the limitations of the report's accounting-type questions and the critical importance of answers to interrelated questions in planning.

Part 1 examines the historical perspective of permanent education, its development within the Council of Europe, and the implications of the principle of recurrence for other stages of the education system. Part 2 summarizes and assesses the 16 experiments which were conducted by the Council for Cultural Cooperation of the Council of Europe in various member countries as concrete examples of the principles of permanent education. Three key problems have emerged as themes in the council's analysis of the experimental projects: the problem of integrating mutually influencing but separate levels of education as well as educational  activities with other aspects of human life, the potential conflict between individual development and social constraints, and the political problem of not being able to alter the educational system without modifying sociopolitical structures. Part 3 is directed toward the development of recurrent education as a new approach to adult education. Issues examined include individual needs, structural changes, course content, teaching/learning methods, unit/credit system, and costs. (EA)",

The results indicated that 14 percent of the young drivers in the general population as compared with only 5 percent of the middle aged drivers reported having had an alcohol related accident within the past three years. Driving after drinking was common among young people (about three times per  month) and drinking frequency appeared consistent across young and middle aged driver populations. Young driver alcohol crash countermeasure and future research recommendations made are: late-night driving and speed-limit restriction, lowered absolute Blood Alcohol Concentration limit, public education for awareness of drinking-driving and disturbed behavior, driver rehabilitation, and mandatory alcohol safety interlock systems for convicted offenders.

        "description":"Criteria sets are a necessary step in the systematic development of evaluation in education. Evaluation results from the combination of criteria and evidence. There is a need to develop explicit tools for evaluating criteria, similar to those used in evaluating evidence. The formulation of such criteria depends on distinguishing between terms (concepts) and statements (linkages among concepts). For both terms and statements a further distinction must be made between categories (nonvariable classes or attributes) and continua (variable continuous dimensions). Borrowing from the discipline of sociology, an exploration for categorical terms for constructing a systems approach yields the elements: resources, structures, integrations, performances, and outputs. Continuous dimensions  borrowed from theory development are scope, parsimony, precision, and accuracy. Combining these dimensions and elements in a four by five solution grid provides both descriptive definitions and a prescriptive framework. Affixing labels to each cell of the grid provides both literal definitions (labels) and theoretical definitions (dimension by element). Dividing the system's elements into their philosophical components yields ontology, epistemology, ethics, aesthetics, and psychology. Crossing these philosophical elements in turn with the five system elements yields a five by five matrix which provides 25 possible elements for the investigation of criteria for criteria sets.

Education is vital if people are to understand the complex legislative process and the challenges to accepted institutions. This slow, built-in process provides protection against bad legislation. Lack of a national education policy and the development by the executive of rule by guidelines have caused problems for Congress. Through compromise in the legislative system, good programs do emerge, such as vocational education, toward which the Congress is very favorable. Development of this practical educational approach can help save the educational  system. In dealing with our growing population and economy, and with the need to change occupations within a lifetime, career education, in combination with vocational education, is vital. Occupational education can then continue at the postsecondary level. There is a need to overcome the stigma of vocational education as a place for nonachievers. Other challenges and opportunities are especially present in the areas of distributive education, agriculture, home economics, and paramedicine. (MS)",

The study provides background information and statistics, discusses pertinent national legislation and the steps taken to implement that legislation, summarizes the vocational rehabilitation resources and facilities employed throughout the nation, and lists references consulted for each of the following European countries: United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, Yugoslavia, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and West Germany. The study also discusses vocational rehabilitation  programs in the U.S. at the Federal level, at the regional level (region 8), and in the State of Connecticut, and describes in detail 11 model programs in various States. The study closes with a discussion of conclusions and recommendations indicating that although U.S. efforts at vocational rehabilitation are more organizationally structured than those of the European countries discussed, there is still a basic deficiency in the U.S. in making rehabilitation services available to all of those in need of such services. Appended are several Federal and Connecticut laws and directives regarding vocational rehabilitation. (JR)",

The criterion used by the model to evaluate electronic theory training is a determination of the usefulness of the training vis-a-vis the performance of assigned tasks in the various electronic career fields. Data collection is through a survey booklet, called the Electronic Principles Inventory, which is completed by practitioners in the field. The inventory is general in nature and can be administered to anyone who works with electronics, regardless of the level of involvement. The data can be analyzed using the Comprehensive Occupational Data Analysis Programs (CODAP). Significant results were found between and within electronic specialties.

Four phases of coordinated planning and decision-making are presented: (1) establishing the basis for industrial arts in the K-12 school system; (2) establishing the basis for industrial arts on the various operational levels (elementary, junior high, and high school); (3) outlining the local industrial arts program; and (4) preparing teaching plans. Phase 1 involves establishing the need for the program and describing how the needs can be met and general  program goals. Phase 2 is directed toward the needs of subpopulations within the school, with a recommended list of goals for each operational level. Phase 3 identifies the program offering, scope, and sequence. A suggested list of knowledge/skill/attitude competencies, developed by a team of Iowa industrial arts teachers, and corresponding sample learning activities are included for the offerings recommended. An eight-page reference/resource section is provided to assist with phase 4, which is directed mainly to the individual teacher. (EA)",

The major data source is the Current Population Survey conducted monthly for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the Bureau of Census. Part 1 provides information on employment and unemployment. In January 1975 some 36 and one-half million women were in the work force, about 40 percent of the country's entire labor force and almost 46 percent of all women 16 years and over. Part 2 shows the marital and family status. Married women living with their husbands, nearly 21 million in 1974, account for almost three-fifths of all women workers. However, the number of families headed by working women is rising. Income of working women is analyzed in Part 3, and  data on their education are shown in Part 4. The great majority of working women have not yet attained parity with working men in earned income. Median usual weekly earnings of women in full-time jobs in 1974 were about 60 percent of those of men. In 1974, 72 percent of women workers had graduated from high school, compared with 67 percent for men. Part 5 provides additional information on the characteristics of working women. (Author/EA)",

Participation rates were examined for females, blacks, Spanish surnames Americans, Asian Americans, and American Indians. Although employment of women and minorities has generally increased  between 1970 and 1972, the survey showed unbalanced occupational distribution and income for women and minorities. Twice the proportion of minority as Anglo women held positions in the laborer and service worker categories. Differentials between occupational distributions of Anglo and minority women were the greatest in Memphis and New Orleans and for Anglo and minority males in Memphis and Dallas. Blacks realized representation gains in the white collar field and Spanish surnamed Americans in the laborer category.

Eighteen papers, all dealing with fundamental problems in apprenticeship and skill training in the United States, were presented at the conference by practitioners, academic researchers, representatives of labor, and members of government. Summary papers in the document are grouped under the headings of: Apprenticeship As a Training Process, Lessons from Followup Studies of Journeymen and Apprentices, Apprenticeship and Minorities, Training Data and Manpower Planning, and Lessons from Foreign Experiences with Apprenticeship. A major diagnosis of the conference was that apprenticeship is  basically healthy but some changes can make it more vigorous and productive. Guiding principles for a model apprenticeship system include: voluntarism with some governmental support and guidance, flexibility in defining and implementing standards, applying the training system to a wide range of occupations and industries, and emphasis on both quality and quantity. Specific conclusions and recommendations were categorized according to costs and financing, ways and means to improve quality of training, apprenticeship and minorities, and data requirements for developing model training systems.

Sixty-two percent of vocational-technical, 24 percent of general education, and 12 percent of academic students indicated that they had received specialized training intended to prepare them for immediate employment upon graduation.

Approximately 87 percent of vocational-technical and 80 percent of academic and  general students who worked in training related jobs expressed satisfaction with their training. Although a generally high rate of approval was found, especially among business and office occupations students, two aspects of specialized training were criticized fairly often. First, many persons, especially health and home economics students, did not find their high school training useful in their on-the-job training programs. Second, many persons, especially agricultural and trade and industrial students, would have liked more experience in their training area before starting to work. (Author/JR)",

Five populations were surveyed, and specific questionnaires were developed for students, teachers (advisors), administrators, parents, and employers (training sponsors) to determine if the organizations were felt to be important and if they were accomplishing their objectives. The rate of response exceeded 65 percent for all  populations. Each questionnaire was analyzed for general trends by using means and percentages. Each item was analyzed by means of chi-square for differences among youth organizations. The tabulated findings, discussed in detail for each questionnaire type, indicate an overall positive perception of the organizations. Detailed conclusions show that the organizations were perceived as important and were meeting their objectives but were in need of support by the schools.

        "description":"The survey, conducted to determine patterns of instructional needs as perceived by adult basic education (ABE) and adult high school (AHS) teachers, attempts to answer three questions: from a broad array of possible instructional competencies, which competencies do teachers (1) perceive as being of the highest priority? (2) feel they have the greatest ability to perform? (3) rate highest in priority and lowest in their ability to perform? The population surveyed consisted of 69 ABE teachers and 186 AHS teachers employed in Utah. A majority of the teachers did not respond; respondents were the more experienced teachers. The survey instrument, the Adult Basic Education Teacher Competency Inventory (revised October 1974), consisting of 170 statements of teacher competency previously  established and validated, is appended. Teachers were asked to indicate the degree to which a teacher should be able to perform, and the degree to which they can perform, each competency. These are among the findings: ABE teachers felt most competent in those areas which they gave highest priority; the area of highest need was mathematics instruction. AHS teachers agreed widely on their abilities and on most-valued competencies; math and reading competencies showed great differences between &quot;should&quot; and &quot;able to&quot; statements.

Chapter 4 discusses the preliminary administration of the 384 items to a sample of maintenance personnel currently engaged in job activities that correspond to the proposed job descriptions at the 13 most highly mechanized post offices. Chapter 5 covers the selection of 339 test items, the assignment of the items to the four qualifying examinations, and the minimum standards for determining job qualification.

An important measure of the success of such education, the handicapped person's ability to get and hold a job, is described. Federal legislation providing for more training for the handicapped is briefly outlined. Twelve categories of handicapped persons are used for educational classification and are defined here: mentally retarded educable, mentally retarded trainable, neurologically impaired, perceptually impaired, emotionally disturbed, socially maladjusted, visually handicapped, auditorily handicapped, communication handicapped, orthopedically handicapped, chronically ill, and multiply handicapped. The recommended team  approach to long-term vocational development involving education and counseling is outlined. Five major phases (each described in detail) of the vocational preparation of the handicapped form a strategy which has often proven effective: (1) vocational evaluation, (2) self and career awareness, (3) skill training, (4) getting started in a real job, and (5) followup. The sequence of programs developed for the handicapped (elementary through high school level and older) includes technology for children, introduction to vocations, employment orientation, work experience and career exploration program, and part-time cooperative employment orientation.

Based on data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Men 1966-69, the following serve as criterion measures in a multivariate framework: a general occupational information test, attitudes toward adequacy of preparation, participation in post-school training, skill level of jobs, wages, measures of career potential, overall job satisfaction, and unemployment experience. Multiple regression is used to identify and measure the net effects of educational and  training variables by controlling statistically for other influences, with separate analyses conducted for white and black youth. The empirical findings reported and discussed for each criterion measure are summarized and provide the basis for specific conclusions which do not support the view that vocational education at the secondary level is superior preparation for the world of work. Four major implications for secondary education are drawn from the findings. A 14-page bibliography, a discussion of statistical tests of the significance of intergroup differences in regression, and tabulated regression results are appended. (Author/MS)",

Guidance and career units were primarily written by a curriculum writer and the project director; teacher involvement was mainly through study of the written materials. The guidance/counseling component is geared to the development of positive work attitudes and self-concept, expansion of occupational awareness, improved pupil performance in basic subjects, and the development of a Career Resource Information Bank. Student achievement was measured by usual normative and pre-post comparisons and criterion evaluation. Career awareness pre- and posttests were administered to six experimental groups while students in the control groups were posttested relating  to their occupational awareness and interest. Standardized test instruments were found to be inappropriate to measure the side-effect results of a program not designed to directly influence academic achievement. Third-party evaluation indicated a very successful project. Future plans of the career awareness program include a three-year expansion to cover the entire district. More than half of the document is devoted to appendixes consisting of career and guidance units, curriculum materials lists by grade, an interim evaluation report, evaluation tests (career awareness and self-appraisal), and parent reactions.

Data from the first part of the study indicated that younger and more well-educated subjects displayed more positive attitudes toward the elderly. Data from the second part of the study showed little relationship between the variables race and socioeconomic status and attitudes toward the aged. The third part of the study tested for relationships between personality characteristics and attitudes toward old people. It was hypothesized that persons high in the trait of nurturance would have more positive attitudes toward the elderly. Data  collected using the Edwards Personal Preference Scale showed positive attitudes correlated with high scores for the traits of intraception, nurturance, and endurance. However, demographic factors seem to be more important determinants of attitudes toward old people than are the personality items.

A basic concern of the study is what level of governmental policy, if any, is needed in this area. Part 1 is a discussion of the conceptual impact of technological change on the labor market. The four chapters of Part 1 are directed to the effect of technological change on employment as related to production function, input prices, demand shifts, and skill sector requirements; worker adjustment to technological change through private/public adjustment mechanisms; other relationships between workers and technological change; and adjustment mechanisms and social well-being. Part 2, a review of current literature from 1965 through 1973, is  anticipated to be representative of total work in the area. Chapter 1 of Part 2 summarizes findings on worker displacement, analyzes policy recommendations in the literature, and indicates needed research. Chapter 2 focuses on which types of workers are affected by technological change (skill, age, sex, ethnic groups, occupation, and industry). Chapter 3 reviews the private/public adjustment mechanisms and which workers benefit most and least from these adjustment mechanisms. An extensive bibliography accompanies Part 2. (EA)",

Blair and \"Forecasting the Impact of Technological Change on Manpower Utilization and Displacement: An Analytic Summary\" by Alan Fechter). The author concludes that, despite concern generated by the unemployment issue at the beginning of the 1960's, little was done through public policy to aid worker adjustment to technological change. Displacement, rather than neglect, was viewed as the economic and social malady; whether the displacement had technological or other roots was incidental.  However, considerable progress was made on behalf of displaced and unplaced individuals during the Manpower Decade, 1960-70. Reviews of post-1965 literature on worker adjustment to technological change by Blair and Fechter further support the fact that technological change is just one of the factors determining future manpower requirements. Fechter feels that, given the general mobility and adaptability of the United States labor force, improvement of forecast methodology is not a high priority need. Nine recommendations related to the issue conclude the report. (EA)",

The procedures in compiling information about cooperative activities which affect career education programs are described. The study focuses primarily on one aspect of the implementation of career education: the modification of existing structure to bring about program implementation. Practices are suggested to illustrate  cooperative activities in school settings with career education programs. The practices included are curriculum legalization, communications, community resources, instructor's handbook, career guidance centers, careers fair, mini-societies, store-front classrooms, and construction technology.

        "description":"The development of continuing education for ministry shows a need for more growth and change in seminary training to meet the fundamental needs of the clergy and the laity. Recent changes since 1960 have resulted in three developments: (1) the need for continuing education for ministry has been recognized; (2) the increasing number in the variety and distribution of continuing education resources that present predominantly a standard theological curriculum of biblical, historical, doctrinal, and pastoral concerns; and (3) the interaction between learning and practice has been recognized and the responsibility of the clergy-learner in the parish context has been identified as an essential ingredient in individual plans for continuing education. A problem exists in the lack of  participation in continuing education programs among the clergy who need this form of organized programs of study. This problem comes as a result of the lack of resources for funding experiments and improvements in continuing education programs for ministry. Despite budgetary problems, development in research on continuing education in ministry has increased over the years. Future trends to meet the training needs of the clergy will show an increasing role for continuing education. (Author/EC)",

Objectives were to ascertain perceptions of the degree of importance, extent of achievement, and responsibilities for accomplishing the goals. The goals are: staff educational needs, staff supply and demand, efficiency of system, geographic availability, flexibility of programs, effectiveness of system, and certification of personnel. These goals were incorporated into a four-part questionnaire: (1) to identify respondents by type of agency or institution and their area in vocational education, and their perception as to the (2) degree of importance, (3) extent of achievement, and (4) agency responsibilities for achieving each goal. A five-point Likert-Type  scale was incorporated into the questionnaire sent to 160 subjects with a 68.8 percent rate of return. Tables and discussions are presented based on the findings drawn from the data.

        "description":"In adult education, program planning and administrative management are important areas within which economic analysis may contribute to effective and efficient decision making. The adult education administrator is faced with a dual economic task: (1) to prove beforehand that his programs will pay for the operating budget he is demanding; and (2) to make correct decisions both administratively and in the market-place to insure an efficiently operating organization and a continuous inflow of participants and funds. Two concepts are discussed to aid the adult educator at both the program planning stage and within his administrative functions: planning, programing and budgeting systems (PPBS) and cost benefit analysis (CBA). An overview of the demand for PPBS is presented as a  rationale for its increasing acceptance, and a 10-step procedure is developed for generalized use in any educational institution. Within this 10-step procedure, CBA is introduced as one of the many possible program evaluation techniques to judge a program's worth. An example of CBA using a manpower training program is presented to allow the reader to understand the scope and limitations of the technique. A 36-item bibliography is included. (Author/EC)",

A systems approach to evaluation was utilized in this effort. The funded project involved all three grade populations--elementary, junior high school, and senior high school. Each major grade grouping had a distinct focus: (1) elementary--career awareness, (2) junior high school--career orientation and exploration, and (3) senior high school--job training and placement. Each group goal was supported by separate grade level goals. The variables for each target group--students, parents, and industry--are described in terms of the actual effect of the program to date. In assessing the overall impact  of the project, the major findings were: (1) career awareness is increasing generally for students in grades five through nine; (2) attitudes are not being affected, therefore, attitudinal concepts would be discarded; and (3) in grades 10-12, the occupational learning centers are having the desired impact on the target population.

Major efforts concerned instructional material revisions or development from the first year of the project where gaps were indicated. Five specific career education components were included in the research and development phase of the project: elementary school awareness, junior high exploration, high school training, placement, and guidance and counseling. Statewide workshops were held to disseminate information about the model. The major result of the project is that the career education model is operational in the  district and has been spread throughout the State. A detailed evaluation report (13 pages) is included in the document. A general conclusion was that the program was successful in meeting its objectives with a positive attitude by teachers and community involvement with the school system.

Data were collected on 911 juniors and seniors selected from a sample at 22 high schools in the San Antonio, Texas, metropolitan area. The general technical score was found to significantly relate to overall academic performance for 19 out of the 22 samples, with a media rank order correlation coefficient (rho) of .44. Results indicate that the level of relationship was not differentially affected by school-specific ethnic group composition, school expenditures, or average teacher/pupil ratio. Since socioeconomic levels represented in the various samples go from the highest to the lowest ranges, limited  generalizations may be meaningful to other school districts with similar diverse populations.

Two assumptions were made: (1) those with highly concrete learning styles learn best by direct contact type activities and (2) individuals with highly symbolic learning styles learn best by abstract type activities. The study population consisted of university students enrolled in an audiovisual communications class. Two methods of instruction were developed: a direct contact type using the actual equipment being studied with assistance from an instructor when desired, and an abstract method using audiotape narration only. Findings indicated that there was no  significant difference in the cognitive skills gained regardless of learning style or treatment. However, there was a significant difference in psychomotor skills gained depending on the treatment method, with the direct contact method more effective than abstract treatments. It was felt, therefore, that the theory of learning style measurement and the teaching to measured learning style is a valid theory. Student opinion favored the direct contact type of instruction to the abstract approach. The questionnaire, testing and survey instruments, audiotape narrative, and data tables are appended.

The program combines the favorable aspects of both the school store and the model store, providing &quot;live&quot; experiences as well as simulated ones. The Distributive Education One curriculum is built into the store. The major retailing functions--merchandising, management, sales promotion, and finance are the foundations on which the store and the project are developed. Students are grouped into one of the retailing functions for nine weeks, rotating at the end of the period. The report presents the rationale for the program, a general description of its design, and suggested implications of the school store.  (NJ)",

Viewed as an investment in human capital, vocational programs were evaluated in order to estimate the excess of social benefits over social costs that accrue from training an individual in any of the programs offered. Benefits were measured in terms of (1) contributions to the value of goods and services produced in the economy over the individual's working lifetime as a result of completing a vocational program and (2) costs, in terms of the value of the goods and services that had to be given up in order to provide the training. The results for the sample vocational education planning districts were then used to  obtain similar estimates for the State's remaining 103 vocational education planning districts. The computed estimates indicated that increasing the participation rate by senior high school students in vocational education programs to 40 percent of average daily membership in all of the vocational education planning districts would result in a statewide increase in net social benefits amounting to a minimum of $108,918,528 and a maximum of $326,951,424.

A model for obtaining accurate feedback as to the kinds of success graduates are having in the world of work was developed. The survey instrument used for collecting data was field tested at three different settings within the State of Indiana. A computer program was written for retrieving the data in a meaningful format. A total of 536 graduates in 29 career division programs were surveyed. The survey provided information on the number of occupational graduates that had secured employment, the number employed, number continuing their education, number who could not be located, and a salary range for those  graduates that were employed.

The center tries to help all Indians referred to it; so far it has assisted about 200 Indian men and women. The center tries, through trust, confidence, and friendship, to develop a productive interpersonal relationship with its Indian students. It attempts to create a friendly center atmosphere with T.V., stereo-tapes, ping pong and pool tables. The program is flexible enough to accommodate individual differences. Each person's abilities are identified, and individuals are encouraged to seek personal,  social, and academic growth. The help and cooperation of various agencies and individuals are sought and encouraged.

The term, &quot;State&quot;, refers structurally to a unit of the personality and functionally to a condition of that unit. This paper refers to the structural unit as an Ego Sub-System. The functional unit is referred to as an Ego State Role which is the mechanism whereby the subunits of the Ego Sub-Systems are organized into relatively stable functional units. Among the major assumptions are: more than one Sub-System may be, and typically is, active at a  time and each contributes to the quality of the transaction; developmentally and evolutionarily, the Child appears first, then the Adult; the Parent appears last and is an outgrowth and specialization of the Adult, and is specifically related to mankind's heritage of having been a social carnivore; for each major sub-unit of the Child there is a reciprocal and corresponding sub-unit in the Parent. The survival value of guilt and anxiety are briefly explored in relation to human evolutionary theory. (Author)",

The counselees were given the option of having or not having themselves videotaped during a number of simulated job interviews and trials; for the 44 who chose to be taped, their own behaviors were played back to them the day following each filming. No attempts to counsel the people were made, although many of them would, after watching themselves on tape, ask for advice about how they might go about being &quot;more cool&quot; in given situations. Following about 10 weeks of such playback experience, the majority of the counselees  were able to get and hold jobs, and a six-month followup revealed that their chances of staying on a job were significantly better than those of another group of people from the same settlement house who had not been exposed to the opportunity to see a playback of their own behavior. Sepcifically, these individuals who had been afforded the opportunity to monitor their own behaiviors by videofeedback reported nearly 80 percent success in maintaining satisfactory vocational adjustment, while just over 50 percent of those who had not received this feedback were satisfactorily employed.

The objectives of this survey were to ascertain: (1) the present activities of these adolescents; (2) the extent to which these adolescents were acting in accordance with their intentions as stated in spring 1973; (3) what factors distinguish adolescents who act in accord with their intentions or act contrary to their intentions; (4) to what extent adolescents in November 1973 duplicated their response to the question, &quot;Which one statement best describes what you plan  to do in the fall of 74?&quot; and, (5) what factors distinguished &quot;consistents&quot; and &quot;inconsistents&quot; relative to question 4.

The first study performed by the authors assessed performance of 60 noninstitutionalized middle-class elderly females on area and volume conservation tasks. On overall performance only 33.3 percent of the subjects were classified as conservers. The second study employed a training paradigm to determine whether simple verbal feedback activated the strategies required for adequate performance on conservation tasks. Twenty-two subjects who failed to conserve in the assessment study were administered a 20-trial training procedure. Half of these subjects received  no feedback. An immediate posttest indicated that the feedback group performed significantly better than the control group on the near transfer posttest task and on the five out of six far transfer tasks. The authors argue that the ease with which training effects were established and the improved performance after training support the view that the elderly maintain competence to adequately solve problems of logical thinking.

The present study aimed at demonstrating that using the Glasser discussion method, which encourages students to take responsibility and discuss various problems that they face in school, increases motivation and improves their self-concept. Six groups of 10 elementary school students each served as subjects. Two groups were led by counselors, another two by teachers while the other two served as controls. The increase in school motivation, as assessed from the pre- and post-treatment scores of the subjects on the SCAMIN inventory, was significantly higher in the counselor-led groups than in the teacher-led groups, but  the experimental groups were not significantly different from the control groups. The increase in self-concept, as assessed on the SCAMIN Inventory, was significantly higher in the teacher-led groups than it was either in the counselor-led or control groups.

The data show that young people use drugs more than adults do, and that they drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol, especially at night, more often than adults do, and consequently young people are more vulnerable to accidents due to drug use than are adults. The writer then considers possible countermeasures against drinking and driving such as limitations on drinking by young people, the amount of permissable liquor consumption, and limitations on driving such as forcing speed limits during certain periods of the day. The writer concludes that few countermeasures have demonstrated their effectiveness;  nevertheless, he argues that it is essential that more effort be placed on the development of effective countermeasure programs and that those programs in existence be more effectively evaluated.

College students, middle-aged and older adults were involved in conducting weekly visits. Although no special effort was made to recruit young volunteers for this project, it is suggested that such assignments can be made successfully. Most of 49 referrals were cited as homebound because of physical disabilities, and fewer than half lived alone. Assumptions about elderly homebound who live alone, are lonely, and who, therefore, should be sought out in a general way, are not warranted. Instead, agencies are encouraged to participate in organized surveys of their local communities in order to differentiate the various needs of older persons. The  call to assist the elderly has widened the generation gap between young and old people. To help close this gap, the authors suggest interagency, interorganizational community models that are designed to direct teenage and college youth into helping roles that include home visiting, escort service and shopping for older adults. Social workers of various specialties can help fashion such cooperative models. (Author/SE)",

This study was implemented with 270 grade 12 girls, 25 percent of whom were from lower class backgrounds. Four scales of SRI were administered: femininity, power, division of labor, and women's liberation. An additional set of four scales of aspirations was also given: educational, occupational, marital aspirations, and occupational commitment. The results indicated a high correlation between educational aspiration and power and women's liberation, while marital aspirations correlated negatively with each of the four scales of the SRI. These correlations suggest that the more conviction in the equality of the  sexes, the higher the educational aspirations of the girls. Agreement with the women's liberation items were the best predictors of occupational and educational aspirations, even after such important background variables as achievement and social class were controlled. The author concludes that the relationship correlations found in this study were very low, and that the results can not be generalized unless a more representative sample of subjects is used. (SE)",

This project explores the implications of the school-based model as it relates to the role of the school counselor. The first speaker was Jacqueline E. Haveman, who gave an overview of career education and school district responses to it. The second speaker, gordon K. McLeod, discussed \"The Infusion of Career Education Into Existing School Subject Areas.\" The third speaker, Jeanette Wheeler, discussed \"The Role of School Counselors and the Comprehensive Career Education Model, CCEM.\" These three speakers  were from the American Institute for Research. To conclude the symposium, Garry Walz, the director of the ERIC Clearinghouse for Counseling and Personnel Services, addressed the participants about career education. (SE)",

        "description":"This speech discusses the negative effects of privacy on youth. The great technological developments, bureaucratization, and concentration of life in urban and suburban areas have greatly increased personal privacy and reduced close personal contacts. This paper discusses several studies which suggest that the above factors lead young people to have ambivalent attitudes toward privacy: on the one hand they value privacy highly, while on the other hand they desire close personal ties. Moreover, data show that privacy leads to antisocial acts as well as self-destructive acts. The punishment of antisocial acts by governmental agencies is counter-productive; certain basic changes in the American socialization process should be introduced to deal with the problem positively. Parents  and other concerned adults should be given improved incentives to personally observe, and accept responsibility for, the conduct of children. Children and youths should be encouraged to spend more time within the personal observation of other youths or responsible adults and establish on-going relationships with them. Finally, the philosophical implications of our current high evaluation of personal privacy should be reconsidered. The author has tried to answer possible objections to his propositions. (SE)",

The author's research on person perception focuses on the use of sound motion pictures of interviews as the primary stimulus and vehicle for the research. Subjects used for these studies were usually college students from psychology classes. There are three major sections or topics for this research: (1) assessing the validity of verbal and non-verbal cues in accurately judging others; (2) effects of money, anticipation and competition upon judging scores and self-reports of motivational arousal; and (3) social stereotyping and its relationship to accuracy in person perception. Results indicate that accurately perceiving  and judging another is a complex task affected by many variables, and the difficulty in decoding them depends on the transparency or opaqueness of the person being judged. In addition, according to the authors, people can be trained to be better judges of others. (GMF)",

        "description":"This article summarizes and discusses some of the studies which relate parental attributes to children's achievement orientations, that is, both achievement motivation and achievement behavior. The warmth-hostility dimension is one of two main parental dimensions which have continually arisen in factor analyses of child rearing patterns. The other major dimension, that of permissiveness-restrictiveness, is considered in this paper only in relation to the warmth-hostility dimension. The paper includes a review of the major theories of achievement motivation and behavior, a description of the two main parental dimensions, and summaries of achievement studies related to the Warmth-Hostility dimension. The paper concludes with a discussion of the methodological limitations of these  studies: the use of self-reports, lack of distinction between intellectual and academic achievement, not enough investigation of other kinds of achievement, and relatively little available data on the father-child relationship. The author makes recommendations concerning these and other methodological problems in this area of research. (Author/SJL)",

Not only do parents influence the development of their offspring, they, in turn, are influenced by them. The infant is an active agent, affected by and affecting those around him. The infant emerges as a primary source of influence--often in the direction of the malevolent distortion of the caregiver's attention. This study further suggests that the family has the properties of a dynamic social unit wherein reciprocal interaction effects appear to be intrinsically related to sources of control or command over others. For example, fathers of children in psychotherapy were consistently and significantly more controlling than the normative group. Fathers of hyperkinetic children tended to  have extreme scores, high or low, on a measure of hierarchical control. More systematic exploration of family life along the dimensions of power, influence, and susceptibility to influence is needed to increase the understanding of why and how specific individuals within a family succumb to pathology.

A girl needs an Affirmative Action Childhood to counteract the intensive, pervasive, and crippling socialization process which negatively and powerfully affects her aspirations, and, therefore, her future as an adult. Included in an Affirmative Action Childhood should be the need to help boys give up their contemptuous, superior attitudes toward females which is allowed and reinforced in childhood, and which pervasively affects all their later adult relationships with women whether on a professional or a personal level. Approval of equal pay for equal work, and equal employment and educational opportunity are, of course, necessary. But the nuances of sexism which  train girls not even to aspire to equal employment and equal educational opportunity must also be dealt with if the vicious circle is ever to break. (Author)",

Schematic concept formation consists of abstracting the common elements or properties of a defined class in a schema. Thereafter, both discrimination and retention are facilitated, since only deviations from the schema need be processed for any particular class exemplar. In the present study, 240 children ranging from 6 to 12 years of age were trained in an oddity task, either with or without knowledge of results to distinguish 67 percent redundant patterns representing different schemata. Schematic concept formation was found to occur prior to age 6 and increase in efficiency to ages 11 or 12. This ability did not depend on knowledge of results and was not related to traditional measures of intelligence. The  schematic concept formation task appears to be a promising nonverbal and perhaps culture-independent measure of learning potential or ability. (Author)",

This research involved two components: (1) the development of simple, efficient, computer-oriented methods for generating rigorously precise stimulus material (these required human attention experiments); and (2) the execution of two experiments which employed computer-generated stimuli. The first experiment examined the filtering characteristics of attention mechamisms when subjects were required to select from either acoustically or semantically similar competing messages. Results show that semantic similarity is disruptive only at a  slow presentation rate, while the effects of acoustic similarity do not depend on presentation rate. In the second experiment, subjects performed a tone detection task in one ear, while simultaneously monitoring a digit sequence presented in the opposite ear. Digits were recalled following presentation. Tone detection performance decreased as the number of digits to be recalled increased. Both findings are interpreted as supporting early-selection attention models. (Author)",

The first area involves the structural analysis of isolable subsystems involved in visual and auditory pattern recognition. The second area involves the study of the encoding and retrieval of emotional or evaluative information. The study of complex patterns of active and passive production of voluntary movements constitutes the third field of investigation. The fourth area cuts across work in the other three and deals with distinctions between automatic processing and processing which is under active attentional control. Experiments in these areas are designed to examine the relationship between mental structures in general and the brain systems  which subserve the functions of consciousness. The final part of the report deals briefly with efforts to make these findings on mental structure available in the form of course materials. (Author)",

A questionnaire (Direction-Unconscious Motivation Scale) designed to assess attitudes toward psychoanalytic, behavioral therapy and client-centered counseling approaches was given to 683 volunteers who were students at two New York State Colleges. Results showed that students reported a greater preference for a psychoanalytic than a behavioral therapy approach. However, few participants were highly positive about any of the three counseling approaches in their entirety. Responses to many of the questionnaire items were related to sex and year, and indicated that most participants held preferences for seemingly contradictory or potentially conflicting  counseling goals or techniques. The authors suggest that counseling centers include counselors who differ in treatment model and outlook, are sensitive to conflicting counseling needs, and can adapt their techniques to the unique patterns of preferences of different clients.

Basically, the research was geared to determining whether the open, community-oriented institution was more effective with children and responsive to change initiatives than its counterpart, the closed (non-community-oriented) institution. Three distinct external strategies for inducing institutional change were developed and introduced in a controlled fashion over a year's time with groups of institutions. An examination of the results of these strategies enabled an assessment of the degree of  responsiveness of differently structured institutions to different types of external change initiatives. These efforts yielded considerable information of a technical nature on measuring institutional effectiveness, and of a substantive nature regarding the quality of care provided by institutions for dependent and neglected children.

Three other objectives for the Teen Age Medical Service were examined in relation to program content and quality of services. These program objectives were: (1) to develop methods of involving and employing youth in the actual delivery of health services to their peers; (2) to assist other concerned individuals and groups interested in initiating similar youth services in other metropolitan locations; and (3) to develop effective methods of integrating the findings and experience of the center into public policy.

Students should be helped to prepare resumes and the placement director should prepare introductory letters and other referrals, and arrange these in a file. He should also prepare students for job interviews by rehearsals and encouragements. A brief form should later be sent to students, asking for feedback. The second major task of a placement director is to have detailed information about the various kinds of job openings in and around the city where the college is located. This can be obtained from newspapers and  through establishing personal contracts with major companies who might need employees. The director should try various means to get in touch with company officials, and inform them about the college and its programs and how the graduates can be helpful to them in their employment settings.

The severely disabled and the severely handicapped populations should be the first priority of vocational rehabilitation programs. The challenge is to find means to pursue the objective in ways that work. This publication attempts to describe an intense program of vocational rehabilitation services in which time, money, and effort are spent in ascertaining what reasonably can be expected to improve the severely  disabled and severely handicapped's ability to live independently and function within a vocational setting. It is intended to provide a practical training guide that will be helpful in the development of programs and for the provision of services to the severely disabled. (Author)",

Va. Research and Training Center has been developing techniques for evaluating rehabilitation programs. This publication contains three papers, the first of which details the basic rationale for a technique developed in the Research and Training Center that is designed to simplify the ultimate development of standards for self-evaluation of VR programs. This technique, called Profile Analysis Technique, takes currently existing data and formats it in such a way as to increase its intelligibility. The second paper, dealing  with Marco and Micro Aspects of Program Evaluation in rehabilitation, takes the theoretical approach developed in the previous paper and shows its application to a number of real-life situations. The third paper, dealing with Measurement of Client Outcomes, continues with a demonstration of how routinely available data can generate fine-grain analysis of program functioning. (Author)",

The focus is on high school graduates and addresses the wide disparity between demonstrated aspiration to attend some form of postsecondary education, and actual enrollment or continuation after high school. The study analyzes the development of educational aspiration and the causes of noncontinuation. Use of factor analysis and regression analysis showed the development of aspiration to be contingent on three main variables--the academic program in which the student is enrolled in high school, the formulation of occupational goals, and the existence of a utilitarian value for postsecondary education which  translates the desire for occupational training and success into the need for further education. Several barriers acting to inhibit or impede enrollment are also examined. The study includes a section of case history narratives designed to complement the traditional statistical interpretation of the data, and provide a contextual framework from which to view the problems in Vermont.

To find out which role is actually adopted by counselors, the author sent questionnaires to 108 counselors in rural, urban, and suburban areas, and held extensive interviews with a subsample of 12 counselors. Items adjudged clinical received the three highest rankings, while the two most environmentally oriented items were ranked next to the bottom of the scale. The interview results indicated that the group considered the clinical role more appropriate than the environmental one.  Counselors enjoy and feel more confident in the role of the clinician; moreover, counselors' perceptions of the expectations of others in the school, with the exception of students, also appear distinctly clinical. The author concludes that counselors are operating within a model that protects the status quo, fails to address change, and depends for its continuance on advocacy of the currently existing school system.

The first stage involves the request for consultation during which the consultant acquires important information regarding the nature of a client's problems, environments and abilities. The second stage identifies the problem behavior, and observes or assesses client behavior. Factors which are maintaining the client's undesirable behavior are identified to determine whether the  client requires referral. If not, consultant and consultee agree on the desired behavioral changes to be initiated. If the consultant judges that the consultee is capable of helping the client change his behavior, then he trains the consultee to implement specific recommendations to initiate positive change in the client.

This document is organized into three sections: (1) a definition of human fact retrieval and its implications for experimental investigations of memory, (2) theoretical constructs that have been used to formulate models of fact retrieval, and (3) the possible roles of temporal information and cues in experimental procedures for investigating human fact retrieval. The document considers the strengths and weaknesses of the current  theoretical approach to memory that emphasizes the micro-processes and micro-structures. This approach is somewhat unique in its use of quantitative differences, as opposed to qualitative orderings, to resolve theoretical issues. The authors stress the influence of contextual cues on the fact retrieval process as well as problems related to complexity of research design, and conclude that it is not yet possible to design a single successful model of human fact retrieval.

        "description":"This paper reports the outcomes of a correlational study that examined the relationships between visual and auditory perceptual skills, on the one hand, and comprehension that is independent of decoding, on the other. Five sets of test scores--a visual perceptual test (Coloured Progressive Matrices), an auditory perceptual test (Auditory Motor Placement), a listening and reading comprehension test (Durrell Listening-Reading Series), and a single word decoding test (Word Recognition subtest; Diagnostic Reading Scales)--were compared. The resulting correlation coefficients showed a highly significant relationship between visual perceptual skills and listening comprehension, and visual perceptual skills and reading comprehension when the effect of decoding skills was controlled.  Auditory perceptual skills were more closely related to reading comprehension than to listening comprehension. It is suggested that although decoding skills explain much of the variance in reading comprehension, visual perceptual skills also contribute to the explanation of this variance. (Author)",

A series of four experiments is then described which involve the cognitive-perceptual basis of R-I of children on a picture recognition memory task. Results from these studies indicated the following important, but tentative, conclusions about the process of picture recognition memory and the underlying perceptual basis of the R-I dimension in children: reflective and impulsive children differ in their propensity to engage in a detailed visual feature analysis of stimulus arrays; the process of visual feature analysis is perhaps the most important component in the underlying basis of R-I; strong inferential evidence was provided that picture  recognition memory is primarily a process of visual feature analysis in which the role of verbal labels is minimal and indirect; recognition memory performance is susceptible to differential instructions which emphasize care versus quickness; recognition memory for pictures appears to increase over the elementary school years; and the Selfridge-Neisser model and the recognition paradigm are useful for future research. It was suggested that future research should be performed in this area. (Author/RB)",

Correlations are reported between 23 textual variables and the criterion. Two readability formulas based on these variables are discussed: one based on a regression analysis that included publisher and linguistic variables (Formula P) and one that included only the linguistic variables (Formula L). Formula P uses words per page and impersonal pronouns plus third person personal pronouns per sentence in the regression equation  and correlates .819 with the judges' summed rankings on 50 books. Formula L uses words over seven letters long per sentence and impersonal pronouns plus third person personal pronouns per sentence in the regression equation and correlates .718 with reading difficulty as determined by judges' rankings on 50 books. The books used are listed by title and author, and the judges summed rankings and the regression formulae rankings are given. Grade level scores were not considered appropriate to be assigned.

A random sample of 72 first graders, stratified by sex and social class, was given the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test and the Farnham-Diggory tasks. An analysis of variance showed no significant differences between sexes and social classes on the Farnham-Diggory tasks. Low, although significant, correlations were found between symbol synthesis scores and scores on the reading achievement test. These results were in contrast to Denner's findings of a deficit in a group of first grade problem readers who had been selected and classified by their teachers rather than randomly chosen. The results failed to  support strongly the hypothesis of an important relationship between representational and syntactic competence, as measured by the Farnham-Diggory tasks, and achievement in beginning reading.

The &quot;Developmental Study on the Difficulty Factors in Reading Kanji&quot; concluded that the complexity of characters had no effect on the reading of Kanji, the frequency of Kanji was one of the significant factors which affected reading, and the familiarity of words in which Kanji characters were used was the most predominant factor in reading. The purpose of the third article, &quot;A Yardstick for Readability,&quot; was to  develop an objective method to assess the readability of Japanese sentences. &quot;A Developmental Study of Reading Rate&quot; determined that the speed of reading, given appropriate materials, was not the same for grades 2-9 and that there was a consistent increase in the rates of reading from grades 3-5.

In massed practice (MP) the item occupies adjacent positions; in distributed practice (DP) successive occurences are separated by at least one other unit. The spacing effect, or the MP-DP effect, refers to better recall following DP schedules than following MP schedules. Four studies discussed in this report examined the spacing effect in four quite different situations: recognition of letters, verbal discrimination, short free recall lists, and recall of MP items presented twice with an intervening interval inserted to produce forgetting. MP-DP differences were found in all studies. Of  particular interest were three interactions; subjects with a low criterion of responding in the letter study lost the MP-DP effect over a 30-second delay, and subjects with a high criterion did not; a clear MP-DP effect, but no lag effect, was found only with unmixed verbal discrimination lists; and in free recall a sharp lag effect was shown for words presented three times but not for words presented twice.

The theory states that culturally associated words in a pair and nonassociated words in a pair differ after a single study trial in terms of their frequency representation in memory. Two experiments were required to show that the use of mixed lists of associated and nonassociated pairs was not the appropriate way to study the effect of associative context on recognition memory. The third experiment provided no support for the theory. Recognition of associated and nonassociated pairs did not differ appreciably. The loss in recognition performance for single words taken from study pairs was the same for associated and for  nonassociated pairs. Frequency judgments paralleled the results for recognition decisions in most aspects of the data. It was concluded that associative context, specified in terms of the strength of the association between two words in a pair, is not a critical factor in recognition performance. (Author)",

The two experiments described in the present study take the theoretical position that the syllable was represented in memory as a visual-phonetic-articulatory frequency unit. In the first experiment, two independent words were presented for study with varying lags, the test being for the two words having meaning as a pair. In the other, elements of compound words were presented separately with the test being on the  compound word. The subjects had to decide whether the two words had or had not been presented together on the study trial.

During the final year of the project it was shown that more than half of the children in each grade gained more than they had the preceding year. Some of the other findings were that teachers participated in inservice programs extensively, developed and modified units of instruction, and utilized a variety of major curriculum systems.  Attendance rose in the entire school during the three years. Research skills showed only minimal gains on a standardized test.

The concept of literacy is defined in terms of levels of literacy and basic skills required to achieve the different levels. A review of the literature on literacy is the basis for three suggested levels of literacy: (1) pre-literacy, composed of skills which are still unstable and transient and which allow a person to complete the tasks demanded by society in its elementary schools; (2) basic literacy, composed of stable skills measurable at a grade level of approximately 5.5; and (3) career literacy, composed of occupationally specific skills and functional and survival skills and measurable at a grade level of approximately 7.5. Since work is one of the  primary functions of being an independent contributing member of society, career literacy is considered necessary for a person to become minimally literate. The basic skills are those language and computational processes essential for literacy and upon which further learning depends. It is recommended that a statewide criterion assessment device be constructed to identify the essential tasks which need to be accomplished in each skill area. (MKM)",

        "description":"This report summarizes information regarding populations, methods, evaluation and instructional materials, analyses, and results from three doctoral dissertations that used the Word Attack component of the Wisconsin Design for Reading Skill Development as an instructional and assessment instrument. The first study investigated the assumption that mastery of essential word attack subskills results in functional word attack ability. The second study investigated the degree to which first-grade subjects retained reading ability over summer vacation. Reading ability was measured by both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced tests. The third study investigated the effects on selected teachers of three motivational treatments: (1) pupil reading achievement monitored without feedback  to teachers, (2) social incentives given to teachers, and (3) monetary incentives given to teachers. Measures of effect were gain scores on the Wisconsin Tests of Reading Skill Development: Word Attack and staff teachers' perceptions of selected interpersonal variables. (Author/RB)",

The subjects for this study were 120 fifth- and sixth-grade children attending two elementary schools located in middle-class areas of Ogden, Utah. According to the frequency theory, successful performance on a visual discrimination task is attributed to subjective frequency discriminations learned prior to or during the task. It was hypothesized in this study that when a rehearsal strategy is added to the verbal discrimination task, attributes other than frequency may be called into play. The results of the present experiment now make it clear that when a rehearsal strategy (of the kind employed  here) is applied to a verbal discrimination list, the task appears no longer to involve frequency discriminations, as it does when a rehearsal strategy is not applied.

        "description":"Tests for prereading skills of Israeli kindergarten children were developed and tested on a wide range of socioeconomic levels. Based on studies in the United States and Israel, tests were developed for letter matching, rhyming, sound matching, and letter recognition. Results from 178 kindergarten children led to a division of the letter matching test into two separate tests, one for testing attention to letter order and one for testing attention to word detail. A second set of tests was then developed, based on the most reliable items from the first set of tests. These tests included rhyming, sound matching, letter order, and word detail. Data on the tests from 94 subjects in four lower-middle socioeconomic status (SES) kindergartens showed reliable results; however, a few low  reliability items were scheduled for replacement in the next test revision. Finally, a test was developed for assessing knowledge of propositions at the kindergarten level and was administered with children from four levels. Differences in test scores were found between the three highest groups and the lowest group, but problems were also revealed in the test itself. (Author/RB)",

The program is a kindergarten-level instructional program designed to prepare children for beginning reading instruction. Four teachers in three Wisconsin schools participated in the field test of teacher training techniques. Fourteen teachers in schools where the Prereading Skills Program had been used during the 1971-72 school year provided evaluative information on program materials and activities. The teacher training evaluated in the field test took the form of workshops. Information relating to the effectiveness of the teacher training workshops was gathered by means of questionnaires, observations, and interviews. Analysis of the data indicated that teachers would  be able to implement the Prereading Skills Program after less extensive workshops or perhaps without any workshops at all, provided that supplementary information on the use of specific components was included in the teacher materials. After further revision, the Prereading Skills Program will be used again by teachers who used the 1971-72 and 1972-73 field test editions. (Author/RB)",

The major aim of this study was to test the effect of this specially devised program on reading competence. Another aim was to test the effect of the program on reading attitude and spelling competence. Fifth grade children in two regular primary schools formed the sample. In one of the schools, average to above average readers were studied, while in the other school, average to below average readers were studied. It is concluded that (1) reading competence is influenced by primary language competence; (2) a remedial program in primary school reading is more effective if it includes language activities based on the auditory vocal aspects of primary  language; (3) additional reading will not help children in the regular primary school who read below their chronological age; (4) the experimental group which made significant gains did so in the comparatively short time of seven weeks; and (5) spelling ability and reading attitude were not significantly changed by the oral language program during the seven weeks the program was in operation.

A group of 50 pupils whose parents were not trained in the tutoring sessions were used as the control group. Relevant data gathered during the study tends to support the two major hypotheses that, given the training program for parents, the students in the experimental group would show a  significant increase in achievement over the students in the control group and the parents in the experimental group would evidence a more positive attitude toward the school.

If children spell creatively for a period of time before being expected to read, they gain active experience in the principles of alphabetic representation. Written language from the start is  systematic and accessible to children, and they can take an active role in dealing with it.

A sampling design was adapted for constructing an artificial year by taking the Monday of the first week of January, Tuesday of the second week of February, Wednesday of the third week of March, and so on through Saturday of the fourth week of December. The findings show that the four sample newspapers, irrespective of ownership, devote more area to governmental and political news than  to developmental news, i.e., news that deals with economic, social, and technological progress in developing nations.

        "description":"This set of papers represents the written record of the 1973 national conference for advertising educators held at Arizona State University in March. The conference focus was on current developments in the practice and teaching of advertising. The purpose of the conference was to bring insights about current advertising developments to the attention of advertising educators. The papers are divided into those presented by educators and those by noneducators. The educators' papers are subdivided into two categories, research papers and papers related to the teaching of advertising. The research papers deal with consumer behavior as it has impact on and input to advertising. The papers on teaching advertising describe recent developments in pedagogical approaches and methodology.  The noneducators' papers include perspectives on advertising regulation, views of trends in advertiser management and agency service, a review of media procedures, analyses of the employment and placement situation, and an overview of advertising's next generation.

Instead, Sophocles was primarily interested in the insufficiency of human knowledge. The gods and their role in destiny, the character and personality of Oedipus, Oedipus' tragic flaw, and the role of guilt in the play are discussed. It is concluded that, in this play, human reason was an exercise in futility, that the universe is ordered and things will be and happen as they will, and that human beings can observe and even help, but not really change anything within that order.

The requirements, specifications, and procedures of these must all be made explicit for each system. Although the eleven system characteristics enumerated are easily differentiated for explanatory purposes, it is important to note that they are interdependent and that the specifications for one are considerably dependent upon the specifications for another. The same is true of the systems themselves; there, too, interdependency between and among the systems requires careful analytic attention and subsequent procedural attention. (Author/RB)",

Nine boys and nine girls were selected from each of the three grades, and close to 1000 words of writing were obtained from each student. The writing was done in class without alteration by anyone other than the writer, and the subject matter was not controlled by the investigators. In addition to sentence length, clause length, subordination ratio, and the kinds  of clauses, the study analyzes structures within a clause: coordinated structures, nominals, the verb auxiliary, main verbs and complements, modifiers of verbs, and predicate adjectives. The results of this study are discussed at length, and tables provide additional information about the procedures used and data obtained. This report was written for two groups: the teacher or supervisor of English and the researcher in language development. (RB)",

The data on mechanical correctness obtained from an examination of these papers during the 1974 survey are compared with the data obtained from the 1970 assessment. Richard Lloyd-Jones of the University of Iowa (Iowa City) and Ross Winterowd of the University of Southern California (Los Angeles) offered the following observations about the writing assessment results: there is no evidence that the schools must &quot;go back to basics&quot; because  the basics seem well in hand; language is always changing, but new ways of writing may not be worse in any defensible sense; writing is inextricably tied to reading; &quot;Edited Standard English&quot; as taught in most schools is one dialect of English; there are fewer rewards for being a good writer; and increasing class size results in fewer writing assignments.

In this booklet, literature is defined as language used imaginatively to communicate ideas and feelings, express perceptions, provide interpretations, and present visions of human experience. Literature exists in all cultures at all times and appears in oral, written, and enacted forms. The advisory committee intended that the three major objectives be seen as a sequence of increasingly complex activities. The first objective emphasizes immediate experience with  literature--the witness must be aware of imaginative language. The second objective emphasizes the ways in which the observer can participate in an experience with literature, and the third objective emphasizes literature as a cultural phenomenon.

Although directed specifically to editors, these guidelines for eliminating sexist language can be useful to all educators who help shape the language patterns and language usage of students and thus can help promote language that opens rather than closes possibilities to women and men. The following general problems in using nonsexist language are discussed, examples are given, and alternatives are suggested: (1) the omission of women as in &quot;the common man&quot; and &quot;businessman&quot; and in the use of the  masculine pronoun for the generic singular and indefinite pronoun; (2) the demeaning of women by not treating men and women in a parallel manner and using patronizing or trivializing terms; and (3) sex-role stereotyping such as appears in the sentence &quot;Have your mother send cookies for the field trip.&quot; Specific problems of female representation in books or collections of articles discussing professional issues, booklists, teaching units, research, reference books, and journal articles are discussed.

Popular speech communication texts directly incorporate activities found in values clarification literature or encourage students to discover, develop, and act on their own values. Some of the humanistic goals, teaching methods, student learning activities, and evaluation procedures of both values clarification and interpersonal communication are examined. The major focus of this paper, then, is on a framework from which speech communication educators might consider the work of a related discipline, the impact of which is already noticeable in textbooks  and teaching. It is concluded that in the speech communication classroom, values clarification activities can be used as motivational techniques and as methods for teaching interpersonal communication skills.

        "description":"Historically, the study of health communication has been confined primarily to the field of medicine. Recently, however, it has increased in importance in other areas of human communication. Exploring a new approach to health communication is the purpose of this paper. Specifically, the thrust of this investigation is the use of dialogue as a mode of health communication in a correctional facility. In this regard, three general areas were examined: the components of the concept of dialogue, the nature of monologue as viewed by the advocates of dialogue, and some aspects concerning dialogue as a means of health communication in a correctional situation. The study is inconclusive, but there are indications that dialogue as a means of communication had favorable impact on the  participants in this project. (Author/RB)",

With more than 70 percent of the respondents indicating utilization of communication games, the  recent trend of including games in fundamentals, interpersonal communication, and small group textbooks, and the advent of a dozen or so books within the past year which include as their major emphasis \"communication probes\" or \"communication vibrations\" appear warranted.

It further attempted to disclose the skills needed to increase employability. Seventy-one questionnaires, designed to focus upon some aspect of the total employment qualifications of the speech communication major, were completed and returned by fourteen different types of companies, national or international in size and extensiveness of operation. The results revealed that very few majors were hired from areas other than Business Administration and Engineering. Employers hire predominantly from areas where students are immediately qualified for a specific  job. At least two observations can be made from these data: (1) speech majors will improve their employability by having courses which make them more qualified to perform a definite job; and (2) the type of job and the type of business concern should be decided upon early in each student's academic development. Speech communication majors were perceived as having high employment potential in departments or skill areas most dependent upon communication skills. (LL)",

After examining the visual bias of media analysts, critics, and historians--a bias which tends to filter out serious exploration of music's role in film and television--the body of the paper is given over to a consideration of film and television music's five basic functions. These functions include: masking noise to neutralize disagreeable sounds emanating from sources within and outside of the viewing environment; neutralizing silence to fill the disturbing aural voids which result when there is an absence of other audial stimuli; providing continuity to impart an undergirding, cohesive bond for film's  and television's sequencing of separate images; providing dramatic support to amplify and reinforce the film or television program's audience effect; and using music as a special feature to attract patronage and increase income. The study concludes with a discussion of the need for further research that will generate increased understanding and appreciation of music's integral role in film's and television's communicative process.

Research on gender differences is that which attempts to describe categorical differences between males and females, based on a designated potential for sexual reproduction. The methodological problems raised by this assumption include the presumptions that masculinity and femininity are extreme opposites and that all persons in each group are more like the persons in their own gender identification group than they are like any one person in the other gender identification group. Anne Constantinople (1973) suggests that there is no rationale for believing that biological function is meaningful for understanding self-conception. This paper concludes by suggesting that the a priori  assumption of two and only two genders has little to contribute beyond refinement of cultural prejudice and that the possibilities for use of such research by social planners is particularly treacherous.

        "description":"One of the main inadequacies in educational management is that planning is not firmly integrated within administration. Five basic processes may be distinguished in administration. The first is planning, or determining what shall be done. The second element of the administrative process is organizing, or defining the administrative structures and activities necessary to carry out the plan. The third is assembling the resources needed to execute the plan. The fourth process is supervising, the day-to-day guidance of operations. The fifth element is controlling, or seeing that operating results conform to the plan. There are different types of plans, including goals, single-use plans, standing plans, and policies. A clear recognition of goals is necessary if planning is to mean  anything. Single-use plans design a course of action to fit a specific situation. A standing plan covers a continual action that can be used again and again. A policy is a general plan of action that guides the operation of an enterprise. The budget is an important instrument for coordinating purposeful and effective planning. Modernization of educational administration requires that adequate arrangements be made for the formulation, decision, and implementation of these different types of plans at appropriate levels within the educational system.

        "description":"If education is a form of investment, how much does it contribute to economic growth compared with other forms of investment? The first approach to answering this question was the correlation approach. But although simple correlation studies show a relationship between education and economic progress, they do not prove cause and effect. The residual approach tried unsuccessfully to show how much increase in national income was due to education. A third approach viewed education as an investment in human capital and tried to measure the economic rate of return on this investment. Recently research has shifted toward the search for strategies of educational planning and resource allocation. One such strategy is the social demand approach, which regards educational planning as the  process of forecasting the demand for education. Another strategy is manpower forecasting, which tries to mold the educational system to meet the particular manpower needs of the economy. A third strategy uses cost-benefit analysis to decide how best to allocate resources among different types and levels of education. (Author/JG)",

        "description":"Educational planning cannot succeed without attention to social factors. Basically, all authors agree that sociology of education deals with three categories of problems. First, it involves study of relations between educational systems and the rest of society, including the economy. The second category of problems is related to the educational system or school as a social system or organization in itself. Third, sociology of education deals with the social aspects of the learning process. Clearly, sociology of education is related in numerous ways to the various problems that educational planners have to face. To learn to look for social factors and social forces and their mutual interdependence and to view education as an integral part of a social whole is probably the most  important component of sociological sensibility and of the sociological approach to educational planning.

The address was given by Dr. Thorkil Kristensen, Secretary General of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and a former professor of economics. In his address, Dr. Kristensen examines the process of economic development and discusses various steps developing nations can take to speed their development. He suggests that developing nations must attract both physical capital and knowledge to increase the productivity of their land and labor force. Knowledge is more desirable than physical capital, he argues, because it multiplies faster and because  a knowledgeable labor force tends to attract physical capital. Therefore, developing nations should strive to import as much knowledge as possible from more developed countries and should take steps to prevent a \"brain drain\" caused by migration of their own knowledgeable people to richer, more developed countries.

Second, educational development will face increasing financial constraints in many countries. Third, educational systems will have to respond to serious shortages of specialized manpower. Fourth and fifth, the role of education must be defined in relation to the need for agricultural and rural development, on the one hand, and the need for industrial development and government services, on the other. Sixth, opportunities for out-of-school education must be developed and coordinated with the formal educational system. Seventh, teacher supply and demand must be reconciled to meet changing economic and educational  needs. Eighth, educational productivity and quality will have to be increased to get maximum results from limited educational resources. Ninth, educational systems must become better equipped for innovation and self-renewal. Tenth, there must be a better understanding of the social impact of education on society. To cope with these challenges, educational planning must make use of improved administrative planning and management analysis, better research and training, and increased help from all the social sciences.

One major objective of Soviet educational planners is to greatly expand the percentage of students receiving a complete secondary education. This will require considerable expansion and restructuring of the secondary school system, with special attention to the role of technicums, or specialized secondary schools. A second major planning problem is the need to consolidate the large number of small rural schools into larger schools that are both more effective educationally and more efficient economically. Following the discussion of these planning objectives is a question-and-answer section, in which the author responds to specific  questions about his discussion and about the process of educational planning in the U.S.S.R.

It is noted that not every case of delinquency (based on criminal law violations) need be referred to juvenile court. It is possible that an administrative unit of a school could make appropriate disposition of school-related delinquent acts, provided that the requirements of due process and fundamental fairness are met. If a student is referred outside the school system, it is reasonable to expect that he would be first referred  to the juvenile court. If a juvenile is referred to the court, the school must be willing to accept the jurisdiction of the court as controlling. (Author/IRT)",

It differs somewhat from other needs assessment packages in that it attempts to provide a needs assessment concerning the overall purposes or goals of the school. In essence, the game asks people to choose a mix of variables from a range of competing alternatives. The way respondents choose indicates the trade-off values of individual items. This handbook provides a copy of the game, a section on administration and use of the game, and a section on the game's background. The game is to be administered to students, parents, board of education members, and laymen. (Author/IRT)",

All seventh-grade students at the study school and some of their parents were selected as the target group. A support team composed of noninstructional school personnel and community representatives was formed to plan and coordinate anti-apathy efforts at the school. The support team was particularly concerned with reducing such manifestations of apathy as absenteeism, tardiness, class cutting, vandalism, and failing grades, as well as with increasing student participation in extracurricular activities and parent interest and involvement in school affairs. Data on the various indicators of apathy among seventh-grade students were  gathered before and after the practicum project. Comparison of prepracticum and postpracticum data indicated improvement on all of the student-related objectives, but no improvement in parent involvement. (Author/JG)",

Throughout the history of testing in this country, the courts have often intervened to assure that students, while they are in school, are free from discrimination, either in word or act, by school officials. Upon a prima facie showing of discriminatory impact, those doing the testing must demonstrate the rationality of the testing procedures and the validity of the tests. In a case presenting the clearest summary of the requirements of proper validation, the court set up four hurdles that the defendant must clear. First, the test must have differential validity, that is, it must have  separate validation scores for all minorities. Second, the level of confidence for the test must be at the .05 level. Third, the testing procedure must contain an adequate sample. Fourth, the test must have been administered to all under uniform conditions--the local use of the test must closely conform to the sample, purpose, and conditions used in the test's validation.

It was found that, generally, the elasticity of grade eight knowledge with respect to grade eight school inputs is higher than the elasticity of grade eight knowledge with respect to grade one students who, then, might benefit from increased resource allocations in the early grades. The second question examined the preferences of teachers with respect to the level and distribution of learning within the classroom and to their own geographic location. Teachers attempt to maximize the average level of learning and to minimize the variance in learning in the classroom, though they  strongly prefer to maximize achievement. The third question examined the relationship between student work effort and learning. It was found that student labor is a strong determinant of student learning.

It is recommended that flexible-modular scheduling not be continued in its present form. Rather, undesirable features should be eliminated and highly valued features should be retained if possible. The resulting schedule will likely hold little flexibility in terms of unscheduled student time, but  should provide capabilities to retain high priority characteristics of a good learning environment.

Presented are the reports of the committees concerned with a year-round school research bibliography library, a student employer survey, a general air-conditioning survey, a review of selected year-round school surveys, a summer school articulation report, and a research report of the 44-17 and other methods of year-round secondary school operation. The student employer survey was carried out in order to sample the conditions under which high school students are employed and the effect that year-round school would have on youth employment and the general business operation. The general air-conditioning survey was to determine the factors existion in the area  schools; no attempt was made to estimate the operation costs for increased air-conditioning. The stress of the survey of year-round schools was placed on the most recent studies and surveys accomplished in San Diego County that attempted to measure the attitudes and opinions of various populations toward the year-round concept.

Leaders may be categorized by personality factors, by methods of selection, or the manner in which the leadership function is executed. One of the most critical areas in which the executive is involved is that of problem-solving. While no specific set of character traits or particular executive style can be established as the best, research does indicate that certain personality traits and qualities of leadership are exhibited in successful executives. Essential personal characteristics include faith in humanity, genuine concern for others,  initiative and integrity, and a sense of purpose and direction. Quality of leadership is characterized by the degree of technical mastery of the executive, a level of intelligence higher than that of most subordinates, and a social awareness enabling him to communicate effectively with others.

Described are project objectives including revising the referral and assessment process within the school system, improving the self concepts of the PASS children, developing staff professionals to serve as better behavioral change agents, and offering a fully developed and evaluated model approach to LD applicable in a wide variety of  communities. The project is seen to utilize the facilities of a community-oriented psychoeducational agency, a school system using diagnostic and prescriptive methods, and a coordination mechanism linking the two systems. Initial data are provided showing that LD children in the project perform lower in verbal than performance skills, function intellectually somewhat lower than the norm, possess a relatively normal self concept, and perform significantly higher in math than in reading. Also noted is a replication and dissemination strategy involving the production of educational products for administrators, psychoeducational personnel, and parents. (DB)",

Development is seen to take place in succession beginning with the primary level, proceeding to the social, symbolic, and abstract levels with each level dependent upon learning to respond to reinforcing stimuli at the previous levels. It is suggested that learning problems such as hyperactivity may be due to the selection of reinforcers at the wrong developmental level.

LD students required three times as many practice trials as normal Ss, thus stressing the importance of drill for LD Ss.

Other findings showed that LD Ss were significantly deficient in the ability to retrieve accurate verbal opposites, to label pictorial presentations, to name foods, to formulate sentences, and to define words.

An eclectic approach to questions of methodology is advocated, basic principles of instructional measurement are reviewed, and the importance of students' rate of response is considered. Use of functional and nonfunctional tasks is one topic covered in a discussion of materials. A skill is said to be generalized when it is performed across persons, places, instructional materials, and language  cues.

Major findings were that there was no evidence of racial or socio-economic class discrimination in MCPS written policy and placement procedures or in the MCPS 5-year Plan for Special Educational Services; that staff members needed to develop greater sensitivity to minority issues during the initial screening and classification process; that improvement was needed in the quality of  placement conference data; that testing policies and the use of test results needed to be clarified; that the majority of parents surveyed were satisfied with the placement procedures and their children's program; and that MCPS personnel had a low tolerance for students who exhibited behavior or background different from established community norms. Evidence supported recommendations in 11 areas: communication, school-by-school needs assessment, pre-referral procedures, identification and classification procedures, staff development, testing and policy procedures, school medical advisors (SMA), parent concerns, programs, human relations, and public relations; and included that there be a review and classification of the role of SMAs in the placement process.

        "description":"A 1-year demonstration project involving 24 developmentally disabled students (9- to 20-years-old) with severe physical limitations was conducted to increase their educational and vocational possibilities by using cost-effective bio-engineering techniques to modify their physical environment and develop improved adaptive devices. Phase I of the project consisted of student selection, parent education, and initial evaluation of individual functional abilities. The second phase included using specially designed or commercially available adaptive devices (such as contour seats and wheelchair ramps) to increase functional independence; developing recreational programs (such as a miniature golf course); measuring functional improvement in 50 areas of self-care (such as dressing and  eating); providing vocational orientation programs (including training in microfilming and one-handed typing); evaluating each student's functional and vocational potentials and recommending environmental and othotic (supportive device) adaptations; and meeting of project advisors, staff members, parents, and students. Plans for the project's final phase focus on a practical workshop to demonstrate how low-cost, simple designed, bio-engineering adaptations can be used to increase the physically disabled individual's functional level and work capacity. (Provided are descriptions and pictures of adaptive devices used with individual students and 14 appendixes including sample forms for evaluating physical functioning and recreational interests.)

Ss' visual discrimination and visual memory were tested with filmstrip materials from Project LIFE (Language Improvement to Facilitate Education). Time scores and error scores were used to measure the performances of both groups. Results showing that deaf Ss scored as well or better than the hearing Ss in all tested activities indicated that the memories of deaf children for visually significant stimuli may be at least as strong and persistent as the memories of hearing children, and that attention could be focused on more and better utilization of significant visual aids in the education of the deaf.

Efforts by industry to increase minority interest in engineering are reported, but the need for additional programs is evidenced by the low influx of minority workers into the job market.

Since it is expected that not all the participants in a graduate engineering program will be able to attend university-based lectures, presentations are video-taped and transported to industrial plants, engineering offices, and other locations throughout the state. When combined with formal registration procedures and the administration of exams under the supervision of faculty affiliates at the remote locations, the system has provided a workable and suitable means of conducting graduate education for practicing engineers. Although many participants complete M.S. degrees, the program has also been shown to be of value for those practitioners who are interested in furthering  education only in specialized topics. (CP)",

The five variables were: (1) operation symbol, (2) sentence type as determined by the symmetric property of the equality relation, (3) the position of the placeholder, (4) whether the solution was a whole number or not, and (5) whether the largest number in the problem occurs as a product in a basic fact. Two instruments incorporating these variables were developed and administered to 1298 students in grades four through six. Responses were coded and analyzed using the Fortap Statistical Package. Data from students whose performance meets predetermined minimal students were further  analyzed using ANOVA and Wilcoxen signed rank tests. These analyses indicated that sentences with whole number solutions were significantly easier than others. Variables (1), (2), and (3) were also related to significant differences in subject performance, and several significant interaction effects were found. (SD)",

The paper examines existing patterns of residential separation in which ethnic and racial groups--primarily black Americans--generally are spatially clustered in segments of urban space that frequently assume a territorial identification. The purpose is to explore the operation of forces that are responsible for patterns which are molded by both economic and social behavior. After an overview of the problem is in chapter 1, a brief history of the black ghetto as a legacy of the past is included in chapter 2. Chapter 3 examines urbanization of the early 1900s and its relation to ghetto formation. The location of urban space  throughout the United States is explored in the fourth chapter, determining that the ghetto is a universal spatial configuration in large urban centers. The fifth chapter presents an explanation of the mechanism which produces such spatial patterns. It includes social, economic, and political variables. These variables are examined in relation to balck and white residential patterns in chapter 6. A list of references cited in the text concludes the document. (Author/JR)",

The guide includes a short orientation to Perspectives and provides a brief summary of the content and methodology of the handbook. The bulk of the guide deals with the task of plugging a specific content area into Perspectives' methodological and analytical framework as a prototype for further  curriculum revision. The content focus is limited to law-related education for a K-12 curriculum. The units focus on planning a program, the incorporation of objectives, questioning, values, inquiry, simulation, evaluation, and analytical perspectives. A series of appendices conclude the document. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"Because of an increasing interest in sociology at the high school level, this publication was developed as an aid to teachers, department heads, and supervisors to incorporate sociology into the secondary curriculum. The introduction defines sociology as not merely a study of society but specifically as the observation of social relationships, a study of groups or aggregates of individuals within a society. In addition, the major subfields of sociology, including research, social psychology, and population and ecology, are examined in this chapter. The second chapter suggests teaching strategies and resources. Two methods of integrating sociology into the curriculum are explore: the separate course method and integration as a supplement to the regular curriculum. The third  chapter presents seven model activities that the author has found to be successful in his own teaching. These range from 15- to 30-minute interaction activities to group research projects that can last as long as four to six weeks. A list of organizations and resources to aid in the development and evaluation of secondary sociology programs concludes the document. (JR)",

        "description":"The politics of the behavioral modification approach to educational evaluation are examined in this position paper. In recent years the science of behavior modification has become an established political doctrine in professional education. Behavioral objectives, behavior change, performance criteria, and competency-based instruction are just a few terms of an educational evaluation system concerned with the quality control manufacture of human products with specified performance characteristics. The danger of this behavioral orientation is that it is a political approach to science and education that is being disguised as rational, scientific, and politically neutral when, in fact, it is not. The problem with the behavioral manufacturers is that they suggest that only technical  questions concerning efficiency should be asked rather than ethical, moral, and political questions concerning the humanistic development of students. Rather, evaluation should be qualitative in order to deepen our awareness of what it means to be human. It should be concerned with the quality of interpersonal relationships rather than the establishment of a management caste system. It should judge the moral integrity and intrinsic meaningfulness of tasks, relationships, and work which students are called on to do. (Author/DE)",

Emphasis is on contemporary industrial and postindustrial society as it expresses its environmental relationships through action defined by policies, laws, and administrative arrangements. The content and organization is essentially multidisciplinary. Twelve subtopics are organized around the following four major areas: (1) basic environmental concepts--introduction and background; (2) environment as a policy issue--origins, characteristics, and implications; (3) reconciling natural and technical systems--objectives, approaches, and processes; and (4) problems of policy implementation--economic, juridical, and  institutional. Each of the subtopics is keyed to references in the comprehensive bibliographies. Subtopics are defined and described by an abstract. Bibliographic references to articles and books comprise the bulk of the document. For each topic, a set of 10 organizing questions has been provided to enable the student to estimate his comprehension of the subject. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"Three ways to develop curriculum materials dealing with controversial political issues are described. Currently the two most popular approaches are the general theoretical discussion of important concepts and case studies. Whereas the theoretical approach may be too abstract and the case study approach too brief, a third approach combines the positive aspects of both and yet avoids their pitfalls. This documentary approach is an extensive treatment of a well-defined topic which avoids lengthy narratives of a theoretical approach and yet is more in-depth than a case study. To teach about the concept of political conflict, a documentary would present students with a wealth of information about a single political system experiencing conflict. The High School Political Science  Curriculum Project under development at Indiana University uses the documentary approach in &quot;Comparing Political Experiences.&quot; One specific unit focuses on the issue of court-ordered busing in Boston by providing participant eye views of the various actors in the conflict situation. This interview technique provides a powerful set of examples of political conflict. Guidelines for the creation of a documentary are provided. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"A survey designed to ascertain how various school-related groups perceive the school responding to nontraditional situations of nationalistic education is described. Administrators, board of education members, parents, teachers, and students indicated what they thought would and should occur in the school in response to 18 nontraditional situations. For example, one question inquires about what action the school would and should take when a teacher refuses to participate in the morning flag salute. The results indicate that students and teachers perceive that the school should be significantly more open and tolerant than parents, administrators, and board of education members. Public school teachers under age 30, nontenured, and with less than four years experience perceive the  schools to be significantly less open than teachers over 30 years old with tenure. Since younger educators seldom hold significantly power positions in a school system, their impact on curriculum will be less than that of older educators. Such obstacles may help to explain the difficulties of implementation of new social studies programs which require open and critical inquiry. (Author/DE)",

The rationale for the approach underlying the publication is that by listening to folk songs and ballads or by talking with a senior citizen about past events, a child can come to understand that history is all around him. Students are involved in many activities. They study the characteristics of roof styles prevalent during colonial times and then go out into their community to photograph or make sketches of roofing on both old and new homes, study floor plans of colonial homes and contrast these with the layout of their own home to disucss differences in living styles, plan a  Sunday meal for seven during the winter of 1798, and choose four streets in their town to write about and discuss why the street was so named and any pertinent historic anecdotes. Other areas and topics explored through the exercises include architectural decoration--colonial to Victorian, chairs, portraits and old snapshots, coins, stamps, quilts, flags, oral history, general stories, trains, and cars. Although intended for use by elementary students, the ideas in this resource can be adapted for secondary students. (Author/RM)",

With an emphasis on both a formal and informal educational level, the essay is divided into five sections which examine the requirements for an attainable global perspective. Section 1, Perspective Consciousness, underscores the need to recognize the concept that everyone's perspective is shaped by subtle influences and that others may have different perspectives. Section 2, State of the Planet Awareness, examines the problems and solutions for increasing the ability of individuals to intelligently interpret information about world  conditions. Section 3, Cross Cultural Awareness, describes the different degrees of cross-cultural awareness and the necessity to reach a stage beyond empathy where one has the capacity to imagine oneself in a role within the context of a foreign culture. Section 4, Knowledge of Global Dynamics, analyzes the world as an interdependent system where the issue of growth may be the predominant contemporary problem. Section 5, Awareness of Human Choices, emphasizes that increased global perspective will require difficult value decisions about the solutions to our world problems. (Author/DE)",

        "author":["Bullivant, Brian Milton"],
        "description":"This study examines how the values and value orientations derived fro two differing, historical traditions influence the formal education of adolescent boys attending an Orthodox Jewish day school in Melbourne, Australia. The two traditions include the Chassidic variant of the great tradition of Orthodox Judaism and the Australian adaptation of the English secular academic tradition. A fundamental dualism dominates the school in the form of two almost separate enculturation matrices between which the students move daily. The contrasts between the value orientations produce an identifiable dissonance in the boys' cognitions about their life worlds. This affects their interpersonal behavior in teaching-learning interaction settings making them prone to hyperactivity, anxiety,  tension, conflict, and even aggression. Sociological explanations suggest that the differing social constructions of learning in the two traditions interact to frustrate the boys' needs to learn. Countervailing influences and enculturation interference from the school's structural-organizational and epistemological dualism make the students' reality constructions problematical which in turn hamper their ability to learn.

Fourteen member states participated in the conference in order to improve international understanding and school-community relationships by suggesting innovations in the organizational structure, curriculum content, and teaching methods of the schools. Two separate reports of the English-speaking countries and the French-speaking countries are included. Both reports provide a philosophical foundation, strategies for change, and possible projects. A final joint recommendation report of the two groups stresses the necessity for further faculty training, UNESCO establishment of information clearinghouses and curriculum development centers within the framework of existing institutions, key  structural changes in selected Associated Schools which will act as models for further curriculum development, and more emphasis on innovative teaching units in the circular, International Understanding at School. Two brief working papers submitted to the conference entitled The School as Social Agent in the Community: Determinants of Effective Programs and Education and Community are also included.

        "description":"An experiment designed to study the relationship between moral behavior and level of moral development is described. Subjects in the experiment were faced with the choice of either remaining uninvolved observers or intervening to help another student. Their choice was affected by the presence of an authority figure which discouraged any intervention. The results indicated that people at almost all levels of moral development do not help someone in need, although they think that person should be helped. The most common reason was the presence of the authority figure. Only at level 6 of the Kohlberg moral development scale did every subject go against the authority figure and help the student. However, the analysis of behavior at stages 1-5 reveals that an increasing percentage at  each level defied authority in order to help the student. Thus the results confirm Kohlberg's theory that moral judgment predicts moral behavior in a situation by determining the interpretation of the situation and consequently the response to it.

They are required to apply critical and analytical procedures leading to philosophical investigations of topics of both philosophical and nonphilosophical origins. The teaching techniques used in the course range from informal classroom discussion to formal philosophical reading. In general, the emphasis is on student inquiry into philosophical problems before the class is presented with philosophers' reflections on the subject. The course, divided into four units, including epistemology, the African world view, religion, and social and political philosophy, is designed to help students become acquainted with and  examine the (1) bases and structure of knowledge; (2) mythology, religion, philosophy, and social system of black Africa; (3) nature of religion and the relationship of black theology to black power; and (4) traditional problems of the relation between man and state as well as the philosophical basis for black liberation.

Basic concepts are introduced which show how a market mechanism resolves the conflict between finite resources and infinite desires, how supply and demand interact, and how competition among commodities and available reserves, as well as among perspective purchasers, influence pricing. Students are exposed to these concepts on a personal level, helping them to answer the following kinds of questions: (1) What kind of car should I buy considering the energy crisis? (2) Should I go to college or to work after high school graduation? (3) What summer jobs are available? Following an introduction which defines and  introduces the market system, activity chapters focus on consumerism, money problems, scarcity of natural resources, distribution of goods, supply and demand, getting enough gasoline, the case for rationing, motorcycles and public safety, and future fear. Although there is some variation, most lessons begin with a newspaper article on one of the former-mentioned economic topics. Then, lists of difficult terminology and a number of questions follow to help students comprehend what they read in the article. The teacher's guide is SO 008 865. (Author/JR)",

The paper first discusses certain important features of the Urban/Rural program. One unique feature of this program is its built-in parity mechanism that requires shared decision-making between school professionals and the community, and which sets it apart from similar programs in teacher education. Another salient feature of the Urban/Rural program is that it is aimed at inservice education. The importance of Leadership Training Institutes (LTI) in relation to this program is also stressed, since the LTI, through workshops, conferences, and newsletters, has served as a unifying element for the Urban/Rural  sites. The paper then discusses the attempts of Urban/Rural programs, by including teachers in their planning, to solve certain problems found in traditional inservice education programs. A working definition of inservice education is then proposed, and strategies and mechanisms for providing inservice education that have emerged in the Urban/Rural program are discussed. Other Urban/Rural experiences for the design of a national strategy for inservice education are considered, and the success of various projects is also discussed.

The obstacles in conducting an evaluation of colleagues' programs are discussed; these fall into two categories. First, there is a set of problems that relate to conflicts inherent in judging the work of a colleague without the protection of anonymity or organizational authority, and second, there are problems posed by the unique characteristics of the program under consideration, which can appear more complex than they are due to the myopia induced by such close association. The proposed strategy, as presented, places the evaluator in the role of coordinator, facilitator, and synthesizer of several separate research efforts in which colleagues in a variety  of disciplines combine energies and interests to assess the program being examined. The paper states that the recruitment of researchers to participate in the strategy was accomplished by persuasion and by assuring a payoff to the researchers involved in the form of contributions to their own area of research. The tactics used for organization and management are discussed in some detail. The preliminary results suggested that the evaluation effort was facilitated and its value increased by multidisciplinary contributions to the research. (Author/RC)",

The major recommendation is to establish a separate ERIC Clearinghouse on HPR. In the interim,  it is recommended that the Clearinghouse on Teacher Education limit its resources for HPR to 20 percent; that the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors be improved to add more HPR descriptor terms; that there be an emphasis on acquiring documents not adequately covered in the data base; and that the Clearinghouse be more widely publicized to people in the health, physical education, and recreation community.

It looks at the history of teacher education in those countries, focusing on (1) the fact that primary school teachers have tended to be women trained in inferior normal or teacher training schools, and (b) that secondary teachers have tended to be &quot;educated&quot; at universities in rigorous disciplines. The author states that teaching needs to become increasingly professionalized, that the role of the teacher has become extremely complex, and that the separation of teacher training from serious academic preparation has been harmful to the profession. The relations between teacher training institutions, schools of education, and universities in the  above-mentioned countries are also analyzed and critiques are offered. The second study is of U.S. and Canadian institutions concerned with teacher preparation. As in the first study, related historical and cultural issues are examined. Issues studied in this connection include accreditation and certification, state and province relationship to education, and community demands. This study also contains numerous tables and statistics. The first study is followed by references, the second by a bibliography. (CD)",

In both the establishing of life-goals and the development of a philosophy of education, a clear understanding of values and facts in necessary. But in educational practice, many decisions are based on one-sided political, social, and economical considerations rather than on philosphical ones. To gain balance and completeness, man first needs God, then the knowledge and practice provided by the humanities and by natural and social sciences. Education, according to the theistic philosophy of education, is the completing and balancing of man with divine help. Humanistic values of their broader form dominate the various schools of modern  edcuational thought. But there can be no reconciliation between humanism and theism. The questions are often asked: Life for what? education for what? A structure for a theist philosophy of education and educational value system offers answers to these questions. The axiological structure for the theistic philosophy of education must be further developed into specific values, aims and educational practices. Thus the axiological approach to the theistic philosophy of education is a reasonable alternative to humanist thought. (CD)",

        "description":"This study assessed the performance of first-year teachers trained through the U. S. Office of Education Career Opportunities Program (COP) and a matched group of first-year teachers in the same school building and grade, but not trained through COP. The study was conducted during the 1974-75 school year at 15 sites across the country, which were drawn as a stratified sample of the 132 COP projects nationwide. A variety of instruments were used to obtain a comprehensive picture of the participants in terms of personal characteristics, attitudes, classroom behavior, and impact upon pupils. The results showed that the COP trained teacher was more likely to have a more positive attitude toward teaching, be more socially oriented, have more vigor, be more original in thought, and  receive a higher rating from the principal based on his/her work in the classroom. He/she was more supportive of student initiated talk and less likely to ask questions soliciting rote responses. The children whom the COP-trained teacher taught had a more positive self-concept, their parents viewed their attitudes toward school more positively, and the children performed better on standardized achievement tests. Although many of the differences between the COP trained and non-COP trained teachers are small, the pattern of differences is clear and consistent. (A summary of the study is included.) (Author)",

IGE/MUS-E was developed by the Wisconsin Research and Development Center for Cognitive Learning and is a comprehensive educational system incorporating several innovative educational development. The study examined five attitudinal variables concerned with learning. These were pupil attitude toward (1) himself as a learner, (2) other pupils, (3) teachers, (4) instruction, and (5) school. There was also an analysis of pupil attitude toward the school plant, the school administration, and the community. Data on attendance and tardiness were also collected. A sample of 566 pupils in 13 Wisconsin  IGE/MUS-E elementary schools was compared with a control group of 410 pupils in 12 traditionally oriented Wisconsin elementary schools with regard to their attitudes toward their learning environment. The School Morale Scale and the Semantic Differential of Self-Concept as a Learner were employed to collect data on pupil attitude. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the pupils in the IGE/MUS-E organizational structure generally have the same learning climate as pupils in traditionally organized schools.

Ten third-grade children were secretly filmed while watching a very easy and a very hard math lesson. Third graders, sixth graders, and adults (college students) were asked to judge, based on a film of each child's face, whether the subject understood a lot, a little, or none of the lesson. The children were more successful at this than the adults, although the degree of accuracy in an absolute sense was not particularly high for either adults or children. Participants also found it easier to tell whether males were watching difficult or easy lessons. The results should not be taken to indicate that children encode all nonverbal responses  better than adults, but rather that their familiarity with the social situations of their peers helps them infer the meaning of different facial expressions of other children. The results of this experiment have clear implications for classroom teaching and tutoring by children. (CD)",

In the first study, fourth graders tutored third graders in reading once a day for two weeks. Another group befriended a third grader over the same period of time, supervising play activities. A control group participated in neither special situation. After the experiment, the children were evaluated through personal interviews and tests to determine how, if at all, their feelings about themselves, their teachers, and their academic progress had changed. Although all the subjects liked being in the experiment, and the tutees' reading improved, few significant differences were seen in experiment and control subjects. In the second study, fifth graders taught first graders symmetry  concepts in math twice a week for six weeks. Again, others befriended the first graders and others were not placed in a pair. Tutees in this situation learned a good deal and developed more positive perceptions of their intellectual performance. First graders who had a friend enjoyed the relationship, but their self-perceptions did not change as a consequence. It was speculated that this was because being in a friend relationship was not enough of a new, concrete role to foster the changes that role theory would suggest. Tutors enjoyed the experience and learned the material they had to teach, but the experiment did not seem to affect their self-concepts very much. (CD)",

The first issue concerns state laws which affect student teachers, with Illinois and Indiana laws used as examples. Some of these laws have to do with liability insurance, credentialling, clinical training, and arrangements for student teaching. The second issue is tort liability of schools and teachers. It is suggested that supervising teachers may be held responsible for harm which befalls a student teacher through their negligence, and student teachers can be held responsible for the safety of children. The third issue is collective bargaining: teacher-board negotiations concerning student teaching. The author states that he expects the  profession to demand more control over aspects of student teaching. The fourth issue concerns school discipline; two important cases are described: Goss v. Lopez, and Wood v. Strickland. The fifth issue is the emerging concept of a \"right to learn\"; the Peter Doe and Ianniello cases are discussed. In the former case, still pending, a high school graduate has sued the San Francisco school system for failing to teach him to read. If a right to learn becomes an accepted legal construct, the author speculates that specific kinds of responsibilities of schools and teachers will have to be clarified. (CD)",

A secondary purpose was to determine if such a program would improve the reading grades, peer relations, and general academic performance of the 100 fifth and sixth grade tutors. Evaluation was accomplished by pretests and posttests administered to the second, fifth, and sixth grade students to measure peer relations, academic performance, and achievement in sight vocabulary in four experimental schools and four control schools. Other evaluation instruments were used to obtain reactions of parents, teachers, and principals to  the program. As a result of the program, dramatic increases were observed in acquisition of sight vocabulary skills of the tutored students. Less dramatic improvements were observed in academic achievement, peer relations, and reading grades of both tutors and tutees. The principals, teachers, and parents displayed positive reactions to the program. (Author)",

The first chapter describes characteristics of professions and semi-professions. Chapter two assesses the extent to which teaching falls short of being a full status profession. It examines social factors which bear on teaching, conditions in the schools, and the nature of teaching. Chapter three examines the various elements involved in the governance of teacher education and explores collaborative relationships among participating partners. The fourth chapter considers the questions  involved in preservice, inservice, and continuing teacher preparation. This chapter also highlights the concept of adequate \"life space\" within which teacher educators can conduct effective initial preparation and subsequent life-long efforts at professional proficiency. Chapter five considers the issues of individual and institutional quality control and explores their implications for certification, program approval, recruitment and selection, and supply and demand. This chapter also addresses the problems of adequate resources and necessary funding. The final section summarizes and clarifies some concepts and themes which have special meaning for the Commission. (Author/CD)",

It is stated that the change process is based upon the assumption that women can implement change to alleviate institutionalized discrimination in the organizations in which they work. The objective of the research is stated as being to develop and implement strategies for the alleviation of sex discrimination in promotion and training opportunities in two federal civilian agencies. Chapter one of this dissertation presents background information on the problem of prejudice, and an introduction to the study. Chapter two contains a review of the literature. Methodology and procedures are discussed in chapters three and four.

It is designed to provide preservice secondary school teachers with an integrated set of teaching skills as well as a systematic set of analytic skills. The competencies involve instructional methods, general educational knowledge, and reading methods. Professional Sequence instruction is organized in a series of self-instructional packages which have been constructed by the ISU faculty. Students are given credit for each package when they have demonstrated the required level of competence by either performance, written work, or tests. Daily computer printouts list results of evaluations submitted  during the previous 24 hours. Each student's cumulative progress is reported weekly by computer printout. Following a series of orientation sessions, the student works individually with faculty members of his/her choice in the Sequence advisement room. Approximately 70 percent of the program is required. The remaining 30 percent is earned by completing optional packages, independent study, or by taking mini-courses. Thus, students are able to work at a pace suited to their needs. The teaching skills component of the program is climaxed by a series of five microteaching experiences, all clinically analyzed. In addition, students may choose to participate in a public school experience or a clinical experience in the laboratory school prior to student teaching. (Author)",

The program, Humanizing, Individualizing and Personalizing Education (HIP), is offered over a three-year period, and correlates a field experience with university classroom activities. Each of the freshman and sophomore students is a member of a learning community in a participating Individually Guided Education (IGE) elementary school, and the IGE Learning Community at the University. When students are not on their field assignments they participate in didactic activities which are designed in two to three week increments, scheduled at least one week in advance. The University Learning Community is made up of the students  and an interdisciplinary team of 20 educators. The professional training embraces the laboratory, clinical, and small group seminar approach to professional preparation. The didactic content is to varying degrees competency-based and is to a large extent organized around behavioral objectives, instructional alternatives, and alternative assessment procedures. Students select an advisor from the Learning Community to coordinate the planning of the professional education learning program for each student according to his/her needs, interests, and activities.

        "description":"The Cooperative Program in Teacher Education at New Mexico State University, now in its tenth year, is a work-study degree plan which students complete in the normal four years by attending summer sessions as well as regular semesters. Graduates enter the teaching profession with exposure to several levels of public school education. From first entry, co-op students alternate semesters between a &quot;work phase&quot; in classrooms (for which they receive both college credit and pay), and a &quot;school phase&quot; requiring enrollment in fulltime university coursework. Financial support derives from the Federal Higher Education Act plus some monies from the State of New Mexico. Wages paid during the work phases are based on a graduated scale and established financial need. As freshmen and  sophomores, co-op students are placed in paraprofessional roles in elementary and junior high schools. In the junior year, they hold assistant teacher classification and are assigned according to their preparations. Senior co-ops become co-teachers with broad responsibilities for teaching. A recent comprehensive comparison with a regular teacher preparation program revealed the co-op approach superior in almost all dimensions which seem representative of the quality being sought in America's classrooms.

It defines the process and procedures whereby all teacher education and school service personnel programs in the College of Education at Bowling Green State University are to be reviewed and subsequently redesigned to assure that they are consistent with (1) state accreditation and certification standards, (2) National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education accreditation standards, (3) present and emergent College/University missions and goals, and (4) research findings relative to professional performance. In addition to involving four College Councils and an Administrative Staff, the Agenda has precipitated the participation of 125 professional teacher  education and arts and science faculty, undergraduate and graduate students, elementary and secondary teachers, specialists, and administrators in the deliberations of six Program Area Coordinating Units and several Task Force groups. The function of the Program Area Coordinating Units is to redesign all programs within their respective areas to meet the four objectives of the Agenda. Each of the College Councils and the Administrative Staff have specified developmental and/or monitoring tasks. The immediate goal of the Agenda is the preparation of a comprehensive plan showing the process, procedures, and timeline by which specified curricular and organizational redesign will be implemented.

The  program was planned to be completed in a five year span, 1970-75, and required the complete cooperation of the public school teachers and the faculty and students of the College of Education at Northwestern State University, Natchitoches, Louisiana. Data evaluated was based on observations designed to measure curriculum organization, teaching techniques, classroom social organization, classroom psychological climate, order maintaining techniques, and provisions for individual differences.

        "description":"Elizabeth City State University has established a program concentrating in speech pathology and audiology which is nontraditional in approach. It serves as a support in giving valuable substance and current expertise to those programs already offered in the area of language proficiency. Growing out of the established educational concept that skills can best be taught by those teachers with the specific, detailed knowledge from the discipline that have proven effective in developing expertise in particular areas, the program in speech pathology and audiology was instituted to give teachers the expertise in developing language proficiency. The courses in Phonetics, Introduction to Speech Pathology, Anatomy and the Vocal Mechanism, Pathology II, and Clinical Procedure and Practice,  are especially useful in teaching reading skills, designing objectives for remediating basic speech and language problems, and establishing behavioral objectives for language arts. The program is especially useful in designing objectives, procedures and materials to serve the exceptional child, both retarded and gifted, in language growth. All courses are structured to provide expertise in servicing the exceptional child. Opportunities are available for interdepartmental use of materials, equipment, and student-faculty exchange of services. (Author/JMF)",

TEAM is an approach to people, teaching, and learning based on a belief that to teach children one must develop a personal style of teaching. TEAM adjusts to individual needs with students making decisions involving both content and methods of exploration. Modular scheduling occurs weekly, and a regular part of the schedule includes a year-long, supervised classroom practicum in urban and suburban schools in which TEAM students observe and teach children. Students return to student teach in these same schools during their senior  year. Students identify the goals toward which they work in developing their personal teaching styles. Evaluation and grading emerge from the goal clarification process through conferences between student and advisor. Research results for TEAM indicate that the program develops positive attitudes in students; they see themselves as better prepared and the TEAM faculty members as utilizing teaching competencies better than other elementary education programs.

Data were collected by questionnaires from randomly selected sample of the public school music teachers in the state. Of 400 inquiries, 208 response sheets were returned. An analysis of the data reveals that (1) the written skills associated with score reading, score preparation, and transportation are most needed and used; (2) the aural  skills most needed are those of sightseeing and detecting errors of all types; and (3) there is a slight weighting toward the pop-commercial type of music in terms of need, but on the use side, folk, pop, and ethnic music are used most often. When examined by areas of both specialization and level of teaching duties, the differences are more a matter of degree than direction. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"Two instructional models offer alternatives to the traditional lecture-discussion of undergraduate teacher aspirants. A self-paced model is composed of videotaped lectures, a learning package, and the use of both student proctors and instructor contact. Each student must develop his/her own time to be allotted structure for the course. An affective model puts students in contact with a faculty member in an informal setting. Human relations and sensitivity are developed, and students examine themselves as future teachers. The self-paced model is highly mediated and cognitive; the affective model, oriented toward personal interaction. Material for the cognitive dimension of the course was videotaped in 1973. Over 200 students who attended live lectures were compared with 200  attending TV lectures. Test results showed the mean score favoring the TV lecture series, but attitudes toward the course dropped with TV lectures. Attitudes improved and additional gain was made on test results when the course was offered in a small viewing room and student proctors added for tutoring. The affective dimension was later assimilated into the mainstream professional sequence. Results and experimentation supported its value in aiding academic success and positive self-concepts.

Specific changes that have evolved during the three year period  include behavior modeling, movement from university classroom to secondary school field instruction, movement toward an inservice treatment for instructors, and production of particularized learning materials. The focus on human relations and affective teaching is concluded to have created a consideration of alternative teaching and learning models and concern for the individual learner. (Author/JBH)",

Phase 1 consists of a two semester component which combines the study of education with directed observations in schools. Phase 2 is a one semester component in which the student tutors a child on a one-to-one basis in a participating public school. In Phase 3, the student serves as a teacher aide for one semester in an elementary school classroom. Phase 4 is a one semester component that combines professional methods courses in an integrated manner with practice of specific teaching skills in an elementary school classroom.

The third phase consisted of a planning day with three or four teachers to prepare for the simulation. In phase 4, each cluster of teachers moved with their classes into an all-purpose room designed to simulate the space and equipment in the new  school. Following the simulation, each cluster met for phase 5 in which the teachers and consultants debriefed the experience and set goals for what they wanted to accomplish in the new school. Phase 6 consisted of 18 days of followup in the new building. Evaluation results indicated that teacher attitudes about the new school have changed from ones of doubt, anxiety, and low expectation to more positive ones. (Author)",

It states that the role of the student is to learn from that which is offered, and that in a person-centered program the learning which is valued (1) is lasting rather than short-range, (2) involves process more than content, and (3) contains more personal elaborations than pieces of information. In part 2, the role of the child in the open classroom is explored, while part 3 shows the parallels between roles in an open classroom and roles in a person-centered college program. Part 4  contains practical suggestions for college instructors who wish to pay greater attention to the role of the student. Finally, part 5 contains practical suggestions for the student to construct his/her own role as a learner. (RC)",

        "description":"The role of the cooperating teacher is one of the most crucial factors in determining the success or failure of the student teaching experience. There are seven major factors to be considered in the development of an effective cooperating teacher-student professional relationship. First, the student teacher must be given a sincere sense of belonging. Setting the tone of the cooperating teacher-student teacher relationship is also extremely important and should be accomplished during the first few days of the student teaching experience. The third factor involves allowing for individual abilities to control the rate at which the student will progress into full time teaching. It is also necessary for the cooperating teacher and the student teacher to schedule a portion of each day  for a conference and planning period. The fifth factor concerns allowing the student teacher to have experience in writing lesson plans for the activities he/she teaches. Next, informal observations and feedback aimed at the improvement of the individual or program must be provided by the cooperating teacher on regular basis. Finally, each cooperating teacher should be expected to formally observe the student teacher a minimum number of time while he/she is teaching the entire class. By establishing strong lines of communication at the start of the cooperating teacher-student teacher relationship, the opportunity for a positive student teaching experience is greatly increased.

The specific skill pattern investigated was the ability of subjects, using either their dominant or nondominant hand, to catch a ball when they were unable to see their arm or hand. An \"L\" shaped curtain containing a hole for the ball to pass through was used for this study. The side of the curtain contained an arm sleeve which allowed the subject to see the ball in its parabolic flight pattern but did not allow the subject to see either her arm or hand. One hundred sixty high school girls were randomly chosen and assigned to one of the following four experimental treatment variables: (1) dominant hand kinesthetic catching ability, (2) dominant hand visual catching  ability, (3) nondominant hand kinesthetic catching ability, and (4) nondominant hand visual catching ability. It was found that there was a significant difference between vision and kinethesis in the ball catching task. A significant difference was also found between dominant and nondominant hands in the catching task. No significant difference was revealed between dominant and nondominant hand catching ability in the visual catching task. (Author)",

In each study, the same teachers taught a short curriculum unit three or four times, teaching different students in each trial. The results of the studies showed marked individual differences among teachers in the extent to which their students learned more or less. Few teachers showed marked increases in student learning with practice. It was also shown that, on the average, student achievement decreased with teacher practice.

It summarizes work done to date on the effects of \"student pull\" (i.e., student influence on teacher behavior) and on the means of training teachers both to be sensitive to the differences among students and to use information about those differences as the basis for modulating their behavior. The process of matching is analyzed in a six-step sequence using a  Behavior-Person-Environment system. Examples of implicit matching are given, and one model for explicitly matching teaching behavior to students' conceptual levels is described. It is stated that the long-term aim of applying explicit matching ideas is to facilitate teachers' implicit matching in their spontaneous adaptation to the needs of their students. (Author)",

The program strives to synthesize multidisciplinary theory and integrate this knowledge into conceptual patterns that guide educators. It seeks to tie theory to practice in the service of the handicapped child. A field based training program has been designed and consists of a primary staff of five who guide the students through this learning experience. Fifty percent of instructional time is spent in the field. Clinical professors accompany students into the classroom of two demonstration centers. One center services severely and multiply handicapped children ages zero to three; the other serves minimally handicapped children ages  three to eight. Students spend seven weeks at each site designing and implementing appropriate learning instructional strategies under professorial guidance. The final internship experience sees students practicing in a range of special education sites from infant stimulation to teacher training. The broad based generic nature of the program offers students a springboard to a variety of teaching and leadership roles. Course work is designed to build insights and clinical proficiency in the following areas: (1) multidisciplinary theory, (2) child development, (3) handicapping conditions, (4) identification assessment, (5) clinical teaching, (6) counseling techniques, and (7) alternative models of service.

Project POINT is field based: education courses are taught in public schools and are directly related to student teaching. Administrators and teachers work closely with university professors to coordinate objectives and experiences. Candidates engage in four semesters of intensive field experience and student teaching, with participation in three different schools, at three different grade levels, and in three different programs. Five university  professors work as a team to teach the education classes and supervise the participants in student teaching. Instructional skills are taught in such areas as assessment and diagnosis, planning, physical and psychological learning environments, communication and interaction, management, facilitation, and teaching strategies for various topics and classroom plans. Graduates' success rate in obtaining teaching positions has been almost double the success rate for other elementary education graduates at San Diego State University.

Consequently, the target groups for the project include both preservice teacher candidates and inservice teachers. Fifty competency-based learning modules were written by teachers from the public/private elementary and secondary schools of Vigo County. These were then tested  and placed in a tailor-made &quot;resource center,&quot; a portable laboratory which contains (1) all the necessary references for the student to satisfactorily complete the modules; and (2) items such as color audiovisual tapes, audio tapes, and other general references. These resource centers are placed in all the schools of the county and in several locations at the university. Most of the modules are field-oriented and are designed to be completed in the public/private school classroom of the county.

It is an interdisciplinary and interdepartmental program utilizing staff from the Departments of Psychology, Special Education, and Family and Child Development, who work in conjunction with the Department of Elementary Education. These university faculty members work in an integrated program with teachers and principals of 12 portal schools and the Utah State University Edith Bowen Elementary Teacher Education Laboratory School. The acronym SODIA represents the first letter of each of the key words, &quot;self,&quot;&quot;others,&quot;&quot;disciplines,&quot;&quot;implementation,&quot; and &quot;associate,&quot; which describe the  major focus of each of the five levels of the program. Each level involves experiences on-site in the public schools. The following three major dimensions of competencies have been identified for professional teachers: (1) personal relations, (2) teaching skills, and (3) subject knowledge. These dimensions form the base for instruction at each level, and evaluation of SODIA is based on each student's performance toward reaching a level of competence in these dimensions. The portfolio method is used in which the student assumes primary responsibility for presenting evidence of his/her competency. (Author/BD)",

As an interdisciplinary arts-education program conducted by teams composed of arts and education faculty and graduate and undergraduate students of Texas Tech University, LEEP is concerned with developing esthetic awareness and knowledge of how the arts are interrelated, while dealing with the improvement of teacher effectiveness. Through interdisciplinary activities, LEEP involves public school children from Lubbock's tri-ethnic community, undergraduate and graduate students, university faculty, and public school personnel in a working and learning situation which focuses on the education of feelings. LEEP is one of the public programs offered by the  museum of Texas Tech University. Future teachers are involved in learning how to use the museum as a teaching and learning resource while the museum is able to enlarge its scope as an interface between the community and the university. Museum Science graduate students participate as team members and aid in relating aspects of the museum to the esthetic experience. Undergraduate students are provided with pre-student teaching involvement with children of cultural and/or ethnic backgrounds different from their own. The focus of all activities is on providing children with opportunities to gain confidence in their creative abilities, to gain improved self-concepts, and to open new avenues of cultural and esthetic awareness.

In an attempt to achieve this objective, a student paraprofessional housing program has been designed and implemented. Initially, this involved the removal of all professionally trained personnel in the student living units. Secondly, a sophisticated selection and training model was developed and designed to utilize students to replace the professional personnel in the student living units. As a result of this program, 45 to 50 students are trained each year in the skills of interpersonal communication, problem solving, goal development, and people management. While the paraprofessional utilizes these skills in the student living units, all students have an  opportunity to observe the applicability of these skills in people-to-people types of environments. The evaluation process has indicated a strong degree of success with almost all students viewing the trained paraprofessional as a highly skilled person. In addition, graduate study surveys indicate that the paraprofessional program has added a valuable dimension to the overall teacher education program. (Author)",

        "description":"Competency based teacher education has been defined in various ways, but there is general agreement on at least two basic elements. The first essential characteristic is the specification of teacher competencies which form the basis of the entire program. The second is the design of assessment techniques directly related to the specific competencies. Competencies have been written in a variety of ways and have been related to various domains or competency areas. In each of the competency domains the form of the competency must be examined to determine appropriate assessment techniques. There are a number of assessment factors which need to be considered in the evaluation of competencies. The nature of the standards, or criterion selection, is essential. Other concerns are  comprehensiveness and fidelity of the assessment system, validity and reliability of data, and general utility of the process. Assessment of knowledge competencies can be accomplished through paper and pencil testing. Assessment of teaching behaviors or performances, however, requires observation of the individual demonstrating the skill. This may be accomplished by rating scales or structured observation systems. Utilizing sampling and student achievement have also been used, although it has been concluded that student learning measures cannot be fairly used to evaluate individual teachers at present.

The university's secondary education department has been instrumental in insuring the success of the programs and thus improving the quality of teacher education. The department has taught experienced and  prospective teachers the effective use of computers in the classroom. Some of this has been done by specially designed courses, and, in addition, a notable effort has been made to expose all education students to the computer's potential in methods classes. As a result of these efforts, the LACE Project has been productive in improving the quality of teacher education at the university, as well as the quality of instruction in Wisconsin schools.

Data from performance domains suggests that some tests have differential validity and an adverse impact on minority groups, disproportionately excluding them from professional practice on the absence of any data indicating criterion related validity of the licensing examinations. The measurement of content validity for these examinations demonstrates wide differences among professions and across states within the same professions. Some typical methods for setting passing scores are shown. The author introduces his own methodology for establishing passing scores and  outlines its mechanics.

Some analysis was accomplished and one paper, &quot;Operational Accountability&quot; (ED 076 666) was written based on these preliminary results. It was decided to use data from the Equality of Educational Opportunity Survey (the Coleman Report) so that models might be developed and tested while developing local sources of data. Three papers have been written based upon the Coleman data: &quot;A Simultaneous Equations Model of the Educational Process&quot; (TM 004 650), &quot;Education  from an Anthropological Perspective: An Empirical Investigation of Structural Differences among Blacks and Whites&quot; (TM 004 651), and &quot;A Simultaneous Equations Model of the Education Process: The Coleman Data Revisited with an Emphasis upon Achievement&quot; (ED 097 404). All of these papers share a common basic idea. The educational process has several outputs which include achievement, efficacy, motivation, and expectations. The notion is that all these must be considered endogenous variables so that the educational process can only be modeled through the methodology of simultaneous equations. (RC)",

Forty Likert-scale items were used to measure attitudes toward certain aspects of drug abuse among the same four groups of college students. The data suggest that students tend toward the conservative side in their attitudes toward a drug addict and the way the addict should be handled by society; the  students are however, not willing completely to deprive an addict of his personal rights and not have a voice in the way he should be treated.

The measures are generalized to apply to incomplete data such as tailored testing. The measures are based on consideration of the items-plus-persons by items-plus-persons matrix as an adjacency matrix in which a 1 means that the row element dominated the column element regardless of whether it is item or person which dominates. From this the number of item-item and person-person dominance relations can be derived. Indices of consistency are developed which compare the number of dominance relations in a matrix to the number that would occur if it were perfectly consistent and to the number in a random matrix. The indices of consistency are shown to relate to test variance, the  Kuder-Richardson formulas, and Loevinger's homogeneity indices. Indices of completeness are also proposed. (Author)",

It is meant to assist justice agency and project managers in determining completeness of evaluation planning by providing a framework against which to measure their evaluation components. While the model and review criteria presented were developed within the context of the Legal Enforcement Assistance Administration's (LEAA's) High Impact Anti-Crime Program, they were based upon an awareness of the difficulties involved in evaluating social programs generally and may be applicable to evaluation efforts outside of the criminal justice sector. The paper is divided into four sections. The first (introductory) section  describes current preoccupations with evaluation. The second section provides the reader with an understanding of the special context within which the model and criteria were developed via a brief discussion of the Impact Program's evaluation effort. The third section presents the evaluation planning model along with a discussion of key steps in the evaluation planning process.

        "description":"The Philadelphia Prekindergarten Head Start Program is a child development program for three- and four-year old children from low-income families funded through the Philadelphia Anti-Poverty Action Commission. The approach stresses an interacting and multidisciplinary attempt to improve the child's physical and emotional health, his family relationships, and his abilities to function better as a person. The program has been designed to implement five different early childhood education models: Behavioral Analysis, Bank Street, Montessori, Responsive Learning, and Curriculum for Social and Emotional Development. Programming according to model specifications remained the theoretical basis for daily operation. Research and evaluation activities during 1974-75 have centered around  the program's goals for children. They have included classroom observations, the development of forms to assess the extent of model implementation, summarizing and analyzing the results of the Denver Developmental Screening Test, and the inclusion of the children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal File. There was found to be a wide range of practices in terms (1) extent of model implementation, (2) classroom differences within a model, (3) grouping practices, (4) frequency of parent volunteers, and (5) provisioning. Observation data yielding the above information are summarized according to model and across the total program. (RC)",

        "description":"The American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) has been very active in the performance-based movement. In the fall of 1972, the AACTE conducted a preliminary survey of 1,250 institutions asking which institutions were operating, investigating and/or planning PBTE programs. Of the 783 respondents (a 63 percent return), 131 (17 percent) said they were operating PBTE programs, 228 (29 percent) said they were not, and a large number, 424 (54 percent), said they were in some stage of investigation. The staff of Teacher Programs and Services at Educational Testing Service, in conjunction with the staff of AACTE drafted a questionnaire, aimed at examining as closely as possible the status of PBTE programs. The questionnaire was reviewed by leading educators in the  movement and most suggestions were incorporated. The limitations of a paper and pencil survey are evident; the data provide a quantitative view and raise many more questions than can be answered here. If feasible, sample follow-up visits will be made in order to gain a more qualitative understanding of some of the programs. Nonetheless, the results of the survey provide the most recent and detailed information available on PBTE programs. (Author/DEP)",

The program provided for the entire community with the provision of supportive information packages specially prepared for specific community groups. Children received support in their efforts to form good dental habits from teachers, parents, dentists, and hygienists, and local suppliers of toothbrushes, dental floss, and disclosing wafers. In the pilot test, curriculum was designed by teams of teachers, dentists, curriculum designers, and evaluators. Four sets of 19 lessons each were prepared,  covering grades K-2, 3-6, Jr. High School, and Sr. High School. These were pilot tested in 111 classrooms in Texas in the Spring of 1975, and this report covered the evaluation strategy, instruments, and results. This report concluded that the materials were quite successful, particularly in the early grades. It was found that the humanistic approach was generally well received and that the entire model for presenting this subject might be equally useful for many other courses. (Author/BJG)",

A descriptive rating was used which consisted of seven items: (1) quantity of work, (2) quality of work, (3) accuracy of work, (4) job knowledge, (5) facility for work, (6) job versatility, and (7) all-around job ability. Statistical analysis of ratings were used to determine which aptitudes should be considered for inclusion in the battery. The objective was to develop a  battery of 2, 3, or 4 aptitudes with cutting scores at five point intervals at the point where about the same percent will meet the cutting scores as the percent placed in the high criterion group and which will maximize the relationship between the battery and the criterion.

Considered are the first four years, beginning in 1969 and ending in 1973. Data were gathered in the learning areas of science, citizenship and writing the first year; reading and literature the second year; social studies and music the third year; mathematics and science, for the second time, the fourth year, or 1972-73. In other words, change data were first reported in science and appeared in print in March 1975. Focusing only on sex differences, the results throughout the four age levels present questions and cause speculation about the educative process, the methods, time allotment and emphasis. Some may conclude that learning opportunities are not equal for  both boys and girls in the majority of schools. Some may conclude that interst is lower among boys than girls, or the reverse, in a particular learning area.

        "description":"A method of interpolation has been derived that should be superior to linear interpolation in computing the percentile ranks of test scores for unimodal score distributions. The superiority of the logistic interpolation over the linear interpolation is most noticeable for distributions consisting of only a small number of score intervals (say fewer than 10), particularly distributions that are relatively unskewed. Logistic interpolation thus should be useful in practical situations in which percentile ranks of number right scores must be estimated from very coarse groupings. The logistic method may also be applied to distributions of formula scores. However, the method should probably not be used for unsmoothed distributions of formula scores unless it is desired to smooth out  the peaks and valleys that result from rounding scores to integer values. The usefulness of logistic interpolation in computing percentile ranks for test score distributions is illustrated using three score distributions for item analysis samples from 1974 Law School Admissions Tests (LSAT).

This is just one of the possible forms of retrieval that may be employed. Other possibilities include serial recall, alphabetization, and imagery. To the extent that subjects employ such other strategies, correlations between organization indices and recall will be attenuated. This study explores this issue in two ways: first, about half the subjects (college students) were instructed to use a clustering strategy on a categorizable list. It was predicted that the correlation between clustering and recall would be higher for instructed than for non-instructed subjects. Secondly, subjects were asked to indicate the types of strategies they employed on a  post learning questionnaire. It was predicted that subjects in the instructed group would report fewer strategies. The relationship of other individual difference variables to organization and recall has had little examination. Organization has been found to vary with internality-externality, intellectual ability, with chronological age, and with impulsivity/reflectivity in children.

The goals of the project since late 1970 have been the achievement of functional literacy by disabled readers and nonreaders from grades 4 through 9 in Target Area schools and the development of an instructional program to make it possible. The newly developed Basic Skill Centers Reading Program provided all curricular materials. A multimedia approach was used which included teaching machines as well as individual instruction in related  classrooms. Individualized instruction was provided for 595 Title I students from grades 4-9 from 22 public schools. The students, who came from Title I Target Area schools, made grade equivalent gains well above what would have been expected for average children working at the reading levels of the Gates-MacGinitie Comprehension tests which were the measuring instruments. From 81 percent to 90 percent of the students made grade equivalent gains greater than expected for the pre- post-test span of six to seven months. (Author/DEP)",

Furthermore, 50 percent of the students were to show a gain of at least one grade equivalent month for each month on roll. The project featured the use of three-button response machines with both commercially and locally developed materials. Machines were housed in two large trailers which were located at Bryant and North secondary schools. Although students operated the machines and tested their own progress at the end of each  lesson, assistance was available from the certified reading teacher and paraprofessional who staffed each trailer. In 1973-74 gain scores were obtained from only 39 percent of the students because of pupil transfers, truancy, and faulty testing procedures. On the basis of the small number (136) of students tested, the project met its objectives in that 71 percent gained at the rate of 1.4 grade equivalent months for each month on roll and 76 percent gained one grade equivalent month for each month on roll. It was recommended that the Mobile Learning Centers' program be continued. (Author)",

The Component also funded a Coordinator of Desegregation Aides and a program of pre- and in-service training to help Aides reduce various types of conflict in schools, to improve interracial relations, and to act as liaisons between schools and the neighborhoods from which students were bussed. The objectives of the component were (1) prevention of major racial conflicts leading to school closing; (2) prevention of any increase in student-student conflict, as measured by suspension rates attributable to such conflicts in 1972-73 vs. 1973-74; (3) prevention of  any increase in student-teacher conflict, as measured by suspensions attributable to such conflicts; and (4) among White students, an increase in liking toward minority students, as measured by 1973 vs. 1974 administrations of the Student Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ). Objective 1 was met. Attainment of objectives 2, 3, and 4 could not be measured directly, because the relevant data were not available. This report, prepared by an independent evaluator, includes a biref description of the Aides and a discussion of the Aides' enacted role. Approximately two-thirds of the Aides represented racial minorities. Aides' most time-consuming activities were monitoring the halls and cafeteria, and talking with students and school staff about interpersonal conflict. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"The Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) Math Component was designed to improve mastery of math basic skills among the lowest achieving math students in 8 desegregating public junior high schools, junior-high-level grades in 6 nonpublic schools, and the ninth grade in one public high school. The Math Component consisted of 25 teacher aides, a part-time Math Coordinator, a curriculum of workbooks and tests of the Mathematics Basic Skills Development Project (MBSDP). The Math Component not only met, but surpassed its two objectives for mastery gain among remedial students. Objective I required 50 percent of ESAA students to maintain or improve their relative standing (percentile) among same-grade peers from fall to spring on the Minneapolis Arithmetic Computation Test (MACT). About  two-thirds of the students met this objective, and therefore had a spring percentile rank which was the same as, or higher than, their fall rank. The interpretation of these MACT gains is, however, clouded by a possible regression artifact. Objective II required 50 percent of the students to earn &quot;Mastery-Gain Points&quot; on MBSDP units at the rate of 40 per year. Again, two-thirds of the students met this objective. Recommendations for program improvement included: (a) a more efficient system for MBSDP materials distribution; (b) a formal commitment by participating schools to use ESAA aides, to use MBSDP materials, and to organize participating teachers and staff; (c) a full-time coordinator; and (d) careful planning to avoid unintended overrepresentation of racial minorities in the ESSA  Math Component.

The project was carried out in 10 (Broward County, Florida) elementary schools with the principals and six teachers from each school involved. The aims of the project were to provide a model for observation and get principals to use it. The model was used by 10 principals and 40 teachers for four months. A Status Questionnaire and Principals' Responsibility Rank Order Form, each developed by the author, produced no significant differences in attitudes, understanding, philosophies or reactions to classroom stimuli during observation. Scriven's Product Evaluation Profile provided the  assessment upon which conclusions were drawn about the model and overall project. Those people who reviewed and used the model support its implementation in other schools. (Author)",

        "description":"This report is an evaluation, using randomized experimental/control design, of a program involving negotiated contractual agreements (MAP) between prisoners and parole boards for specific parole dates contingent on performance in work, training and treatment activities. Contracts were generally for less than six months. Both feasibility and effectiveness of the model were analyzed. Reasonably high levels of acceptance were found among both prisoners and correctional officials in Wisconsin and Arizona; but in California, where the model involved direct release to a community correctional center, administrative obstacles hindered full implementation. Contract cancellations were almost always the result of disciplinary infractions rather than failure to satisfy work or training  requirements; prisoner-initiated withdrawals were rare. At release, prisoners judged that MAP had provided them greatest service through more certainty of release, facilitating planning outside prison, and the opportunity for earlier release, but that MAP had made less substantial differences in improving staff interest, access to prison programs, or operation of those programs.

The DAT program consisted of three stages: pretest orientation, testing, and interpretation. Specially designed materials were developed to assist counselors in each stage of the program. The DAT Interpretation booklet, specially developed by counselors in the Grossmont District, was the key to the program and tied the DAT scores, occupations, and sources of occupational information together to help  students reach career decisions. To determine the effectiveness of the program, a questionnaire was developed for the students, parents, and school members involved. Similar questions were included on each questionnaire in the same numbering sequence so that the responses of each group could be compared. The overall results of the questionnaire revealed that parents, students, and staff were positive about the program. The student information booklet is included. (Author/DEP)",

Despite restricting the sample to 1,633 university students who had progressed to junior standing in three years, HS GPA correlated as highly with cumulative college GPA as it does with freshman GPA in broad, national samples (.51). HS GPA was also the best predictor of graduation and credits earned, the other predictors augmenting only slightly in multiple correlation. Despite the social significance of graduation as a criterion of academic performance, it was only predicted poorly. Graduating major fields were more related to interests  than to aptitudes or HS GPA, but the extreme asymmetry of these criteria precluded good prediction in a practical sense. (Author)",

The emphasis was placed on the first source, the data obtained from the pupils of the student teachers. This source constituted a large volume of evaluation information that had to be processed through the use of automated procedures. Results of the project compared the several sources of data, and indicated the relative effectiveness of each. The feedback provided from the evaluation information was used to identify strengths and weaknesses of  individual student teachers, and cumulatively to evaluate the total student teacher program. Finally, by subdividing the data into categories relating to pupil characteristics, information was obtained about the effectiveness of student teachers in working with black, white, male and female students. As a result of this project, an automated system for gathering and analyzing a large amount of data is available to evaluate the effectiveness of student teaching. (Author)",

These analysis required that national surveys be written which would first give brief background information on existing provisions of pre-school education, underlying educational philosophies, and important sociological and historical factors. A description and discussion of different evaluation purposes and procedures, with special attention to new methods, were judged desirable. Major attention would be devoted to a review of evaluation studies, both those evaluating general pre-school curricula and those assessing more  specific programs, and taking into consideration process evaluation as well as short- and long-term effects. An attempt to judge strengths and weaknesses of current studies and to identify the main problems of evaluation research would be made. Possible guidelines for future evaluations were to be included. The national surveys generally followed this outline and were followed by a chapter in which the main trends reflected in the survey were summarized. Appended were special studies concerning the use of tests in evaluating pre-school educational programs, historical, social and cultural influences of pre-school evaluation, language programs, the evaluation of learning difficulties, the role of an evaluator, and an action research evaluation.

        "description":"Intended to help institutions place their entering students in regular freshman English composition courses, the Test of Standard Written English (TSWF) is most useful to colleges that also offer alternate courses designed to improve students' understanding of the material explored by the test. The Test of Standard Written English assesses students' levels of achievement in standard written English. By &quot;standard written English&quot; is meant the conventionalized, edited language of most college textbooks and the language in which students will probably be asked to write most papers in college. The test does not attempt to assess the ability of students to write &quot;creatively&quot; or to communicate informally as they would with friends. The Test of Standard Written English does not ask  students to do any writing. Rather, it presents a total of 50 multiple-choice questions of 2 basic types. Research comparing the scores of students on essays and multiple-choice questions shows that performance on questions of each type correlates highly with the ability to write standard written English. Sample questions as well as some preliminary findings are included in the document. (Author/DEP)",

        "description":"In 1970, at the request of the School Board, the Minneapolis Public Schools began a review of the school district's goals. Several approaches to establishing and revising goals were used. By January 1974, 1,506 people in Minneapolis had participated in the goals ranking procedure. This group included 630 community representatives, 569 school personnel, and 307 senior high school students. Agreement among the three groups--parents, school personnel, and students--was relatively high on the importance of the various goals. All three groups gave high rankings to the goals of reading and writing, pride in work, learning to respect and get along with people with whom we work and live, and developing good character and self-respect. The three groups gave relatively low priorities to  goals related to understanding skills of family living, understanding democratic ideas and ideals, understanding the ideas of health and safety, and gaining information needed to make job selections. A critique of this approach to goal ranking is given. Recommendations are made. (Author/DEP)",

Response is on a scale of from one, the poorest estimate of his ability to perform the task, to five, the highest estimate, on each of the relationships in question. After a readability test (Dale-Chall) was applied to each of the task areas, the scale was administered to 255 adolescents in grades seven through twelve in various suburban Chicago school districts. To derive validity data, the Pearson Product Moment Correlation was used to compare student to teacher  responses by relationships within each task. The mean of the teacher responses was used as the criterion against which student responses were tested to derive reliability. The Kuder-Richardson 21 formula was used resulting in a coefficient of .88. Moderate correlations of the kind derived in this study place the instrument well within the acceptable range insofar as validity is concerned. Reliability is also sufficiently high to give adequate assurance of consistency in subsequent administrations. (RC)",

Students were classified by their grade equivalent scores on each of the subtests. For each teacher in each of the grades, the scores were computed for each of their students. Upon grouping of students, each teacher received nine data points; mean gain scores for slow, average and fast students in reading, language and arithmetic. It was then determined which cluster of teachers was most effective with certain students and then to follow these teachers the  second year of the study and reinvestigate their effectiveness.

Furthermore, the type of measurement necessary to implement this approach can be made directly, without perturbing the network system under test. This technical note introduces the service concept and other background information necessary to understand the need for and use of the NMS. The fundamental distinction between service and internal efficiency is clarified, both in  general and in the environment of computer networks. A number of different measures of service are then discussed, followed by the presentation of several models of interactive use of networks. Then, the practical aspects of gathering data and applying this information to service measurement are reviewed, leading to a presentation of the NMS as it is implemented.

The comparison of the performance changes in similar types of students is illustrated with a ranking procedure according to results obtained. Although this system of analyzing the output of various remedial programs is more revealing than gross  comparisons, sole reliance upon this procedure for purposes of program accountability is not advocated. Measurement of student performance as analyzed by the proposed method, over a period of at least three years, should produce useful information upon which decisions for change can be made.

Regression models which account for achievement will result from the application of the methodology to two evaluative problems--one of curriculum comparison and another exploring the relationships between achievement and instructional processes in different schools implementing the same curriculum. Evaluative studies focusing on such questions should yield more information about pupil achievement than evaluations following other models when the following practices are reflected in the design and execution of the study: (1) several dimensions of the curriculum, including material and instructional process  aspects, are represented in the set of independent variables; (2) curricular and pupil variables are chosen whenever possible from those conceptualized by educational researchers and known to have a likely relationship to achievement; (3) direct measurements on all variables are incorporated in the data set rather than categorical representations of variables, as in a factorial design; (4) the shape as well as the location of the distributions of pupil achievement before and after instruction is represented in the analyses; (5) the techniques of the data analyst guide the model development process.

A hypothesis to explain this resistance is that an outside evaluator may face inherent difficulties in evaluating new social-political curricula such as women's studies because of the understandable suspiciousness of students, to which Grier and Cobbs' (1968) term &quot;cultural paranoia&quot; has been applied. Suggestions are offered to future evaluators of the social-political curricula that may help lessen this &quot;paranoia.&quot; (Author)",

Eight calculus classes were randomly selected. Each student completed a Texas A & M University (TAMU) student perceptionnaire the first day of class, envisioning having completed the course with it meeting the highest ideals of expectation. Using the same form, each student evaluated his instructor at the end of the semester. Significant differences (.01 level), between class means existed in the students' ideal perception, as well as in the students' evaluative perceptionnaire. The results indicate that research using student perceptionnaires as an independent variable should provide for preconceived expectations of  students.

Section I shows what BOER has done since 1968 in developing an education evaluation system. Thirteen documented examples are given to demonstrate samples of the understandings, insights, personnel, skills, media, data, objective measures, applications, systems, and other resources developed by BOER that can be integrated into almost any type of education evaluation system that is likely to emerge. Section II goes beyond the obvious requirements of more time, money, and manpower to make any such system workable by suggesting the need to coordinate existing departmental functions through a  number of organizational &quot;linking pins&quot; and the need to &quot;tool up&quot; existing resources to produce a departmentwide effort to bridge the evaluation gap in a humanistic fashion. Specific examples and directives are given to spell out exactly what is meant by &quot;linking pins&quot; and &quot;tooling up.&quot; The report concludes that evaluation is best achieved when the goals of a particular function or unit are expressed so clearly and succinctly that even a stranger walking in off the street can get a clear idea of what is going on and how well it is being done.

The five phases of the work plan were: (1) area meetings with Title I principals in Minneapolis North, East and West Areas, and from parochial schools, to determine interest in building level evaluation; (2) in-depth interviews with ESEA Title I principals who expressed interest in building level evaluation; (3) literature search for evaluation models  relating to building level evaluation; (4) preparation of an evaluation &quot;menu&quot; consisting of a simple, nontechnical pamphlet designed to stimulate discussion on building level evaluation; and (5) preparation of a final report of the project. Through a series of meetings, questionnaires, and interviews, it was possible to ascertain the interests of Title I principals in building level evaluation. Their main areas of concern, in order of frequency, were: (1) overall program effects on pupils; (2) attitudes of staff, pupils, and parents toward the program; and (3) best allocation of Title I funds.

At the same time, it highlights techniques and procedures that evaluators will find useful in planning and implementing evaluation studies. The objective of the guide is to contribute to the improvement  of career education efforts in local school districts. It strives to convey the importance and utility of program evaluation to the management of career education programs and to offer practical assistance in conducting such evaluations. This guide, in draft version, was published and disseminated for trial use. Hundreds of personnel provided feedback resulting in this final version.

Students can provide an important judgement or perspective on the suitability of the social environment as shaped by curriculum, instruction, and learning. This type of assessment holds promise for suggesting curriculum and instructional changes. A number of learning environment scales showing predictive validity from previous studies are utilized in four evaluation studies involving assessment of learning environments. The first two demonstrate instructional effects on the learning environment or classrooms, the third documents the assessment of a major  curriculum change through measurement of changes in the learning environment, and the fourth illustrates the sensitivity and usefulness of learning environment data to changes brought about by racial integration. All studies were done in public schools to answer specific problems. The four studies are discussed. (Author/RC)",

It is important that community opinion be obtained regarding the goals to ensure that they represent the interests of all involved in the educational process. Once the goals are established data can be gathered related to goal attainment in order to uncover discrepancies between desired conditions and the actual state of affairs. Two kinds of data should be used: \"hard\" data which includes measures such as test results, absentee rates, etc. and \"soft\" data which shows perceptions of people about the goals. The survey instrument should be designed to measure how important the goal is and the extent to which  it is being achieved. Reconciling the differences between the respondent groups as to where the greatest needs lie is usually followed by establishing priorities, the first step in a total program-development cycle. Performance objectives are then developed for each identified need, providing a basis for planning new programs. After programs are implemented and evaluated, a reassessment of the original needs can take place to see how much progress is being made and whether new priorities are needed. This is the cycle of program development and evaluation that the original needs assessment sets into motion. (RC)",

It is suggested that instructional materials be examined for the quality and completeness of their instructional design and their compatability (fit) with the curriculum design of the school. Second, a broader system is described which holds promise of analyzing, developing, and maintaining a reference file on the thousands of instructional products now on the market. Schools would be able to retrieve from the  reference file information on the particular instructional design constructs of materials.

Much consideration should be given to specifying job descriptions and requirements. The value of R and E competencies depends upon the specific tasks expected to be performed. A synthesis of the efforts of a task force of the American Educational Research Association to identify educational R and E competencies grouped under 25 general tasks is included in the document. In an effort to identify a  universe of evaluation competencies, Stufflebeam and Bunda produced approximately 250 items grouped under eight major categories. The categories and examples of corresponding self assessment items are also included. Several strategies for assessing whether an individual possesses the competencies needed for a specific job are considered.

        "description":"Although grades have been criticized for lack of reliability, end-of course grades and grade-point averages are reliable enough for most uses. The charge of unreliability applies only to grades on themes, tests, or other individual pieces of student work. On the other side of the controversy, grades have been said to be essential to the learning process because they provide for the evaluation of student performance. But performance is evaluated and its results reported to students independently of any grading system. The justification for grades must lie elsewhere. The critical issue in grading is the validity and usefulness of grades for the variety of purposes they are called on to serve--conveying information on student achievement, providing incentives for students to study,  serving as selection criteria, providing material for administrative records, helping in the evaluation and monitoring of the instructional process, and assisting students in educational and occupational planning. Until better information is available on the effectiveness of grades with respect to these various functions, the continued trading of unsupported assertions about them will be fruitless. New approaches to grading, such as contract and criterion-referenced grading, do not change the basic issues. (Author/RC)",

Currently, many school systems are reevaluating their criteria for school entry. In some school systems, chronological age appears to be the sole criterion; in others, social and learning readiness are also primary considerations. Frequently, educators turn to various testing procedures in order to make an objective determination of readiness. The 113 entries contained in this bibliography, chosen after careful review of items retrieved from a computer search of five large data bases (ERIC, National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Psychological Abstracts, Exceptional Children, and Dissertation Abstracts), should facilitate this process.

        "description":"To the data analyst, outliers can present both a problem and an opportunity. Stray or outlying observations can severly distort estimates of a distribution's central tendency (like the mean) and estimates of one variable's relationship to another (like the regression coefficient). These problems are frequent and serious, and as a result, increasing numbers of statisticians are developing new estimating procedures that are robust in the face of outliers. But outliers may also present an opportunity. An unusual observation may indicate the existence of a process not operating in the rest of the distribution. In education, for example, an outlier may turn out to be an unusually effective school, perhaps one worthy of emulation throughout the educational system. Finding the best by  locating outliers may be particularly important in the evaluation of public policies. Can one find exceptionally good police forces and study the causes for their success? What about outstanding rural development projects, exceptional hospitals, and unusally effective manpower training programs? Indeed, one may suggest a worthwhile general rule for policy evaluations: For exceptions to the general rules, include a search for unusual performers. (Author)",

        "description":"Current practices and controversial issues pertaining to student evaluation of instruction are briefly reviewed and followed by a discussion of the application of formative evaluation to this endeavor. Two reasons are generally given for conducting teacher evaluations by students: identification of good teachers and instructional improvement. Summative evaluation appears to provide the identification but does not appear to improve instruction. The use of summative evaluation alone ignores the dynamic and process characteristics of teaching and makes teaching seem to be a static product which is unchanging and unidimensional. A formative approach appears best suited to provide information on improving instruction and should meet these three criteria: (1) it should be specific to a  lesson, objective, or teaching behavior; (2) it should be conducted frequently; and (3) it should yield information which may foster the improvement of instruction during the teaching process. Such evaluation must be an integral part of the teaching process. In this way a closed feedback loop is created wherein information may be continually recycled. Formative evaluation should be embedded in a series of comprehensive and systematic procedures designed to evaluate instructional quality. Using formative evaluation by students effectively and in concert with other forms and sources of information should help teachers answer many questions about their teaching effectiveness and ultimately result in teaching improvement.

        "description":"In 1970, the Illinois Legislature passed bills requiring that elementary school districts institute procedures to identify and treat preschool children who, without such intervention, would not progress satisfactorily in a normal school environment. Efforts in this regard resulted in the screening instrument called Developmental Indicators for the Assessment of Learning (DIAL). Despite initial administrations of the battery and several research efforts, information regarding the reliability and predictive validity of the DIAL was insufficient to promote its general use for preschool screening. This project was funded in an effort to supply the missing data and to address additional questions. The major activities and findings of the project are described in the second section of  the report. These concern the content validity of the DIAL as judged by consulting experts in child behavior and development, the predictive validity of the DIAL, the reliability of DIAL administration and scoring procedures, and various recommended modifications of the DIAL. The final section of the report summarizes conclusions and outlines recommendations concerning subsequent steps in the development and use of the DIAL. (RC)",

The instrument used to retrieve the data was administered to 112 teachers in the three Dona Ana (N.M.) county school districts. Six constructs resulted from the factor analysis of the instrument, namely, achievement, time orientation, acculturation, family identification, economic, and religiousity. Reliability of factors was established through Cronbach's Co-efficient Alpha, and item reliability was obtained through item analysis. Forty of the original 50 items were used to compare the groups on each of the six dimensions. Using ethnicity, age, and teaching experience as variables, t tests were computed to test for significant differences. Differences with  respect to ethnicity were found in four of the constructs: achievement, time orientation, acculturation, and religiousity. Age and teaching experience were not variables influencing the differences in attitude between the two teacher groups. Educational importance, implications and recommendations based on the findings of the study conclude the paper. (Author)",

        "description":"From an individual's viewpoint, it is argued, culture establishes a meaningful context of social institutions, ecological practices, and personal rules of conduct which provide each group member with a blueprint for social existence. But, behavior is also conditioned by unconscious internalized patterns, which tend to be accepted by everyone as normal facets of \"human nature\", thereby originating the false premise on which so much crosscultural miscommunication is based--the belief that behavioral deviance must be contrary to nature. Men who live and work in the same community tend to develop certain common features. In the area of intercultural relations the importance of assessing accurately this elusive, but powerful, activator of human behavior cannot be overemphasized.  Misunderstandings between members of different societies are apt to occur as a result of the speakers' compulation to communicate with each other through different viewpoints based on variant mental models of reality. If a Frenchman may be seen as cognitive-oriented, for example, and if an American may be characterized as psychomotor-oriented, then a Spanish speaking individual must be depicted as affective-oriented. One may easily predict that any confrontation between members of these three cultures is apt to generate a host of misunderstandings. (Author/JM)",

Besides these specific verbal styles, there are other verbal comminication patterns prevalent in black culture such as inversion and loudtalking which are included. Major kinesic patterns (body language) found in black culture are described, along with their significance in an instructional situation. These include eye movements (eye-aversion, eye-rolling, and other uses of  eye-movement), hand movement, and walking (the limp stance, pimp strut or pimp walk, black walk, and rapping). In order to achieve an effective level of communication with blacks, the white middle-class teacher is recommended to stop believing that, and acting as if, all black students are inferior or culturally deprived; and to stop believing that, and acting as if, black students must be made over into the superior image of the white middle class.

For example, American culture tends to value time to the point of obsession, whereas Hispanic cultures subordinate temporal considerations to interpersonal relationships. The resulting clash which will occur between representatives of divergent cultures may then be predicted accurately. It should convince teachers, it is argued, of the necessity to adopt a flexible frame of reference and an attitude of suspended judgment in dealing with any crosscultural circumstances. What is needed, is the ability to look at the world through someone else's eyes and to perceive it in the manner determined by the viewer's own cultural  filter. Such a skill is simply a matter of acquiring the needed competences in cross cultural understanding. Without this empathy for other cultures, the effectiveness of an adult educator will be considerably reduced, as a result of restrictive communication at the cognitive, as well as the affective and psychomotor levels. The task of the adult educator is not so much that of \"changing\" the learners' values as that of helping him (1) acquire an additional and different set of values, and (2) learn to behave differentially according to context.

The pairings and rezoning as finally ordered were fully implemented by the District at the beginning of the 1971-72 school year. There was, it is asserted, a failure of pairing to maintain an acceptable level of integration over its five-year history, and community dissatisfaction with the pairings. A community Task Force was appointed to develop an alternative to the pairings. The Task Force presented its report to the Board of Education on February 24, 1975 in which it recommended the use of magnet  school programs to replace the pairings and to supplement the integration efforts of the District. The Defendant Board of Education on March 10, 1975, unanimously voted to implement the magnet school concept and appointed an Administrative Task Team for Quality Integrated Education. The Board adopted the Administrative Task Team Report on May 12, 1975, and instructed the school attorneys to proceed with the filing of this motion to amend this Court's Amended Decree of September 18, 1970.

The main issue is said to be whether blacks pay higher prices and/or consume different residential packages than whites as a result of racial discrimination and segregation. Results indicate that blacks purchase different residential packages and pay different prices for the attributes contained in their respective packages. These differences are considered to result from whites' higher income levels, different housing preferences, and willingness to pay a premium for housing in white neighborhoods. Results of comparisons of blacks living in all black neighborhoods with blacks living in mixed neighborhood indicate that the former purchase smaller quantitities of residential  services, but pay higher prices. These differences are seen to result from variations in the elasticity of the supply of housing for black occupancy and from variations in the residential packages consumed. Since this analysis focuses on the outcome of the residential market transaction process, how the results obtained can be translated into policy programs is said to be unclear. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This publication provides a source of information and research to the people interested in and responsible for American Sponsored Overseas Schools (ASOS). The first section includes an overview of six major categories of research, namely: school setting, school institutionalization; school organization and administration, school program, personnel, and pupils. Each category is treated by three approaches: (a) one or more vignettes to provide fictionalized but illustrative examples of the human element in the ASOS; (b) sets of the author's premises and examples which illustrate the ambiance in which the schools exist, and (c) a narrative providing a conspectus of the included research about the ASOS as related to the major category. The second section discusses the research  matrix, said to provide a ready reference to many of the common problems and potentials in the ASOS. Included here are the coding system, regional code, simplified coding system, matrix outline, school setting, institutionalization, organization and administration, school program, personnel and pupils. This model classifying pertinent research is considered to provide the serious researcher not only with a means of classifying existing research but also for identifying the voids in the research base.

        "description":"This document provides a detailed discussion of two laws and three court cases affecting the education of non-English speaking children. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 addresses equal education opportunities for all Americans. The Four Point Memorandum issued by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare specifically deals with discrimination and denial of services on the basis of national origin. The Lau vs. Nichols legal case was filed in San Francisco to protect the rights of Chinese speaking students who were not receiving adequate education because of their ability to speak English. This landmark case in the movement for equal educational opportunity for non-English speaking people considered to have spurred bilingual education programming. The Serna vs.  Portales case continued the push for bilingual education by directing its efforts to Spanish-speaking persons in New Mexico. A court evaluation of the merits of bilingual/bicultural education concluded that (1) bilingual education was the best way of meeting the needs of the Spanish-speaking children, and (2) ordered an expansion of these services. The Aspria et al vs. the Board of Education case was brought to court in the interests of youngsters born in Puerto Rico or recent adult immigrants who are also parents. The Aspira decision led to a consent decree signed by both parties to provide bilingual programming for New York City children needing help in language. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"The nature of institutions of higher education and their interaction with the larger society is discussed. The societal environment in which the university operates is said to be characterized by national withdrawal from the goals of equal opportunity and from humane principles that make up the basis for a viable educational system. In light of recent economic and fiscal problems, restricted access to college education for blacks and minorities is said to be occurring. Two important facts about the black college experience are said to be the vital role played by traditionally black institutions and the equally important role played by public institutions. Although the dismantling of dual educational systems is seen as necessary, ways to preserve valuable attributes of those  institutions that have historically served the minority community within the framework of integration need to be developed. The concept of integration is said not to be at issue here, but the manner in which integration is conducted. Integration that becomes synonymous with the destruction of historic black institutions and black community strengths is not accepted. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This paper comments on a few of the intricate relationships between the dollar, the degree, the society, and the school. Education and economics are said to interact in three ways: on an elementary level of funding an educational system, the influence of economic factors on individuals who are consumers of education, and education viewed as an economic subsystem of the society. These three issues are then considred from a black minority point of view. The necessity for federal financial intervention at the elementary, secondary, and higher education level that is both more extensive and more sharply targeted than has been the case is suggested. The need to get more federal dollars into the hands of the people who need them is sharply stressed. Lastly, it is stated that any  consideration of economic barriers to educational opportunity must concern itself with basic societal changes that include a full employment policy, a replacement of the welfare system with an economic security plan, the improvement of schools that serve minorities, and special programs of compensatory education.

Instrumentation for assessing program implementation at both the selection and  observation stages of the study has been produced. The sampling and selection design was structured to sample systematically along all basic dimensions including the instructional setting dimension. The use of both the California Achievement Test and selected items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress are recommended as criterion achievement measures. The analytic procedure recommendation for the first study question is a two by two factorial design employing univariate and multivariate analysis of covariance (controlling for IQ and socioeconomic status) on reading, mathematics, and student perceived classroom climate.

Attention is directed at a group of salient assumptions underlying social science investigations, namely: (1) the universality of majority culture models of attitude structure; (2) sociolinguistic and linguistic styles in black communities; (3) the utility of majority culture cognitive frameworks to understanding black attitudes toward sensitive topics; and, (3) the adequacy of traditional survey research procedures to garner valid samples in urban black communities. Research pursued during summer 1975 involved eliciting a domain of thoughts about television in open-ended interviews with a cross-section of black respondents, refining that  to a number of categories, and construction of an attitude scale reflecting those categories. Experienced black interviewers approached black residents of San Jose, East Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Oakland, California, in a variety of settings to ensure a mix of relevant and &quot;irrelevant&quot; factors. The interviewers attempted to structure the intercept as a conversation, so that the black respondents would feel free to utilize a similar communication style. The emphasis was on generating as much information about the cognitive categories people utilize to think about television as possible. (Author/JM)",

Instead, the approach suggested here determines the test score gain a pupil achieves from the beginning to the end of the year, with all of the pupil gain scores of a single compensatory teacher being compared to those presented in the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT) Gains Tables. These tables present typical gains that should be made on a particular subtest of the MAT, according to the grade level of the pupil and according to whether the pupil's pre-test achievement level is high, average or low. These tables differ from the norm tables provided in the test publisher's manual in that both the pre and  post-test were administered to the same pupils to obtain the gain scores. The tables have two major limitations: (1) they are only useful for pupils' test results who are in grade levels 2-8; and, (2) the interval between testing is short. Implementation considerations and implementation procedures are included in the discussion. MAT Gains Tables are presented in this publication. (Author/AM)",

This question is held to have particular relevance in Connecticut since two-thirds of the state's compensatory programming is aimed at improving reading and math skills. Chapters focus on background and purpose, attitude responses of pupils, reading and math gains of pupils, combining attitude and achievement of pupils, additional findings, discussion of results, and value of the evaluation design used in the study. Findings indicate a low and non significant association between pupil attitude and achievement test results. Evidence of this study is considered  to indicate that school districts spend more of their compensatory dollars to help those eligible children who are furthest behind in achievement. Other findings showed that reading gains equaled expectations, that poor children achieve less, and that concentration was least in large schools. More emphasis is said to be needed in selecting those most in need of help. Results are reported in the form of tables listing the outcomes of statistical analyses, together with brief descriptions.

        "description":"The educational complex is seen to act as a subsystem of the overall societal system whose main function is said to lie in the socialization of individuals for membership in the larger society. The socialization process, including mastery of norms, beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral patterns of the society, are seen to be permeated with institutionalized racism. As a vehicle of the socialization process, the educational system is considered to incorporate racist norms, standards, behavioral patterns, morals, and sense of social position in such a manner that the socializee is unaware of his absorption of a curriculum that is fundamentally racist. While American institutions contribute to institutionalized racism, the focus on the educational system has particular relevance since  minority groups, ethnic minorities, and poverty groups attach high significance to education, particularly as the road to upward mobility. The major conclusion formulated from the evidence presented is that a pervasive and effective institutional racism permeates the entire education system. (Author/AM)",

        "author":["Peters, Marie Ferguson"],
        "description":"This review examines some of the basic sociological, psychological, and philosophical issues of childhood socialization, and briefly discusses some of the significant influences which impinge upon all children as they grow and develop within their society, sub-culture, and family. The stated purpose of the review is to provide a perspective for examining the basic assumptions which underly current research on parent-child relationships within the black family. Research in the 70's concerning the socialization of black children that also addresses various aspects of the influences in the black child's development is also examined. Research in general is said to be characterized by poor methodology, to ignore black families, and to concentrate on the black poor, father-absent  families, the mother-child dyad, and to have an ethnocentric approach. The literature is seen to be discussed in terms of popular but misleading assumptions that seem to be explicitly involved when hypothesis are made concerning socialization patterns within black families. What are stated to be more promising approaches are also pointed out and two recent research projects are described in detail. In conclusion, the paper suggests a black child family-society interaction model said to be useful in the conceptualization of the socialization process, policy making, and program planning.

Numerous findings descriptive of the Boston public school system, its facilities, student body, curriculum, administration and the like, are considered to appear in the plan itself. The memorandum of decisions contained here deals mainly with the reasons for particular features of the desegregation plan that have been of major concern to the parties. Major headings include an introduction, prior proceedings, findings and conclusions, plans submitted by the parties, general principles governing remedy, school districts, guidelines for assigning students, examination of schools,  school closings and capacities, magnet schools and programs, citizens participation, monitoring, reporting and conclusion. The plan and the demands of its implementation on the people of Boston are seen to be as diverse and complex as the needs of the city's schools. The student desegregation plan is also included in this document. Its major categories are: the community school districts, the citywide school districts, vocational education, guidelines for assigning students, transportation, cost considerations, citizen participation, monitoring, reporting timetable for implementation, further remedial orders, and retention of jurisdiction.

Four categories, those of physical growth, social growth, emotional growth, and development of communication skills, are said to have been selected in an effort to promote total development. Each category is described in terms of desirable concepts, along with accompanying or matching behavioral objectives. Each child may not be ready to perform the stated behavioral objective, even by the end of the school year. Some objectives are more appropriate later in the school year. However, these are included as goals around which the learning program is developed. The behavioral objectives for a given concept are sequenced in order of difficulty. A brief introduction to each component is  provided. Since room arrangement is said to be closely allied with the instructional program, a basic list of equipment, a sample floor plan, and suggestions for room arrangement are also included. Parent participation activities which are said to be essential to the success of this program are described. To provide an example of a typical daily program for four year olds, a case study is presented. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This study successively tests simple modeling, normative influence, and conditional positive modeling hypotheses about the working mother's effect on her daughter's work orientation. Four hypotheses are postulated and tested separately by race to examine possible racial differences. The most complex hypothesis is that if modeling is conditioned by other characteristics of the mother than those considered, that modeling will be heightened by the following two characteristics: increasing the work orientation of girls with working mothers, and decreasing the work orientation of girls with nonworking mothers. It is also hypothesized that white girls' work orientation is more likely than black girls' to be a function of commitment to the exclusive homemaker role. Data from a 1973  urban population of black and white high school girls and a sample of their mothers revealed no evidence of either simple positive modeling or normative influence, but simple negative modeling occurred for black girls whose mothers worked in blue collar jobs. Conditional positive modeling is evident for all girls. Findings are contrasted with those from studies of male achievement socialization, which are said to stress the importance of direct normative influence. (Author/AM)",

Sections deal with evaluation sample selection; district, community, and school characteristics; student and family characteristics; resource allocations; funds and services; basic program desegregation; student gains in achievement test scores; exploratory analyses; and summary of results. Two important facts are stressed: (1) that this report deals only with the first year of implementation, and (2) that because of difficulties in obtaining outcome data that might more directly reflect desegregation activities in the first year of the study, the  present report is based on a single set of criterion measures - achievement test scores in reading and mathematics. Findings indicate that: (1)the assumption on which the legislation was based is, indeed, associated with educational disadvantages; and (2)that students in minority-isolated schools and many students in desegregated schools have needs associated with their educational and economic disadvantagement that are directly related to the objectives of the program.

Their approach to the problem is said to have evolved through three interlocking stages: increasing the supply of housing through support for technical advisory services to non-profit groups engaged in building low and moderate-rental housing for the poor, minorities, and the elderly in both urban and rural areas; the support of open housing through assistance to groups that spearhead the fight against residential segregation; and inner-city renewal. Topics addressed are: housing development, the role of nonprofit organizations, the housing packagers, rural housing, state housing corporations, new options in public housing, open housing, the public policy arena, equal  housing, integrating apartments, open housing in Connecticut, the Denver experience, rebuilding the slums, the New Detroit Committee, and new directions in housing. An appendix includes grants in housing from 1958-1970. Among new programs in the housing field are those considered to be designed to improve the existing inventory of housing through better management and maintenance and by extending individual and cooperative home ownership. The Foundation is also reported to be working on housing within the framework of community development. (Author/AM)",

Both educational and practical benefits are claimed for this project. Data will be collected for a small section of the city. Generally such data are not available in published reports since data collection units usually are not at such a fine scale. The nature of the data it is proposed here to collect differs from that available in the census and most other published reports. The ethnic map of local areas will be of value, it is argued, since it will not only portray the ethnic make-up of the area but also will show the degree to which spatial clustering has been  maintained. The monograph is divided into five sections. The first is an outline of the rationale for conducting a community survey. The second, a theory section, focuses on ethnicity, neighborhood, and community. The third section outlines methodological considerations for mapping and surveying a community. Suggestions for ethnic research projects in the Detroit area are then discussed. Finally, a sources section follows, with references and information related to Detroit ethnic bibliography sampling, questionnaire design and interviewing technique, and data and agency sources.

        "description":"Addressing the issue of desegregation and its implications for cultural pluralism in the school curriculum, this report states that it is in the desegregated setting that the institution through its officials, staff, and curriculum can interact with all children in a manner which demonstrates respect for student and his heritage, recognizes the needs of students, facilitates the acquisition of survival skills, and encourages individual and group problem solving to improve conditions of life for all persons. A brief discussion focusing on the rationale for cultural pluralism in the school curriculum provides comments by persons who have researched school curricula and found them inadequate relative to their treatment of Third World people. A listing of what some state groups are  doing about cultural pluralism is provided. A series of recommendations for developing a curriculum that speaks to the realities of cultural pluralism are listed. In addition to modifying the instructional material, other facets of the school environment that must be present if cultural pluralism is to be realized are noted. Some of the possible strategies that the educational units or institutions might employ in institutionalizing the recommendations are delineated. (Author/AM)",

The interdisciplinary nature of ethnic studies is noted: that they must draw on many disciplines within the social sciences and humanities. And as with all inter- interdisciplinary programs, it must be established that the combined multi-academic program is as scholarly and strict as its individual parts; strong scholarly work in ethnic studies is needed. Multicultural ethnic institutes should be created which would function as resource centers within schools, subject to the rigorous criteria of other academic disciplines. The \"outreach\" responsibilities of ethnic studies center -- to work with local ethnic communities and  to provide adult education -- are emphasized. Discussing the philosophy behind ethnic studies, European history and the origin of humanities are drawn on in the second section. The third section of this working paper includes some sample courses in the various studies, submitted by professors who have taught such classes. In addition, the fourth section gives a listing of ethnic studies resource centers. There is also an extensive bibliography, categorized by ethnic groups, appended to the report. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The present study states as its purpose the delineation of everyday transactions with the environment of a group of children observed longitudinally in their own homes and neighborhoods from age one to three. This research is considered to have been designed to answer: (1) what types of experiences are intellectually valuable to the young child; (2) whether and when it is important that he construct such experiences for himself as opposed to receiving them from his environment; and, (3) whether and when it is important that he encounter such experiences in context in which he relates to the human in contrast to the non-human environment. Topics addressed are: sources and situations associated with intellectual experiences, the interactor as a source of the child's intellectual  experiences, television as a source of the child's intellectual experiences, intellectual competence (tested and spontaneous), the interactor as participator in the child's intellectual experiences, and the process of interaction. It is concluded from the supporting data that the class of intellectually valuable experiences that are observed in this study are more deeply implicated in the child's development of intelligence insofar as this is measured by IQ than other types of everyday experiences, and that it is the incidence and sources of the former type of experience that must be examined in detail if one is to understand how everyday experience becomes the basis for his development of intellectual competence.

The training program is considered to be designed to increase self-awareness of the multicultural community, and awareness of local and nonlocal resources related to ethnicity. It also provides an introductory  historical and social perspective from an academic standpoint through a series of readings and discussions on ethnic studies, and introduces activities relevant to the development of this discipline in the classroom. The basic scope of the training program is five workshop sessions. Although said to be designed to be carried out in five sessions, the activities and materials can be presented in either fewer compressed presentations, or additional sessions, according to the needs and convenience of those involved.

The stated purpose of the first paper was to describe the development of the &quot;Cultural Attitude Scales&quot; (CAS), a pictorial measure designed to assess attitudes toward the black, Puerto Rican, and Anglo-American cultures. The development of the CAS encompassed: (1) the derivation of an item pool from interviews and discussions with parents, pupils, and teachers of each of the target cultural groups; (2) systematic selections and selections by a group of adolescent student judges representing each of the target cultures; and (3) item analysis based on the responses of 336 students in the elementary grades representing these three cultures. The end product was a scale of 15 pictorial items for each of the three cultures with Likert-type response  options in the form of faces. The stated purpose of the second paper was to report a study designed to determine the reliability and validity of the CAS using a sample of 330 Anglo-American, black American, and Puerto Rican pupils in grades 1-6. Evidence of construct validity was revealed in the pattern of the mean scores for each cultural group in the same sample of pupils. Evidence of criterion validity were revealed in terms of its statistically significant relationship to the results of a teacher rating scale (r=.32 to .46). (Author/JM)",

Results of the enrichment courses fall in the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains. Gains such as increased knowledge of jobs available and training necessary for each, improved peer relationships, and development of marketable skills are reported. Program content is said to be determined through a needs assessment which takes place at each center. Performance objectives are written for the programs once needs and priorities are established. This area is stated to be of greatest potential  for the centers. Although some centers state objectives in limited, observable, and behavioral terms, other centers state their objectives in non-behavioral terms establishing no definite criteria for measuring the impact of these programs. Another area of potential for the entire system is said to be that of instructional activities and methods. The incorporation of a more comprehensive system of describing instructional activities and methods is seen as a way to remedy the situation. Additional areas of possible common interest for all the centers are said to be systems used for scheduling and patterns of organization. (Author/AM)",

Section I compares the definitions of the poverty area used by this survey with that of the Survey of Economic Opportunity (SEO). Section II examines their implications for truncation bias. In Section III, the CES data are described and the effect of education on the earnings of poverty-area residents is estimated. It is shown that for the sample under consideration, education has a significant impact on the economic welfare of both whites and blacks despite the presence of truncation bias. It is concluded that to say that education and training are profitable investments is not to say that they are the optimal investment. The large impact  of industry on employment in the regression analysis is considered to suggest that policies that alter labor demands may yield higher return to poverty-area residents than policies that emphasize education and training.

Child testing, observations of test-taking behavior, mother-child observations, and home interviews are described. Section 4 offers recommendations for future inquiry. Recommendations are divided into two general areas. Firstly, project  reports are outlined, and then directions for future inquiry are suggested. Among the former are patterns of learning characteristics in each ethnic group, patterns of family socialization, mother-child interaction, and language behavior of child. Among the latter are a replication of the present study, studies of learning characteristics, studies of Asian American families, and the relationships between verbal and nonverbal assessments of competence.

        "description":"This paper reports work in progress concerning student desegregation among elementary and secondary schools in districts regardless of the source of segregation, and between school districts for the period of 1968-73. The data sources, the statistical reports collected by DHEW, are stated to allow for a detailed statistical analysis of the status and trends in school segregation by race throughout the U.S. First, the state of racial integration among schools within a district in 1968 is examined, followed by an examination of the changes that occurred over the period 1968-1973. The differential changes that occurred over that period of time in different kinds of school settings--in different regions of the country, in school districts of different sizes, and in particular large  cities--is seen to be of special interest. Data indicate that, by 1968, desegregation of schools was a far from accomplished task in cities and towns of all sizes in the South, but that in the largest cities, it was equally high in many places where dual school systems had never existed: yet the trend for the next four years tends toward desegregation. It is concluded (1) that the emerging problem with regard to school desegregation is the problem of segregation between central city and suburbs, and (2) that current means by which schools are being desegregated are intensifying, rather than reducing the problem.

This paper focuses on the discussions of HEOP's organizational format, materials, innovative educational techniques, and philosophies or theories of learning which have significant impact on student performance. A secondary focus is the identification of studies that have been done on the parts of the HEOP programs, individual counseling, tutoring, testing, and other supportive services aimed at academic development of the students. This report also identifies evaluative studies of Higher Educational Opportunity Programs which explore the degree of success and  effectiveness of the program. Bibliographies are provided for sections on curriculum and instruction, tutoring, counseling, testing, and instructional program policies. The dilemma for these programs is held to be in how to produce substantial evidence of their contribution when their funding does not provide for this sort of research. (Author/AM)",

Major problems that arise when examining the urban school administrator from a black perspective are: the brief tenure of superintendents and other administrators, the urban school administration's reluctance to change, the lack of black people serving on school boards, and the lack of faith in education. Among the challenges and needs of urban school administrators listed are: (1) quality of education to enable all students to meet and deal with society; (2) a redirection of the  school's focus from tax burdens to useful tools for the populace; (3) a provision of quality education for all students; (4) to instill in students interest in education; (5) to issue self-challenges; (6) to eliminate segregation; and, (7) to recognize that the present educational efforts are dysfunctional. Issues such as the future of the predominantly black urban center, black education in the North, urban school problems as compared with rural or community systems, federal financing, and revamping of the school curricula are discussed.

It is hypothesized that professionals representing various disciplines related to the problems of deprivation as perceived here would substantiate a number of points -- that the syndrome of deprivation and disadvantagement is universal and affects all in general and greater in specific groups of individuals within a given time and space, and that stylistic features displayed by individuals under deprived conditions are universal. Issues  discussed in sensorium are: labeling, types of learning; disadvantaged children; teaching styles and methodologies; effect of the schools on children; language/linguistics; community; school relevancy; segregation/integration; children's growth and development; dominance theory in sociology change within the schools; the ideal school; homogeneous/heterogeneous school groupings; observation of the child; evaluation of the child; evaluation of school programs; teacher preparation and behavior; and survival and institution.

The ideas and values underlying the development of the voucher school, the problems of operationalization, as these are said to influence the measures used in the research cited, are discussed. The paper also deals with (1) some of the Alum Rock data on rates of parental participation, where the indices of participation include both school and non-school context and rely on both attitudinal and reported behavioral measures of participation; and (2) some correlates of parental participation such as education, ethnicity, income, and occupation in the voucher schools,  drawing inferences about the implications of these varying rates of participation on the educational processes shaped by the voucher school system. The pattern of findings is said to be interpretable in terms of social class differences, parental participation being of key importance in the voucher school plan. The intentions of the planners of the voucher school system are considered not to have been fulfilled in the Alum Rock school system by the time of its first evaluation. (Author/AM)",

Among the recommendations made are that formal attitudinal measures be employed to assess the amount and degree of growth for future planning and record keeping purposes; that an initial in-depth case conference for the new learner be attended by all staff assigned to the enrollee; that periodic case conferences be held to ascertain what has or has not been accomplished and to plan and set future goals for the youth, particularly those that are most in need of extensive assistance; and that black and Spanish-speaking tutors be hired.

A summary of the procedure involved with each instrument is discussed.  The results of the study indicate an overall high risk percentage of approximately 22 percent which is considered to approximate theoretical high risk percentages of potential learning problems specified by professionals in the field of special education.

Tabular sections on student and teacher data include objectives, together with the evaluation technique used to assess each objective and the results obtained. A subsequent section discusses the effects of the project on the clientele. Factors which facilitate the accomplishment of the objective are cited. Two major projects are said to have been met: staff training and the provision of circle  discussion activities for all middle school students. Statistical data are seen to indicate significant gains and/or trends in the areas of personal inventory, self-perception, desirable self-traits, personal adjustment, and school related self-esteem.

        "author":["Beller, Andrea H."],
        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to estimate the effects of enforcement of Title VII to determine whether and to what extent it has helped to achieve the elimination of employment discrimination. The model developed in this paper is considered to depart from those of previous Title VII studies in two ways. First, it incorporates the effects of the law's enforcement on nonrespondent covered firms in addition to the effects on respondent firms. Second, it analyzes separately the effects of enforcement of the law's employment and wage provisions. Primary data sources are a matched sample of covered firms, 1966-70, and the U.S. Censuses. Evidence is said to suggest that, in the aggregate, from its inception through fiscal year 1970, enforcement of Title VII at best left the economic  position of black males unchanged and at worst caused it to deteriorate. While enforcement of the employment provision increased relative employment in covered firms and relative employment and wages in the economy, enforcement of the wage provision had precisely the opposite effects. The latter effects appear to have dominated the former, although the net negative impact is, in general, statistically insignificant. Two possible directions for enforcement given are: (1) concentrating limited resources on enforcement of the employment provision, and, (2) accompanying enforcement of the wage provision by strict and extensive controls on minority employment.

        "description":"This report contains information on the constitutional decision to prevent and eliminate racial and ethnic segregation in the State of California. The implications of the California Supreme Court decision on the constitutional duty of schools to eliminate segregated education are presented, along with the State Board of Education declaration of policy regarding de facto segregation. Six characteristics resulting from the efforts of the Equal Educational Opportunities Commission to assist the State Board to implement the policy are listed. Among them are that academic achievement of all ethnic groups will meet or exceed accepted national norms, that self concept and attitudes toward school and learning will be equally positive among all ethnic groups, that status roles and  participation of pupils, school staff, and parents in the life of the school will be comparable among all racial and ethnic groups, and that school staffs will be representative of all racial and ethnic groups. Listed among the conclusions are that integration schools and integrated education programs are essential elements of quality education, that integration cannot be achieved without desegregation, that the process of achieving integrated education is not quick, easy or painless, and that further delay in the development of affirmative steps will lead to additional problems.

        "description":"This document presents in graphic form a system of interaction analysis, in which methods are presented for the teacher to study his teaching behavior in terms of the behavioral objectives he has established for himself. A summary of categories of interaction analysis is provided, which are labeled as indirect and direct influence. The former includes a teacher's acceptance of feelings, teacher's praise or encouragement, acceptance or use of students' ideas, and teacher's use of questions. The latter involves lectures, teacher's use of directions, criticism or justification of teacher authority, student-talk (response and initiation), and silence or confusion. Charts for plotting classroom interaction with examples used to illustrate student talk following teacher talk and  teacher talk consisting of lectures are provided. Among areas identified to differentiate types of teacher response are: indirect teacher talk, direct teacher talk, student talk, silence or confusion, acceptance of feelings, offering praise, using student ideas, giving criticism, lengthy student responses, and teacher responding to termination of student talk with direct influence. That there is no single standard of what is best in assessing interaction is stressed. (Author/AM)",

A general synopsis of Chapter 71A of the Act includes what a program in transitional bilingual education consists of, who has the right to it, and what the obligations of the local school committees and the department of education are. The five sections of that chapter, declaration of policy, amendment of chapter, authorization for reimbursement, establishment of bureau of transitional bilingual education-its powers and duties, and repeal of Chapter 852, are outlined and briefly discussed. Criteria set down to determine bilingual teacher competencies in language skills and culture include requirements of  foreign service institute native or bilingual proficiency rating, requirements of foreign service institute minimum professional proficiency in English, and requirements of culture competency in English and other languages. Approval procedures are also outlined. Several guidelines for parental involvement in transitional bilingual education programs are provided that address the &quot;when&quot;, &quot;how&quot;, &quot;why&quot;, &quot;who&quot;, and &quot;what&quot; of the programs. Appendixes include parent participation regulations. (Author/AM)",

The study team consisted of five members who conducted structured and unstructured inverviews with a sampling of Central administrative staff, school faculty and staff, students, parents and community leaders, and observed both formally in eleven school settings. Observations in class rooms, study halls, lunch rooms, hallways, etc. were complemented by group as well as individual interviews, it is stated. The instruments used for data collection were structured to more readily ensure consistency and  adequacy of reporting. In summarizing key factors that have made for successful desegregation in the school district, it is stated that such components as communications skills among teachers and support staff, more flexible academic program, promotion of the team-teaching method, and an increasing willingness of teachers to be open with each other and to deal with conflict were mentioned most often by respondents.

In addition to interviews, the team made formal and informal observations in eight of the districts' 26 schools. A total of 12 instruments were used to insure consistency in the collection of data across the districts' schools. This study, it is stated, does not attempt to evaluate the long range effects of desegregation on the populace.

As a  continuation of a series of studies on school desegregation in the United States a team of four members from Teachers College, Columbia University, spent two days, November 15 and 16, 1973 in Bloomfield, Connecticut meeting with town and school officials, citizens, parents, teachers and schools and observing in four schools.

The future of this mini-school project, along with the future of alternative education and school renewal in general and the potential impact of the alternative-school movement on established school systems particularly in the inner city is addressed last. The concluding chapter is presented as a guide for educators and community groups interested in launching their own  alternative-school programs based on the mini-school approach and the processes involved. It offers a step-by-step &quot;road map&quot; covering such areas as planning organization, management, financing, administration, staffing, day-to-day operation, involvement of the business community, and facilities planning and acquisition.

The study deals with educational opportunities afforded Chinese American youth; housing and redevelopment problems faced by Japanese Americans; allegations of inadequate social services allocated to Pacific Americans; the various problems faced by the elderly within the Pilipino communities; and the difficulties encountered by Korean and Philippine-educated professionals in obtaining state licensure. State licensure policies are examined in four health fields as they affect the large number of Koreans and Philippines born and  educated professionals residing in California. The difficulties encountered by these subgroups in resuming their professions are said to present significant socioeconomic problems within the Asian and Pacific communitiesin that they lack adequate health care and medical services and are deprived of the services of trained medical personnel with whom they could communicate effectively. Among the recommendations made are that the state licensure boards review their standards to see that qualified professionals are not screened out, and that they endorse and actively support training programs for foreign-educated in the medically-related professions.

Emphasis is placed on comparisons of age and sex specific means and medians for Negro and white children. These national estimates are based on cross-sectional data, which are said to limit the analyses to attained size rather than velocities of growth. All dimensions are said to increase almost linearly with age from 6 through 11 years in Negro and white children, both males and females. Conclusions derived from these data are considered to agree generally  with most other anthropometic comparisons of American white and Negro children with these statistics providing figures held to be current, comprehensive, and reliable national estimates. Twenty-six detailed tables of statistical material are provided. (Author/AM)",

The major elements of this agreement extend on a city-wide level the best practices that are currently being attempted and implemented for target children in the New York City schools. Certain provisions of the agreement specify the class of children entitled to the full program: that is, those whose language deficiency prevents them from participating in the learning process and who can more effectively participate in Spanish. An improved method of identifying and classifying children who are Spanish speaking or Spanish surnamed is also being developed. The elements of the program that are to be provided  in full by September 1975 are: (a) intensive instruction in English; (b) instruction in subject areas in Spanish; and, (c) the reinforcement of the pupils' use of Spanish and reading comprehension in Spanish where a need is indicated. Additionally, and not at the expense of these three elements, these students are to spend maximum time with other children as to avoid isolation and segregation from their peers. The basic program will be operable in a number of schools which will set up pilot programs by February, 1975. (Author/AM)",

Ratings with the following criteria are assigned to each book: (1) sensitivity in dealing with differences; (2) accuracy of fact or situation; (3) readability of the book; and, (4) interest level and attractiveness of the book. The rating schedule consists of poor - given to books with little ethnic sensitivity and/or low interest to the reader; average - books which neither detract nor improve the reader's perspective of Asian Americans; and excellent - highly recommended reading material which can help bring about understanding of the Asian experience. Recommended grade levels are based on  interest rather than reading levels. Six major topics include fiction: folk and fairy tales; resource books such as history, song, game, and culture; books/media/curriculum supplement outlets; audiovisual; and publishers of books offered in the bibliography. The bibliography is limited to elementary and junior high level resources. It is said to alleviate the problem related to the lack and shortage of appropriate Asian American curricular materials.

Specifically, the tool is a course having as its base the proper assessment of student needs and the revision of the syllabus to fit those needs. Aspects of course development, the objectives and methodology of the seminar aspect of the course, and the objectives and methodology of the study skills aspect of the course are addressed. They study skills aspect of the course is evaluated at the end of the term, with the seminar aspect being evaluated as early as the second session. The end of term evaluation is somewhat more formalized, with students responding in writing to a  questionnaire. The significant aspect of this tool is considered to be that it was developed at the request of and with the critical evaluation of the student body. After two years, the course's effectiveness is said to be reflected in the positive feedback from students and faculty. The course has now become a part of the core of required courses for all freshmen. (Author/AM)",

Among the issues addressed by the students were the following: how the schools can respond constructively to the needs and aspirations of today's youth in these turbulent times; how students can participate constructively in the decisions that affect their education; what innovations in educational technique or curriculum are necessary to improve the quality of education; what must be done to meet the educational needs of minority group children; and, what steps must schools take to promote successful adjustment to desegregation by students and teachers alike. In  all, 277 students from 17 cities and towns were interviewed at length. Efforts were made in each of the communities to interview substantial numbers of both minority and majority group students. Most of the student interviewed were high school juniors and seniors. In most cases, the race of the student interviewer were matched. Questioning was directed toward bringing out the student's views on specific topics. These topics appear as chapter headings in the report: Education Overview; Administration; Teachers; Curriculum; and Perception of Others. (Author/JM)",

Board of Education\" the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights undertook to commemorate the Supreme Court's decision with an examination of civil rights progress between 1954 and 1974. The Commission is publishing a series of concise reports summarizing the status of civil rights in education employment, public accomodations and housing. The first report in the series provided a brief historical background; the second covered equality of educational opportunity, and the third dealt with equality of economic opportunity. This fourth report looks at national housing policies and the extent to which they have been effective in providing equality of opportunity in housing for all America's citizens. It is stated that, at this juncture in our  Nation's history, the Commission finds that the forces promoting discrimination in housing hold powerful, if less than universal, sway. These forces will be curbed only by new dedication of national resources and fair housing enforcement efforts to the creation of many more rental and home ownership opportunities for monorities and women of all incomes, in good housing located in a full variety of viable urban neighborhoods, and in rural areas and on native American reservations as well.

The report's introduction provides a brief overview of the secondary level program and the evaluation design. Chapter 2 focuses on the procedures for the recruitment and selection of program students, discusses comparison and control student groups, and compares the demographic characteristics of these groups. Chapter 3 deals with program outcome data, discussing students, parents, and resource perceptions, attitudes and opinions about FWS and assessing student achievements. Chapter 4, outcome backup research, considers anthropological observations, an analysis of program components, test-taking attitudes, and staff-program issues. Chapter 5,  model development and implementation, examines the formative evaluation of student-related procedures, and the assessment of the FWS instructional system. Chapter 6 provides a summary and conclusions, presenting generally favorable student and parent reactions to the program, and reporting success in achieving most FWS program goals in self-development, career development, and basic skill and interpersonal skill development. The program was also viewed as successful in keeping students in school and achieving community support. (JR)",

Most of the 29 students completed eight employer site explorations, spent 108 days in learning experiences on three employer sites, completed seven projects and five single objectives, were tutored in two skills, and participated in many hours of independent study, seminars, counseling, and enrichment activities. In tests of student growth, the students remained about the same in basic skills and self-concepts, but reached competence level in a number of survival skills, and improved their writing skills. Seniors reached a high level of career maturity. As judged by employers, students improved in their work performance,  adherence to work schedules, acceptance of responsibility, interest in and enthusiasm for work, judgment, ability to work with others, and ability to learn through work experience. All those involved were enthusiastic about the program. The evaluation lists the project's goals and an evaluation of the progress made toward each goal. Evaluation questions and statistical data are presented and discussed. The presentation of program results include data on: employer learning sites; student learning experiences; student growth; employer, parent, and student appraisal; and outside evaluation.

Approximately 50 high school juniors and seniors participated in the project on a full-day basis, dividing their time equally between a learning center and various employer and community sites. Students showed a statistically significant gain in reading, mathematics, and study skills, but no significant gain in language mechanics. Against a psychosocial maturity scale, students showed a positive gain in the areas of self-reliance, work, communication, and trust. The test for measuring career maturity was found to be faulty. The report is an  extensive summative evaluation of student achievements in terms of the project's goals, and a formative evaluation of the program based on a survey of participating instructional staff, students, parents, and employers.

Career education should therefore be involved with a broadened educational perspective which includes student development and the community. The second paper, Career Development as Self-Development: Beyond Career Education, discusses the guidance approach to career education which would unify academic, vocational, and guidance efforts around individuals and their needs. Several characteristics of the self-development approach to career education  and a conceptual career development curriculum model are presented and related to a discussion on how they relate to the self-development needs of women. The third paper, The Role of Assessment in Career Guidance: A Reappraisal, discusses common misconceptions about the use of tests in counseling and the importance of test information in career guidance and career exploration. The vital need for counselors to acquire skills for a comprehensive career guidance program for all educational levels is emphasized in the fourth paper, A Summary--Future Directions. (Author/EC)",

The major question asked was whether a film followed by practice leads to better mastery than a film presented without practice. The relationships among cognitive, affective, and psychomotor aspects of the task were explored. The subjects were 148 fourth to eighth grade boys and girls with no previous industrial arts experience. Students were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups and provided different types of instructional treatment. The students were given attitude and knowledge tests on the films they were shown and rated by experts on their skill performance; they were administered a battery of achievement, intelligence, and attitude tests as  well as the Rod-and-Frame test, to identify their cognitive styles. Results are described by instructional treatment, by sex, and by level of intelligence. Correlations among knowledge, attitude, and skill performance are presented, as well as the factor analysis of the major variables in the study, and regression analysis. A summary of the results and their instructional applications are presented, with implications and recommendations.

The review (presented separately) referred to over 100 programs of dropout prevention and vocational development for the disadvantaged; in reports having an evaluation component, assessment measures have been identified. Described in the document, these are not limited to criterion-referenced techniques, which were infrequently found. Measures tended to be obvious and already included in the CIP package. Unique measures are discussed in the document within the framework of a generalized evaluation model, constructed to  place the data from literature in perspective and to determine the requirements for additional assessment measures. In general, the document concludes, the measures found in the literature were related to specific, short-term program expectations, based on immediate program outcomes, and not empirically tied to ultimate, long-range goals; the data presented incomplete and fragmented pictures of programs' progress and success. A new approach is suggested, which asks not whether the program objectives have been met, but whether they were the correct objectives: &quot;What have we really done for this individual?&quot; (Author/AJ)",

It attempted to ascertain the status of career education in the States, the use of newly developed curricular materials, trends of growth, and State evaluation methods. Information was obtained exclusively from SEA personnel responsible for career education, as the SEA is considered to be the critical agency within the educational system's organizational hierarchy. From the available data (presented and discussed in the report), it  is concluded that the general status of career education is good. The data suggest that there have been gains for career education in the various States in these areas: (1) SEA career education positions, (2) numbers of pupils involved in career education, (3) inservice teacher programs, (4) State legislation, (5) appropriation of State funds, (6) use of Federal monies, (7) State plans, (8) State advisory councils, (9) evaluation techniques and instruments, and (10) establishment of career education as an SEA priority.

A list of recommended investigations judged to be important for increasing the effectiveness of beginning pilot training was formulated based on their suggestions and in conjunction with the capabilities of the HRL/FT facility. Methodological considerations in the planning of long range training research are the difficulties inherent in carrying out classical transfer of training experiments and the configuration of the training simulator. The major elements of an overall plan for a research program in undergraduate pilot training are discussed. These include the six  technological base phases and the research phase. The discussion on suggested research is divided into two areas: training methodology and simulator requirements. A list of 23 references is included.

The project focused on two major phases of inservice teacher education: (1) the formalized inservice training of administrators, counselors, and teachers; and (2) the informalized continuing inservice education of teachers using visiting career awareness assistants and mobile media centers. The report briefly covers: the need for the project, the project's goals and objectives expressed as teacher outcomes, the procedures followed in setting  up administrator workshops and inservice teacher education and workshops, selection and utilization of media and instructional materials, developing a handbook for teachers, advisory council operation, information dissemination, and the project's results and conclusions.

Published research on the subject either fails to adequately assess the influence of education on job satisfaction or is too occupationally and/or geographically limited to form the basis for generalization. To examine on a larger scale the association between education and job satisfaction, four national household surveys of the American work force conducted by the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center in 1969, 1971, and twice in 1973 were analyzed. One hypothesis was that in small occupationally homogeneous samples those with higher educational levels would be less satisfied than others. Regarding education and overall job satisfaction, no  support was provided for assuming that job satisfaction increases with each advance in educational level attained. On the other hand, overall quality of employment was associated with educational level, but large increments in quality of employment occurred only at those points where educational credentials are conferred. Future work on the relationship should involve several types of secondary analyses: treating education operationally in terms of quality and type rather than simply level; identifying the contribution of education to the relative importance that workers assign to different aspects of their jobs; and accounting for modifications in individual aspirations throughout life.

In the study, the construct of correspondence is explicated in terms of statistical measures and applied to the prediction of job satisfaction. Measures of needs and general job satisfaction were administered to 635 employees in six different occupations for which occupational reinforcer patterns had been previously obtained. Nineteen indexes of need-reinforcer correspondence were compared in terms of the efficiency with which they could predict general job  satisfaction across the six occupational groups. Using the criterion of consistency of outcomes across occupational groups, the results show product moment correlation and d squared prime to be the best statistical indexes to measure correspondence. Implications for the operational and theoretical development of the concept of correspondence are discussed. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"Two models of the duration of stay on welfare are developed and estimated using panel data from the California Aid to Families with Dependent Children AFDC panel survey. The first model characterizes the distribution of length of stay on welfare as drawn from the lognormal distribution with a truncation at the duration of the experiment (sixty months). The second model analyzes the movements on and off welfare, and duration of stay on welfare as a Markov process. Methodological findings indicate that statistical procedures fail to account for the special characteristics of the limited duration of observation and can be quite misleading. Substantive findings indicate that the welfare population as a whole involves an enormous turnover and modest length of stay. Those earning below  the minimum wage are less likely to leave welfare and are more likely to return, stay off welfare for shorter periods and stay on for longer periods, and are more likely to be on welfare in a steady state than those earning above the minimum wage. Persons with high expected unemployment or low non-wage incomes respond similarly to those with below minimum wage earnings. Seven tables supplement the discussions. (Author/LH)",

Objective screening procedures were used to define physical and mental health problems and handicaps in a New York State sample population. Common health disabilities identified in the experimental group included emotional handicaps such as sick-role behavior, aversive handicaps including obesity, dental decay, and locomotor handicaps with limited mobility. Health intervention included treatment of sick-role behavior and other emotional problems by group counseling, weight reduction, exercise classes, and treatment of specific medical and dental problems. Job motivation classes were also  provided. Improvement in health status and solution of problems was correlated with compliance in relation to treatment. Clients with initial medical handicaps, successful in the health rehabilitation program, entered CETA job training and gained employment, doing as well as controls without chronic health problems over the same period. Appended materials include: all forms used, a short job motivation course outline, 70 case resumes, code words and definitions, and tables summarizing all measures (educational, social, personal, and medical) and correlations between all measures.

Any IRS employee in a career ladder where the journeyman level is grade 7 or lower is eligible to compete for an Upward Mobility Target Position. Every employee in grades 1-7 is given a skills and interest survey; two completed example surveys are included to acquaint personnel managers with their use in counseling interviews. The next step involves the identification and matching of projected vacancies with employee interests, or the recommendation of alternate career goals. A problem-solving exercise (helping an employee decide between taxpayer service representative and revenue agent) offers  counseling techniques. At this point, the employee is ready to develop an individual development plan of objectives and activities for the coming year. The plan needs to be responsive to competition, the possibility of failing to achieve a stated objective, and to revision. For self-instructional purposes, a number of possible employee situations are presented with overall ways of handling them. Sample projection vacancy charts are included as well as sample occupational information for 11 IRS positions. (EA)",

Career education extends the academic world to the world of work. In scope, career education encompasses educational experiences beginning with early childhood and continuing throughout the individual's productive life. A complete program of career education includes an awareness of self and the world of work, broad orientation to occupations (professional and nonprofessional), in depth exploration of selected (occupational) clusters, career preparation, an understanding of the economic systems of which jobs are a part, and placement for all  students.&quot; In addition, the council believes that career education is for all learners, is in all levels of education, includes all work (paid and unpaid), includes the total community, and is lifetime education. It represents a concept that actively involves students, parents, educators, and the community. It is not a separate program, but rather a concept that is integrated into and throughout the existing educational structure. Career education offers the emphasis and the means to deliver educational experiences which prepare individuals for a changing and increasingly complex society. (Author/EA)",

Questionnaires based on the results of the survey were sent to educators to gather their opinions regarding the usefulness of the instruments. The results showed that no preference between the two instruments existed. Results from the student survey indicated some degree of career maturity and ethnic differences among students. Criteria for career education student accomplishment were developed based on the question: What does an individual &quot;look like&quot;  when he or she is 17 years old and has become adequately developed in terms of career education? A total of 279 learner outcomes were identified and rated in a Statewide survey of students, parents, educators, and persons from business and industry.

The purpose of the program, operated by the Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America under a contract from the National Institute of Education, is to provide opportunities for students with school problems to achieve their career aspirations. The program begins with 10 weeks of intensive orientation, counseling, and career investigation. Its second phase, lasting from 11 weeks to four semesters, features individualized instruction in basic academic subjects integrated with education; career exploration and hands-on experience highlight this  phase. Disadvantages of the program's informality have included manipulation of staff by some students, conflicting staff standards for academic credit, and the great effort required to retrain the staff. Advantages have included a personalized school atmosphere liked by the interns, students' feelings of acceptance, and program flexibility. The document recounts the program's development, describes its students and the short-term effect on them, identifies those for whom the program works best, presents followup data, and discusses the program's implications.

        "description":"The study attempted to measure world-of-work values and perceptions at entry and after a period of employment of enrollees in Plan D of the Public Service Careers (PSC) Program, a Federal program designed to bring disadvantaged individuals into Federal employment. A PSC Enrollee Questionnaire, developed from a logical taxonomy of world-of-work values based on an extensive review of related literature, was administered twice, along with supervisor evaluations, for initial testing and at six months after employment. The first session involved 328 enrollees in the entry-level component, 106 individuals in the upgrade component, and 95 Federal employees holding equivalent positions to those of PSC entry-level workers. The second session involved 211 PSC entry-level enrollees and 137  of their supervisors. Project background, methodology, data analysis, summary of findings and recommendations are presented, with 27 tables. Appended material, encompassing half the document, presents the data collecting instruments and responses. Conclusions state that PSC enrollee perceptions of world-of-work values were congruent with the &quot;middle-class value system&quot;, these values were maintained through job experience, and the PSC employee is generally underemployed in the entry job and might continue to be after one promotion.

One of the research devices investigated is the Advanced Simulator for Undergraduate Pilot Training (ASUPT). The equipment includes the ASUPT, the instrumented T-37 aircraft, the T-4G and T-40 trainers, and the formation flight trainer. Methodological considerations and the development of a research program are discussed. Instructional procedures and practices are described for three phases which will be used in establishing a technological base: equipment familiarization and operator performance measures for the T-40 study, ASUPT, and instrumented aircraft. One area of suggested research is visual  display which will include investigation of visual cues, the use of a visual model as a research tool, and four studies on the content of visual display. Another area for suggested study is motion cue research which will attempt to determine the necessary axes of cockpit motion for training simulation. A third area of suggested research focuses on training methods in the areas of cognitive pretraining, feedback, sequencing of training tasks, contextual training, and individualized training. A list of reference is included. A list of AFHRL/FT research programs for 1975 is appended. (EC)",

The concept of lifelong learning is defined and criteria for developing positive attitudes and opportunities for its development are discussed. The analysis of the curricula in the basic and upper secondary schools involved five main criteria, with a number of subgroups within each: (1) horizontal integration; (2) vertical integration; (3) individual maturity--self realization; (4) autodidactic--development of readiness for new learning and relearning; and (5) directing studies toward creativity, flexibility, and equality. Discussion of the curriculum analysis takes up more than half the document. No empirical research was  undertaken for this report, but already completed studies concerning school curriculum analysis in Sweden were investigated and are discussed with reference to the five criteria used in the analysis. Conclusions state that school curriculum and everyday school activities do not necessarily correlate, with the desired development of attitudes towards lifelong learning being neglected. Adult education is briefly discussed in terms of developing lifelong learning concepts among adults and educators alike. (LH)",

All were enrolled as full-time students, three at the master's degree level and four at the doctoral degree level. During the year, each Fellow engaged in at least four distinctive types of leadership development activities. Each earned at least six semester hours of credit in individually arranged internships; completed administrative processes, theory, and planning courses; participated in an exclusive series of leadership development seminars; and engaged in related enrichment activities such as serving on an Illinois Division of  Vocational and Technical Education public school evaluation team. The EPDA Leadership Development program has been evaluated and, in general, its objectives have been achieved. The interdisciplinary, performance-based, individualized program has been awarded continued status and funding for the 1975-76 year. The report gives an eight-page description of the leadership development program, a six-page description of the university's occupational education program, and a four-page description of the program evaluation. Approximately one-third of the documents is comprised of a list of personnel and the Fellows' vitae. (Author/AJ)",

The projects and programs cited represent the results of a survey to search out studies that delineate project population, methods, materials, and results. The survey was designed to limit the time period covered (1965-75) and the educational area covered (academic rather than vocational). The abstracts are arranged alphabetically by author in a 60-page section. A discussion section contains observations drawn from the survey supporting the conclusion that basic questions concerning adult education (what kind of teachers, teaching what kind of students, with what kind of content, at what level of complexity, and in what teaching style) have not  yet been definitively answered. Those studies which seemed to be peripheral to the main survey and those which did not include sufficient achievement data are listed alphabetically by author in an annotated bibliography (Appendix A, 47 pages). Other appended materials include: approximate figures on grade level gains per unit of time, a suggested checklist for future research, and a list of sources contacted in gathering the documents (includes computer searches and references).

The eight main elements of such programs are: philosophical and taxonomic considerations; instructors as resource persons and learning managers; peer tutoring, personal and academic counseling, and cognitive style maps of students; instruction employing such techniques as pre- and posttesting, computerized data banking, individual diagnosis, and designed instructional mediation; financial prioritization; inservice training for administrators and educators, and individualized student orientation; open architecture of physical facilities; computerized management information and evaluation systems; and accountability and planning models. The development of the elements of the I and P  program is a dynamic process. Since the computer, a full range of mediation, and paraprofessionals can adequately dispense information, instructors are able to become designers and managers of learning, prescribers of instructional material, and interpreters of evaluation data. Instructors are able to select a proper mix of a large variety of elements and tools for each individual student. Educational technology thus does not replace instructors; it merely frees them to humanize the educational process. (Half the document consists of explanatory notes of terminology used in the text.)

A questionnaire was sent to all known administrators in the State, with a 93.44% return. Four major sections sought information regarding: (1) demographic/biographic data; (2) the nature of each respondent's program, including problem evaluation; (3) administrator task analysis; and (4) perceptions of competencies and need for additional education. Data analysis is presented in 19 tables and major findings are enumerated. Most administrators were found to be male, part-time, between 30 and 50 years  old, having some graduate training, and no specific training for adult education work. A variety of competency training and educational needs were uncovered, with part-time people indicating more need in this area. Results are stated in a variety of formats, and recommendations include that the State Department should continue to seek additional funding for hiring full-time administrators.

The volunteer sample consisted of 83 ABE students. Subsample comparison groups consisted of sixth graders, stock brokers, and GED students. Data on the total of 158 subjects were analyzed by computer to display individual and group profiles. Results of the Luscher Color Test indicated a sense of fragileness, a slight degree of social-emotional dependency, and a need for healthy release from tensions on the part of the ABE students. The Manzo Bestiary Inventory findings corresponded to the Luscher findings but also indicated  a need for ABE students to appear highly aggressive and cautions about intimacy with others. The Learning Preference Inventory indicated their preference to learn by direct teaching approaches such as lecture, tutoring, and group interaction rather than by less direct approaches. The study concluded that ABE students are like other segments of society, especially those with newly heightened aspirations. Unlike other undereducated adults not enrolled in ABE classes, however, ABE students are probably more aggressive, intense, and conflict-prone. (Author/JR)",

Data were analyzed utilizing tables with frequencies, percentages, and mean scores as well as a crossbreak analysis and t-test of significance for testing some hypotheses. Data from the study revealed a need for more suitable continuing education programs based on the following findings: (1) obstacles to  learning selected most often were \"don't like to go out at night.\"\"not enough time,\"\"cost,\"\"home responsibilities,\" and \"job responsibilities;\" and (2) courses selected as an indication of learning interests included \"Stretching Your Retirement Dollar,\"\"Tax Benefits for Older Americans,\"\"Outdoor Flora\", \"Medical Care in the Retirement Years,\" and \"Laws Affecting the Aged.\" The study's design, findings, recommendations, and implications of the study are presented. Data collection materials, miscellaneous tables, and comparison data on learning projects are appended. (Author/EC)",

The focus throughout the brochure is on various aspects of GM operations. The following concept areas are to guide the development of school-industry cooperation: (1) education and training as related to one's career choice, (2) economics as related to career choice and the responsibility of the worker to industrial economics, (3) employability and work-adjustment skills, and (4) the sequence of development of decision-making skills. Three  outlines for linkage are offered: (1) implementation of CE-GM Corporation linkage; (2) format for development of local career education: GM plant-city programs; and (3) suggested list of student performance objectives to aid in evaluating CE-GM linkage activities. Activities are suggested for plant involvement in career education programs, and a sample career education program at a Packard electric division is outlined. A map illustrates the relationship of Ohio career education program sites to General Motors Corporation plant sites. (Author/AJ)",

Evaluation of inservice training by pre- and posttest and self-assessment indicated that  the majority of the participants increased their basic career education knowledge. There was evidence also of functioning committees to form a basis for future career education efforts. Approximately 100 pages are appendixes consisting of: pre- and posttest survey, agenda for inservice training programs, survey to rate materials disseminated, opinionnaire to evaluate inservice training sessions, directory of district team members, and extensive task force reports (communication and reporting, computer usage, assessment and evaluation, goals and objectives, infusion, and career guidance).

The effectiveness of work registration requirements was analyzed. The intention was to isolate the extent to which the welfare system itself causes job instability. The data sources were the Graduate Work Incentive (Negative Income Tax) Experiment and the Panel Study on Income Dynamics. The many findings are reported in terms of (1) work patterns, (2) the effects of welfare on work, and (3) welfare dependency. It was learned that those who can and cannot work are not  easily distinguished on the basis of characteristics that could be specified. Labor market problems are not clearly linked with demographic characteristics. Overwhelmingly, males in the low-income population move from welfare to work on their own, and so, apparently, do most female heads of low-income families, over time. However, there is much movement from work to welfare, and little movement out of the low-income ranges. (Author/AJ)",

Various basic construction trades were investigated: bricklayers, carpenters, electrical workers, ironworkers, plumbers and steamfitters, and sheet metal workers. Data were collected through interviews and surveys. About 49% of the journeymen interviewed (from a total of 1,234) had served apprenticeships and were younger, better educated, more likely to have friends and relatives in the trade, and learned the trade faster than those trained informally. Craftsmen obtain work in the jurisdiction of most building trades local unions in four ways: graduation from an apprenticeship program, admission to the union as a  journeyman or by being upgraded into the union's construction branch, transfer from other locals, and working under temporary permits. A large majority of informally trained journeymen learned their trade either by working as laborers or helpers or by working on the job in open shops. The study provides strong evidence that apprenticeship training gives construction craftsmen considerable advantage over the informally trained. Sixty-six tables illustrate minority representation union entry requirements (by trade) and other comparative data. A bibliography, list of persons interviewed, and survey instruments are appended.

Outreach also applies to those many adults who need help simply in coping with everyday life in this complex society. A recent study found that Americans have more trouble with everyday problems in consumer economics than in any other knowledge area, that one-fourth of Americans do not understand their rights and obligations under our system of government, that one-fifth of adults have trouble with occupational knowledge, and that people had more trouble with arithmetic than with any other learning skill tested. The responsibility for rectifying the situation in the case of  adults rests with the adult education community. A set of 65 learning objectives covering occupational knowledge, consumer economics, health, community resources, and government and law, which the aforementioned study identified, is the core around which remedial instructional programs can be built. The task in adult education is to find people who would not otherwise seek help on their own and involve them in instructional programs committed to innovation and change built around real world situations.

Several areas that need improvement in the Department's administration of the program and  weaknesses found in the compliance agencies' implementation of the nonconstruction program are discussed. The problems of coordination between the Department, the compliance agencies, and EEOC were due to lack of information exchange and duplication of some compliance activities at contractor facilities.

The report describes basic training provided in four regional 10-day seminars which equipped participants with basic skills and knowledge for planning, implementing, and evaluating delivery systems of adult career education in correctional settings. Advanced training provided in a national five-day seminar and 10-day internship for participants selected from those successfully completing the basic training program is detailed. The advanced training enabled participants to effectively implement  leadership roles in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the correctional programs. The design of the planning model is discussed, including such aspects as testing by simulations and internal and external evaluations. The method of designing adult career education delivery systems, utilizing the planning model, is described. As a result of the program, 64 individuals received basic training, 17 received advanced training, a generalized planning model was developed, and 21 delivery system models for correctional agencies in 16 States and Canada were designed.

        "description":"A study of the Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), Nurse Aide (NA), and Homemaker-Home Health Aide (H-HHA) occupations was conducted during 1972-73 in Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Questionnaires were administered to 600 LPNs, NAs, and H-HHAs in 30 health facilities who rated the frequency and importance of 346 tasks. Usable questionnaires numbered 492. A representative sample of employers also rated the tasks for each job title. The data revealed considerable task overlap between job titles and between patient care settings, and much agreement between job titles concerning the frequency and importance of task performance. On this basis, the study constructed an outline for an experience based core curriculum containing four modular units of instruction and organized to provide exit  points for various job titles leading up to the LPN level. The study also developed a model for community-wide involvement in aide education and utilization to maximize the career mobility and effective use of aides. Appendixes comprising 125 pages provide: a brief glossary; an inventory of hospitals, nursing homes, and providers of home health care in the Metropolitan Washington area; the employer and employee task inventory questionnaires; data cross-tabulations by patient-care setting, shift, education, and years of experience; and a bibliography.

A continuum of education without unnecessary duplication of instruction or delay in students' attainment of career objectives must be developed, for educational separatism has reached a point of diminishing returns. The establishment of an articulated agreement between educational levels is a three-phase process: (1) a formal letter of agreement between the systems involved, based on meetings between administrators; (2) program letters of agreement, based on meetings between  faculties; and (3) evaluation, review, and revision, based on input from all involved parties. Seven items should be considered for inclusion in the first letter of agreement. The next phase, more laborious, can be achieved by taking outlined steps; there are three minimum requirements for the second letter of agreement. There are broad guidelines for the evaluation phase. The greatest problem is attitudinal: educators should remember that allowing or refusing persons enrollment in postsecondary studies significantly influences their chances of success throughout their lives, and contributes to the nation's economic and social situation.

        "description":"The reported study attempted to determine for program planners the felt training needs of adult basic education (ABE) directors and teachers in Texas. The questionnaire (appended) was prepared at Texas A and M University and revised after review and field-testing. Of 1,900 questionnaires mailed, approximately half were completed and returned; the questions were cross-tabulated and the data analyzed by computer. The report is largely comprised of tables, representing five major data areas: (1) biographical data of local ABE program staff, (2) local program information, (3) student-related information, (4) inservice training needs, and (5) higher education-related services. Among implications drawn from the data are these: Most ABE staffers, although educated beyond the bachelor's  degree, have not received any adult education training; they are dedicated, but uncertain about their roles, concerned about testing procedures, and wish to spend more time teaching. Many directors are not in the program by choice. Participation in inservice training is widely discrepant; a significant number of those who have participated were dissatisfied. Both teachers and directors have definite feelings about their specific training needs, which should be met quickly. There are also indications of a need for adult education training at the undergraduate level. (AJ)",

Previous manpower planning models of the Office of Civilian Manpower Management have utilized multi-period Markoff processes embedded in goal programing (multiple objective) models. These are here extended to EEO plans directed to changing the mix of employees over time. At each point in the planning interval, the organization is taken as given (for example, in terms of the probabilities for promotion, transfer, etc.) when formulating manpower programs. Over time, however, these organization processes are submitted to planned changes which alter the probabilities of occurrence for these events. The Merit Promotion System is preserved and other controls are also imposed explicity  for the exercise of managerial discretion. The focus here is on an ordinary (absolute value) formulation of objectives and a numerical illustration is supplied with differing weights for each of the indicated classes of objectives. Other types of objectives are briefly discussed, along with different approaches to problems of validation and, subsequently, implementation in a U. S. Navy context. (Author/EC)",

Different and separately administered general and vocational offerings will only delay the development of the total education enterprise necessary in a rapidly changing society. It is important to contemplate the skills and knowledge that schools/colleges/universities should be striving to impart. More viable relationships are needed between education and all of the work that people do; students should not have to choose between liberal arts education and occupational education. Post-industrial America now engages more people in sales, services, and government than in the production of goods. A knowledge-based society warrants more educational program-fusing. Career education activities are  needed to help all students understand the free enterprise system and the arts and to develop consumer/economic literacy. More open-ended and flexible programs geared to individual needs must be designed for the next century. The broad range of an individual's talents should be developed; over-concentration on one specific area of education should be avoided. Likewise, high quality educational programs utilizing all of the educating mechanisms (Federal/State/ local governments, private employers, trade associations, labor unions, and the home) are needed.

Statements were made while completing Air Force occupational surveys during the period 1966-71. Frequency and percentage distributions characterizing item responses and career decisions of the sample are given. Relationships between career intent/job attitude responses and actual reenlistment decisions were studies using multiple linear regression techniques. Job attitudes were found to be substantially related to career decisions but did not provide unique contributions to predictions of career decisions when used in conjunction with career intent statements. A model-seeking exercise identified a second-degree polynomial  model with career intent and time-in-service interaction vectors as the most appropriate prediction model. Separate prediction equations were obtained for a number of selected subsamples. Practical examples of forecasting reenlistment rates are illustrated. The regression model selected for the demonstration used weights derived from the total sample to predict the percentage of actual reenlistments for 30 specialties. Ten principal findings of the study are identified. Appended is a chart of Air Force specialties used in the sample. (Author/MS)",

It contains recommendations to the Secretaries of Defense, Transportation, Army, Navy, and Air Force. The review was based on questionnaires mailed to 2,209 randomly selected reservists (1,707 were returned) and 1,438 unit commanders (1,241 were returned). The reliability and validity of responses were validated by on-site visits of 99 sample units. The General Accounting Office (GAO) estimated that in fiscal year 1974 reservists' time devoted to other than official jobs or spent idle totaled 15 million man-days and cost about $1.2 billion (about 43% of the $2.7 billion authorized by Congress for drills and active duty  training during that period). The report alerts the Congress that some members in all Reserve components and Reserve units can maintain proficiency under a reduced training schedule. GAO recommends that the Congress amend the existing laws to permit varying the training of the Army and Air National Guard by categories according to kinds and degrees of training.

The evaluation included: (1) analysis of quantitative data; (2) administration of questionnaires to certified, classified, and student personnel; (3) on-site visitations by project administrators; and (4) a comparison study of student achievement. The findings are presented and discussed, concluding that the program effectively met its  overall goal of increasing individual assistance to disadvantaged vocational education students and had a generally positive effect on them. The aides' greatest efforts were in direct assistance to students, as guidelines required. Project objectives for median rating of 3.0 or more (on a 1-to-4 scale) in selected program aspects were met, except for the dropout rate and school attitudes. Grades in ACE classes were slightly higher than in others, but citizenship grades were similar. Inservice education was generally effective.

The present teaching load is compared with an evaluation of an acceptable teaching and student load. Two questionnaires collected data: (1) regarding the present teaching load (136 of 197 sent to vocational agriculture instructors were returned), and (2) evaluating an acceptable teaching load (335 of 469 sent to school superintendents, principals, and vocational agriculture instructors were returned). An analysis of the data concluded that: (1) not enough is known about the cooperative education program in vocational agriculture, (2) inadequate time for supervision is allowed for the majority of  instructors, (3) majority of the programs need more instructors, (4) supervised farming projects and the Future Farmers of America are adversely affected by student overload, (5) 13 to 30 students should be able to be supervised in a cooperative education program, (6) an agriculture classroom should consist of 16-20 students, with shop classes between 14 and 16 students, and (7) 75-80 students is an acceptable teaching load.

        "description":"It is the undeniable responsibility of the community college to provide educational opportunities for all citizens in a community, including culturally different adults. In designing relevant outreach center programs for culturally different adults, it is of utmost importance to determine the needs of the groups, to directly involve participants in the process, to explore their perceptions of reality, and to examine biases held by the dominant society. The logical starting point for program planning involves determining the group characteristics, which will vary from one group to another. The social-psychological characteristics of culturally different groups usually include low self-esteem, a high degree of dependency on others, and difficulties in communicating with the  dominant society. The Martin Luther King Adult Education Center of Kankakee Community College, Kankakee, Illinois is a model outreach center that provides physical/socioeconomic/social-psychological support through its &quot;success-oriented&quot; program. Effectiveness of an outreach center will depend ultimately on the quality and dedication of the teaching/counseling/administrative staff, and on preservice and inservice training, which are vital teacher training components. Moreover, outreach centers need to coordinate their efforts with community libraries and learning centers in order to serve the needs of culturally different adults. (EA)",

Information was collected from a sample of 623 students from 30 public high schools which provided vocational agriculture programs in 1974-75. Instruments for collecting data consisted of: (1) personal, family, and community data related to educational and occupational plans of Iowa vocational agriculture students (40 variables); and (2) agribusiness achievement test (four variables). The following educational plans on graduation were identified and studied: (1) those who planned to attend a postsecondary area vocational school (27%), (2) those who planned to  attend a four-year college or university (17%), and (3) those who planned to enter the world of work (55.9%). The findings of the study reveal that there are differences in selected factors related to educational decision making among vocational agriculture students grouped according to their stated educational plans upon graduation from high school. A series of 87 tables support the analysis and discussion based on the collected data. Materials related to the conduction of the study are appended. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"A major problem in the utilization of personnel appears in the identification of skills and knowledges acquired in job assignments held in the past. Lack of regular job inventorying of Air Force personnel by individuals rather than samples makes it infeasible to use job inventories to recapture a given airman's record. The possibility of using the Functional Account Code (FAC) in occupational analysis was formulated and a preliminary assessment to verify its potential is presented in the study. The study was made possible with the use of a file of records on all studies clustering job inventories from 1965-1971 with the FAC for each airman included. It was first shown that, when individuals are sequenced by FAC, the job clustering corresponds well with the FAC. Seventy-five Air  Force Systems Commands are shown in graphic form. A more intensive analysis was then made of the Administration Specialist ladder, which contains the largest number of FAC's of any specialty. It was found that FAC titles agreed well with the titles assigned to job clusters by the analyst who interpreted the homogeneous grouping of the job inventories.

        "description":"The study attempts to verify the affective competencies which vocational-technical areas in common require of students, and to validate those required in agriculture, business and office, distributive, home economics, and industrial education. The affective competencies were identified so that they might be a major part of the learning sequence, not merely incidental, and provide a basis on which to establish common experiences among vocational education programs. The competencies, elicited by review of vocational education publications, were verified by randomly selected employers, employees, and teachers. Their degree of commonality was validated by 48 State vocational directors, through the Delphi technique. The study concludes that: (1) State directors appear to agree that  the five vocational areas do require common affective competencies; (2) teachers, employers, and employees appear to agree with directors on what constitutes affective competencies; (3) they appear also to agree on which are important for career success; (4) affective competencies appear to provide a commonality for the five areas; and (5) the common affective competencies appear to be as important as cognitive and psychomotor competencies. Tables comprise the largest part of the report. A research instrument, a condensed version of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, and sample study correspondence are appended. (Author/AJ)",

Federal and State legislation affecting prison industries were examined, several prison industries were visited, and the literature of prison industries was reviewed. The study's findings are these: Prison industries exist in the context of correctional systems whose future dimensions are unknown and whose purposes are unclear. Therefore, before effective prison industry planning can take place, agreement must be reached as to underlying correctional philosophy and as to the expected numbers and distribution of offenders in the correctional system. Prison industries today do not achieve  their traditional goals and should be modified (possibly eliminated). Intelligent modification will be possible only with better information on the true costs of prison industries as determined through standardized accounting procedures. Prison industries should provide a real work experience, including full work days, job compensation, minimum wage, and merit increases in pay. New and closer relationships with private industry can benefit prison industry. Finally, laws restricting prison production and marketing should be repealed. (Author)",

A continuing educator must also be a continuing learner. In Africa, education is considered a continuing or recurrent process throughout life serving to fulfill social needs, to foster community awareness, and transmit basic values. Adult education offers a chance for a country to develop and strengthen its population, not only in terms of economic advancement, but in terms of acquiring literacy and skills in the areas of politics, health, agriculture, and economics. Educational problems exist for African women since men are usually provided more educational opportunities in the school  system which is patterned after the western model. In planning adult education programs, the important role women already have in the areas of agriculture and trade should be taken into consideration. Adult education, for men and for women, promotes national and cultural cohesion by raising the consciousness of the people to a sense of development and change. (EC)",

Stated aims clearly stress that the primary aim in the teaching of immigrant children in Swedish schools is to promote bilingualism. While the short-term aim is to produce functional bilingualism (equal ability to speak and read both languages), the long-term aim is to equalize the learning opportunities for these children in the regular school system. V. P. John and V. M. Herner (1971) propose four models of bilingual education: informal, supplementary, transition, and two-way. The Swedish model is a transition model which uses the native language as a bridge to the national language. The mother tongue (Finnish)  is developed to a relatively high degree during pre-school years and the first two years in the compulsory school; Swedish is given subordinate importance until grade 3 when training in the national language is necessary. The objective is to reach functional bilingualism by the end of grade 3. Development in the native language after age 10 is highly dependent upon the individual child and parental support. (EA)",

        "description":"The conclusions presented in a book entitled Inequality, written by Jencks, et al., call for a critical analysis of the popular beliefs regarding schools and schooling as a means to achieve the social, economic, and cultural goals of the American Dream. This meritocratic system offers equal opportunities but may yield unequal results. In the Jencks study, educational opportunities, educational attainment, occupational status, income, and job satisfaction were all found to be unequally distributed among individuals. These inequalities are real, even though their causes may be questioned, and they have implications for career education, which is, like faith in schooling, presented as a facilitator of the meritocratic ideal. Because it can exert no influence over the working world,  it is likely that career education will act as a conservative force to maintain the very societal inequalities it was designed to overcome. The achievement of equality will require more radical social and economic changes than mere school reforms offered by career education. (Author/EC)",

The five main parts of the course are: (1) career corner, a multimedia career information center for student job studies, (2) life career, a life planning simulation game, (3) self-awareness learning package for self-evaluation of interests, attitudes, abilities, and personality, (4) study of a local business, and (5) consumer economics, emphasizing buying an automobile and grocery shopping. The guide contains general objectives for the course. Specific objectives, background information, student activities, worksheets, and other learning materials are included for each unit. Activities can be adapted for  use with the entire class. The guide is one product of a project to provide a comprehensive, formal career education program to seventh and eighth grade students through a learning center program utilizing an integrated approach. The final report of the project which involved 483 students and 20 staff members is included. The educational setting, procedures, outcomes, and recommendations of the two-year effort are summarized. An evaluation of the project's objectives indicates that the majority were met fully or partially. (MS)",

        "description":"The project was designed to help high school students with industrial occupational goals achieve practical communication skills necessary for efficient employment entry. Industrial arts and language arts teachers together developed major essential categories for vocational English (reading skills, correspondence skills, reference skills, technical terminology, and job hunting skills) and subdivided these into specific communication skills. Multiple job sheets were developed for each skill utilizing content from the occupational fields (auto mechanics, drafting, electronics, and metals). A total of 277 job sheets, each about a 50 minute assignment, were developed and reviewed by an advisory committee for each industrial area. After completing 45 sheets a student received a grade  and credit for the class. Student response was positive and evaluations by the instructors indicate their satisfaction with the program and the need for its continuation. The course materials (most of the document) are: student progress record sheets, performance evaluation sheet, separate job sheets for the four industrial areas covering skills in the essential categories (presenting objectives, materials, and procedures for students to use independently), and a bibliography for each area. Also included are notes from the advisory committee meetings, and favorable program evaluations from parents and outside educators. (Author/MS)",

Such monitoring is required by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) guidelines. The suggested procedures were obtained by telephone survey, review of materials, and visits to 55 SPAs and represent those practices which appeared most useful in meeting the LEAA guidelines. A chapter discussing monitoring requirements defines the nature and scope of the required monitoring, and describes its relationship to management and other types of evaluation. In another chapter the major problems confronting monitoring system  managers are identified. The remaining four chapters detail how the manager can use the monitoring system to accomplish these four identified tasks: establishing agreement on information required by the user, establishing agreement with the subgrantee (unit of local or State government receiving Federal funds from the SPA for a criminal justice project) on what will be monitored, establishing the information flow, and assuring the utilization of monitoring information. Appended material (79 pages) includes detailed examples (identified by State) of procedures and materials used in monitoring criminal justice programs. (Author/MS)",

ABE services, developed to meet individual needs, were offered in the home by project teachers when participants were unable to attend classes. The services came in the form of innovative and individualized survival type lessons designed to enable participants to understand and deal with the existing socioeconomic system in their locality. The first year of the project focused on recruiting low income participants with no high school education through general outreach techniques and on the development of relevant and practical  learning materials. In the second and third years the emphasis shifted to enrolling parents of school aged children into ABE classes and encouraging them to become involved with the programs or institutions affecting their children through specific goals such as: visit the classroom, become volunteer teaching aides, serve as tutors, or attend parent meetings. The importance of the role of the project teacher is discussed and participant data are given. Summaries of accomplishments for 1973-1975, correspondence, and samples of materials and curriculum are appended. (Author/EC)",

The community centered career program consisted of a two-week internship in a government agency or business, study of the internship career prior to internship, group visits to agencies, and emphasis on individualized reading skills. The staff included a teacher coordinator, a teacher aide, and four community aides with input from parents and resource personnel from various city agencies and businesses. The Iowa Test of Basic Skills Reading Tests,  administered as a pre- and post-test in each 10-week session, indicated statistically significant improvement in reading scores. Results of the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory were nonsignificant, although a slight improvement in self-esteem levels was reported. A school attitude inventory, constructed for the program, indicated improved school attitudes; strong parental approval of the program was noted in interviews and questionnaires. (EA)",

During the 12-year period between conferences, organized adult education has made notable advances throughout the world. However, weaknesses remain in governmental reluctance to treat adult education as an integral part of educational systems, the low level of financial support, and the lack of participation in adult education programs by those most needing education. Chapter 1 reflects &quot;Changing Ideas and Functions&quot; while Chapters 2 and 3, &quot;Attitudes, Needs, Motivation, and Learning  Ability&quot; and &quot;Unmet Needs and Target Groups&quot;, examine the nature of the demand for adult education. Chapter 4 presents &quot;Changing Structures&quot; on the international scene, and Chapter 5 examines &quot;Programs and Content&quot;. The following five chapters deal with &quot;Methods and Materials&quot;; &quot;The Administrative, Organizing, and Teaching Force&quot;; &quot;Administrative Policies&quot;; &quot;The Problem of Financing&quot;; and &quot;Research and Development&quot;. Two concluding chapters, &quot;The International Dimension&quot; and &quot;Towards a Learning Society&quot;, discuss the developed nations/developing nations relationship and future implications.

The study is presented in six chapters. First is a relatively brief overview of the Australian health care system; second, a summary of the health manpower resources, with some data on facilities, and their distribution by type and geography; and third, an examination of recent innovations in functions of health manpower, new types of personnel, and new ways in which established types of health workers are functioning. Chapter 4 reviews the  educational system for health manpower, emphasizing recent changes, and Chapter 5 analyzes the several methods of regulating health personnel, through governmental and voluntary channels. Chapter 6 recapitulates the highlights and trends in all aspects of health manpower policy and practice deemed especially salient for the United States. The information was gathered through a literature review supplemented by three visits to Australia. A list of 165 persons and agencies interviewed is appended. (Author/AJ)",

        "description":"Military psychology has made three major contributions to civilian education. The first is the systems approach which contains two complementary components: the conceptual and the empirical. The purpose of the conceptual approach is to understand nature to determine on what principle the system works; the purpose of the empirical approach is to control nature. The conceptual approach is problem-oriented; the empirical approach is product-oriented. Although the distinctions between these two systems approaches must be carefully delineated, they work best when tied together. This second major contribution of military psychology is integrated research, development, engineering, and utilization activities. Used in close relationship with clients, these activities ensure that  continued empirical results develop in clients' faith in the continued need for conceptual research. Finally, the third major contribution of military psychology concerns content and tested programs. Since about 85% of military jobs have commonality with civilian occupations, military programs can be adapted or adopted to meet civilian education and training needs. (Author/JR)",

The classification system's purpose is to control the nuances of expression relevant to indexing and retrieving information, technology, and literature of interest to rehabilitation personnel and others concerned with program evaluation. The classification system includes: (1) a hierarchic outline consisting of 323 terms, which provides a systematic set of constructs for describing all the elements (environment, goals, resources, methodology, results, and utilization) that relate to the input, process, and  output of program evaluation in the rehabilitation service system; and (2) an alphabetic thesaurus which includes all of the terms contained in the hierarchic outline as well as terms that refer a user to an accepted system term. Both the hierarchic outline and alphabetic thesaurus were developed in a manner that complements the existing Rehabilitation Service Administration's Research Information System Thesaurus.

The following components used with E referrals are described: audiovisual orientation, vocational rehabilitation-oriented social evaluation interview, psychological testing, short-term work evaluation, faster general medical examination, medical transcription, and transportation.  Thirteen variables on which it was hypothesized that the E Group would be found superior to the C Group are listed. Results, based on 749 E and 722 C cases, are reported in 20 tables (Appendix A) and analyzed in narrative form. Findings revealed successes in some areas but indicate that, in general, all E-C differences were small.

Project participants included representatives from the local public school district, the community college district, the office of the State Department of Rehabilitation, the Mayor's Office of Manpower, and several citizens. These participants worked to build a new and wholly local model for coordinated planning without significant links to other governmental relationships. The report discusses the implications for national policy and local program development in the way intra-field communication needs are presently perceived and handled. It outlines the processes through which the local  group progressed toward a new procedure and discusses the nature of the group process in working with diverse local training agencies. Finally it outlines the features of the &quot;Job Training Interchange,&quot; the instrument for continuing communication among local training programs, which was the product of the work group's effort. Appendixes include information on public training and related assistance programs in San Francisco (one page) and the Job Training Interchange's statement of purposes and methods (seven pages).

        "description":"The paper uses John L. Holland's theory of careers to explain certain common career phenomena and concepts. An understanding of careers requires useful answers for four fundamental questions relating to vocational choice, vocational stability and instability, and vocational congruence. The theory of careers attempts to answer these fundamental questions by using a few carefully defined concepts (such as theoretical personality types and environmental models) to explain vocational behavior. A modern differentialist view can better reinterpret some common vocational developmental concepts, such as those associated with vocational maturity, personal integration, identity, crystalization of interests, and vocational adjustment than a developmental view. The typology of persons and  environments is more useful than any of the life stage strategies in formulating a theory of careers applicable to the entire life span. It also is suitable for assessing career changes and crises, as well as for explaining the career experiences of women and minority groups. In summary, the typology can be used to organize occupational materials and experiences, to explain and interpret vocational data and behavior, and to plan remedial activities. It can serve as the basis for an entire vocational assistance orientation including self-use materials and, where needed, personal and group counseling. (Author/JR)",

Prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Manpower Administration in cooperation with the Bureau of the Census, the survey covered nearly 16 million employed wage and salary workers 16 years of age and above, who were not in school, and had started their current job in 1972. Two broad categories of search methods are recognized: informal methods, including direct application to employers and asking friends; and formal methods, including State and private employment agencies, school placement offices, union hiring halls, and newspaper advertisements. Seven tables supplement the test, which discusses job seeker characteristics; methods used  and their effectiveness; work history and job search; job search timing, duration, and intensity; job refusal; earnings; and suggestions for further study. Half the document is taken up by extensive reference tables. The appendix discusses survey reliability and concepts and presents the questionnaire used. Major findings include: two out of three jobseekers applied directly to employers, with half of them obtaining jobs; greater proportions of blacks than whites asked friends for jobs; and four methods were generally used before a job was found.

Chapter three deals with special issues in individualized instruction including the role of counseling, problems in program evaluations, and common criticisms. A definition of individualized instruction as a basis for program review and assessment is presented in chapter four along with a discussion of tracking. Chapter five relates key  elements of the definition to activities and programs observed in NIE-funded programs in Philadelphia, Charleston, West Virginia, and Glasgow, Montana. Presented for each program are: a brief description, detailed assessment results, and a discussion relating six questions about tracking to these programs. Where tracking appeared, it was attributed to external influences. A final chapter summarizes the project and discusses numerous conclusions for each program.

The empirical results estimated the probability of individuals with certain characteristics (such as race, sex, age, and education) entering each of 11 occupational groups. The results indicate that individuals tend to choose those occupations with the highest discounted percent value of potential future earnings, the lowest present value of expected earnings foregone due to unemployment, and the lowest raining cost relative to net worth. The relative weights given to these three variables in choosing occupations varied markedly by race and sex. White males tended to weight expected earnings much more heavily relative to earnings foregone due to  unemployment than black males or females of either race. Results were then employed in an analysis of the effects of a national wage subsidy scheme on the selection probabilities for each occupation. The results suggested a higher probability of entering low wage occupations due to the greater relative importance of the subsidy in these occupations. (Author/EA)",

        "description":"The study on Lake County career opportunities was conducted (1) to forecast major population and demographic changes and their effects on schools and programs, (2) to determine the present and future occupational needs of employers, (3) to determine current program and enrollments in career training, (4) to determine student aspirations, (5) to determine career planning services provided for the students, and (6) to make recommendations for improvement of occupational education. To meet these objectives, four subcommittees from the Citizens Advisory Committee were established to collect pertinent data. The findings for each objective are discussed with supporting tables and include: (1) 1974 population estimates range from 202,600-220,900 with a declining birth rate; (2) most  companies do not forecast rapidly expanding labor needs, and higher job categories were in more demand; (3) college preparatory was the program with the highest enrollment; (4) nearly half of all seniors had college plans; career cluster selection varied with the sex of the respondent; (5) research on both local and national levels suggests student concern for career planning and information; (6) six recommendations resulted. Questionnaires used for the study and a bibliography are appended. (Author/EC)",

It demonstrates the utility of the commercial contract training concept and contains information useful to Area VOTEC (Vocational/Technical) Support Center personnel and others involved with the implementation and functional management of a VOTEC program. Guidelines for the implementation of the program are presented in the following areas: (1) VOTEC basic concepts; (2) VOTEC coordination structure; (3) typical functional process to obtain VOTEC training; (4) contracting notes (armed services procurement regulations, general contract requirements, typical contract,  and contract format/contents); (5) VOTEC training survey forms (general information, instructional approach, facilities, special facilities for training, and institutions with dormitory facilities); and (6) a list of VOTEC sources of Marine Corps related instruction and pertinent data. Training specifications for a Navy/Marine Corps VOTEC skill training program are appended. These include information on its scope, applicable documents, training, training support, and a glossary of terms. (Author/EC)",

        "description":"A field test was designed and conducted to examine the effectiveness of Arizona-designed career education units, particularly to examine the units' success in terms of their ability to affect positively students' cognitive, affective, and psychomotor behavior according to expressed performance and behavioral objectives. Eleven career education units in nine projects were field tested. Data were gathered through UNIVAL and a teacher monitoring system, with approximately 4,900 students and 152 teachers included in the study. Of the students, 50 percent were female, 69 percent were Anglo, and 31 percent from minority groups. Of the teachers, 31 were male and 121 were female. Teacher attitude toward career education was very positive and moderately positive toward the particular  units. Student response to the units was positive, and learner performance (overall percent of correct scores) was a high 83 percent. Measures of unit effectiveness were calculated, based on teacher attitude, learner attitude, and learner performance. Student demographic data were subjected to an ethnic profile. It was concluded that all 11 units in the field set were sufficiently satisfactory to be included in the 1975-1976 statewide implementation program. Additional data and the UNIVAL questionnaire are appended. (BP)",

By using provocative photographs, problems critical to learners are identified in interviews and subsequently reflected in short, idiomatic, open-ended discussion units used to organize or supplement curriculum; social interaction is crucial. Learners, motivated to solve critical problems, desire basic skills education. Skill development modules provide systematic assistance to teachers, focusing on specific skills and providing skills development  outlines, learning activities, and sample applications to particular AIM problem-stories. From the model, ABE teachers can tailor-make culturally relevant and situation-specific materials and develop their effectiveness with disadvantaged, undereducated adults. Background information, the methods-and-materials model evolution, results (a complete list of 101 photo-discussion units, with synopses) and implications comprise the report; appendixes include skills modules and evaluation information. The model is being transferred to selected State ABE staff development projects; a teacher's manual and instructional materials will be published; and a foundation has funded two New York City AIM projects.

        "description":"Effective buymanship and effective financial management are the cornerstone of an elementary and secondary school consumer education program. The curriculum must meet some basic and essential criteria in order to prepare the student for learning about budgeting, a concept which encompasses buymanship and financial management. Through knowledge, insights, and attitudes, students can be helped toward a rich image of the personal and family life they want to work toward, the values they mean to live by, and the commitments they will not forsake; toward a working familiarity with their economic system; and toward a working acquaintanceship with the processes of government and a social philosophy. The tone of a course is important in determining how the students see their own lives;  each teacher must decide what type of attitude towards consumerism he wishes to encourage. Preliminary steps to program organization are described: (1) lay out the total job; (2) take an inventory of consumer education already being done in each department; (3) find simple adaptations to enrich the total program. In a well-rounded school-wide program, the special consumer education course starts where other programs have left off, and drives deeper. (Author/AJ)",

A national training conference for key State leaders was held in St. Louis, Missouri in January, 1972 to provide State teams with the knowledge and skills to develop a State guide. Each team received a \"Program Content and Operations Manual\" and a kit of exemplary materials and resources. The States received further consultative and technical assistance from the project staff, the national steering committee members, and national/State leaders in the field, as  well as limited financial assistance. \"Elements of an Illustrative Guide for Career Guidance, Counseling, and Placement\" was prepared by the project staff in 1974.

        "description":"The final report on the development of a Work-Relevant Attitudes Inventory (WRAI) describes the use of the WRAI in diagnosing the needs of individuals and evaluating the effectiveness of manpower programs. The WRAI was used in two longitudinal studies: four Neighborhood Youth Corps (NYC) programs with 502 subjects, and a demostration education project, the New Educational Program, with 526 subjects. The WRAI was able to differentiate between subjects making a &quot;good&quot; and a &quot;poor&quot; adjustment to work. Furthermore, positive changes in WRAI scores were associated with a &quot;good&quot; adjustment. The WRAI also correlated with counselor ratings and with achievement test scores in reading and mathematics. It was concluded that the WRAI had demonstrated its usefulness as a measure of program  effectiveness and as a help in diagnosing the needs of new program participants. Five appendixes include the WRAI and various statistical measures relating to the results of its administration. (Author/JR)",

Data were collected as part of the Current Population Survey and relate to persons 16 to 24 years of age in the civilian noninstitutional population. Estimates on the number of graduates are based on a sample, and two tables are included in the discussion. High school dropouts were the most severely affected by increased job market competition, with their unemployment rate rising over four percentage points. Negro high school graduate and dropout unemployment rates were twice that of whites. Changes in the college student body reflected a higher percentage of 20 to 24 year old part time students who were combining work and school, with an increased  enrollment among women. College freshman and college graduate unemployment rates remained approximately the same as in the previous year. Appended material takes up the bulk of the document and presents definitions and explanations of the basic labor force concepts, sample design, estimating methods and data reliability of the survey, and 17 supplementary tables.

All differences for main effects for speed and errors were significant (probability less than .01). When office tasks were done under wholly realistic conditions, planning and decision making were one-half, keystroking was three-eights, and erasing comprised one-eighth of the task. Mean completion time for one letter, one table, and one rough draft for 60 students was: prearranged without erasing, 8.94 minutes; unarranged without erasing, 20.89 minutes; and unarranged with  erasing, 23.93 minutes. At low levels of skill, time consumed for keystroking was nearly as salient in contributing toward completion of product as time consumed for decision making. As psychomotor skill increased, the perceptual skill of decision making played an increasingly dominant role. The amount of time needed for decision making took on increasing salience in producing office communications as difficulty of the task and amount of training were increased. (Author)",

The format is designed to help determine  problems, questions, and concerns of participants and then allow for group discussion that will lead to solution of these problems.

The major goals of the program were to design an appropriate curriculum for the staff of PCU centers (physicians and other health professionals), develop training methodology for implementing it, produce a training manual outlining the procedures for program implementation in other HMOs, and increase PCU staff cohesiveness and levels of knowledge about HMO systems. The report is divided into four major parts. Part 1 describes: MHMOP (with 28,000 enrollees and 19 health centers) the DMF, and the  planning, implementation, and evaluation phases of the DTP. Part 2 is the Individual Practice Association model HMO Training Program Manual which was developed during the training process. Part 3 is a process and impact evaluation of the entire project prepared by a sub-contractor to DMF which indicates that the basic project objectives were accomplished. Part 4 contains appended material including major supportive materials used to design and implement the DTP and a list of trainee participants. (Author/MS)",

This report includes a description of the two-year counselor education program, as well as program evaluation methods and procedures. Data generated indicate that there are no performance differences between interns from this program and control counselors, as perceived by student clients, teachers, administrators, and other pupil personnel specialists. While the data are tentative because the  largest group of persons trained through the internship (15) has yet to perform independently as school counselors, the results of the project and study tend to shed more light on the ability of persons without teaching experience to perform as school counselors.

        "description":"Anxiety management training (AMT), developed by Suinn and Richardson, is a short-term treatment procedure for alleviating a variety of manifestations of anxiety. It is based on the theory that anxiety or fear responses themselves can become discriminative stimuli and that clients can be conditioned to respond to those stimuli with antagonistic responses of relaxation and feelings of competence which remove the anxiety through reciprocal inhibition. This study investigated the efficacy of three variations of AMT--physiological cues only, physiological cues plus scenes, and scenes only. Subjects were college students who were seeking help for &quot;free-floating&quot; anxiety problems. Questionnaire data were obtained on the Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS) and the Anxiety Symptom Check List  (ASCL). Post-treatment interview data were also obtained. Data were analyzed by separate analysis of variance designs. In addition to comparing AMT groups to each other, data from a waiting list control group and a no-problem, no-treatment control group were obtained and compared to the treatment group data. The results indicated that all three variations of AMT were effective in alleviating &quot;free-floating&quot; anxiety. (Author)",

        "description":"There are numerous problems involved in counseling minority group members. Rapport is difficult to establish because of the racial and/or cultural attitudes client and counselor have toward one another; consequently the client often finds his own goals in opposition to those of counseling. The existing cultural gap also leads to different patterns of transference and counter transference; the client expects punishment and rejection from the counselor, while the latter might either be excessively sympathetic and indulgent with minority clients or convey \"the great white father syndrome\" to his clients. Language is another important factor which hinders effective communications between counselors and clients coming from different cultural backgrounds. Finally, the psychological  characteristics of self-hatred, machismo, unwillingness to self-disclose, and modesty are other barriers to successful counseling. Many specific tests are not recommended for use with minority groups that have been culturally isolated and do not speak English fluently. Counselors should thoroughly understand all aspects of minority group cultures and should be careful in recommendations that aim to help their clients. (SE)",

Responses were coded as indicating parental use of power assertion, love-withdrawal, or teaching (induction). Mother-child agreement and the interrelationships among the discipline types are discussed. Sex of child, measures of SES, and family size were significant predictors of parental discipline. Boys received more power assertion and love-withdrawal, and less teaching than did girls. Indicators of social status (parent education, parent occupation) related negatively to use of power assertion. Larger family size was associated with increased use of power assertion and decreased use of teaching among boys, but among girls the relationships were reversed. Processes by  which these demographic variables influence parents are proposed. (Author)",

Seventy, 10-12-year old children (36 female, 34 males) were placed into dyads controlling for age, sex, I.Q., and friendship choices. Self-allocations were made (1) prior to an interaction, (2) after interactions involving an information exchange, and (3) as a result of a mutual decision process. The results indicated that successful performers gave themselves greater rewards than unsuccessful performers gave themselves; however, these responses reflected equality decisions. Prior to an interaction, unsuccessful performers gave themselves greater rewards than after an information exchange  interaction condition. After this interaction, unsuccessful performers followed equity behavior, giving themselves smaller rewards. The mutual decision led to equal rewards for all regardless of performance. Content category analyses of the bargaining sessions revealed differences for performance factors, specifically that successful performers primarily discussed equality statements while unsuccessful performers emphasized equity and agreement with other statements.

In the context of an accuracy-of-person perception task, 162 male and female subjects were shown a photograph of either a male or female physically attractive or unattractive stimulus person. Subjects were told that the stimulus person had either succeeded or failed on an examination, and were asked to attribute the stimulus person's success or failure to four attributional categories (i.e., task difficulty, luck, ability, and effort). The results indicated that physical attractiveness affected causal attributions,  especially for those who were unattractive. Unattractive individuals were seen as having very high ability and expending much effort when successful, but very low ability and effort expended when they failed. This finding was especially pronounced for female, as compared to male subjects. A number of such sex-related findings are discussed as well as the implication of these findings for other attribution-type studies. (Author)",

The primary areas investigated as to their impact on adjustment levels included whether or not the women were working, whether or not they were satisfied with their working or nonworking status, and the nature and extent of support they received from husbands, domestic help, and governmental agencies. Findings from open-ended, semistructured interviews suggested that satisfaction with one's home/career patterns was a necessary prerequisite to healthy emotional adjustment. All the women rated poorly adjusted (N=10) were not working, and were highly dissatisfied with this state of affairs (International  Casualties). Those rated well-adjusted were either working and happy to be doing so (Happily Working Mothers, N=9) or not working, but by conscious choice (Satisfied Mothers, N=6). The extent to which the husband actively participated in family life, the amount of household help, and the presence of supplementary income were not as critical to women's satisfaction as was the freedom to actively structure their lives in a fashion consistent with their sense of self.

The School's Commission places an emphasis on more equal outcomes from schooling. Particular stress is laid on social group disparities and attempts to mitigate them, and on social changes and their effects on desired educational outcomes. It is asserted that the adaptation of educational arrangements to the needs of children in relation to desired outcomes from schooling is more effectively achieved with active community involvement. The commission recommends that the school or learning community be allowed maximum freedom to address itself to its own problems and act on its own best judgement in allaying them. The commission also  encourages more open attitudes to educational questions, organization, and structures. The report challanges the traditional balance of allocation of resources between primary, junior secondary and senior secondary levels. The report includes descriptions of the commission's multiprogram approach to its supplementary funding of state school systems. (SJL)",

A problem remaining is determining if contingency awareness is a necessary condition not only for the special case of classical conditioning of meaning but for classical conditioning in general.

It would appear, however, to have relevance for all age groups. Thus this researcher sought to investigate whether or not the relationships which had been previously found between children's others-concepts and their group behavior could be demonstrated in an adult population. An adult form of the PHT (the PHT-A) was developed and given to university students. High and low scoring subjects were asked to work in small groups on a task appropriate for college students. The group sessions were tape recorded, and these recordings were coded blindly and analyzed statistically, along the lines of the Barnett and  Zuker studies with children. Significant behavioral differences were found between subjects who had high others-concept and subjects who had low others-concepts. The study therefore demonstrated that the others-concept is a theoretical construct which is applicable to adults as well as to children. In so doing, the value of the others-concept as a construct for working with children was enhanced. (Author)",

Each element of the model is totally dependent on the completion of the components comprising each preceding element. The model was applied in the Cooperative Educational Service Agency No. 1 which is composed of 14 school systems in six counties in northwestern Wisconsin. The model, as applied to two pilot school systems, was intended to serve as a guide for other school systems. Through application the model was found to be viable in implementing career education into an existing curriculum. Development of attitudes and communications  skills is essential to the participation of parents, teachers, and students in creating the curricular design. Needs must be identified and satisfied in the implementation process. Evaluation and followup should provide necessary feedback to insure an acceptable level of implementation. It is recommended that others test the model for usefulness and possible improvement. Further application should support its practicality for urban as well as for rural settings. (Author)",

The idea for such a project came from the fact that agency guidance consultants often discovered exemplary practices by accident. Sometimes these were small, innovative projects carried out by a zealous individual or a few staff members in one school, and sometimes they were systemwide programs. The Division of Guidance Services decided there should be a systematic attempt to find such practices and give them additional recognition. This publication is the result of that attempt. Its purpose is to highlight 30 selected examples of innovative approaches to guidance and to serve as an example to other educators  who look for ways to increase their guidance services to students. Projects selected are categorized into six groups: Elementary Schools, Middle Schools, High Schools, All Levels, Schools Without Counselors, and Schools with Guidance Associates.

Results confirmed predictions and supported Crandall's (1969) findings that women students underestimate future performance on intellective and academic tasks while men tend to overestimate  it. Women tended to report grades as overrepresenting their ability, men as underrepresenting their ability. Men were also more likely than women to expect at least a \"B\" average in college and honors at graduation.

Group sessions of four children each were taped while the children worked on tasks such as assembling a jigsaw puzzle or building something with Tinkertoys. The recordings were then coded blindly and analyzed statistically. All three studies showed a tendency for children who have high others-concepts to be more cooperative and friendly in small groups than children with low others-concepts. Some of the factors which were explored in these studies were sex  of children, teachers' judgements of their socioeconomic status and intelligence, and variations in the group task. The data from all three studies demonstrate that the others-concept is predictive of group trends and therefore a significant theoretical construct for helping school psychologists to understand children's behavior.

The general hypotheses of the study are that (1) normal subjects respond differentially to the behavior of depressed patients; (2) this differential response is due to the fact that the target individuals are depressed, and not that they are patients; and (3) this pattern can be related to the symtomology of depression. More specifically, it was hypothesized that depressed persons induce depression and hostility in others, and consequently are rejected socially. The experiment involved a single telephone conversation between paired women. One women of each pair was a college student, the other was either a depressed outpatient of a mental health center, a nondepressed  outpatient, or a control group member. These conversations were then rated on various dimensions and a measure of postconversation mood was completed by each participant. The results are supportive of the hypotheses, and are discussed in terms of their implications. (SJL)",

The person who fills the role of vocational guidance specialist must be aware of the potential roles that each group within the educational system can play in fostering needed guidance services, and must serve as a catalyst for bringing these resources together into a viable program. To do this, the author posits that the specialist must have an in-depth and practical understanding of the educational system, the world of work, the individual and the process of vocational development, and procedures for bringing people together in a common effort. For purposes of providing insight into the breadth and level of this  person's understanding, the author provides a comprehensive description of relevant competencies. (SJL)",

Positive attentional cues are defined as positively-valenced descriptors of the feared stimulus. Two groups of two subjects each were assessed as to the intensity of their fear responses (snake phobia) along behavioral and cognitive dimensions. After two relaxation sessions, the standard treatment and experimental groups received the same desensitization treatment with one exception: the hierarchy of the experimental group was supplemented with a positive attentional cue. The results indicated that while both groups improved on the behavioral measures, the experimental group's improvement  was somewhat greater.

Instead of training students how to do evaluation, graduate programs stubbornly adhere to the experimental research-scientist model. Research generates further research with little effect upon clinical practice. An alternate training paradigm based on the scientist-practitioner model is necessary. If evaluators are to be successful, they need a knowledge in program evaluation, environmental assessment, political processes, organizational theory, and research design. Evaluators also need interpersonal skills. Will graduate training meet the challenge of  the 70's and train students in program evaluation and environmental assessment? (Author)",

Subjects were 146 females who were led to be either truthful or deceptive verbally to a confederate. The underlying affective state of the subjects and the publicness of the interaction between subject and confederate were also varied experimentally. The nonverbal behavior of the subjects was analyzed using objective scoring by trained coders and by showing samples of subjects' behavior to naive judges who rated how pleased the subjects appeared. Results showed that nonverbal behavior tended to reflect whether a subject was dissembling or being truthful. In addition, when they were truthful, subjects revealed their underlying affective states. However, when lying, there was no difference in  nonverbal behavior according to the affect felt for the confederate. The nonverbal behavior of the subjects also tended to differ according to whether they were interacting publicly or privately; in public, subjects appeared more pleased with the confederate than in private.

Scores are compared using a t-test for significant differences. Findings indicated that the groups differed in two areas of adjustment: one area of personal adjustment, manifestation of nervous symptoms, and one area of social adjustment, community relations; in both cases the children whose fathers did not return were indicating poorer adjustment.

The approach attempts to relate individual dynamics to the interpersonal context of the marital relationship. The therapist's function is to facilitate the marital partners' recognition of their needs, feelings, and expectations, and to help them express these fully to their partners. The general aims of the approach are to help each partner find ways to have his needs  met without interfering with the satisfactions of the other, and find ways to help satisfy each other's needs.

The 279 protocols (93 ss X 3 cues = 279) were coded blindly for existence of conflict and evaluation of outcome. Interrater reliability was 96 percent. Cochran's Q analyses indicate that more stories with conflict were told to the girl-friend/wife role and more stories with negative outcomes were told to the mother role cue.

The author examines the historical framework of professionalism, outlines the philosphical, legal, and ethical issues, and stresses the need for accountability and continuing education. While the professional associations should set the standards for continuing education, it is recommended that the universities be responsible for planning and developing continuing education programs.

Certain aspects of \"ego\" do have a verifiable existence and lead to beneficial results: people do seem to exist, or have aliveness, for a number of years, and they also have self-consciousness, or awareness of their existence. In this sense, they have uniqueness, ongoingness, and \"ego.\" But what they usually call their \"self\" or \"totality\" or \"personality\" has a vague, almost indefinable quality, and they cannot legitimately give it a single meaningful rating--cannot label it as \"good\" or \"bad.\" They may well have good or  bad traits--characteristics that help or hinder them in their goals of survival and happiness--but they really have no \"self\" that \"is\" good or bad. To increase their health and happiness, RET theory and practice recommends that they'd better resist the tendency to rate their \"self\" or \"essence\" and had better rate only their deeds, traits, acts, characteristics, and performances.

        "description":"Nouns are generally recalled and recognized better in memory tasks, although several theoretical positions and a variety of empirical tasks indicate the importance of verbs to sentences. To try to resolve this paradox, several experiments were designed to explore the efficiency of various sentence elements as cues in recognition memory. Subjects for the experiments were students enrolled in an introductory psychology course at Dartmouth College. In one experiment concreteness of the stimuli did not interact with the type of distractor; however, verb phrase changes were harder to recognize than noun phrase changes when synonym distractors were used. This result was replicated in two other experiments, a forced-choice recognition paradigm and an experiment involving whole sentences  where the derivational similarity of verbs and nouns was controlled. Two additional experiments indicated that the effect could not be attributed to characteristics of the English language or to superior memory for form information in nouns. The total results are interpreted as suggesting that subjects process different parts of a sentence to different semantic levles, with verbs receiving more semantic representation and nouns more orthographic or phonological representation.

In  general, the sixth graders reported that they and their parents engaged in many reading activities. The favorite themes of the children were mystery, adventure, and horror. Analysis of compositions collected from a sample of eighth graders showed that most of the students can write a coherent narrative of acceptable prose.

The significant difference between the ninth-grade good readers' and the ninth-grade slow readers' performance on A Test of Sentence Meaning (ATSM), developed by Albert D. Marcus, clearly shows that comprehension of syntactic structure is an element in total reading comprehension. The low correlation between the total reading scores and the ATSM score would seem to indicate that it is not an important factor in reading at this level. The correlation of .70 between reading and the ATSM indicates that comprehension of syntactic structures is an important reading factor for sixth grade readers even on a  survey reading test. It is suggested that the great difference in the correlations between the sixth-grade readers and the ninth-grade readers indicates that although these two groups measure on The Nelson Reading Test to be very similar with the same range and almost the same means, they must differ in at least one important respect.

In the first plan a reading consultant tutored childen individually in a reading clinic. In the second plan a master reading teacher provided aid in diagnosis, prescription, and individualization of instruction to classroom teachers who taught the remedial readers in their own classrooms. Intensive inservice education was conducted during the three years for the participating teachers; a reading materials center was established; and the reading clinic resources were made available to all teachers. A control group was selected the second year and did not receive program treatment. The  results indicated that teacher competency increased in terms of five of six behavioral objectives. In the first year no statistical difference could be demonstrated in favor of children receiving special reading treatment at the clinic when compared to like children receiving regular classroom instruction. During the last two years of the experiment, students in the regular classrooms, whose teachers were involved in inservice sessions and who had the help of master teachers, demonstrated greater gains than the other two groups. *MKM)",

A study conducted by the author which employed the author constructed Teacher Effort Scale in Reading indicated that high teacher effort correlated positively with the reading achievement of classes. The teachers judged to be high effort versus low effort teachers in reading expended a high degree of effort while attempting to individualize instruction in their classes. Four subscales of the rating scale noted efforts to: (1) secure and utilize a variety of materials; (2) provide differentiated instruction; (3) keep records of student progress; and  (4) arrange conferences dealing with an individual student's progress. The success of the high effort teacher in the study cited lends increased support for the training of teachers to William Powell's &quot;automatic&quot; level where the teacher blends knowledge and action together and to Arthur Gates' observance in 1937 that success in reading depends on the effectiveness of the teacher, the availability and effective use of materials, and the adherence to individual differences.

Determination of grade level of all Rate Training Manuals and Non-Resident Career Courses had been requested by the Chief of Naval Education and Training Support. The devices compared were the Automated Flesch Count (AFC) developed by Kincaid and McDaniel and The Navy Automated Counter (NAC), a pencil-like stylus with a pressure-sensitive switch, developed by the Navy. Comparisons were made between the speed and reliability of the automated devices, and between the speed and reliability of each device and the manual method of counting data points.  Similar reliabilities were found for both of the devices and for the manual method. Counts made using the devices were done almost twice as fast as manual counts. The NAC was 20% faster than the AFC, but this difference may be attributable to a practice advantage. The use of an automated device such as the NAC or AFC is recommended as being the most cost-effective technique available for any readability study which involves detailed counting. (MKM)",

The data was analyzed and median word recognition scores were computed across levels of readability for various bands of comprehension. Subjects were asked to read two comparable passages at each level, one orally at sight and the other silently by sight. The  results indicated that most second and fifth graders needed to achieve a word recognition score of at least 98 or 99 percent on the oral passage in order to have an accompanying comprehension score of at least 75 percent on the silent passage. Most second graders who achieved less than 92 percent recognition had accompanying comprehension scores of less than 50 percent. Most fifth graders who achieved less than 96 percent had accompanying comprehension scores of less than 50 percent. (Author/MKM)",

The diagnostic information needed includes basic skills as well as attitudes toward reading  and reading interests. Sources for obtaining this information include a variety of group methods, such as administering standardized intelligence and achievement tests, and individual procedures, such as administering a miscue analysis inventory and holding individual conferences.

Conducted in an elementary classroom, the test involved having each student read five cloze passages and answer an interest questionnaire about the passages. The experimental variable in this study was choice of topics on a reading task. Children were assigned to either a cued choice, blind choice, or no-choice condition. In the cued choice condition, children chose their reading topics from among alternatives which were clearly labeled. The blind choice condition offered them a choice, but from among alternatives that were in blank folders so that they had no information about the alternatives. The no-choice condition assigned the selections to be read on a  random basis. The analysis of central interest in this study was a sex by condition analysis of variance. The performance means were fairly low overall and were similar in magnitude for both sexes. However, the boys in the cued choice condition performed substantially better than the boys in the blind choice and no-choice conditions. The girls had no apparent pattern which could be related to the manipulation of the choice variable. (MKM)",

A review of the readability literature reveals numerous studies performed on content area textbooks but relatively few studies performed on literacy materials. Three questions are asked: (1) What is the Dale-Chall readability level of each power builder? (2) What is the average Dale-Chall readability level of each color level? and (3) Do the Dale-Chall readability levels for each color level correspond to the readability levels asserted by the publisher? A computer analysis of the power builders indicates that: (1) readability scores for individual power builders range from grade 4.0 to grade 14.0; (2) the average readability score for  each level ranges from grade 5.8 to grade 12.2; and (3) the average Dale-Chall readability score for all levels is .2 to 1.4 years higher than the publisher-determined grade level. It was discovered that the readability scores in any one level cover a wide range. The smallest range occurs in purple--3.4 years, while the largest range occurs in aqua--6.5 years. Recommendations are made for application of the research findings and the revision of the Dale-Chall formula. (Author/MKM)",

Contents are divided into three main sections. The guidelines for treatment of the sexes focus on general content, language usage, and avoiding sex stereotypes in art. The guidelines for treatment of races and minorities deal with general content, content for specific groups (Black Americans, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and Jewish Americans), and avoiding racial and minority stereotypes in art for the same groups. The subject area guidelines concentrate on avoiding sexism and racism in 11 key classroom areas of study: reading;  general social studies; elementary social studies; high school social studies; literature; grammar, composition, and spelling; foreign language; family life (home economics); mathematics; science; and music. Each of the sections in the booklet's guidelines gives detailed examples of negative and positive treatment. (JM)",

        "description":"All sixth grade pupils in the largest elementary school in New Orleans were involved in a study to assess the effects of social reinforcement on the use of library books. The number of library books used by both experimental and control groups was ascertained and compared. Standard arithmetic procedures were used to establish baseline, experimental, and postexperimental phases for the study. The treatment for the experimental classes consisted of social reinforcement in the form of praise by the librarian when the pupils returned their borrowed library books to the librarian personally instead of placing the books in the usual place. The members of the classes not having used library books were ignored. It was concluded that social reinforcement can (a) increase the utilization  of library books by sixth grade pupils and (b) it can increase proper care and prompt returning of library books by sixth grade pupils.

        "description":"Information is presented in this paper regarding suprasegmental features of Black English thay may cause reading interference for some Black children. Much of the research concerning reading problems of many Afro-American students stresses the segmental differences of the phonology, the morphology, the syntax, and lexical selection between two dialects of American English referred to as Black English and Standard English. Not enough attention has been given to suprasegmental features of Black English such as intonation (pitch, stress, and juncture), prosody, and loud-speaking. Black English is a speech that has common African core elements fused with English. The process of the fusion begins with American languages through a pidginization stage, through a creolization stage (the  language called Gullah), to a decreolization stage, to the output-Black English. One can assume that some African language features have been retained and research studies are cited showing that suprasegmental features, especially pitch, are important to the understanding of Black English. Pitch has semantical as well as phonemic significance; certain intonational patterns in Black English may be misunderstood by white teachers who are checking comprehension through oral reading.

This project served 7,698 pupils. The design of the instructional format of the Reading Strategy Project was one which utilized a criterion-referenced diagnostic reading test, locally constructed, to identify degrees of accuracy within sub-skill areas of comprehension, vocabulary, auditory discrimination, syllabication, beginning and ending sounds, blending, and sound discrimination. Special teachers provided help to the classroom teachers. Evaluation was directed toward determination from test data and the subjective opinions of parents, teachers, principals, and project staff the extent to which the project had met its  product objectives. Some of the findings drawn from the evaluation procedures were: (1) Based on a sample of 85 students, it was determined that 82 percent of fourth grade and 80 percent of fifth grade participants attained the objective criteria based upon 80 percent mastery of the Diagnostic Reading Probe posttest; (2) Fifty-three percent of the sample maintained and/or increased their stanine status from third to fourth grade; and (3) Increased positive attitudes toward reading were observed by teachers.

Subjects for this research were eight normal readers, reading above the 46th percentile on the Davis Reading Test Form 1-A, used as a control group and sixteen abnormal readers drawn from a junior college remedial reading center, who tested at the 1st to 25th percentile. The abnormal group was split into two sub-groups termed hypotensive or hypertensive according to their behavior during reading. Physiological data were collected during the reading process using a polygraph machine and a psychogalvanoscope. The data introduced evidence to the effect that two opposing, coping behaviors are evidently associated with long  term reading dysfunction. The first is a hypotensive reaction indicating a drop below the normal activation or arousal necessary for optimal processing of information, registration and storage to occur. The other reaction is one of hypertensiveness where all arousal mediating sympathetic nervous system factors are activated into an alarm reaction, making it equally difficult to attend to external stimuli and information processing as during reading. The control group exhibited a moderate range of emotions. (MKM)",

This interpretive study combines an examination of relevant literature and field observations of several ongoing peer tutoring programs in a guide for school personnel. The guide contains descriptions of both structured and flexible approaches to tutoring in reading (8 programs), all subjects (3 programs), spelling/English  (1 program), and math (1 program). It also provides suggestions for teachers on how to design and implement a program of peer tutoring which is responsive to the particular needs of their individual classrooms.

The study of new subscribers and those cancelling their subscriptions demonstrates that readers take a newspaper for both news coverage (content) and for psychological satisfaction (relaxation and enjoyment), but that they stop taking the newspaper mainly because of unsatisfactory delivery service, the cost of the newspaper, and lack of time to read the newspaper. While the  decision to subscribe to a newspaper is usually a joint one, the decision to stop seems to be rather evenly divided among husbands, wives, and joint agreements. Husbands and wives seem to take the newspaper for about the same reasons, but to stop it for slightly different reasons.

The data for these inquiries were collected from various groups of people in Finland. The first chapter discusses the background of the report. The second chapter discusses the structure of gratifications, examining such topics as dimensions of gratifications associated with mass media use and summarizing the conclusions.  The third chapter discusses dimensions of gratifications and content choices, examining such topics as relationships between gratification dimensions and content choices with respect to newspapers and summarizes the conclusions. The fourth chapter discusses education and the dimensions of gratifications and content choices. The fifth chapter contains a summary and final conclusions. (TS)",

The subjects for the survey were television owners and non-owners in Lapland. The questions dealt with in this descriptive survey are the following: what is the significance attached by people to television and what are the functions which they consider television to fulfil for them; how does the introduction of television affect conceptions as to the significance and functions of the other mass media; what advance ideas do people have as to the importance and functions of television, and how do these advance ideas correspond to their actual experience; and  what are the factors underlying the conception of television as significant in general and as a means of fulfilling certain functions, such as the transmission of news, general information, art and entertainment.

        "description":"The traditions of the Chinese press in Malaysia go back 160 years to Malaysia's first Chinese-language newspaper, considered by scholars as the first modern periodical anywhere. Since then, this press has aided Christian missionary efforts in China and Southeast Asia, helped develop permanent Chinese communities in the Malay peninsula, called for both reformist and revolutionary movements in China, fought against the Japanese during World War II, and supported the formation of a Malaysian state--all the while trying to retain valuable aspects of Chinese culture. Currently, the Malaysian Chinese community is served by 26 newspapers (23 are dailies), a few local magazines, a Chinese section of Radio Malaysia, and a daily Chinese newscast and limited drama on television. Readership  of Chinese papers is the highest of any ethnic press in the country. In the future, most of the Chinese papers, falling under the ownership of Alliance government parties, will have to report according to government standards and, while Chinese broadcasts could be diminished because of language restrictions, it would be a long time before Chinese would be discarded as a broadcast language.

In trying to account for these facts, it may be seen that in the United States international news coverage and usage are: often determined by considerations of international diplomacy, national government and military policies, and  historical-cultural heritage; often crisis oriented; often affected by censorship policies and image building activities of other countries; affected by a dwindling corps of adequately trained correspondents abroad and by globally blind editors cemented to their swivel chairs stateside; and guided by an American public not generally noted for being cosmopolitan or well informed on world affairs.

In the first of two experiments using both male and female tenth grade students, the degree of divergence between instances showed that contrasting irrelevant features resulted in better performance than matching irrelevant features. The data analysis from experiment 2 showed that when two contextually similar rules were learned simultaneously, student performance was superior to that of students who learned the rules successively. When the students were provided with an analysis of how a given instance represented the application of a grammatical rule, performance was better than without this analysis. The results were discussed in relationship to a  prescriptive theory of instruction. (Author/LL)",

Two courses were combined: English for students needing intensive help and English for students with somewhat better skills. All students began working with transformational based materials to develop effective sentence structure and moved on to workbooks which presented principles for writing narrative-descriptive, expository, and argumentative essays. All students were urged to progress as quickly as possible, with 100 students expected to complete the program in one semester and 105 expected to take two semesters. Little group instruction took place. Pretest and  posttest scores, grades, and student questionnaires indicated significant improvement in writing skills and a generally favorable attitude toward the program, with dissatisfaction in the grammar component. Recommendations include changes in the method of teaching grammar, development of additional or alternate language skills units, and more group activities to complement the individual work.

To assess the usefulness of Katz and Kahn's scheme, data derived from a sample of more than 4,000 organizations in Wisconsin were analyzed to determine whether the structure and function of communication systems used by people-processing and object-processing organizations vary systematically. The analysis focused on variances in measures of the structure and function of the water-use (task-oriented) communication systems used by these different types of organizations. The research findings support the proposition that an  organization's through-put will significantly influence the structure and function of the organization's task-oriented communication system. Object-processing organizations in this study scored significantly higher on the data acquisition index than people-processing organizations. Also, the evidence indicates that object-processing organizations place much more emphasis on data transportation than do people-processing organizations, probably due to the immediate demands of the marketplace.

Thirty-three Wisconsin state senators served as subjects along with 1,650 Wisconsin citizens who were interviewed via telephone regarding their views. The political public relations environment in a rural setting is one of high surveillance. Rural senators become quite accurate in their assessment of the voting public, and opinion agreement seems to become a precondition to reelection. Urban senators, on the other hand, do not display the same sensitivity to constituents. They come into office about as discrepant from the views of their constituents as are new rural senators, and they seem to stay that way.

During the Saturday morning hours of tawdry animated cartoons, children are bombarded with frequent interruptions for commercials advertising artificially flavored and colored snacks, candy, cereals, soft drinks, and flashy toys. (Only three countries in the world allow any advertising with children's programs and only the United States allows more advertising with children's programs than with  adult programs.) Furthermore, children--even very young ones--spend the bulk of their viewing time watching adult programs, most of which feature violence, crime, mystery, and brutality. There are a number of effective steps which schools, teachers, and parents may and must take to reduce children's viewing time and to promote critical and selective viewing among children. (JM)",

James Carey sees advertising's basic institutional function as market information and the secondary function as social control; Vincent Norris views the institution's function as being an instrument of attempted market control for producers. David Potter sees the institution as an instrument of social control in an abundant society; and to C. H. Sandage, the institution's purpose is to inform and persuade people in order to help achieve abundance. (JM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to examine deception in advertising from a behavioral perspective, and to attempt to formulate a definition that can guide both research and governmental regulation. Whether or not an advertisement is said to be &quot;deceptive&quot; depends on the definition of deception being used. The position advocated here is that the focus of any definition must be the receiver of the message. Based on the analysis of veridical preception, a definition of deception in advertising is offered. An approach to measuring deception is also offered. The techniques are all seen as screening techniques, although by their regular use, advertisers should improve the ability of their advertisements to reach their stated objectives as well as reduce the amount of deception.

Two approaches to clarifying values are the values clarification approach (Louis Raths, Merrill Harmon, and Sidney Simon) and the moral development approach (Lawrence Kohlberg). The goal of values clarification activities, in which students choose among options on rating scales, values continuums, value statements, etc., is to help students become aware of their own values. Kohlberg's approach, based on a theory of logical and cognitive development, defines six stages of moral reasoning as bases for student development from  one stage to a higher one. Both of these approaches suggest a number of ways for helping students gain an awareness of their own values and of the processes of moral reasoning in responding to literature. (JM)",

Section 315 is the major legislation governing the use of the broadcasting media in the area of politics. The underlying philosophy of the law is that people have a right to a full and complete disclosure of conflicting views of news of interest. The essence of the law is that if a broadcaster allows one candidate for public office the use of broadcast facilities, an equal opportunity to all other candidates for the same office must be afforded. Many of the problems with this law are discussed including the fact that stations are not required to provide any air time at all for candidates running for public office, sometimes there are a large number of candidates running for a particular  office, and the incumbent usually has an advantage over the challenger due to news coverage of both political and nonpolitical activities while the incumbent is in office. A case study of the Humphrey-McGovern debates during the California Presidential Primary in 1972 is presented and discussed. The results and conclusions of the study and recommendations based on the conclusions are presented. (TS)",

The survey indicates that WBGU-TV attracted one out of ten households throughout the expanded viewing area after its power was expanded. In those areas reached by WBGU-TV before its power was increased, more than 15 percent of the households were weekly viewers. The audience expanded despite lack of familiarity with the station in previously unreached areas, UHF channel location, and reception problems  related to incorrect antenna orientation.

All the schools were located in Administrative District 1 of the Philadelphia School District. Data measuring the effects of the articulation project were generated through the use of surveys, student questionnaires, and official school records.

School board minutes were examined and demands were analyzed for a six-month period under the appointed school board, then compared to demands for six months under the elected school board. Results of the analysis showed significant differences in the control functions of the appointed and elected school boards in 6 of 15 demand areas. Of these, the elected school board was more responsive in the three areas of new teaching methods, student behavior, and community services. There were distinct differences in the control functions performed by the appointed and  elected boards. However, only demands for new teaching methods were both quantitatively and qualitatively different under the elected board. There was strong evidence that the school board does exert political control in processing its decisions. This seems to disagree with some earlier studies, but the earlier studies concentrated only on money demands. By broadening the spectrum of demands analyzed, the present study found significant differences in political control functions that earlier studies had missed. (Author/JG)",

In this paper, the author offers arguments and statistics to refute these two assumptions. He presents demographic evidence of a recent trend toward greater racial equality and asserts that this trend makes radical solutions like compulsory busing unnecessary. And the fact that members of many racial and ethnic groups tend to cluster together voluntarily, he argues, shows the folly of striving for the equal distribution of minority groups  throughout our society.

Perhaps there is a need for an educational system that is not directed toward specific, predetermined goals. It seems that educators have adapted the engineering and management applications of general systems theory. Instead of extending systems theory to education, educators have adapted and adopted other field's applications. Almost all these borrowed applications are linear program models capable of attaining one specific product. The a priori establishment of relatively fixed objectives is characteristic of most &quot;systems&quot; instruction, but useful goal statements are hard to come by in education. A possible alternative is to adapt general systems theory  itself, rather than its applications. Both summative and formative feedback may be used to refine and redefine goals, rather than to simply accept or reject the entire engineered system, as is often done now. Instead of trying to agree on where education should be pointing learners, educators can agree on mechanisms for making all decisions within the operating system. (Author/JG)",

He identifies two major changes that have affected school integration since 1954--a change in residential patterns that has increased segregation in recent years, and a change in the idea of what constitutes desegregation. The courts have changed the \"rules of the game,\" he argues, by confusing the essentially different goals of eradicating legally sanctioned segregation and overcoming the educational handicaps of blacks that have resulted from official and unofficial discrimination. The author asserts that, because of white flight to the suburbs, efforts to achieve compulsory racial balance in the schools will  succeed only where there is sufficient community support for the idea. A more realistic alternative, he suggests, is to attack the effects of residential discrimination by adopting a voluntary \"integrating transfer\" plan that permits children to attend any school in their metropolitan area, so long as they transfer to a school with a smaller proportion of persons from their race.

In a five-year period, 341 young persons were committed to Maryland juvenile institutions for the crime of truancy. During the same time, 2,699 young people were committed to institutions because they were considered to be \"Children in Need of Supervision\" (CINS), which includes truants, runaways, and children deemed to be ungovernable. It is reasonable to assume that some of the people who were committed for being runaways and ungovernable have had problems with truancy. Thirty-four percent of all Maryland delinquents committed were in the CINS category. If students were not compelled to attend school, the monetary  savings from truant officers and their staffs, vandalism, and incarceration of young people would be more than enough to achieve the American dream of free public education for all of our people. Further, there would be more money for compensatory and specialized educational programs that are often prohibitively expensive with the present law. (Author/RT)",

The purpose of the exemption was to enable selected districts to establish pilot programs using differentiated staffing patterns without loss of state funds. The five districts selected to begin the program in the 1971-72 school year were Cupertino Elementary, Fresno Unified, Newport-Mesa Unified, Ocean View Elementary, and San Jose Unified. San Jose requested to be dropped from the program in 1973 and was replaced by Monrovia Unified. Each district has submitted a report listing its objectives, describing its program and activities, and summarizing  its results. Summary descriptions are presented in Appendix A of this report. Four basic objectives have been common to all five districts--to reduce the pupil-adult ratio by increasing the number of adults in the classroom, to individualize instruction to meet the unique educational needs of each child, to increase community involvement in the schools, and to increase the reading and mathematics achievement of students in participating schools. All five districts reported successful programs. (Author/IRT)",

The framework included the formulation of a set of categories that include all aspects of activities and experiences that define the quality of life in America. The second was to utilize the participants in the Project TALENT national survey to provide a longitudinal perspective on the individuals studied. The third was to select a nationally representative  sample of persons who were 15 years old in 1960. The fourth was the adoption of these 30-year-olds' quality of life and their performance in present roles as the criteria against which to evaluate the effectiveness of their educational experiences. The last was using the individual as the unit of analysis.

Too often the key element of \"administrative presence\" is missing. An \"administratively present\" leader is able to conceptualize within his system, interact with the human elements of the system, and actualize his concepts in such a way that the human elements understand and support the actualization. The important opposite of administrative presence is \"administrative absenteeism.\" Three types of administrative absenteeism are commonly observed in educational systems. Physical absenteeism entails the physical absence of the leader from his assigned leadership role. Psychological absenteeism often involves a leader who  adheres rigidly to an absolute set of beliefs, and is further manifested by a gap between what the leader believes and what his staff believes. Philosophical absenteeism manifests itself in deep-seated philosophical differences between the leader's belief system and the belief system of some or all of the other individuals composing the educational team.

Most of the paper describes a performance-based, criterion-referenced student evaluation system developed at Concord High School in Wilmington, Delaware. The Concord system employs formative evaluation, which results in interim progress reports of a student's work in each subject area, and summative evaluation, which summarizes a student's work for an entire course and evaluates his level of achievement. Both the formative and summative evaluations evaluate students on an individual, noncompetitive basis, without using  traditional grades, grade point averages, or class rankings. Samples of both the formative and summative evaluation report forms developed at Concord are included. The author emphasizes the importance of contacting college admissions officers before implementing an alternative student evaluation system; he reports that 90 percent of the colleges surveyed indicated their acceptance of the new Concord system.

An observational checklist was used on the same large sample. Data were gathered from 700 classrooms and 867 teachers in 30 schools in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Fort Worth, Texas. The researcher's goal was to find the relationship between the spatial characteristics of public school classrooms and alternative modes of teaching and the staff's perceptions of the learning climate. The findings reveal that alternative teaching modes do increase in more open-spaced classrooms. Also, teachers tend to view open-space, high-achieving, smaller schools with ongoing human relations programs for staff as more open.  (Author/MLF)",

The predicted life cycles matched the actual historical data very well in five of the six cases.

The author systematically critiques the Esman model in terms of its (1) specificity to the universe of institution building, (2) generalizability across societies and cultures, (3) ability to discriminate between varied institution building situations and tasks, (4) utility for strategizing and engineering, (5) ability to focus not only on the client system but also on the nature and structure of the system of advice, (6) ability to include dual focus on internal organizational design and external institutional interfaces, (7) mobility in shifting analysis between molecular and molar  configurations, and (8) utility for explanation and operationalization. The author concludes that although the Esman model has made a valuable contribution to the study of institution building in the past, the time is ripe for a new conceptual leap in the field.

Data were collected from a random sample of 324 Wisconsin school districts with professional staffs ranging from 30 to 500 members. A six-indicator index was developed to measure the comprehensiveness of collective negotiations in each district. This negotiations index and 11 other determinant variables were studied in relation to 10 different measures of teacher salaries. Stepwise multiple regression analysis found negative correlations between the collective negotiations index and all levels of scheduled and actual teacher salaries. The authors concluded that collective negotiations do not have a significant positive effect on teacher salaries in  Wisconsin and that a negative effect is likely. In addition, they found that socioeconomic conditions in a school district, especially level of personal income and percentage of urban population, have the strongest positive impact on teacher salaries.

First, a thorough needs assessment should be made of the school and community. From this assessment should follow a set of goals and needs that provide the broad guidelines for all school activities. To maintain individual school autonomy, each school should perform the goals and needs assessment. The needs assessment process should be tailored specifically for the needs and resources of the individual school and district. In order to carry out objectives and move towards established goals or needs, a set of programs will be necessary to link the school's activities to its goals, needs, and  objectives. Finally, budget relates expenditures to the various programs. Cost accounting methods should be employed as necessary. Activities should be continually monitored to determine whether objectives are being met at the best cost-effective ratio. Goals, needs, objectives, programs, and budgets must be continually reviewed, because school needs will change. (Author/JG)",

But in Canada, liberalism must vie with touches of Toryism and socialism; as a result, the common good receives more formal attention than in the U.S. The extent of variation in local financial resources for education is potentially under the control of both state and provincial governments. However, in recent years, Canadian provinces have acted more decisively in educational finance than have American states. In Canada, equality means equality of condition; in the U.S., equality means equality of opportunity. The energy crisis and other global crises are forcing the U.S. and other liberal fragment societies to face the future they escaped when they split off from Europe. Reentry  into the full political spectrum is likely to pose greater problems for the U.S. than for Canada, with its relatively wider political spectrum. The major hope in the U.S. lies in the continued redefinition of equality from equality of opportunity to equality of condition. If this redefinition occurs, educational finance will probably be one of the first beneficiaries. (Author/JG)",

Power is used to explain individual, group, and institutional behavior as well as the statics and dynamics of societies. The paper is addressed especially to educators because education is shown to be education in power. Distribution of educational goods in a society is a process of ascribing power to particular individuals, groups, communities, and classes. Significant educational change is a process of substituting old power arrangements with new ones, and educational policy-making is a development of statements by the elite in a society expressing intentions to direct and harness the power of education for particular outcomes. It is suggested that all  individuals should develop their powers to the maximum, should learn to experience power without necessarily having to exercise it on others, and should exercise power with all moral compunctions.

Teachers can be hired on the basis of midyear projections; also some teachers can be employed on a one-semester basis. Considerable savings can be obtained by renting out surplus classrooms and office space to other governmental agencies and to private firms. Districts are advised to utilize each school as fully as possible and dispose of all empty buildings. Early retirement programs assist older teachers to have economic security, save the schools money, and release jobs for younger teachers. Savings can be effected by decentralizing budget accounts. The accounts establish limits for services and products, making the local school unit accountable.  (Author/MLF)",

The freedom of thought, self-expression, and creative activity that characterized the humanistic schools are considered to be the fundamental bases of education today. A brief description is given of brutalization and inhumaneness in education, typified at its worst by the English public schools of the 17th and 18th centuries. The concluding section of the work discusses the humanizing aspects of education as a greater personal concern for the student as an individual in his own right. To humanize educational administration, according to the authors, is to create a permissive atmosphere within which an individual can feel free to make his own unique  contribution. (MLF)",

Schools have adopted modern corporation and military management models. Women unhappy about the status quo must learn about power, both theoretically and practically, in order to change their position in the world of education and find the tools for institutional change within the schools. Women can (1) collect the qualifications necessary to be a legitimate contender for a place in the school power hierarchy; (2) summarize the research negating that administration is a male job; and (3) if necessary file legal complaints. Women in administration can provide a much-needed service by becoming participant observers and compiling handbooks  and case studies of real experiences with power structures and leadership styles.

        "description":"The author makes three assumptions in discussing the effect of collective negotiations on teachers' sense of alienation: first, alienation is a multidimensional concept that, in this context, is taken to derive from within the organizational setting of the school system; second, school systems are organized as bureaucracies containing more or less the general characteristics of Weber's \"ideal type\" bureaucracy; and third, negotiations in school systems deal with both the centralization of authority and the rule structure of the organization. The conceptual scheme based on these assumptions is that teacher alienation from work, the sense of powerlessness and meaninglessness, is related to the extent to which the bureaucratic structure of the school provides the means for teachers  to become involved in the decisions affecting the rules and regulations governing their work. The negotiation process is seen as a means whereby teachers may have increased input into the decision-making authority of the organization and, consequently, provide a rule structure that has more meaning to them. Three hypotheses are derived as a guide to further research. What is critical is the degree to which the negotiation process is truly a joint decision-making one and the nature of the rule structure that develops from the negotiations. (Author/IRT)",

Current societal pressures would seem to indicate that successful planning and implementation of the cultural-educational cluster concept will probably begin in a nonpolitical, nonprivate sector area. In most cases, the central institution will be the public educational system. The services to be clustered will need to be identified by a community planning group emerging from the community, service, and governmental sectors. For example, public health service, public welfare service, private secondary schools, drug abuse programs funded by private foundations, the urban education section of a local university,  and the public school system can all combine to plan successfully the cultural-educational cluster project. Appropriately motivated, a community can conserve its resources, become fiscally responsible, and render a much higher proportion of good service to its citizens through the careful, coherent planning and implementation of the self-sustaining, self-sufficient cultural-educational services cluster.

After a survey of the past, which shows that city schooling has improved, the author briefly discusses the present before moving to consider the future. He presents five elements to a successful resolution of the problems of big city education: (1) stabilization of school  enrollment, (2) achieving a democratic pluralism in school policy and practice, (3) a metropolitan area civil-educational system, (4) an active role for teachers organizations in policy-making, and (5) broad-based planning and changes in the bureaucracy.

        "description":"There are three very important factors that contribute substantially to urban fiscal problems in providing educational services. First, at the same time that the tax base for the cities' services is being eroded, the cities' residents are in need of and demanding greater expenditures for health services, welfare, sanitation, transportation, public housing, and all the other services required by an urban population. As a result, a smaller proportion of the city budget is available for public education than is available for educating the children in wealthier communities. Second, city education budget items are more costly than such items are elsewhere. Third, the socioeconomic characteristics of the urban school population require greater expenditure than other school populations.  The combination of these factors results in less education per dollar in the city than in suburban or rural areas. (Author/IRT)",

This strategy was explored in the form of a collaborative enterprise. Eighteen schools in southern California and the research division of the Institute for Development of Educational Activities, Inc., (IDEA), engaged in the internal process of self-renewal in each school through sustained dialogue, decision-making, action, and evaluation on the part of the entire faculty under the leadership of the principal. This involved a network of schools within which ideas, resources, and practices were developed and exchanged; a continuous self-directed  seminar in which the principals discussed their problems and developed necessary leadership understandings, and skills; and a variety of pedagogical interchanges for teachers.

The Dissemination and Resources Group is obligated to provide educators information about the full range of alternative solutions to their problems, rather than advocating one solution above others, and is committed to working through existing educational agencies and institutions whenever possible. The  strategy of the group has three elements: first, maintaining and improving access to the complete knowledge base about education (primarily through operation of the Educational Resources Information Center--ERIC); second, building capacity for dissemination and utilization of knowledge throughout the education community (primarily through support of state departments of education); and third, supporting research, development, and evaluation needed to facilitate achievement of the other two missions.

Teachers, to be effective when the criteria of effectiveness are related to student learning of basic skills, will organize instruction differently for different subject matter areas and for different grade levels. The important concern for student learning of basic skills at the elementary level is direct teacher instruction, which may involve different types of instructional organization. The important  factor seems to be teacher instruction of the student and student attention to, and time spent on, instructional tasks. The organizational pattern and selection of materials that facilitate student attention to task and teacher involvement in instruction will be the most effective teaching procedures. Some research problems, such as measurement, are the concern of and need to be solved by researchers; others, such as the criteria of effective teaching, are the concern of and need to be addressed by all educators and concerned citizens.

Six experiments with educable and trainable mentally retarded children cover topics such as the application of associative strategies to word recognition, the effect of reinforcement on word knowledge, the effect of pictorial stimuli on word recognition, and the effects of animation on word memory. Seven studies investigate such topics as the effect of a subjective  deletion scheme on reading performance of Braille and regular print readers, the application of a subjective deletion scheme to film captioning for the deaf, and a comparison of two deletion schemes on three types of prose among blind and deaf students. Major conclusions reported are that learning and retention in word recognition tasks can be facilitated by the use of associative learning strategies; and that telegraphic prose is a viable alternative to traditional educational materials for the blind, but results were not as favorable with the deaf.

        "description":"Presented is a competency based teacher education (CBTE) program for training and certification of elementary level special education teachers which represents the program development phase of the Eastern Washington Special Education Consortium. It is explained that a student must be interviewed by a three-man review committee to reach each level of certification: preparatory level--the level a trainee reaches before being allowed to student teach; initial level (normally reached on the completion of B.A. degree requirements)--allows trainee to teach the handicapped; and continuing level (equivalent to the fifth year or a graduate program)--qualifies the trainee to act as an advisor within the training program. Following an introduction in Chapter 1 on the program's historical  development, advantages of a special education CBTE program, a brief program description, and consortium by-laws, are six chapters covering program management; preparation program; and the implementation process in table form for elementary special education teachers at the preparatory, initial, and continuing levels. Included in the appendixes are program planning sheets for each of the three levels of certification, the estimated budget for first year operations, and a copy of &quot;Guidelines and Standards for the Development and Approval of Programs of Preparation Leading to the Certification of School Professional Personnel&quot;.

The program's four major objectives are outlined as identification of training needs of local schools through an assessment process; making an inventory of successful training practices in special needs for application to inservice education; development of gaming and simulation training materials in selected high need areas where programs are nonexistent; and implementation of training sessions through a college-community collaborative model. The bulk of the document is a program narrative which  covers the topics of problem description, results and benefits of the proposal, approach of the study, geographic location of the collaborative project, and backgrounds of project personnel. The benefits of the proposed activities are noted as high impact on target population, the development of improved inservice dissemination models, commitment for continued support from local school systems, specific product outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. Appended are a letter of support, and overview of the principal's training program, and an outline of a school planning game. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"Fifteen hyperkinetic children (6-12 years old) were involved in a pilot study to test B. Feingold's hypothesis that hyperkinesis may be caused by artificial flavors and colors in food. Prior to treatment, parents and teachers completed bi-weekly questionnaires regarding each Ss' behavior both on medication (pretreatment period) and when medication was discontinued (baseline period). Ss were randomly assigned to either the experimental (K-P) diet which eliminates artificial flavors, colors, and natural salicylates or a control diet for 4 weeks. The following month, each S was placed on the alternative diet. Following each diet condition, parents were interviewed, school reports were examined, and a judgment was made using the Clinical Global Impressions scale without knowledge of  diet condition. Results showed that both parents and teachers reported fewer hyperkinetic symptoms on the K-P diet as compared to pretreatment baseline; that teachers noted a highly significant reduction of symptoms on the K-P as compared to the control diet but the parents did not; and that control diet ratings did not differ from the baseline period for either parents or teachers. Although findings suggested that the K-P diet may reduce hyperkinetic symptoms, results should be viewed cautiously until further research is completed. Concluded in a critique of the pilot study by the National Institute of Education was that the behavioral outcome measures were &quot;soft&quot; and pharmacology uncertain; that the experimental design was subject to certain problems; and that the sample size did not  allow for much further analysis.

Findings included the following: More than 60 percent of chairpersons indicated that they administered categorical CBTE or NCBTE programs. The majority of students in both the CBTE and the NCBTE programs were in the bachelor's level programs. More students were enrolled in the area of mental retardation than any other category. The majority of CBTE programs were begun as a result of either federal funds or legislative mandates. The essential  program components as listed by department chairpersons were similar for both CBTE and NCBTE programs. Most CBTE programs had developed printed nonpublished instructional packages, whereas, most NCBTE programs had not developed such materials. The most frequently mentioned strongest program components for the CBTE programs were learning packets, individual study, and practicum; while practicum was listed as the strongest program component for NCBTE programs.

The model links input-output analysis and task analysis features. Introductory information includes varying impressions of cost efficiency concerns and the current status of project development. Discussed are the following elements of a cost efficiency study model: input-application-output, feedback, outcome analysis, cost allocation, pupil accounting systems, technical support systems, and related technical issues. Application of these elements in a cost efficiency system design for a local education agency is described. Reported are outcomes of pilot tests of the model and its components including simulation of resource  allocation and design of a student accounting registration procedure. Among project findings cited are problems encountered such as lack of efficient pupil accounting systems--and areas in which progress was made--such as development of task analysis classifications for special education.

        "description":"A program was designed to train college students in the use of behavior modification procedures with problem children in the classroom. Through application of social learning theory principles and operant conditioning, program trainees learned to reduce the innapropriate behavior of problem children in class, to prevent small difficulties from becoming future problems, and to maintain optimal levels of academic and social behavior. The training program consisted of four phases: pre-intervention training in observation and data collection, pre-intervention training in classroom contingency management, intervention strategy training and implementation training. Problems encountered during the pre-intervention phase (such as students \"freezing\" when being videotaped during  role-playing practices) were usually resolved while the program was being conducted on the college campus. The majority of problems took place in the public school setting and generally stemmed from a reciprocal view of incompetency existing between classroom teachers and college students. To deal with problems, a set of guidelines was developed which related to the baseline data collection phase, the intervention/teaching phase, and the relationship between participating students and the school setting. (Appended is a list of errors commonly made by poorly trained teachers attempting to carry out behavior modification programs.) (SB)",

        "description":"Matrix tasks to assess multiple classifications and multiple seriation skills were administered to 160 children (40 Ss each from preschool, kindergarten, first and second grade levels). Each child received six matrix subtasks (reproduction and transportation of cross classification I, double seriation, and cross classification II) in one of six orders of presentation. Preliminary analyses indicated a general absence of significant presentation order effects and an absence of sex differences. Grade level comparisons were significant for all subtasks except cross classification I transposition. Significantly superior performances on the reporduction when compared to the counterpart transposition subtask were shown for the cross classification I (first grade, second grade, and  combined grades), double seriation (kindergarten, first grade, second grade, and combined grades), and cross classification II (first grade and combined grades) cases. The between matrix difficulties were that in both reproduction and transposition subtasks, cross classification II was more difficult than double seriation and cross classification I. Results suggested that development in classificatory abilities may lag behind relational abilities contrary to the structural prediction of orthodox Piagetian theory. (Author/SB)",

Among findings related to content and format were that there was a need for instructional games and other manipulative materials across a variety of handicapping conditions, and that there was generally a high need for materials in language arts. Teachers' training needs were in such areas as child assessment and preparation of learning prescriptions for individual students. Person-to-person contact was found to be the most valued technique for teachers to obtain information about existing materials, and teachers preferred to receive information only about materials immediately available for use in their  classrooms. Large numbers of teachers were not prone to use materials not immediately available, and there was some evidence that teachers more often use instructional materials which have been demonstrated in their own classroom or school rather than materials they have not seen demonstrated.

The dialect analyzed is the speech of Japanese faculty members at the University of Hawaii. A speaker of Japanese must evaluate his addresses in terms of a vertical axis of power and a horizontal axis of solidarity and their respective positions before selecting the proper first and second person pronouns. Pronouns may change during a conversation as relationships are discerned. Analysis of the professors' speech revealed that men frequently use a very informal and intimate first person pronoun with friends or family; women use more polite  and less intimate pronouns with their parents than men do. Both men and women used kinship terms (&quot;mommy,&quot;&quot;daddy&quot;) instead of personal pronouns with their children. In use of second person pronouns, all males used different pronouns depending on their addressee, while 60 percent of women varied their use and 40 percent did not. Kinship terms are often used with siblings and parents, and women use a more formal pronoun ending with family and friends. (CHK)",

The research was carried out as part of the Project &quot;Language Development in Pre-School Children,&quot; directed by Gordon Wells, at the University of Bristol, School of Education. The research represents an attempt to integrate the theoretical and methodological orientations of linguistic semantics and Piagetian theory in the study of the acquisition of a limited domain of word-meanings. Detailed analyses are presented of particular strategies utilized by children at various ages and stages of development in the comprehension and production of spatial and temporal relational terms. It is suggested  that such strategies result from specific interactions between the developing systems of language, cognition and perception, the overall forms of which are determined by the socio-cultural context of the use of the relational terms. In conclusion, partial critiques are presented of one-sided applications of semantic features theories and Piagetian theory in previous explanations of the acquisition of spatial and temporal relational terms.

The aim of the long-term study is to show the place of intonation in the total system of Japanese grammar. This particular part of the study is limited to the group of intonations which are characterized by the &quot;the terminal pitch rising.&quot; The prosodic features which are possible correlates of certain grammatical functions were isolated and quantified, using a spectrograph. The samples were provided by four speakers of standard Japanese, with every informant making five recordings of each sample item. A total of eight different intonations were identified in the terminal rising group. Direct questions in Japanese, of which there are two  types, both terminating with a rising intonation, were used to demonstrate the role of this stype of intonation. The conclusion is that the question in Japanese is a response-eliciting function, specified by a terminal rising intonation. The unique logical order between question and answer is attributed to the basic function of intonation. Intonation is primarily tied in with the concurrent statement, and the response which is signaled by the rising intonation refers strictly to the affirmation or negation of that statement.

The norms of commality were established by counting every identical repetition of noun-adjective pairs. Two tables give: (1) the index of common nouns used as stimuli in the experiment; and (2) the norms of descriptive adjective responses to common nouns, including the number of repetitions for each  adjective.

Suggestions are made for the improvement of existing materials and for the development of new ones. The main problems associated with the production and usefulness of language materials are that: (1) languages change through time and therefore materials are quickly out of date; (2) teachers and students vary in goals, temperament, and techniques; and (3) language pedagogy theories are constantly evolving. In addition, intensive courses create a qualitative difference in the need for materials. Academic intensive courses, unlike those offered in the government, must be targeted equally toward speaking and reading. The majority of the students in academic courses  are preparing for higher-level research, for which they require reading proficiency in the language. In view of this, although all currently available Chinese materials could stand improvement and updating, reworking priorities should be for materials in the reading phase: (1) introductory general readers, and (2) intermediate short-form character texts especially on culture in Mainland China and updated newspaper readers. The available dictionaries seem to be adequate, but a periodic newsletter would be useful for continually updating the rapidly fluctuating political vocabulary.

        "description":"This guide is designed to assist teachers using the \"Cambridge Latin Course,\" a multimedia instructional system developed in the United Kingdom which can be adapted to the needs of pupils of varying backgrounds, ages, and abilities. The Guide focuses on Unit I, the first level of the Cambridge materials. The materials are especially suited to beginning learners of Latin in grades 7 and 8, but they may also be used with beginners in grades 9-12. The general approach to each stage in Unit I is as follows; (1) aural-oral presentation, using model sentences with visual cues and tape recording: (2) reading and writing, which involve reading aloud and little use of translation; (3) presentation of English derivatives and cognates, involving word games; (4) additional reading and  writing, again with the use of visual cues and audio tape; (5) presentation of material on culture with the use of a variety of audiovisual aids, quizzes and written games; and (6) evaluation of pupil progress at the end of each stage. The major portion of the guide consists of curriculum and teaching suggestions for each stage in Unit I, specifically Latin questions, activities, derivatives and cognates, and word games. Two appendices conclude the guide: a bibliography for teacher reference and a summary of recent research on the value of Latin in upgrading the basic skills of ppils. A form for evaluating the guide is also included. (SCC)",

        "description":"This is the first phonetics book to be developed for use in first-year French courses. The intent of the book is to help the student acquire confidence in his ability to look at 85 percent of the words in the French dictionary and be able to pronounce those words correctly, as a result of his sounding out the words. When an American student looks at a foreign word, he may associate it with letters or groups of letters in the American phonic system. After an individual has learned to read (i.e. to associate sounds with symbols), he has difficulty understanding that a letter has a different sound in another language. This becomes evident when a language teacher pronounces a foreign word, and the student displays lack of comprehension until the word is presented to him in visual  form. A concentrated comparative study of the sound-symbol correlatives in both the mother tongue and the target language makes the student aware of the similarities and differences of the sound systems of the two languages. The approach described is a systematic effort to associate the distinctively French sound with the printed letters. (Author/CLK)",

For this purpose, an observation instrument was developed which was expected to allow the study of the structure of the interaction process; it was hypothesized that such interaction would move with a certain cyclical regularity and that sequential patterns of verbal behavior would be obtained which, in descending order of occurrence, would characterize dominant interactions. A computer program was written which, following certain conditions, segments the total interaction process into strings, lifts out embedded patterns, and orders them into groups of recurrent patterns. Examples are presented  to show that sequential processing provides much more meaningful information on a classroom interaction than could hitherto be obtained from matrix analysis. The implications of research in this area for foreign language teaching are briefly discussed. (Author)",

Some generalizations are offered concerning the relationship between the meaning and the syntactic properties of these constructions. The complement structures are isolated into groups according to verb selection: (1) verbs which permit no independent selection of complement subject or tense; and (2) verbs with no restrictions on complement subject or tense. These categories are then examined for consistent semantic content. It is concluded that when tense in the embedded sentence is redundant, it is eliminated and either the infinitive or subjunctive, both essentially tenseless, is inserted. When, however, there are no restrictions, indicative  complements occur, since the indicative contains the full range of tenses. Since similar principles seem to exist in English and other Romance languages, it is suggested that some principles of economy are at work in the distribution of complement constructions.

If translation cannot be dropped entirely, it is very important for the student to accept what is typical and untranslatable in itself and to identify himself with the native speaker. Although every language has expressive functions, in Romanian in particular, expression assumes great significance. For example, redundancy is the most important problem facing the teacher of Romanian to Americans, and the teacher must convey to his students the values expressed by such redundancies. The expressive quality of Romanian is revealed in popular poetry, riddles, and metaphors, but the student needs a gradual introduction to the Romanian cultural  universe in order to form the link between the literal and the figurative in Romanian. For this reason text selection is crucial, and an anthology is needed of instructional texts. This can only be the result of long bilateral cooperation between Romanians and those interested in Romanian language and culture. (AM)",

It would therefore come as a surprise to some Greeks that Modern Greek lexical elements in Romanian have undergone a substantial stylistic demotion during the past century or so. In this paper only those words which entered Romanian during the Phanoriot Era, i.e., between 1711 and 1821, are considered. These &quot;Phanariotisms&quot; underwent stylistic markings which changed the original meanings of the loanwords. They are found only in spoken Romanian, or in a written style which purports to imitate the spoken style. Greek models of some Phanariotisms are stylistically marked in Greek as they are in Romanian. It is further suggested  that certain unmarked Phanariotistic suffixes are so because they underwent stylistic change in Greek before being incorporated into Romanian. (Author/AM)",

In America the question of placement of Romanian scholars and methods of selection must be a matter of serious and continuing concern. In the past, while the programs have been valuable, much of the planning has been ad hoc. This paper tries to suggest specific areas where concerted effort, serious forethought, and  long-range planning can add to the value of the programs.

        "description":"Traditional research on the written language of hearing-impaired persons has tended to support a position of deviant language processing in such individuals. The major reason for such findings has been directly related to the lack of appropriate control groups. Recent studies which have emphasized the comparison of the language of hearing-impaired writers against normally hearing peers, rather than against an abstraction called \"English,\" have supported the notion of linguistic delay, rather than deviancy. The latter studies, however, have placed their emphasis on syntactic consideration rather than the more promising semantic constraints. Research by this author which considered 100 syntactic and semantic aspects is congenerous with recently stated positions by Quigley and  associates, namely that \"deviant\" and \"delayed\" language systems may exist side by side. Indeed, since the \"deviant\" rules seem consistent across large numbers of hearing-impaired writers, one could argue that these should be considered dialectal in nature, arising either from the effects of hearing impairment itself, or imposed by the educational and/or social isolation of deafness.

        "description":"Development of a typology for linguistic situations has been a continuing concern of sociolinguistic research. Thus far, however, typological studies have served primarily to demonstrate the difficulties involved in such an undertaking rather than producing results of obvious utility. With few exceptions, notably Greenberg 1956 and Pool 1972, sociolinguistic typology has taken a categorical view of data which is largely scalar. The arbitrary segmentation of scalar attributes leads to undesirable data-loss, but in the absence of a principled measure of significance there is no elegant alternative. Such a measure is to be sought in the study of the ways that sociolinguistic data are applied to practical concerns. In this paper, the general characteristics of sociolinguistic  typologies and the particular features of existing models are reviewed and the following major issues are discussed: (1) treatment of scalar attributes and data-loss, and (2) development of objective measures of significance.

Two ideas to better answer this question are proposed: Professor William E. Bull's model of the communication process and his adaptation of the mathematical Theory of Sets to language study. Bull's model of communication is described as including four phases: precoding, encoding, transmission and decoding. The importance of Set Theory in language study is explained. The language skills of listening comprehension, speaking, reading and writing are identified in terms of the phases in the proposed communication model and Set Theory. The precoding phase of the model is found to have no curricular equivalent in any skill. The same is true for  Set Theory. Specific goals or educational purposes for the language arts curriculum in bilingual programs and instructional objectives derived from Bull's model and Set Theory are provided. (Author/KM)",

The three components of the project are: (1) Model A, providing bilingual education from prekindergarten to fifth grade, (2) Model B, parallel in pattern to Model A but serving grades 1-4 and grade 2 at othe schools, and (3) Arriba, designed to serve new arrivals to the mainland, mostly Spanish-dominant, in grades 3 through 12 in nine schools. The report describes the needs of the environment, the objectives and organization of the project and the modifications instituted in the fifth year. Testing and management problems are examined. Materials completed in 1973-74 are listed and a financial analysis is given. Statistical tables and graphs reflecting language and reading  performance, self-esteem and readiness of pupils, and parental support, with an evaluation for each section, make up the bulk of the report. A cumulative abstract for the five years shows that the &quot;Let's Be Amigos&quot; program has improved performance of both English- and Spanish-dominant pupils in their mother tongues. Growth has occurred in second languages as well but has not been as rapid as anticipated by program planners. A bibliography is appended. (TL)",

        "description":"An inventory for storing data on a sociocultural system was designed (a) to favor the emergence of a structural-functional model, and (b) to generate the descriptive knowledge most useful for a practical understanding of the life style. Thirty sections are grouped into four subsystems, adapted from those of the sociologist Talcott Parsons: the culture, the society, the ecology, and the individual personality. A fifth main heading is devoted to the culture bearer's perceptions of other cultures. The first three sections of Parson's cultural subsystem, namely the culture-wide values, habits of thought, and underlying assumptions, are equated with the &quot;main themes&quot; of the culture as defined by the anthropologist Morris Opler: if the definition of each main value is amplified to  include the pertinent habits of thought and assumed realities, then the value can be perceived as it appears to those who live in the culture. The main themes serve as a manageable-sized handle which the student can grasp. These generalized themes give insight into the situation-specific norms which govern institutionalized roles; and the specific norms, in turn, serve to caution one against regarding the generalized themes as a self-dependent description of the life style.

It argues academic organizations differ in major respects from more traditional bureaucracies; hence it is necessary to develop a suitable model of decision-making for use in studying academic governance. The characteristics that set academic organizations apart are described in detail: their goals are ambiguous; they are devoted to client service rather than profit-making; they exhibit a high degree of professionalism; and they are particularly vulnerable to their environment. In light of these characteristics, three models of academic governance are then considered: the bureaucratic and collegial models, and the political model, which is revised and expanded. Although the  bureaucratic and collegial models offer valuable insights, the political model is seen as the most satisfactory and complete. A final section analyzes images of leadership and management strategies under each of the three models. (Author)",

These fields are: (1) cost-effectiveness, cost/benefits analysis; (2) curriculum and campus planning; (3) college, university-wide educational goals and objectives; (4) consensus on rating scales, values, and other evaluation elements; (5) generalized educational goals and objectives for the future.

A fundamental purpose of IEP is to assist postsecondary education institutions in establishing a basic set of data useful for the improvement of education planning and management. This purpose is pursued through IEP in two ways: (1) by helping the institution to create its own internally useful data set and (2) by fostering the creation and exchange of comparable data sets among similar institutions. The IEP basic data set now consists of information of each  of the following types: (1) institutional characteristics; (2) student enrollments and characteristics; (3) personnel resources; (4) other resources; (5) institutional finances; (6) costs by instructional discipline and student program; and (7) student outcomes. This document is directed toward the definition and discussion of IEP student outcomes information and procedures for obtaining them. It also presents the procedures for creating the data set necessary to support further developments, provides a descriptive overview of the outcomes of student programs, and allows the institution in the context of IEP to undertake examination of the activities, costs, and results of those programs.

In conjunction with the certification of data, questions were asked concerning the following subjects: (1) The composition (makeup) of the total charges in terms of support for operating costs, capital expenditures, special student activitie, and services fees; (2) the extent of any differential charged to graduate students: (3) whether or not lower fees are charged to graduate students: (4) whether or not lower fees are charged to resident Vietnam veterans; and (5) plans for increasing tuition and fees for 1976-77. This survey was as extensive as possible and in the authors' opinion reflected actual practice within the  respective states. It was found worthwhile to follow-up on published sources when the State of Washington ranked either exceptionally high or exceptionally low in a particular category. The council staff checked both the aid amount information and the enrollment figures. In discussions with individuals who conducted the survey and with the National Center of Education Statistics, the U.S. Office of Education, it was determined that the dollars per student were based on an erroneous enrollment count for the State of Washington. Corrected tables along with the corrected enrollment information as published by the National Center of Education Statistics are attached to the document. (Author/KE)",

This study is the first effort in this state (and perhaps any state) to clearly relate all costs to the instructional, research, and public service efforts of all the public institutions of higher education. The information base has been built from a detailed level (e.g., upper division biology courses or dental assistant technology courses started after the eighth day of instruction) and aggregated upward. This report includes information covering the community colleges, the state colleges, and the two universities. The cost data are presented in a format compatible with the &quot;Program Decision Structure,&quot; and are also compatible with  structures being developed nationally for the presentation and analysis of higher education costs. In reviewing the figures contained in this report, comparisons of overall averages except in those cases where the institutions offer reasonably similar instructional programs should be avoided. The same rule applies to comparisons of graduate costs at the state colleges and universities where the differences in program size and type significantly affect costs. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"During the spring of 1974 a series of seminars on student aid programs and student access was held in connection with the congressional hearings on Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Participants represented the federal, state, or institutional point of view. This document reporting on those seminars, deals with federal-state responsibilities in facilitating student access to postsecondary education. This topic is particularly thorny for two reasons. First, clear-cut federal legislative policy for postsecondary education has been lacking, at least until the 1972 Education Amendments with their initiation of a program of state scholarships and their creation on the 1202 Commissions. Second, the 50 states differ greatly on variety of important variables: legislation, the mix of  public and private institutions, student migration patterns, arrangements for financial postsecondary education, and level of financial support for the total system. In addition to these two major problems, many other difficulties arise in trying to apportion responsibility between the federal government and the states. Some of these difficulties discussed by the five panel members are: (1) The Federal Role; (2) The Promise of SSIG; The Goals of State Aid, and The Complementary Roles of State and Federal Programs; (3) The CUNY Experience; (4) A Challenge from the Private Sector; (5) The Paradox of &quot;Access&quot;, The Scorecard, and Increasing Student Choice.

A basic premise in the governance of postsecondary education in New York is that statewide planning and coordination must be directed so that institutions, in making their separate decisions, can chart their paths with relationship to what other institutions regionally and across the state are planning, while assuring that state and federal resources are used to achieve the goals established for the state as a whole. Part 1 of the document discusses: alternatives to the present system of governance, background on the University of the State of New York, New York State's performance in postsecondary education, the  coordination of postsecondary education with other educational levels, and the relationship of regents to the state executive and legislature. Part 2 discusses changes in planning functions and procedures, citing weaknesses of statewide planning in the past as: (1) the lack of detail of institutional plans; (2) the lack of communication among public and private institutions as they proceed in the planning process, and (3) the lack of formal arrangements for articulating the budget with the planning process. Part 3 discusses governance of student aid and the Higher Education Service Corporation. Part 4 notes other governance issues that deserve some attention. (Author/KE)",

Data seem to support the view that in the future more older people will go to school. Tables include information on: number of high school graduates; number and type of people attending college; years of college completed; enrollment changes and trends; comparisons of working and school populations; and enrollment projections.

        "description":"A group representing United States higher education, Federal Government, foundations, and professional agencies and associations met to discuss the issue of the impact that undergraduate foreign students and United States postsecondary education have on each other. The meeting was organized around three prepared papers. The papers dealt with the ideal, the real, and the practical approach to undergraduate foreign student programs. This document reprints those papers. With insights gathered from the colloquium, some guidelines were established that might be utilized entirely or in part by institutions, government, professional associations, and foundations as they develop an achievable strategy, one in which the \"ideal,\" or the dream, and the \"real\" with all its existing  constraints, were concurrently examined. Some recommendations include: (1) information sources overseas; (2) integrity in admissions; (3) clearinghouses; (4) curricular reform; (5) legislation; (6) service to institutions; (7) institutional self-study; (8) research; (9) two-year colleges; (10) proprietary schools; (11) liaison with financial aid office; (12) accrediting; (13) international foreign student association.

Data on which the study is based were collected for freshmen who entered in 1970 and 1971. For the 1970 freshmen, academic outcomes were described over the course of the first four semesters. For the 1971 freshmen, academic outcomes were described for the first two semesters. Data on the first-year performance of the two classes were compared. Data were reported in aggregate for senior and community colleges: comparisons between individual CUNY colleges were also presented. Four major topics were considered: (1) academic performance of students (grade-point average and credit generation); (2) retention is related to academic performance; (3)  the impact of compensatory programs upon retention and academic performance; (4) comparison of academic outcomes for SEEK and non-SEEK students. SEEK stands for Search for Education, Elevation, and Knowledge and is a forerunner of the open admissions program at CUNY senior colleges. (Author/KE)",

One such federal program is I-E-L (Federal Coordinator for Industry-Education-Labor) that brings together leadership, information, and ideas from the worlds of business, training, and work. Another federal program is HEGIS (The Higher Education General Information Survey), which is a comprehensive survey of statistics of institutions of higher learning. The document also gives some suggestions for the fiscal and philosophical survival of colleges and universities. Those suggestions are: (1) fiscal responsibility; (2) more attention to  students' rights; (3) more consumer orientation; (4) more career education orientation; (5) retention of a strong humanities program; and (6) teaching communications skills necessary for success in the work world. Some things colleges and universities might do are to: (1) review the efficiency of their operation; (2) expand course offerings to adult students; and (3) eliminate the dichotomy between so-called academic learning and vocational education.

The survey focused on the relationship between voting behavior and two potential sources of variance: (1) faculty characteristics; and (2) attitudes and/or opinions about several key issues in academic collective bargaining. The document is presented in four major sections. The first section discusses the national and local scene relative to collective bargaining, sets the context of the election, and specifies the methods and analytic techniques used in the research. The second section presents results of the survey pertaining  to the first election held. The third section is similar to the second section but deals with the second or runoff election. Survey data presented in sections two and three include: (1) open-ended response by voting behavior; (2) demographic characteristics by voting behavior; (3) association descriptors; (4) internal versus external governance factors as influences on voting behavior; (5) satisfaction with and desired negotiability of issues; (6) attitude toward strikes by voting behavior; (7) the viability of &quot;no representative&quot;; (8) summary of election results.

Chapter two outlines what has been learned about the efficient use of TV in a school system. In chapter three, thirty variables important to the effectiveness of television teaching are analyzed. Among these variables are: physical variations in the broadcast and viewing conditions; the length and timing of broadcasts; the use of humor; the teacher's role in  televised instruction; and factors affecting student response to TV. Staff and student attitudes toward the use of television are considered in chapter four, while chapter five is devoted to educational television in developing nations.

Sub-goal #1 is to ensure that library and information services adequate to meet the needs of all residents are obtained. Sub-goal #2 is the provision of adequate specialized resources and services to constituencies with special needs.

The modules were designed as supplements to the traditional organic chemistry course of the University. As such, they emphasized tutorial-drill and experiment simulation applications in some of the basic organic chemistry concepts including nomenclature, classes of organic compounds, syntheses, reactions, preparations, laboratory exercises, and spectral interpretations. This paper includes descriptions of the modules together with a summary of their initial use and evaluation. (Author/DGC)",

The nine MONIFORMS resulting from this study are useful for rapid development of certain frequently used CAI material. These authoring aids are partially precoded formats which make use of HumRRO subroutines for question execution. MONIFORMS are used for development of single questions--of the multiple choice, constructed response, and matching type--that can be combined with material prepared by conventional methods. The characteristics of  these MONIFORMS are described together with comments on future developments to be made in CAI material generation for military training. (Author/DGC)",

Although there is a definite need to support university programs with media materials, the library programs are developing slowly. A major concern of librarians is that the use of media in the library usually means that there must also be creation and production of media materials. The Bobst Library at New York University, designed in 1963 with neither a centralized audiovisual equipment service nor production facility, is an example of many conservative libraries today.  In this case, the needs of the university community are overlooked or underdeveloped due to a lack of administration support. A bibliography containing over 60 citations is appended. (Author/DS)",

The first phase of the study consisted of (1) a review of tasks performed by the operators of different types of military simulation systems, (2) an analysis of problems experienced in the development of devices for such training tasks, and (3) the identification of design areas in which experimentation is required. The second phase of the project resulted in the formulation of design recommendations and a five-year implementation plan to permit system procurement in five relatively discrete incremental modules. Each of the five modules can be employed independently, and each can also be integrated with the preceding module to provide additional,  supplemental functions. Procurement of all five modules will provide for the total capability necessary for the support of future human factor experiments in military training. (Author/DGC)",

The initial phase of the project consisted of the analysis of representative sonar and acoustic equipment to identify training areas and operator performance requirements that could be subjected to generalized training methods. The degree of commonality in operator tasks, skill, and knowledge requirements for each system was considered. Phase 2 involved the evaluation of existing training methods. A high degree of commonality was found in operator tasks for surface and subsurface systems involving stimuli of low to moderate uncertainty, procedure following, and simple motor responses. The application of generalized training  concepts was judged feasible for sonar operators, although further research is needed on the exact approaches to be taken. (DGC)",

It covers the first six months of the first session of the 94th Congress, which convened January 14, 1975. The first section of the report discusses appropriations bills, without which funds would not be available to carry on federal programs such as the Library Services and Construction Act. The appropriations bills now being considered in Congress are those providing funds for fiscal year 1976. Some programs such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act's new Title IV-B Libraries and Learning Resources, receive their funding a year in advance, so that their fiscal year 1977 appropriations are included in the education  appropriations bill now before Congress. The second section of the report deals with legislative bills and related matters which Congress must pass to establish new programs or to extend existing ones. Attached to the end of the report are: 1) a table of funds giving details on the appropriation of funds for federal library and related programs and 2) a status-of-legislation chart summing up the status of a few bills with library-related implications.

The six cost factors were: (1) authorship, (2) incentives, (3) distribution, (4) replacement, (5) evaluation, and (6) training. The major hypothesis was that the attitudes of administrators in medical schools which offered, expected to offer, or did not expect to offer CAI toward the six cost factors would not differ significantly. The population of the study was composed of deans and dean appointees of 115 colleges of medicine in the United States. Survey research techniques were used to determine the attitudes of  administrators towards the six cost factors. It was found that all of the groups of administrators had similar attitudes towards and were generally receptive to the relevance of the six factors. Additionally, they expressed uncertainty about the role of cost-effectiveness in the production of clinical programs. (SBM)",

The hypothesis was that there would be no significant difference in attitude between the two groups. The study was limited to two elementary schools in the Belle Vernon Area School District of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. To obtain the necessary information concerning students' attitudes a closed, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; questionnaire of twenty items was constructed. The results of the study indicated that on the whole the attitudes of the two groups were not significantly different. It was concluded that carpeting, carrels, and open spaces do not guarantee a good  educational system, nor do workbooks, desks in rows, and quiet. The key to success in any program is the teacher and her relationship to the students. Based on the findings of this study, the author recommended that in open settings: (1) to fully implement the open concept, the teacher-pupil ratios should not exceed 1 to 20; and (2) there should be continuous training of teachers and others.

The videotapes were modeled on television documentaries, and included study guides with a student response and feedback mechanism. Under this system, class time can be devoted to discussion and analysis. Media cannot totally replace reading in the humanities classroom, nor can it develop critical thinking. But the videotapes are effective in conveying factual information and have allowed poor readers to enroll in the humanities course simultaneously with their special reading courses. While many good commercial materials are available, only locally produced media can really be integrated into a specific teaching situation. Because of the cost and  production time involved, it is advisable to produce videotapes which are interdisciplinary in subject and useful in several courses. Cooperation between faculty and the video production staff is essential to insure high quality content and an effective presentation. At DBC, the use of electronic media has not precluded interest in or use of books by students. It has been found, rather, that the two forms can be combined in a number of interesting ways to achieve the goals of the humanities. (SL)",

The Texas Telecomputer Grid, a telecommunication network, is operated by Central Texas College in Killeen, Texas. Satellite facilities are located in Dallas, Fort Worth, and San Antonio, Texas. The project evaluation relied on two main inputs: questionnaires completed periodically by the participating teachers and review of the programs by an advisory committee of media and career education experts. Results indicated that  staff dedication was high, but that the program was impaired by mechanical failures of the Grid.

What will be the objectives of the survey? Which businesses, industries, and services should be included? Who will conduct the survey? How will the survey results be implemented? A survey of the economic community is, in effect, a market analysis. To insure success of the survey, goals must be established early, to set the appropriate lines of inquiry. A brief economic profile of the community, gathered from easily available sources, can be helpful in determining which of the various types of enterprises offer the best field for investigation, if time and money constraints  preclude a total survey. If the library staff does not have sufficient expertise to plan and conduct such a survey, consultants are available from marketing research firms, local academic institutions and library associations. Survey results will not be useful unless they generate recommendations, preferably in the form of a program proposal, which can be subjected to review and eventual implementation of improved library services.

The critical thinking process is said to involve: (1) the decoding of source material through observation and interpretation and (2) the encoding of original insights as a result of the interpretation. This act of translation--critical thinking--is essentially the processing of input information and the creation of output. Though much  of the analysis is subjective, an honest attempt must be made to locate reliable patterns in what is observed and to restrict the tendency to guess or bias a study. This is where the computer is most useful. The subjects of the Freshmen Seminar for 1974-75 were an analysis of: (1) the literary language of John Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and (2) the live communications of the Watergate Testimony.

This project report presents: (1) a revised cost analysis form for state-level reporting of institutional program effectiveness data and per-student costs by EOPS program category (recruitment, counseling, financial aid, etc.); (2) a formula for determining cost effectiveness of individual college EOPS programs in which effectiveness ratios for first-time and continuing EOPS students are calculated from student retention, ability, unit completion, and goal (degree) completion data; (3) a proposed State Allocation Formula for EOPS funds, which combines the resulting cost effectiveness ratios of individual college  EOPS programs with a need factor, determined by the discrepancy between the potential pool of EOPS students in the college's service area and actual number of EOPS students served, the college's requested EOPS service level, and area cost of living; and (4) an additional revised institutional data reporting form. Recommendations are made for the implementation of the cost effectiveness formula and its incorporation into EOPS master planning and program development. Appended to the project report are EOPS program and per-student costs by category for the 11 colleges involved in the study and a hypothetical calculation for EOPS program allocations. (BB)",

This document is a status report on affirmative action plans and policies in California community colleges. Of 59 responding districts, 34 submitted affirmative action plans, and 35 submitted affirmative action policies; 14 reported plans underway with completion pending. All 59 districts stated that they would meet the requirements of ACR 151 by 1980. Analyses of these plans and policies indicate that many need improvement; however, the  number of districts with plans is encouraging. The report reviews the impact of ACR 151 and notes that its emphasis on recent high school graduates is inappropriate; that it provides no direction as to the procedures to be used in determining economic underrepresentation; and that a single plan cannot be made for 70 local districts, many of which already have their own plans. Various Board resolutions, affirmative action program outlines, the text of ACR 151, and a table indicating the status of affirmative action plans and policies in each responding district are appended.

The Committee studied the planning, operational, and methodological review functions of the Office of Program Planning and Fiscal Management (part of the State Census Board), which has been directly responsible for the preparation of enrollment projections for the community college system since 1970. As a result of this evaluation, it was concluded that the present methods are inadequate in that they do not account for community needs, student characteristics, local  economic characteristics, sociological groupings, or other factors which influence enrollments. Present enrollment projection methods are based on census data for the age group of 18 to 24 years; since this age group is not representative of the community college student body, the statistic is irrelevant. As a result, actual enrollments have surpassed projected enrollments by 0.5 percent to 10.3 percent for the past four years. Current enrollment projection methods are reviewed in detail. No recommendations for improvements are made. (Author/DC)",

Respondents were also asked to indicate their perceptions of organizational effectiveness. A response rate of 60 percent was obtained. Conclusions indicate that: (1) these 12 institutions are not highly centralized and  they differ primarily in the patterns of centralization/decentralization within their units rather than between units and the district office; (2) neither a highly centralized nor a highly decentralized distribution of authority is a primary determinant of effectiveness; and (3) there is a great increase in effectiveness if participation in decision-making is simultaneously increased for staff members at all hierarchical levels.

The first part of the survey asked respondents to rank 21 listed characteristics of &quot;poor&quot; students. The findings for the Harcum faculty are compared with the findings of a previous administration of a similar questionnaire to faculty at Frostburg State College (Maryland). Both faculties considered the inability to synthesize and apply conceptual principles to be the most prevalent characteristic of the academically poor student. Furthermore, both faculties considered negative attitudes toward the teacher or course content to be the least prevalent characteristic. The  second part of the survey asked respondents to select from a list of four characteristics the most common cause of poor academic performance: 30.5 percent selected poor study habits; 29.2 percent selected lack of knowledge and skills; 22.2 percent selected lack of motivation; and 18.1 percent selected poor classroom participation--these opinions varied significantly from those of the Frostburg faculty. The implications of these findings are noted, and a bibliography is included. The remarks of Harcum respondents to the open-ended questionnaire items are appended. (Author/DC)",

Projections of expected enrollment are obtained for the following segments, which are discussed separately: (1) recent county high school graduates, including early and delayed enrollees, (2) out-of-county Maryland students, (3) out-of-state or non-resident students, (4) matriculated returning students, and (5) county residents expected to enroll as non-matriculated students.

The students were asked to list all courses for which they were enrolled at midterm, their midterm grade in each, and their rating of each instructor on a scale of 1-5. The investigator found that there was a significant correlation between letter grade received and the faculty rating; ratings go up as grades go up. The implications of this finding in a college where student evaluation is a major part of the faculty retention/tenure/merit process are discussed, as is the potential correlation between  alternative teaching methods, such as mastery learning, grades, and consequent student satifaction.

Some of the factors considered in making these projections are the rapidly expanding economy and population of the El Paso area, the number of high school graduates in the county, the national trend toward increased enrollment in vocational-technical fields, and anticipated expansion of college facilities to meet vocational program demands. Costs and administrative organization are discussed  for a proposed multicampus area. The author concludes that necessary expansion of the college can be achieved with a minimum of expense to the taxpayer, in light of anticipated income from state aid and tuition. Tax rates required for the operation of the college are calculated for each college year from 1975-76 through 1984-85. Final recommendations include a request to the Board of Trustees for acquisition of new building space and for an election in El Paso County to secure additional bond tax. Extensive tables, maps, and sample calculations illustrate each area of the study. (JS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted among 332 young women at Harcum Junior College to investigate the relationship between eating patterns and academic achievement. Two groups were compared, one eating two or three regular meals daily (A) and one eating less than two regular meals daily (B). For each student in Group A, one was included in Group B who matched her Scholastic Aptitude Test scores within 50 points. By following this sample selection method, the aptitude-matched groups were analyzed in terms of their graduation cumulative grade point averages. The t-ratio for the obtained difference between the mean GPA (2.9) for Group A and the mean GPA (2.6) for Group B was 2.60, showing a reliable correlation between higher achievement and good eating habits. Many variables in determining the  exact nutritional intake of students prevents generalization from these results, but further study of collegiate nutrition and achievement is recommended.

        "description":"This report provides previously unpublished data gathered during Project Focus, a nationwide sample survey of community and junior colleges, on the vocational plans and expectations of full-time students enrolled in fall 1970. The data were drawn from a sample of 10,250 student responses from 92 institutions. The report tabulates data on student characteristics (age, sex, ethnic group, father's occupation, timing of vocational choice, size of hometown community) against two vocational variables: expected main vocational roles or occupations and expected fields of specialization. The potential vocational fields of specialization consisted of 98 areas within nine major fields: education; social science or religious; business, political, and persuasive; scientific; agriculture and  forestry; health; arts and humanities; engineering; and trade, industrial, and technical. The vocational roles within fields were combined in five broad groups (administrator or supervisor, promoter or salesman of services, etc.). Appendixes include the survey instrument and a description of the sample and weighting procedures. (BB)",
