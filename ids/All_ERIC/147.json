        "description":"This document describes a three-part, flexible, individualized teacher education program which spans the preservice/inservice continuum. The first part, Secondary Teacher Education Program (STEP), is a five-phase program which features early and continuous contact with secondary school classrooms and students, individual learning packages called SEEDPACS, continuous assessment and monitoring, and a variety of teaching/learning methods including small-group activities, seminars, simulations, microteaching, and independent study. The second part of the program is a new Master of Education degree program that deals specifically with the continuing education needs of practicing teachers and the inservice needs of school districts. Credit is earned by performance, and no core of  courses is required of all students. The third part is a new approach to summer school for teachers called Academic Fair. All courses offered by the Department of Secondary Education, University of Minnesota are available under 10 program categories. The course scheduling includes independent study, small groups, and other variations dictated by the needs of the students. More specific information regarding STEP and a program satisfaction questionnaire are appended. (PD)",

        "description":"This six-chapter study provides a summary of active programs that aim towards professional development of educational personnel, and it generates attributes of programs of professional development that would distinguish teacher centers from other types of programs. Chapter one provides information regarding the historical background of teacher centers, in-service programs in other countries, and origins of the teacher center concept. Chapter two presents the following information: a) the conceptual base on which the three populations were developed and the sampling procedures used in each case, b) the processes used for the development of the instrument, c) data collection procedures, and d) plans for the analysis of the data. Chapters three through six discuss demography, nature  of programs, administration and governance, and finance. Chapter seven highlights the important findings to provide helpful information for future program development. The authors conclude that children should continue to be the primary focus of teacher centers and that the centers should be evaluated by measuring their impact on the lives of children.

        "description":"This paper discusses court cases that are a legal basis for screening programs for teacher education. The Supreme Court case of Adler v. Board of Education established that the states do have the power to set up requirements or rules concerning the quality of moral character in applicants for teaching certificates. Vogulkin v. State Board of Education defines the reason for denying a teaching license. Subjective evaluation elements in addition to academic scholarship may be required for teacher certificates as in the case of People, el rel Odel v. Glaningam. Other state cases are also briefly discussed that uphold the denial of certification on the basis of lack of good moral character. In conclusion, the requirement of subjective evaluation and screening of teacher education  students and teacher certification has a legal status as well as a professional one. However, due process is a vital aspect in screening candidates. (PD)",

A Quinton 607 Heartrate Controller maintined the specified work intensity on a treadmill. Training consisted of 15 minutes of work, three times per week for one month. Workload was held constant for subgroups. Cardiovascular training effects were determined by using the Balke protocol prior to, miday, and after the training period. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was the statistical technique employed for repeated measures. Results indicate that there were no significant differences in the variables measured for each of the groups.

        "description":"This study investigates the effects of setting an overt level of aspiration on the standing long jump performance of mildly and moderately retarded institutionalized children. Thirty-three mildly retarded and seven moderately retarded students were randomly assigned to either an overt level of aspiration (OLA) group or a control group. Each subject was asked to do his best on every trial. After each trial, OLA subjects were shown how far they had jumped and then asked to point to a line on the mat where they expected to be able to jump on the next trial. The control group subjects were asked to do their best and were shown how far they had jumped in the preceding trial. The evidence that no significant differences in long jump performances were found within or between groups  indicates that overt level aspiration does not appear to act as an effective motivating technique in increasing the performance of mentally retarded children, and, therefore, these subjects were not able to make a meaningful connection between an overtly committed goal and succeeding performance scores.

Seventy-five high-anxious and 75 low-anxious subjects were divided into three groups of 25 and tested under alone, supportive audience, and nonsupportive audience conditions. Results showed that four of six groups improved significantly in balancing ability over 12 trials. There was no significant difference shown for conditions of learning nor for interaction between anxiety level and learning conditions. It was hypothesized that perhaps the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale is inappropriate for motor learning studies and that a learned drive approach  should be considered in future studies.

        "description":"One hundred and fifty-one college women, 88 non-physical education majors, and 63 physical education majors were given a 75-item Q-sort of statements on motives for participation in physical activity and a background questionnaire that elicited demographic data and information on sports activity experience. The Q-sort data for each major group were treated by means of an inverse factor analysis to establish factor types representing groups of people with similar motives for participation. Findings indicate that differences can be discerned among women regarding motives for playing. Five significant activity types were established for the nonmajors, including (a) the appearance conscious, (b) the skill developers, (c) the fitness fadists, (d) the healthy long-livers, and (e) the  groupies. Four significant activity types were established for the physical education majors, including (a) the straight arrows, (b) the show-offs; (c) the groupies, and (d) the givers. On the basis of this study the author draws the following conclusions: (a) physical education majors are distinguishable from the nonmajors in terms of their experience in intramural and varsity sports on both the high school and college level and by their participation in sports in leisure time and (b) college and junior high school girls are alike in participation in physical activities for the group association it provides.

        "description":"This study investigates the effect of a three-month physical fitness program on serum-free cholesterol concentration in four age and fitness adult groups. Twenty-four men were divided into the following groups: (a) young, low-fit; (b) old, low-fit; (c) young, high-fit; and (d) old, high-fit. All subjects had normal resting glucose and triglyceride levels and participated in a physical fitness program consisting of calisthenics, jogging, and recreational activities. Subjects were tested on a treadmill at the beginning and at the end of the three-month program, and venous blood samples were drawn at four stages of metabolic stress: rest, submaximal, maximal, and recovery. The analysis of variance technique was used to determine significant differences between pre- and post-tests,  fitness levels, age groups, different metabolic stress levels, and the significant interactions of various factors. Data suggest the following conclusions: (a) there is no significant change in serum-free cholesterol level due to a three-month physical fitness program; (b) the high-fit group had a significantly lower free cholesterol level than the low-fit group did; (c) there was no significant difference between fitness groups for the percent-free cholesterol; (d) there were no significant differences between age groups for the free cholesterol or percent-free cholesterol; and (e) acute physical exercise increases the absolute and percent-free cholesterol from the resting state through the maximum exercise state.

It is sensitive to the criticisms leveled at teacher education by observers such as Silberman and attempts to lead teachers to share in decision making, participate actively in learning, and become independent learners in their own right. During the workshop semester, up to 50 undergraduates join 15 or so graduate students in a series of learning experiences which have replaced the conventional methods and curriculum courses. These preservice teachers earn 18 hours of credit for participating in activity-oriented workshops in Multi-Arts, Math and Science, Language Arts and Reading, Curriculum Building, Social  Studies, and Human Relations. Workshops are offered during two-and-a-half-hour blocks of time weekly. While learning activities vary widely (from lectures, to slide shows, to task groups, to finance committee meetings), all are competency based. The preservice teachers demonstrate their beginning competence during learning fairs, through projects, in peer teaching situations, and during their weekly field day experiences. Learning experiences are often integrated, and competencies overlap subject areas so that the preservice teacher can work toward several competencies concurrently. (JA)",

The instructional plan provided a focus on interpersonal communications skills during five weekly, one-hour seminars, which were part of the pre-fall elementary education student teaching experience at the University of Minnesota, College of Education. The guiding principle was that the instructional intervention should be derived from a statement of desired skills. Five areas were selected for this training program: (a) establishing relationships: (b) listening, i.e., attending, assessing, and clarifying; (c) interpreting and valuing in listening; (d)  soliciting feedback; and (e) giving feedback. Specific behaviors and affective responses which would constitute acceptable evidences of skill performance were identified. The statements of evidence reflected the project goal of developing student teachers' skills in communicating with both their university and classroom supervisors and were of two types: (a) behavior descriptions which could be observed and checked by someone outside the dyad and (b) internal responses of the supervisor to the student teacher's communications.

The experimental group (Group 1) consisted of 23 students selected primarily on the basis of personal interviews with program instructors.

Group 1 students were selected because they exhibited the following behavioral characteristics to a high degree: flexibility, self-awareness, reality-orientation, responsiveness to others, assertiveness, \"cool,\"  warmth, and enthusiasm. Group 2 served as a control to this selection procedure. Students were pre- and posttested on two scales--Kerlinger's Education Scale VII and the Basic Concepts Test.

        "description":"This paper posits that it is necessary to evoke the development of an adequate federal KPU (Knowledge Production and Utilization) program in education which will command broad-based support within and outside the profession and that this demands a reformulation of the conceptual structure on which the program is built. Section 1 offers a historical analysis of federal involvement in educational KPU and offers some generalizations regarding the goals and the means for achieving them that have characterized federal programs and policies. The conceptual structures that have emerged during this period are identified and criteria that can be employed in assessing such structures are proposed. The second section examines the systems view, which is the conceptual structure currently  dominating educational KPU policy. How this view emerged and how it is reflected in current KPU policy are discussed. Also this concept is assessed in terms of the criteria listed, and its shortcomings in relation to realism and balance are noted. Section 3 purposes an alternative structure, the configurational view. This view is contrasted with the systems view on the dimensions of completeness, realism, and balance. It is concluded that the configurational model would result in more productive relationships between federal funding agencies and KPU units in the field and among the latter. Section 4 provides illustrations showing the effect the configurational view might have on educational KPU policies and program. (PD)",

MERGE is a systematic, field-based, cooperative approach to teacher education, instruction, and curriculum development. It has been validated and is competency based. It represents an interrelational tri-phase structure composed of the following: (a) an inservice program which affects the renewal and enhancement of the contract teacher's competencies consistent with the demands for flexibility of functioning in a constantly changing educational age; (b) a preservice element dedicated to producing a beginning baccalaureate teacher capable of functioning across traditional categorical lines and of adjusting to evolving change; and (c) a graduate aspect  relating to the production of a cadre of young persons who can assume a leadership role in the upgrading of teacher education programs. The project represents a merging of the physical, personnel, and fiscal resources of the Toledo Public Schools and Bowling Green State University to improve the quality of education.

These global characteristics have been translated by the faculty into topical characteristics and actual program objectives and experiences (included in appendixes). The program presents reality to the student through two years of continuous field  experience. The student is taught a variety of teacher roles which he may model as he begins to teach and from which he will evolve his own model of teaching behavior. The program is pluralistic in that it provides experiences in several distinct cultures. The student is also provided with a variety of personal information utilized in making initial career decisions. (Extensive appendixes describe the program, its components and objectives.) (JA)",

Without sacrifice of existing programs, college resources were reallocated to maximize the normalization of school services for educationally handicapped children. Thirty-six to 40 undergraduates per year complete the approved program in the specialty areas of mental retardation, behavior disorders, and learning disabilities; an equal number complete the elementary general program with an area of interest in special education. Training in both options is identical until the senior year when differentiated practice teaching is given. The dual track approach promotes mainstreaming by establishing a broad area of commonality in the  training of both special and general elementary teachers. A heavy commitment to clinical training takes students into the schools during all four program years. Students are bused to local schools for methods demonstration and practice throughout the junior year. The senior practicum features a reciprocal arrangement in which each student receives supervision from a curriculum/methods specialist and diagnostic specialist both in seminar and on-site--this in addition to the daily supervision provided by the cooperating teacher.

The program planning and administration emphasizes a shift in power from college-based teacher educators to parity cooperatives. For the preservice teacher the program emphasizes phased introduction into teaching with an initial clinical experience, individualized program structuring with a wide range of minicourse offerings in professional areas, a strong general education background, and a year-long internship. The inservice component emphasizes more responsible roles  for teachers in supervision and preservice instruction, more attention to inservice education by college-based teacher educators, and a formal role in decisions about teacher preparation. Major program components include the following: (a) a one-semester teacher aide/instructional assistant experience (normally in the sophomore year); (b) minicourse programs in educational structure and change, human growth and learning, alternative teaching models, and alternative perspecitves on the nature of education; (c) a year-long internship as part of a master's degree level program; and (d) graduate-level inservice courses offered at school centers.

(Western State College's Teacher Education Center), to operate a teaching center at the district's Centennial Elementary School. The purpose of the teaching center was to involve elementary education students in a year-long field experience in which methodology courses (teaching of reading, language arts, social studies, science, and mathematics) were combined with field experiences and student teaching. Methodology courses were organized by subject-matter specialists from each of the five colleges, and continuing efforts were made to correlate concepts presented in the seminars to corresponding competency needs of the classroom. The student field-experience activities were organized on a  progressive scale. They began with observations, then teacher-aide activities; proceeded to tutorial activities and small-group teaching sessions; and finally evolved into full teaching functions. Each student was assigned to six different classrooms during the school year. The first assignment was concerned with nonstudent teaching experiences, and the second through the sixth assignments were progressively concerned with student teaching responsibilities. The college students assembled for biweekly practicums which focused on methodology and content. Feedback was obtained from the student at seminars and practicums and from student surveys and interviews. (Author/JA)",

The center operates on a calendar year identical with that of the campus laboratory school. The permanent staff consists of two full-time professionals with one delegated as head teacher. A partial listing of ancillary personnel indigenous to the school who provide services to the center include the nurse, librarian, counselor, and resource  teacher. Student teachers are regularly assigned while a number of students enrolled in relevant courses spend time working with the children in the center. Every activity is organized so that the student perceives the child as a learner who actively participates in his own learning. The student is given the opportunity to develop not only beginning management skills in general classroom procedure, but also those closely related with a child's self-management and growth in independence.

During the first phase (reported in another document), 24 third- and fourth-grade teachers and their students in nine elementary schools in low-income communities were the subjects of an investigation examining the principal influences on student engagement including: (a) student characteristics; (b) contextual variables; (c) teacher attitudes toward open space, classroom organization, and control ideology; (d) global teacher strategies; and (e) specific teacher strategies. During the second phase, 15 teachers were observed in a single school, including grades K-6, that moved from self-contained classrooms to  a new open-space building. Eight observations were made in each architectural condition. Major findings are that; (a) teacher behavior accounts for a large proportion of variance in student engagement; (b) specific and global teacher strategies are strongly related to level of engagement; (c) teacher attitudes are associated with level of engagement; (d) classroom architecture is not strongly related to level of engagement but is associated with the pattern of classroom organization and teacher-student interaction; (e) student characteristics have little or no correlation with engagement levels; (f) the pattern of classroom organization affects engagement and interacts with classroom architecture in its effects on student behavior; and (g) there is extreme variability in student and  teacher behavior in the classroom.

The project proposed to take a broader approach to the overall problem of quality education by seeking to identify generic concerns and needs common to all ethnic groups and diverse cultural situations. The project at the same time sought to identify those needs felt to be unique or more relevant to certain cultural circumstances and situations than others. Part 1 of this document is in the form of a prologue; it is entitled &quot;Antecedents to Developments of and Emphasis on Multicultural Education.&quot; Parts 2-5 were written by four educators and/or teams  from the black American, Spanish-speaking American, and native American academic communities who were invited to contribute. Part 2 treats teacher competencies from the perspective of the black American educator. Part 3 treats teacher competencies from the Spanish-speaking educator's perspective (including views of Puerto Rican Americans, Chicano Americans, and Cuban Americans). Part 4 treats teacher competencies from the perspective of the native American, recognizing the divergencies of views among the nearly 300 tribal groups. Part 5 seeks to identify teacher competencies common to all groups as well as those recognized in the general society as evidence of accepted requirements and standards. (Editor/JA)",

Twice a week there were meetings in a large lecture hall where the lectures were geared toward topics in child development; once a week small groups met to learn communications and human relations skills which were then implemented and practiced in dyadic fashion during subsequent small-group meetings. It was explained to the students that in no way would any judgments be made regarding the quality of their dyadic interpretations but that points would be earned solely on the basis of participation. Grading for the entire course was determined on a partly traditional, partly  self-motivated basis: points were received on the basis of tests; points were earned by special projects; and students could assign 10 percent of their own academic grade by defining in essay fashion their own academic criteria and how well they adhered to that criteria.

(b) What effect do different conditions of feedback have on the development of self-perceived teaching performance, the perceptions of an internal source of evaluation, and the development of self-evaluation skills? and (c) Will the participants react favorably toward the workshop variables? Thirty graduate students were randomly placed in three feedback treatment groups. All students videotaped three microlessons and self-evaluated  them. These evaluations were then compared with the evaluations of a panel of experts. Augmented feedback was given to two of the treatment groups in the form of knowledge of the results of the two evaluations (self and panel) and/or knowledge of results and a group supervisory conference. Correlated t-tests for pre- and posttest means showed statistically significant results for the three dependent variables (self-perception, panel perception, and agreement). An analysis of covariance, utilizing the pretest as a covariate, produced no significant differences between treatment groups. (Author)",

Initially, cooperating teachers, student teachers, and education department faculty meet for an orientation session. The second segment of the program is a series of three one-hour conferences between the college supervisor and the cooperating teacher in the public school setting, with one session involving the student teacher. These meetings are designed to balance time and topics with the goals of the  program and the needs of the cooperating teacher. During the sixth week, cooperating teachers visit college classes in their major academic areas while the student teacher substitutes in their classrooms. This segment of the program is designed to acquaint the cooperating teachers with recent changes in basic core course organization and curricular designs of academic majors. The final segment is a three-hour session on campus at the close of the semester. The first two hours are devoted to professional growth experience for the cooperating teacher. The student teachers are included in the final hour which is an evaluative seminar. During this time an evaluative instrument of the semantic differential-short answer type is completed. (PD)",

Phase 1 focused on the relationship of intern background and Teacher Corps Program characteristics to intern exit characteristics. Its goals were to: (a) contrast teacher performance and pupil gains of graduates with those of control group teachers; (b) analyze the relationship of teacher background, teacher education program, teacher performance, and pupil performance for the graduates; and (c) assess the effects of professional support which graduates and controls receive. The 84 subjects taught grades 2-6 in self-contained classrooms. Data about teacher and pupil performance were obtained through a classroom observation guide, teacher questionnaire, data, standardized reading  test, and standardized self-concept scale. Graduates were superior to controls in developing ethically relevant curricula, using community resources and initiating contact with parents, and developing positive attitudes about reading development and the causes of poverty in society. Graduates facilitated greater self-concept development in pupils, but there was no significant difference in reading gains between the two groups. The consistent pattern of relationship between pupil variables and Teacher Program characteristics suggests that teacher training makes a difference on pupil behavior and on related teacher performance.

After two sessions of tutoring, tutors completed an opinion form in the presence of their pupils. Tutors were told that their pupils would complete an identical form but were in fact shown forms completed by the experimenter. Tutors were also shown a Tutor Evaluation Questionnaire supposedly completed by their pupils but in fact completed by the experimenter. Tutors were subsequently asked to complete an attitudinal measure dealing with their pupils  and the tutoring experience. An analysis of data suggests that female tutors responded favorably to imitation by their pupils while male tutors preferred independent behavior on the part of their tutees.

The institutionalization phase, the last of four, is defined as the introduction of IGE concepts and practices into undergraduate courses for prospective IGE teachers and into graduate programs for unit leaders and IGE principals. Three teacher education institutions developed academic year programs for IGE principals, unit leaders, and staff reading teachers. Federal funds were appropriated through the Wisconsin R &amp; D Center for Cognitive Learning to the three institutions to aid in the development of the programs, and a  limited number of fellowships, including tuition and stipends, were offered at each institution. The program developed at each institution, while not identical, followed the same basic four step model. The first half of the program was devoted to the acquisition of new knowledge, and the second half emphasized actual experience in IGE/MUS-E implementation. In general, the five academic year programs offered at the three institutions proved successful.

        "description":"This report describes the first phase of a longitudinal study of the Sixth Cycle Teacher Corps program, focusing on the relationship between intern background characteristics, Teacher Corps Program characteristics, and intern exit characteristics. Data about all Sixth Cycle projects that prepared elementary school teachers were collected at each site by interview and questionnaire. Data about the exit characteristics of interns were gathered using: (a) classroom observation, (b) log of professional activities completed by interns over a week's time, (c) interviews, and (d) questionnaires completed by interns and their team leaders. Descriptive and analytic results are reported. Analytic findings are: (a) the relationship of intern exit skills was not very strong; (b) Teacher  Corps Program characteristics rather than intern background characteristics were most closely associated with intern exit skills; (c) the extent that teacher competencies were specified and used by the project was not closely related to any intern exit skill; and (d) the sets of program characteristics that were most closely associated with intern exit skills were those pertaining to collaborative decision-making, personalization of the program for interns, and the community component.

The subjects for this investigation were a random sample of 183 girls in grades 1-3 of the public schools of Natchitoches, Louisiana. The variables selected were 22 cable tension strength tests developed by Clarke and associates. The instrument selected for use was a 200 pound cable tensiometer. Subjects were administered the cable tension strength tests in a specific sequence which was selected for purposes of practicality and ease of administration. After completion of testing, the data were statistically treated in the following manner. Intercorrelations between all experimental test items were computed using the Pearson product-moment formula. The correlation  coefficients were factor analyzed according to the principal axes method of factor analysis with the varimax criterion for rotation. As a result of this factor analysis, Knee Flexion, Shoulder Outward Rotation, and Hip Adduction were selected as the cable tension strength test items to include in a gross muscular strength test battery for girls in the lower elementary grades.

Some of the formal characteristics of play are: (a) it is distinct from ordinary life in its \"temporariness\" and its limitless location; (b) there is an element of tension in play that leads to uncertainty concerning the outcome but at the same time provides the opportunity to test the player's prowess against the rules of the game; (c) even though it is removed from real life, play is quite serious; and (d) play is a voluntary activity that is spontaneous and pleasurable. Informal aspects of play are also cited as described by various writers. The reason man plays is an inner \"need\" to play--to seek meaning in life by testing himself, by being free with himself, by seeing what is inside himself. The author  gives the following reasons as to why the concept of play is important for physical educators: (a) if physical education programs are to contribute to the well-being of children, youth, and adults, then any program of sports and games must be infused with the joyful inner-directed play element; (b) if the need for integration and self-actualization is so great in our society, and if games and sport can enhance the possibility of man's self-awareness, then a basic task of physical education must be to maximize the opportunities for these types of occurrences.

Educational research properly includes &quot;basic- nonevaluative&quot; and &quot;applied-evaluative research.&quot; Each species should be judged relative to its purpose and the degree to which systematic investigation occurs through the application of the scientific method. Evaluative or nonevaluative research must be justified in terms of the comprehensiveness of the knowledge base related to the project's development goals. Some overlap of research purposes between evaluative and nonevaluative research may occur with the improvement of evaluative research methodology. Relevancy to practical concerns may be improved by exploiting the mutual interdependence between evaluative and nonevaluative research. Practicing  researchers must recognize the inherent differences of purpose between evaluative and nonevaluative research, and support each according to its particular strengths, if the full potential of the total educational research enterprise is to be realized. The I Can Project, an instructional program in physical education for trainable, mentally retarded, elementary school children, is presented as an example of the relationship between evaluative research and curriculum development.

The study attempts to measure not only achievement but also motivation and rate of progress. Two hypotheses are tested: (1) Teacher measures of application, improvement, and grade level do not bear a significant relationship to standardized test scores in mathematics. (2) Teacher measures of application and improvement do not add, significantly, in prediction to that provided by the grade level and class. The procedure of the study is described in light of the definition of terms, sample, instrument, design, and data analysis. It is clear from the data that the grades at this private day school bear a strong relationship to achievement test scores and are a good  predictor of them. However, neither application nor improvement, as measured, added significantly to the straight achievement measure. The reasons for, and implications of, this result are explained. (SE)",

Analysis of the data revealed findings highly favorable to the LAP method of instruction when they were compared to criteria established by the consortium members. Results were important because they yielded information relevant to a major curricular endeavor in vocational education in the U.S. They represent findings about an initial attempt at using learning packages on a national basis.

These criteria were developed in accordance with basic notions of fairness, equality, and expanded life options for women. In terms of prescriptions for test developers, the criteria are: (1) tests should be constructed of items which contain either no sex references or equal sex references; (2) status of males and females within the test should be equal; (3) item content should not reinforce traditional sex stereotypes. Tests currently in use may be considered biased if: (4) item content in terms of male or female statuses or stereotypes affects the performance of males or females differentially; (5) the test predicts differentially for males and females; (6) the test is normed separately for  males and females unless separate norms are used to insure balance in selection; (7) the test is constructed so that female futures may be separated from male futures.

Despite its expansion from one team to a present total of four high school and four middle school teams, HH100 as a program continued to provide articulated services geared toward skill remediation, guidance services, and cultural exploration and these to groups of approximately 100 urban youngsters in each of the program's eight centers. While the cultural activity funds were necessarily limited, team members were still able to provide youngsters with a number of vocational,  experiential, and career services as these were contemplated in the original and in subsequent proposals. As a model for secondary school compensatory education, the original format was set up to enable the HH team to plan activities and programs in conjunction with the students. Through a series of systematic formal and informal planning sessions, team members would receive continual participant feedback and could use this information as a basis for modifying the program so as to better individually diagnose needs and prescribe appropriate educational treatments.

An Instructional Center approach was the core of this program in which specific remedial/corrective instruction was provided to eligible students who had reading, language, and/or mathematics learning problems. The instructional program emphasized corrective reading and language arts skills. Remedial mathematics instruction continued at the Cathedral of St. Joseph School and at St. Peter  School. Instruction was provided on a scheduled basis during the regular school day. The equivalent of 13 full-time teachers were employed to teach in the Instructional Center Program. These teachers worked in teaching teams on a part-time basis, generally half days. In addition, eight instructional aides worked with children in the centers under the supervision of the instructional center teachers. These paraprofessionals allowed the teachers to offer more individualized and more intensive instruction to the students. (Author/JM)",

Since the non-English speaking youngster attends an ESL class for only about one hour or less per day, the classroom teacher must see that her lessons are adapted to the comprehension level of the non-English speaking student, and that her instructions are understandable to him. The ESL teacher provides what is basically a supportive service. Working with small groups of children for part of each school day, the ESL teacher provides practice, experience, and serves as an English-speaking model to help  youngsters understand and communicate in what is for them a new and different language. The ESL teacher also provides demonstration lessons and helps to integrate the non-English speaking student into the general classroom language program. Three reception areas also are in operation. Staffed by ESL teachers and bilingual assistants, each center provides orientational assistance, translational services, and instruction to one of the three schools which have the largest proportion of Puerto Rican youngsters in the city.

Its purpose was to help narrow the time lag between local politically or court-mandated desegregation--physical mixing of races--and school integration--positive interracial relations and academic achievement in racially mixed classrooms. The method chosen was to train people who were planning school desegregation in California and other parts of the Southwest to act as school change agents. This meant they learned to direct workers in local schools and communities so as to promote school desegregation and integration and to improve  interracial relations. The content of the training program was to include nine topics: the state of school desegregation, racism in American schools, the social and political structure of American schools and of the educational profession, alternative programs to support integration, theory and practice of making change in schools, coping with resistence, building support systems for consultants or change agents, and funding sources and other resources. A variety of instructional procedures were utilized to provide guidance, information, and experience in each area. (Author/JM)",

The Renaissance literature reflects the reality of the Negro as he indeed perceived himself regardless of color--the reality of the psychological mulatto. Histroically, black scholars must re-evaluate the origins of the integrationist movement. Even now most refuse to ask themselves if it was relevant to the African-American working class laborers and farmers whether or not a few Negroes got \"equal opportunity\" to become part of white America. Literary and other cultural aspects  of the black American experience must be employed in the historiography of analyzing such questions as: Who really wanted this struggle for total assimilation in white culture and economics? Why is it that the Negro intellectuals, until recently, refused to be associated with anything \"black,\"\"revolutionary,\" or \"African?\" Unfortunately, present-day New Negroes, building on the faulty foundations of the 1920's, retard advancement of the race and deny the establishment of a legitimate black historical tradition and black literary tradition.

The concern here is to assess the probable causes of such actions and to offer possible remedies for them. No one really knows the exact degree to which violence stems from the child, the home, the community, the school, or some combination of all these. It cannot be denied that urban society tends to be a violent one, and that aspects of it overflow into the school. On the other hand, it must be admitted that some antisocial behavior originates within the school and that some is reinforced by policies of and attitudes found in the school. It must be remembered that the school is never really a separate enclave which can remain untouched by  the society it serves. Nonetheless, it might be said that the schools contribute to their own problem of crime and violence in three areas: governance, interpersonal communication, and leadership. Immediate measures are preventive. They do not provide remedies for the causes of urban school violence. We must concentrate our greatest efforts on changing the values and attitudes of those who attend and manage our schools. We must develop strategies to create an environment where students, teachers, and administrators can resolve conflicts peacefully. (Author/JM)",

Title I services were extended to 74 elementary schools and three junior high schools. Title I services made available to pupils in &quot;Extended Service&quot; schools consisted of corrective reading instruction, mathematics instruction, and supportive services. In addition to the instructional activities mentioned  above, other instructional programs were: Business Education for Delinquent Children, Neglected Children's programs, and Pre-School programs. Service activities were: Supplementary Counseling, Supplementary Health, and Family Social Services and Attendance. Also a broad range of similar activities was conducted during June and July as a part of the Title I summer school. A total of 4,292 public and 243 nonpublic children participated in all phases of Title I. Sixty-two percent of the pupils achieved at least one month's gain per month of instruction on the Gates-MacGinitie Vocabulary Test. (Author/JM)",

The main objective is to teach Cantonese to non-Chinese speaking children so that they can use this new language in a meaningful way such as, carry on a simple conversation in that language. The ultimate goal in the oral segment is to have pupils demonstrate the progressive ability to carry on and understand a Chinese conversation with peers who are native Chinese speakers. The curriculum will also provide knowledge, insight, and an appreciation for the cultural similarities and differences between Chinese and English speaking peoples. The format of the curriculum has the &quot;ripple-effect.&quot; It evolves from the students' basic personal needs to their home,  school, and community environments. Therefore, by relating their new language to their own needs and experiences, Chinese becomes meaningful to them. Language is cumulative. This system provides a review factor which relates each unit introduced to previous units taught. The purpose of the reading and writing segment is to show the language's possibilities and the pupil's potential to fully attain Chinese as a second language. It is hoped that this will further their interest in future Chinese studies. (JM)",

The program is charged with developing and disseminating Chinese bilingual/bicultural curriculum materials, providing instruction in both English and Cantonese in the basic subject areas, providing the parents of our students with second language instruction in English and Cantonese, and developing an educational prototype which might serve as a replicable model for the development of a K-12 bilingual/bicultural program.  A student in the program divides his school time between two teachers in two different classrooms: an English component class and a Chinese bilingual component class. The student will spend half the day in one class and the other half in the other. In some grades the alternation between components is every other day. The students are offered the following subjects: English reading and writing, Chinese reading and writing, spoken English, spoken Cantonese, mathematics, social studies/science, music, physical education, and art.

Both the politics of education and the quality of the educational process must be considered before suggesting futures for cable technology. A significant impact can be made on the politics of education if cable technology is used creatively and constructively to improve the educational process. Because existing educational institutions have neither credibility nor accountability in many communities, especially among minorities, the establishment of community controlled institutions is essential in planning for the development of a community level cable television educational system. These  institutions should have a research, development, and demonstration function. Though high, the costs involved seem reasonable and justifiable considering the potential of cable technology and the inferior results so far achieved by educational institutions serving minority groups. The depth of the social crisis requires new concepts and new directions for which cable technology provides a unique and historical opportunity. (SA)",

Tables, likewise, provide estimates of numbers of people participating in nonvocational education--general education, television courses, and &quot;liberal&quot; adult education. It is estimated  that about 12 percent of the total population aged 15 and over is participating in adult education with the majority being in the 15-30 years age group. About a quarter to a third of enrollees in part-time vocational and nonvocational education are women; female participation in the young workers' educational institutes is about 60 percent. Estimates of expenditures for each type of education or training are summarized. Approximately 1 percent of the total 1974 government expenditure is for adult education while 23 percent is allotted for formal full-time education. (EA)",

Military bases, private driving schools, motorcycle dealer sponsored schools, youth and service clubs, as well as public schools could offer motorcycle safety instructional programs. A survey revealed a lack of existing programs, citing a shortage of qualified teachers as the main cause. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF), founded by the six leading motorcycle manufacturers in the United States, offers a remedy  through services in teacher education, development of related curriculum materials, testing of such materials, data analysis, and research. Recently graduate workshops were conducted offering basic riding instruction, problem identification, and educational programming and curriculum development, aimed at increasing the number of qualified motorcycle teachers. Now the responsibility rests with the high school traffic safety educators, teacher training faculty, State education department personnel, and others to provide this needed instructional program.

        "description":"Two equally important and parallel developments have been working together: first, the emergence of a substantial and well-defined national role in career education and second, the explosive expansion of the system of career education. Career education first should provide meaningful, practical, open-ended career education in communities and regions and in other eligible institutions (profit and nonprofit) of education. Second, it should provide an effective strategy for marshalling the myriad of manpower programs that have been uncovered throughout the national government. To begin to implement innovations in career education for the 1970's, a two-edged approach is needed: the creation of a system-wide career education coordinator and the establishment of a new organizational  unit. The career education system should stimulate enrollment in all performance-measured educational activity in our educational system, particularly those that follow through with job and community placement.

Norway has many one and two room schools on the primary level, but has a well-developed vocational school system. Training is provided before apprenticeship through workshop-schools or during apprenticeship in apprentice schools. Further instruction is available through technical trade schools and specialized trade schools in a great variety of vocational areas. Denmark provides tuition-free technical and vocational training aimed at definite occupational fields as well as community, daily living, and leisure time instruction. The technical, commercial, and other vocational schools are self-governing, under Ministry of Education  supervision rather than under regional or local control. In Sweden, students attend a nine-year comprehensive compulsory school that includes craft instruction with no division into groups by sex. The student has three upper secondary school options including vocational school. Vocational training is provided in a large variety of trades in programs of one to several years. Many firms operate their own vocational schools. Recently, a new school unit combining the gymnasium continuation school and vocational school was created to form the gymnasial school. (MW)",

The research component was twofold; first an attempt was made to identify alternate educational applications of the computer terminal for the districts and second, an analysis of staff usage over a four-month period has been evaluated and documented as to type and extent of activities. Results to date show a generally favorable acceptance of the system, as well as a growing use of the  computer terminals in obtaining information for curriculum development and for research.

Taken together these three components comprise a conceptual framework for development of implementing curriculum guides. The rationale covers assumptions about learners, about the nature of career development, and about effective interventions to achieve career development, followed by general assumptions about the environment. The conceptualization encompasses three major components of career development: (1) the four areas  of individual growth and development (self-realization, social relationships, civic responsibility, and economic efficiency); (2) the four aspects of the environment in which growth occurs (home, school, work/leisure, and community); and (3) the three dimensions of the sequence of experiences implementing career development (awareness, exploration, and preparation-placement). The four goals (self-realization, social relationships, civic responsibility, and economic efficiency) are summarized in table form with end-goals and learner objectives by grade level.

The historical background of internship in the United States is developed in a 25-page section, appended by a 10-page annotated bibliography. On-site visitations to the 11 institutions disclosed wide variations, particularly in the area of implementation (financial remuneration, course credit, student role in negotiating, advisor role, and orientation); the section is 25 pages. A 68-page indepth evaluation of the internship at Rutgers University indicates that there is general support for the internship concept; further  study of the relationship of the internship to career goals is required. Guidelines for the 30-page Internship Manual, which contains suggestions for the implementation and evaluation of an internship program, were formulated from an analysis and synthesis of these data. Among the recommendations contained in the 40-page summary are that the internship component be continued after termination of EPDA 552 projects, but with evaluation provisions. (AJ)",

The second chapter discusses general planning considerations. Subsequent chapters deal with recruitment, screening and selection, volunteer training and orientation, the instillment of volunteer incentive and support, and the assessment of volunteer programs. Descriptions of typical volunteer program types are published separately and are summarized in chapter 12, along with  references to information available on the various subjects. Caution must be used in the acceptance of specifics which are especially vulnerable to varying conditions in different communities. The manual may be viewed as a core curriculum designed for training of volunteer program developers and administrators.

Pupils, through participation, can learn responsibility and leadership and develop their character. Patrol work is relevant and necessary, and the children are enthusiastic participants. Moreover, patrol work stresses individual needs and human relations. Patrols need everyone's support. There is a job to be done in the safety patrol work throughout America that is vital--vital as life itself. The school safety patrol has a definite place in today's educational system. (NH)",

        "description":"There are three levels of potential liability involved in the specific area of school safety patrols--liability of the school district as an entity of government, liability of the individual school board member, and liability of the school administrators who supervise the school safety program. But there is no known case in a court of record in which these liabilities have been decided. There are several steps school officials can take to reduce their liability potential. The first is to secure enactment of State legislation specifically authorizing the maintenance of school safety patrols. A second step is directing a complete review of the entire school safety patrol program. Thirdly, if exempting legislation is not possible, legislation should be sought which provides for the  indemnification of any school official or employee who is the subject of a judgment for damages in any action arising out of the performance of his duties.

The primary interest indicated by State departments of education was in curriculum guidelines, program planning and administration, instructional materials, and teacher qualifications. Although nearly all States report some material already available, there is wide agreement on the need for development of additional instructional material. Sixty-five percent of the respondents felt that motorcycle safety education, during the last three years, has become more acceptable as a school  responsibility. Responses from 122 colleges and universities revealed similar primary interests. A shortage of qualified motorcycle education teachers appears to be a restrictive factor in developing programs in colleges and secondary schools. Increased emphasis on motorcycle safety is being planned in 60 percent of the colleges. However, the respondents showed wide differences of opinion on predicting the future of motorcycle safety during the next five years. (EA)",

The course is divided into three sections and, within each section, into units and jobs. Each job is broken down into five sections: objective, motivation, references, teaching outline, and teaching procedures; in most cases illustrative material is provided. Section A, Livestock Selection, is 27 pages long and reviews herd selection, and the selection of swine, beef animals, sheep, and dairy cattle. Section B, 96 pages,  covers the history and present day methods of livestock breeding, trends in Livestock Improvement, and 13 sections covering aspects of reproduction and inheritance. The topics treated in Livestock Nutrition, Section C, 80 pages, are the monogastric and ruminant digestive systems, six sections on nutrients, followed by the digestive process, metabolism and absorption of nutrients, and four sections on rations.

The first session dealing with instructional objectives included a curriculum rationale, educational objectives, selecting appropriate educational objectives, establishing performance standards, and defining content for objectives. Training in the construction of instructional sequences dealt with teaching units and lesson plans, analyzing learning outcomes, appropriate practice, knowledge of results, and perceived purpose. The session on evaluation emphasized a rigorous system for assessment of  teaching, test construction, item sampling, interpretation of student performance data; the preassessment of learner competency was also examined. The evaluation of the institute offers data related to a profile of the participants, physical facilities, objectives, the program--its strength and weaknesses--and an overall rating. The appendix includes the forms and questionnaires used in evaluating the institute. (MW)",

The course is defined as the study of organic and inorganic materials and how they are changed to satisfy man's material needs. The guide opens with orientation suggestions, safety instruction, and introductory activities. Lesson plans covering the analysis and processing of plastic, metal, wood, and earth materials fill more than 100 pages of the guide, from which the instructor may select those he  wishes to use to complete a 74-day course. Each plan offers a learning activity, material and processes covered, necessary reference materials, and relevant information. Among the appendixes are a pre-post test and an attitude inventory, with answer keys, an equipment list, and a bibliography.

        "description":"The final report of the planning phase of Project COULD (Career Orientation Utilizing Language Development) serves a dual purpose: It provides a summary description of the overall project and of each of the units; and it records the interim and final evaluations. Project COULD was conceived as a partial answer to the problem that 60 percent of the children in Coos County had reading difficulties. The project then utilized career concepts indigenous to Coos County to simultaneously improve language skills and provide an early awareness of career opportunities with the development of 18 preliminary units incorporating the following basic objectives: career awareness, language development, and specific unit characteristics. The project evaluation was in two stages. First to assess  the conduct of the project, and second to assess the quality level of materials and activities produced. The final evaluative overview showed that the success of the project was due to: (1) the immediate specification of measurable objectives, and (2) the preparation of exemplary curriculum units. The remaining two-thirds of the document includes five appendixes: unit summaries and evaluations, minutes of interim progress review meetings, a calendar of anticipated due dates, exemplary model units, and job descriptions.

Children learn to speak the grammar and vocabulary characteristic of the language heard most frequently at home and in the immediate environment. Each unit of this instructional guide is designed to promote vocational awareness, exploration, and language development. The information in this unit on Coos County careers in lumbering was prepared for use at the eighth grade level for an approximate period of four weeks. It is divided into eight sections: a summary, an outline of the entire set of units for the category of lumbering, Project COULD's goals, a list of the performance  objectives, a vocabulary list, suggested learning activities, numerous resource materials (films, filmstrips, transparency sets, instruction sheets, pamphlets, books, records, slides, resource people, and a resource outline questionnaire), and background information on the Coos County lumber industry (job and process flow charts, job summaries, and suggested teacher reading).

        "description":"Designed to assist Computerized Vocational Information System (CVIS) users in evaluating projects in local secondary school sites, the handbook provides users with a variety of variables or viewpoints from which to assess the CVIS system. Four different approaches are presented to CVIS evaluation: the analysis of use patterns; the reaction of users and nonusers of the system; the effect of use on students' vocational planning; the cost-effectiveness of the system. Users might be analyzed by: sex, grade level, quartile by rank and/or test information, post high school plans, and reason for use. Use patterns can be analyzed by specific subsystem, by terminal, and by type of user (student, counselor, administrator, teacher). Approximately 80 pages of questionnaires (student,  counselor, administrator, teacher, and parent) are included as examples of the types of questions which might be asked. Suggestions for measuring changes in vocational maturity and student exploratory behavior are offered. The Occupational Plans Questionnaire has been included to realize crystallization of student vocational plans and the Vocational Plans Questionnaire to measure change in occupational knowledge. The concluding section is a 30-page cost justification guide by IBM Corporation (cost analysis of CVIS operation at Willowbrook High School, Illinois). (Author/EA)",

Gottfried Haberler considers the international aspects of recent United States inflation. William Fellner organizes his discussion of employment goals and overexpansion around manpower problems, acceleration and deceleration, &quot;inflationary equilibrium,&quot; money supply targets, and unemployment. Phillip Cagan analyzes monetary policy and provides perspective on previous positive efforts to combat inflation under controls. Wage behavior during each of the control phases, as related to both average hourly earnings in the private nonfarm economy and  negotiated wage settlement, is examined by Marten Estey. Charles McLure discusses fiscal policy by examining Kennedy-Johnson economics, the game plan of gradualism, Nixon's New Economic Policy, and the record of that policy. (Author/EA)",

Chapters 3-10 discuss possible program options within the budget categories of: national defense, agriculture, science, technology and industry, housing and community development, education, manpower, health, and income security. Chapter 7, dealing with the education budget, includes discussion of programs at all levels--occupational, vocational, and adult education--other educational aids, and general science. Focusing on the budget outlook for manpower programs in the 1974  budget, chapter 8 offers an overview of the rationale, program objectives, performance, proposed cuts, and suggests a revised role for future manpower programs.

In phase 2, the student continues basic skill development and completes curriculum requirements in social studies, English, health, and science. The third phase includes an indepth study of the world of work in both practical and theoretical terms. The student will be exposed to the underlying principle of work, labor unions, government, economics,  consumer education, and cultural institutions. It may also include vocational-technical training, on-the-job training, and/or intensive work experience in a specialized skill area.

        "description":"Due to recent industrial growth in Mississippi and the shortage of trained manpower in numerous occupations, start-up training programs have originated to provide a pretrained work force for new or expanding industry in the State. Each start-up training program is a joint effort between a new or expanding industry and a public educational institution that trains prospective company applicants for specific jobs prior to the start of plant operation. Some benefits are: higher standard of living for employees through better jobs, opportunity for prospective employees to explore new and different work before leaving present jobs, high percentage of job placement for employees, use of collective resources of total community, and the elevation of vocational-technical programs to a new  level of importance. The guide outlines the steps in developing and accomplishing objectives for each individual program as: establishing rapport, identifying program objectives, specifying training methods/means, conducting the training, and evaluating the program. A complexity of the program is the large number of tasks to be completed in a relatively short period of time. Six industries using start-up training programs are described--areas of training, numbers of participants trained and placed, types of training aids, and unique features of training program. (EA)",

The curriculum consists of 16 basic instructional modules organized in three groups: introduction, nursing role, and patient care. Optional modules included are: team leadership, pediatric nursing, maternity nursing, and psychiatric nursing. Part 2 is designed for the instructor and includes information about instructor role, student characteristics, and preliminary module descriptions. Part 3 consists of the syllabus of modules which provides module  objectives, experiences (classroom, laboratory, and library), and proficiency experiences (individual conferences with the instructor). Many of the modules include word lists for students to define; one module presents a case study, while another provides a chart of levels of behavior from prenatal to old age.

The middle school philosophy is child-centered and uses an individual approach to meet the unique needs of early adolescence. Within this framework, the industrial arts program is concerned with common learning needed by all persons to function effectively in our industrial-technological society and the development of attitudes, interests, abilities, and skills as well as occupational information. Some performance objectives include management organization, social relations, problem solving, consumer knowledge, and safety practices. It is desirable that  the program be co-educational with 100 percent participation. Facilities should stimulate learning and be adaptable for change. A suggested desirable class size is 16-20 or 18-22 students; a minimal program should provide two and one-half clock hours of weekly instruction for all students. A minimum of 75-100 square feet of open laboratory space per student is recommended by the council. Suggestions are offered for both unified arts patterns and traditional patterns of operation. Tools should not be limited to hand tools. Teacher preparation considerations include background in general education and professional/subject competence. (EA)",

An introductory article comments on environmental stewardship, the responsibilities of technology, and environmental education. The article on &quot;Perspective&quot; briefly reviews our technology, gives attention to viewing the environmental question as a total ecosystem with interrelated components and variables, and examines the role of industrial educators in changing values and environmental concern. The author of &quot;A Rationale for Integrating Industrial Arts and Environmental Education&quot;  views industrial arts teachers as having a unique opportunity to integrate environmental sensitivity into technology since technology will play a key role in solving pressing environmental problems. Another article focusing on &quot;Rationale for Studying the Environment in Industrial Arts&quot; conveys the concept of environmental education as an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary approach with industrial arts dealing with the technological dimensions of environmental education. The concluding article reviews funding appropriated by the Environmental Education Act of 1970. Environmental careers are briefly surveyed, and a bibliography of environmental books is included.

(1) Any prescription for \"every\" person is questionable. (2) Does the phrase \"marketable skill\" refer to a specialized skill or does it refer to the ability to fill a job? (3) If the definition of marketable skill applies to the ability to be productive in a job, then the most important qualities are the communication skills and personal traits derived from general education that produce fully-rounded human beings. (4) Increased vocational training of young people does not necessarily increase employment. (5) High schools are likely not to be very proficient at vocational education. (6) For students with capacity and motivation for general  education, the cost of employability at age 18 would be a shortening or dilution of general education. (7) Much youth unemployment occurs among culturally handicapped youth with inadequate general education and vocational training; our problem is to raise their cultural level through a foundation of general education.

        "description":"Designed by the Monroe County Library System as a cooperative venture with Model Cities and the Adult Basic Education Department of the City School District of Rochester, New York, the project explored the feasibility of using socially oriented programs and area canvass by library aides to uncover communication needs and recruit enrolless for an area adult basic education program. Monroe County, New York, was estimated to have more than 20,000 functionally illiterate adults from divergent backgrounds. The report covers: recruitment and training of the library aides, development of the advisory task force, types of programs sponsored, evaluation methods, and a discussion of the difficulties inherent and experienced in a multiagency venture. Although funding by the Adult Basic  Education unit became unavailable in the early stages, similar objectives of encouraging adult basic education participation in general and providing aid to such programs with library materials and support were devised. It was found that cooperative funding efforts require careful consideration, skillful coordination, and a maintenance of effort to insure maximum functioning. The most important development of the project was the continuing interaction between the library and the involved agencies. Three-fourths of the document consists of appendixes of locally used promotional material. (EA)",

        "description":"Nearly 4.3 million workers held two jobs or more at the same time in May 1973, representing 5.1 percent of employed persons. After a 1972 decline, 1973 saw an increase of 500,000 more moonlighters. Four-fifths of all moonlighters were men. The difference between the multiple job-holding rates of Negro and of white workers was not statistically significant. Men whose primary jobs were as teachers below the college level or as protective service workers had the highest moonlighting rates. Men who were postal workers on their first jobs also had a high multiple job-holding rate. Most male multiple jobholders held a full-time job while working at a second job, but female moonlighters were about equally divided between those who had two part-time jobs and those who had a full-time and  a part-time job. A major part of the document is devoted to supplementary tables. (MW)",

        "description":"The study attempts to determine what labor effort disincentives, if any, will result from the introduction of a negative income tax plan into the fiscal structure of the U. S. The study's conclusions are: disincentives appear to be associated with negative income taxation, and these disincentives depend on whether the worker is in the manufacturing or nonmanufacturing industries. And, the disincentive effect for any group of workers is extremely sensitive to the employment opportunities of that group. That is, the groups of workers which should be least influenced by the aggregate employment opportunities show a small response to the proxy used, and the groups of workers which are subject to a wide variation of employment opportunities show no disincentive because their reactions  to the tight labor market of 1966 greatly outweigh any disincentives from the proxy. The policy implications would be that, while it is likely workers will exhibit disincentive tendencies under a negative income tax scheme, these tendencies will be greatly outweighed by conditions in the aggregate labor market. In the appendix a complete listing of the regression results is presented for the various subgroups. A four-page bibliography concludes the document. (Author/MW)",

The material, as organized, is a suggested sequence of instruction within each block. Each lesson is stated in terms of a specific teaching objective, teaching aids, references, and an outline of information. Upon successful completion of the 29 lessons in the block of work, students will be able to: (1) identify the major components of typical automotive engine cooling systems, (2) relate the functional significance of the components to the operation of the total system, (3) recognize common malfunctions of the cooling  system. Included with the course outline are transparency masters and reference guide listing related books, texts, and other publications. (MW)",

Some basic conceptual components proposed are: (1) self-awareness, (2) career awareness, (3) appreciations and attitudes, (4) economic awareness, (5) skill awareness and beginning competence, (6) decision-making, (7) employability skills, and (8) educational awareness. A holistic approach to the education of youth is suggested, integrating the home, school, and community into a total educational effort as a major goal of career education. The responsibilities of all members of the educational team from the board of  education to the guidance counselor are described to insure cohesiveness in the step-by-step process of career development. In conclusion, the three phases of career education are defined: (1) the awareness phase in grades K-6, (2) the exploration phase at the junior high level, and (3) the preparation phase at the high school level.

It deals with the broader concepts permeating career education on a nationwide level and those having grown out of the practical experience of developing new State programs. As primary change agents, administrators can set up pilot projects, establish good public relations, analyze the present system and channel responsibilities in the implementation process. The roles of the superintendent, the supervisor, the principal, the guidance counselor, and the teacher are clearly defined. Community resources lie in four basic areas: (1) the home, (2) business and labor, (3) elected officials  and public agencies, and (4) school personnel. Steps in utilizing these resources are enumerated and personnel development discussed. Strategies for curriculum development include the following approaches: (1) the career implications of the subject matter, (2) isolated activities approach, (3) unit approach, and (4) integrated activities. Two sample approaches to career education curriculum unit writing and a project evaluation conclude the document. (MW)",

The report deals only with private (and community) foundation support, since such data are not only public and easily available, but also serve to indicate the thrust provided by private financial sources to the development of health manpower education. The report is divided into three parts. The first is a description of the methodology used to obtain the data and a description of the coverage. The second provides a number of summary tables and a brief digest of the detailed  listings. The final, and by far the largest part, presents a detailed listing (or inventory) or private foundations providing support in 1971, classified in three different ways: (1) alphabetically by foundation name; (2) by State of foundation; and (3) by State of recipient.

The document contains two concept papers by recognized authorities on knowledge utilization activities: A Diffusion Mechanism for the Center for Vocational and Technical Education, Egon G. Guba; and Alternative Diffusion Strategies, Henry M. Brickell. The first paper begins with a review of diffusion models: considers six tactics including telling, showing, helping, involving, training, and intervening; and offers an explication of a diffusion program for the Center as its major thrust. Advocated within the program as mechanisms for effective diffusion are: (1) a distributor relations division; (2) a warranty division; (3) a training division; (4) a  promotions division; and (5) a market studies division. Each division's functions are outlined and evaluation criteria are reviewed. The second paper considers 10 images of the practitioner (regarding educators as adopters of innovations); implications of these images for diffusion; characteristics of the adoption setting; characteristics of the innovation, with a summary of desirable characteristics; and diffusion tactics. This paper concludes with alternative diffusion strategies describing sample case strategies for the adoption of an innovation in an educational setting. (NH)",

The four subject areas are: human development; housing, furnishing and equipment; food and nutrition; and clothing and textiles. The content emphases related to each subject area are: management, buymanship, leisure, careers, health and safety, and relationships. Instructional levels have been used to identify skill development in particular subject areas for a specific emphasis according to the learner's maturity level. Further explained are the course development and module development for local use. The  remainder of the document discusses the scope of learnings, framework, and modules in human development, housing, furnishings and equipment, food and nutrition, and clothing and textiles. Each module is presented in terms of behavioral outcomes, suggested learning experiences, measurement of student progress, and related modules.

        "description":"PRYO, the Swedish acronym for Praktiske Yrkesorientering, translates into English as Practical Work Orientation. PRYO was the result of action taken by the Swedish legislature, excluding educational researchers for the most part, in which compulsory school attendance was extended from seven to nine years to further equalize Swedish education while providing students with some knowledge of life outside of school. Until 1971, PRYO consisted of two weeks of work outside school, required of all eighth graders. In 1971, PRYO was changed to include three school visits to varied forms of industry and business during the eighth grade year, and the work experience followed in the ninth and final compulsory year. Having established the historical basis of PRYO, the author proceeds to  investigate it as it existed in May 1974, through interviews with people in various capacities who are involved in it and through examination of documents issued in connection with PRYO. He concludes that in spite of the political, rather than educational, grounds of Sweden's comprehensive school origins, the school and PRYO effectively prepare graduates in a variety of ways to face the contemporary world. He also examines possible application to American education. (AG)",

The graduate level was chosen because, though it is a small facet of the educational system, it is an important and influential leadership area within the system. The report on the national workshop: provides a record of participant recommendations and suggestions regarding career education personnel development, relates the career education concepts, needs, and problems for leadership personnel  in graduate teacher education, and provides a reference resource to leadership education personnel at all levels. Workshop discussion centered on papers presented by Louise Keller, Terrel Bell, and Grant Venn. Abstracts of the papers are included in the report together with criticisms, questions, and summaries. Materials relating to the workshop's organization and the full text of the papers are appended in the final three-fifths of the document. (Author/AG)",

        "description":"This report was based on a survey to determine how students in the health professions of medicine osteopathy, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatry, and veterinary medicine financed their educations during the 1970-71 school year. The purpose of this nationwide survey was to provide information on patterns of student expenses and on the sources from which income was obtained, including any indebtedness incurred to finance their education. Marital status to be the single most important factor in determining both expenses and incomes of students in the health programs. Spouses tended to contribute more than twice as much income as any other source. The average annual expenses were highest--between $6,231 and $6,710--for students in dentistry, podiatry, and osteopathy, and  lowest--$3,739--for those in pharmacy. Approximately 35 percent of all students reported receiving federal or state scholarships or other nonrefundable grants. While the proportion of students obtaining loans ranged from 43 percent for pharmacy students to 70 percent for osteopathy students. Findings showed that the majority of students in all health profession schools reported some indebtedness as of June 1971. (Author/PC)",

After three years of using this program, the authors have compiled some findings on girls' attitudes toward marriage and careers. These are that the average girl: (1) plans on being married and does not expect to work for a living; (2) has minimal knowledge about careers and their requirements; (3) selects traditional careers for women; and (4) is distrustful of, and often hostile to, the concept of &quot;Women's Liberation.&quot; The chief differences in thinking among average girls seems to arise more from  socioeconomics and educational experience rather than ethnic or cultural background.

        "description":"The struggle for self discovery is the major task of adolescent development. That struggle can be magnified by certain psychosocial forces which retard such ego identity development. American Indians share a centuries old, psychohistorical experience of massive disenfranchisement, powerlessness, and enforced dependency. Its symptomatic legacy is family disintegration, unemployment, alcoholism, and other suicidal behavior. For American Indian adolescents, who see such manifestations in their parents and tribes, it often triggers an unusually stormy adolescent struggle. The anticipated alienation, disorientation, and confusion of adolescence becomes magnified in the face of such negative identifications. This paper outlines a small group experience and the issues with which these  young people deal, its efficacy and outcome. (Author)",

To accomplish this, steps were taken at a mental health center to: (1) identify mediums in their program; (2) visit spiritual centers and observe their \"modus operandi\"; (3) exchange views with mediums; (4) accept referrals from and refer cases to spiritual centers; and (5) carry out research and produce a film to be used for training non-Hispanic staff. These steps were taken in recognition of the fact that the unique aspects of a culture must be identified and dealt with in any mental health program. Conclusions reached in this dialogue included calling attention to psychiatry's neglect of  sociocultural problems among Hispanic groups, and pointing out differences in cultural and technical orientation between classically trained mental health workers and folk healers (spiritualists). There was a need established for the implementation of training curricula for classically trained professionals who work with Hispanic patients. (Author/PC)",

Initial tests failed to support an incentive model for learning and transfer, but a new model given strong emphasis to the role of context in learning was developed which accounted for a wide range of learning and transfer data. Although this was clearly the most salient result, other work revealed that: (1) learning rules when there are exceptions to rules may be much more difficult than one might have been led to imagine; (2) simply solving any problem (learning the rule) may underlie the basis of the easy-to-hard transfer effects in children; (3) tests to measure dimensional preferences may create them; (4) young children may use more than a single  dimension in making choices when decisions can be considered sequentially; (5) dimensional processing skills may increase with age in ways that are more significant than simply changes in the allocation of attention; and (6) some claims concerning changes in mediating skills with age were most likely premature.

An edited version of the Berscheid, Walster, and Bohrnstedt Body Image Questionnaire (1972) and a focused interview were administered to three groups of female surgical patients both pre- and postoperatively. Significant differences were found between groups presurgically on time lag before calling doctor and amount of anxiety expressed in the interview. Breast surgery seems to elicit more anxiety, as evidenced by shorter times between appearance of symptom and contacting doctor, and spontaneous expression of fear of mutilation or death in the interview. Significant postsurgical decreases were found for all groups in self-concept and satisfaction with intimate relationships. The  defensive operation of denial is hypothesized to be masking postsurgical differences in the mastectomy patients. (Author)",

The project is based on the following premises: (1) children who learn basic academic skills and appropriate behaviors will be less vulnerable to future problems; (2) some children are not motivated by the usual rewards found in the school system; and (3) these children can be motivated through utilization of appropriate reinforcement procedures. The program involves three elements; (1) math and English work units which meet individual student needs, (2) group interpersonal skills classes, and (3) a counseling program for the parents. Results indicate that this investment in money, time, and concern  for children has brought short-term rewards for students in terms of higher grades, better test results in English, and improved relations with teachers, parents, and friends. Long-range effects on the lives of the students cannot be measured; however, the author feels that it is fairly safe to assume that the replacement of failure with successful learning experiences will have useful and rewarding ramifications for the child and society.

Extreme threats and other stressors can accumulate to produce behavior changes: perceived shortened time span, diminished search for alternatives, decreased planning, increased concreteness of thought, simplification of thought process, and diminished attention to events outside the area most threatened. Threats which lack credibility are unlikely to influence behavior except to invoke some hostility. Threats work most effectively when the threatened party believes them. Bigger threats inhibit actions more effectively than smaller ones, but threats merely sufficient to do their jobs may produce the largest change of values and attitudes. Ambiguous threats may appear as noncontingent ones to their  targets, in which case they are provocative. This analysis does not make many assumptions about the targets of threats, for the idea of contingency, especially as perceived by the threat target, seems adequate to explain most of the effects discussed.

Frequency of marijuana usage was greater among individuals with a personality profile suggesting dependence on others and heedlessness.

These new scales reflect the utility for sex and number of children, disentangle their separate effects, and provide independent measures of each. They are sensitive to deviations from a first choice, and index an underlying preference structure that is often at variance with a stated first preference. Two advances in psychological measurement theory provide the basis for the models and measures developed and tested in both the experimental and field data. The authors detail the development of both the model, using conjoint measurement theory, and the scales, using the unfolding theory. Six different models of family composition have been  tested in exploratory work to date. They range from the simplest--that the utility for a boy adds to the utility for a girl to give the utility for a family--to a threshold model which implies some sort of stopping rule, such as having at least one or two sons. The most viable model asserts that the relevant variables are the total number of children and the algebriac difference between the number of boys and the number of girls preferred. A cross-cultural analysis of scale validity is reviewed. (Author/PC)",

However, a significant correlation occured between the client and rater opinions concerning helpful counselors. Counselors receiving feedback based on client-rater evaluations and also obtaining encouragement to plan and implement alternative behaviors improved significantly more on their pre-post total scores than did a matched control group of counselors. All counselors improved their client-rater scores as a result of a supervised practicum experience. Implications and suggestions for counselor supervisors are included. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper discusses new projections for career education, particularily in Michigan. The author maintains that the emphasis for vocational education must be on the individual and his need for satisfying work. He discusses what work is, the meaning of work through the ages, and why men work. He proposes a list of needs which can be satisfied, in part at least, through work. These are: (1) need for income, (2) need for activity, (3) need for self-respect and the respect of others, (4) need for social contacts and participation, and (5) need to express one's self creativity. According to the author, the traditional controversy between vocational educators and those advocating a liberal education is no longer necessary. Technology has brought the sciences and the arts to vocations,  so that study in preparation for a career is a means of providing a broad and liberating education. Education for work and education for living are really two sides of the same coin. (Author/HMV)",

Taking into consideration some of the variables which possibly affect death, this paper reviews intervention techniques with the possible goal of saving lives. Knowing that the elderly respond to the environment, society should accept as its responsibility the provision of support within that environment. The author sees this support as coming from community-based intervention which would hopefully delay death, allowing the elderly to remain as functional members of society, and returning the elderly to the mainstream of society. Part of this environmental intervention relates to changing society's attitudes toward aging. The other thrust of the paper is toward community intervention, where the importance of  marriage and friends is emphasized. (Author/PC)",

The report reviews the diagnostic methods for determining addiction in newborns as well as the treatment processes. The controversy over methadone treatment for heroin addiction is also discussed in light of the severity of withdrawal symptoms. One definite conclusion reached in the report is that a narcotic-dependent woman can give birth to a baby who is dependent on narcotics. If the dependence is severe enough and the baby is untreated, its life  can be endangered. These facts alone indicate the need for further research in this area. (Author/PC)",

For seven years, the author followed the careers of all boys who were sophomores in 1964 in 14 high schools in one of Oregon's nonmetropolitan counties to see what patterns of delinquency developed in the group. By correlating his findings with those of a slightly later study of deviance among Philadelphia high school boys, he has conclusively shown that there are remarkable similarities between delinquency in town and cities. Patterns of delinquency included the finding that more than half (56 percent) of the juvenile deliquents continued to commit offenses after leaving high school. A predictor of adult criminal behavior was the timing of juvenile delinquencies, with 73 percent of those boys who  committed offenses both before and after the first semester of their sophomore year going on to commit offenses as young adults. The report describes who, among the high school students, became an offender, and when, as well as those characteristics of delinquency within the group. (Author/PC)",

A social exchange theory was suggested as the general theoretical framework for the study. The overall pattern of results suggested that women with different numbers of children and occupational statuses showed different relative costs and benefits of parenthood and work. In particular, women with larger families had a higher general satisfaction with parenthood than those with small or no families. Those who were childless saw higher general costs associated with parenthood than those with small or large families, and professional women also saw  greater costs of parenthood than did the nonprofessional women. General motivation for work was found to be higher among the professional women. Other significant differences were found between subgroups of women who differed in work status or family size in terms of their responses to both openended and structured questions regarding their motivation for parenthood and working.

Studies were conducted within several organizations using similar procedures in each. First-level management males and females, matched as closely as possible, were asked to describe an occasion on which they felt they had been most successful and an occasion on which they felt they had been least successful. For each situation the managers were asked to rate the importance to the outcome of a number of causes: ability, effort, ease or difficulty of the task, and luck. In addition, these persons were asked to evaluate themselves on a number of characteristics relevant to their job performance and to complete a  questionnaire measuring job satisfaction. Results indicated that the patterns of male and female managers showed a surprisingly high degree of similarity, giving weight to the argument that males and females in equivalent positions are more similar than different. Ability differences occured between the two groups, with males consistently rating their performance and ability higher and attributing success more to their ability. For the female managers, estimates of ability were significantly linked to self-estimated physical attractiveness and to their perceived relationship with their supervisors. Attitudinal differences between young and older management women were also noted. (Author/PC)",

Those conditions of change involve principles which relate to three elements--people, places, and things. Within these categories, principles may be enumerated which operate to facilitate or restrain change or innovation within educational institutions. The relationship of people to institutional change is summarized with two fundamental principles: (1) the translation of a theoretical curriculum into program reality is always a matter of personal involvement; (2) the changes most often realized are those clearly perceived by people. Just as change involves people, change also occurs at given places, at given times. As an institution orients change to goals,  several principles seem to be appropriate. These include: (1) any institution can assimilate only so much change in a given period of time; (2) change requires time, but not in proportion to the extent of change. In order to complete this sequence of change which relates people to things, the author places a premium on communication with those who are responsible for accomplishing program objectives. When change actually occurs, it is a result of people who have a commitment, working hard in programs to which they have a dedication, doing things which make a difference. (Author/PC)",

A pair of chief personnel-men, one black, one white, boarded over 70 ships on the east and west coasts to search disciplinary records for data and to administer an attitude questionnaire to 324 sets of personnel. Conclusions from the study revealed no significant differences in the treatment of blacks and whites for whom reports were filed. The authors  acknowledge that this does not mean that equality of treatment has been established, since there is no way of knowing the number of offenders of each race who were not put on record or were disciplined by their division officers.

High school students were assigned to high, middle, and low attraction groups on the basis of their ratings of their fellow classmates. The results indicated that subjects in both studies did not find those crowded conditions to be aversive or stressful or to influence their affective ratings of their fellow subjects. In the second study, while density had no main effects on task performance, under middle attraction conditions performance was impaired as a function of density. These findings suggest that while crowding did  not necessarily result in a stressful experience, both social and spatial elements were important in obtaining group productivity. Overall, negative, and neutral verbal behavior increased as a function of density. Neutral verbal behavior increased in high and middle attraction groups while it slightly decreased in low attraction groups as a function of density. There were no efforts of density and attraction on positive verbal behavior. (Author)",

The control group consisted of 63 subjects who were not considered \"high-risk,\" the ratio of which was 30 percent black. A comparison of mean gain in self-esteem at the end of 40 weeks of school showed a gain of .29 for the control group and a gain of 9.42 (significant at .01) for the IEP group. It was hypothesized that the rise in self-esteem scores for the IEP group resulted from  participation in the IEP program rather than from college attendance per se. Speculation is made by the author on reasons why the initial self-esteem scores of the IEP subjects were so low, and important conclusions were drawn from the data concerning overall results of higher self-esteem in black students.

First, he asserts that assessment procedures which attend exclusively to the accuracy with which subjects are able to characterize other people's feelings provide little or no useful information about the process of empathic understanding. Second, he takes issue with those investigators who insist that empathy be defined as an interaction between discrete cognitive and affective responses, and argues that assessment procedures which require that subjects share, as well as understand, the feelings of others hopelessly confuse the processes of empathy and projection, and logically exclude the possibility of achieving an unambiguous index  of empathic skill. In order to defend these claims, the author first characterizes the principal ingredients of the most current measures of empathic ability, describes what he feels are the major limitations of these procedures, and explicates specific corrective measures.

The process of skill training involved defining and rationalizing the skill in behavioral terms, using models to demonstrate effective and ineffective examples, and giving opportunities for extensive supervised practice of the skill.

        "description":"Kenya and Ghana provide interesting case studies of the theory that women who have access to roles other than mother and whose status does not depend largely or solely on the number of children they bear will have fewer children. Kenyan and Ghanaian women have among the highest desired and actual fertility in the world. They also, relatively speaking, appear to have a degree of independence and breadth of roles which many women, Muslim women in particular, do not have. This paper documents briefly the status and roles of women in each of these countries, their fertility levels and what they imply for the theoretical model under consideration. (Author)",

In an attempt to gather such information, 17 polydrug users, selected from a group of 224 young adult, male, hospitalized veterans were matched for socioeconomic class and age with 17 controls who reported no experience with drugs of any kind. Comparison of the two groups on several personality measures showed significant differences on indices of neuroticism, sensation-seeking, and state anxiety. On the basis of personality characteristics, veterans could be classified into drug usage categories with 97.05 percent accuracy.  (Author)",

        "description":"The author reviews research which examines a specific aspect of achievement arousal concerning the variable, \"self-importance\" of immediate activity. It also examines the relationship between \"self-importance\" and \"future-importance\"--that is, the extent to which possession of a certain personality attribute is believed necessary for achieving future goals. The author raises the question of whether the accentuation of characteristic effects of achievement related motives previously attributed to contingent future orientation is produced instead by contingent self-evaluation. Several as yet unpublished investigations into this area conclude that: (1) the effects of contingent self-evaluation (or self-importance, of immediate activity) are similar to those of contingent future  orientation; and (2) when research views both effects of self- and future-importance simultaneously, both dimensions of motivational arousal are found to produce the greatest engagement of achievement-related motives. A study by Blumenfeld et. al. (1974) is cited as a basis for these later investigations, as is an unpublished study by Raynor and Mitchell (1974) which explores the joint effects of future- and self-importance on grades obtained in an introductory psychology course.

His inability to do so results in what Piaget calls egocentric speech whereas what Piaget calls socialized speech indicates that the child actually adopts his listener's viewpoint and engages in an exchange of ideas. The present study was an initial effort to explore the potential of conversational rhythm as another criterion for distinguishing between egocentric and sociocentric orientations. Forty children were assembled into 20 same-sex pairs on the basis of age. The children in 10 of the pairs were between 5 and 6 years of age; the other 10, between 6 and 7 years old. Each pair engaged in a 20-minute conversation on each of two  occasions. The 40 conversations were electronically analyzed in terms of pauses (silences within the utterances of a single speaker) and switching pauses (Silences between the utterances of two speakers). The results indicated that the average duration of pauses and switching pauses were consistent within conversation and from conversation to conversation both for the younger and older pairs.

The data collected from this sample of the general public contrasted in several ways with data gathered among college students. First, the percentage of respondents who told fear of success stories were generally lower among the noncollege population. The groups with a high incidence of fear of success were those most similar to college students. Other findings of researchers studying college students were corroborated: (1) blacks were significantly less likely to tell fear of success stories than whites; (2) males told fear of success  stories to a male cue almost as often as females did to a female cue. In this study, women who both feared success and were traditional had significantly larger families than women who either did not fear success or who feared success but were not traditional. There is now under way a more detailed analysis of fear of success among the currently-married white females in the study, aged 18 to 55. (Author/PC)",

The characters and rules are designed to ensure easy transition from i.t.a. to traditional orthography (T.O.). In September 1969 the British Schools Council published a comprehensive review of the use of i.t.a. for the teaching of literacy after nine years of research and experimentation in i.t.a. Research findings show that the unadulterated use of T.O. for beginning reading and writing reduces the potential of average and above average children in the early years of school and actually increases the incidence of reading and writing disabilities. In  contrast, i.t.a. enriches the early school experiences of most children and also provides a highly effective preventive measure to guard against reading and writing disorders. For remedial treatment, i.t.a. seems to be most effective when students are exposed to it for the greater part of their working day. These conclusions may now be extended to literacy learning in English when students have some other mother tongue. (JM)",

One strategy is the development of sight vocabulary; another is phonetic analysis, which includes sound-symbol correspondence, syllabication, and accent; and a final strategy is structural analysis, which includes roots, compound words, inflected endings, prefixes, suffixes, and contractions. The reader, however, should not become totally dependent on these strategies; such dependency could result in serious problems. Elementary level English as a Second Language (ESL) readers will have varying degrees of difficulty in identifying words, depending on the nature of their native script and the transfer to English print. Word identification may or may  not be an important aspect to a reading program for the individual reader. It is important, however, that the ESL reader be familiar with the multitude of ways of identifying words in order to gain meaning. (Author)",

Pupils are all too often evaluated in terms of their ability to express what they know rather than what they think. Thoughtful reading can be done from the very beginning of reading instruction. Effective questioning practices will develop this ability. The ability to know what the author says is generally referred to as the literal level of comprehension. This level tends to be overemphasized because literal comprehension is fundamental and can be more clearly defined and taught. Determining what the author means is often referred to as the inferential level of comprehension. Comprehension at this level requires the students to read between the lines, analyzing and interpreting the  information presented. Evaluative reading means that an interaction between the author and the reader takes place; the reader makes a personal judgment about what the author says or means, not only analyzing and synthesizing the information but also evaluating it in terms of its quality, value, accuracy, and truthfulness. Creative reading overlaps with critical reading in that it also implies application and internalization of the written message, rearranging the ideas into new thoughts and ideas. (WR)",

The teacher of adults should utilize these students' experiences, because adults can respond better if encouraged to draw on their personal knowledge. The non-English speaking adult students learning English as a second language have several obstacles to overcome. Not only must they learn to communicate in a new language, but also they must adapt themselves to American culture. Influences on an adult's ability to learn English as a Second Language (ESL) skills include aptitude, age, motivation, and native language interference. These influences are variable and can positively and/or negatively affect ESL learning. Reading ESL is important in order for the  non-English adult to communicate effectively and to become more aware of himself in relation to his society. Several factors affect the adult's ability to learn to read English. They are oral knowledge of English, literacy level in the native language, the native language orthography, and student incentive.

Of these, 15 subjects were selected for being the poorest readers in their class, and the other 15 were selected as being the best readers in their class on the basis of their scores on the Wide Range Achievement Test. Stimuli were 10 picutres of common objects chosen from the Stanford-Binet picture vocabulary test and their printed word equivalents. For half of the subjects, all of memory set (MS)  size two (two items in memory) was run before MS size four; for the other half, this was reversed. The subjects viewed slides of the pictures or words and indicated whether the slides were the same or different. The results showed no differences between GRs and PRs or between grades in preference or in pictorial versus word mode of encoding. However, the substantial reading ability and grade differences found in this and previous studies indicate reader ability difference in the facility to encode single words. (WR)",

We cannot hope to attain the high level of competency needed in our professional reading programs if we are to continue in our traditional demands for cognitive skills without application to children in our instructional processes. Inservice teacher education programs also have a growing responsibility for providing reading teachers with more than the conventional facts and theories of reading that they may or may not have received in their earlier training. Perhaps one of the most vigorous and far reaching efforts in the 1970's to raise the current standards of inservice and continuing education for those who teach  reading is found in the International Reading Association's Competency-Based Teacher Education Model. The 17 components listed are referred to as resource modules and can be divided into instructional modules for use in inservice, graduate, or undergraduate programs. Educational institutions must be ready to reach beyond traditional programs of inservice and preservice instruction if we are to succeed in our thrust toward excellence in educational programs for teachers of reading.

The test of the sequence and structure of reading instruction is not simply a matter of completing the learning activities correctly, nor is it the level of attainment reached in the reading test, but it is rather the ability of the student to apply the skills learned to any reading situation in which he finds himself. Therefore, teachers need to think in terms of reading curriculum and not narrowly in terms of reading instruction in the areas of word attack skills, comprehension, and reference skills. There are three aspects of the reading curriculum which need consideration in planning school work: reading purposes, reading media, and reading skills and techniques. Reading is too often thought  of in terms of books. The child is not prepared for effective reading unless he has had experience of the whole range of media in terms of types of publication, types of writing, and types of author purpose. Two interrelated problems, structure and transfer, must receive careful attention when planning the reading curriculum. The use of the total curriculum as the basis for reading instruction holds out the greatest hope of a higher level of success in the future. (SW)",

A study skill is a mental technique to use when accomplishing a specific task or solving a given problem and is one element in a process essential for efficient and effective reading. Students who lack basic study skills can be taught to think if situations are developed which require thinking. One way to stimulate thinking is through the use of cognitive centers, a provocative setting generated by activities and/or materials presented in a manner to stimulate a small number of students to engage in the exchange of opinions for the purpose of developing proficiency in prestated study skills. Examples are given of using the cognitive center approach to provide students with the study  skill abilities to discover the basic structure in a system, to see relationships, and to evaluate situations or information.

        "description":"Both psychologists and reading specialists have been interested in whether words are processed letter by letter or in larger units. A reaction time paradigm was used to evaluate these options with interest focused on potential units of word recognition which might be functional within single syllable words. The basic paradigm involved presenting subjects with a five-letter word accompanied by a probe letter or letters (BLAST:BL). Subjects were to indicate if all letters in the probe were from the word. Reaction time for these decisions was measured for all probe types: single letter probes, all possible double letter probes, all triple letter probes, or the whole word as a probe. Several probe types were identified as being exceptionally easy to identify as members of the target  word. The results were replicated in a second experiment under conditions where a visual match was not possible (BLAST:b1) and where a visual match was quite likely. A third experiment employed the same paradigm but with consonant strings which contained permissible spelling patterns or nonpermissible patterns. Permissible strings again showed a unit effect on the first and final consonant clusters. (Author/TO)",

        "description":"Analogous auditory and visual central-incidental learning tasks were administered to 24 students from each of the second, fourth, and sixth grades. The visual tasks served as another modification of Hagen's central-incidental learning paradigm, with the interpretation that focal attention processes continue to develop until the age of 12 or 13 years. The auditory tasks were administered to the same students in order to extend this interpretation to auditory selective attention processes and to assess the feasibility of a modality independent central process for allocating and maintaining attention. As predicted, central task learning increased with age for both auditory and visual presentations. Visual incidental learning followed the predicted curvilinear age trend for boys but  not for girls. Auditory incidental learning increased with age for boys but not for girls. These results suggest that auditory selective attention processes develop more slowly than visual selective attention processes, especially for boys. (Author)",

A form designed to collect mid-year and end-of-year data on reading achievement was used in each of 27 schools. The form consisted of four key categories--decoding, comprehension, study skills, and literature--and included 14 levels of pupil growth in each of the four areas. A section of the form was planned to record the highest level of pupil growth in each of the four  categories. The mid-year data were used to assess overall class progress and to report to the parents about their child's reading achievement. End-of-year data were used to evaluate the impact of the program and to provide levels of pupil attainment not normally available at the grade, school, or district levels. (WR)",

The humanists are concerned with such matters as adaptability, creativity, self-concept, values, attitudes, beliefs, feelings and other affective results of learning. However, changes in the way teachers are certified and in the ways they are prepared to teach are desirable. By 1980 all existing teacher education  programs must become competency based.

The two word lists were compared by token comparison--a method by which words are weighted on the basis of frequency of occurrence within a given set of materials. The written materials used for the comparisons were two large word count studies published within the past decade. In determining the cumulative frequency of words on each list, regularly inflected forms were combined. Calculating the cumulative frequencies of both the word list for the 1970's and the Dolch list in each of the two large word count studies made it possible to determine whether any differences existed and the statistical significance of the  differences. The results indicated that the word list for the 1970's accounted for a significantly greater proportion of words than the Dolch list in written materials encountered by both children and adults. However, both lists accounted for over 50 percent of the words used in materials for children and adults. (WR)",

It was hypothesized that if sexism is a valid dimension as measured in this study, then \"sexists\" would learn nonsense syllables associated with scenes rated \"role appropriate\" faster than those rated \"role inappropriate,\" since the latter scenes would be expected to be somewhat aversive for them. Forty-eight female and 44 male subjects were presented two separate sets of eight nonsense syllables paired with chosen pictures which differed in role appropriateness. The results revealed that for all subjects inappropriate scenes were learned faster than appropriate scenes, and scenes  depicting females were learned faster than those depicting males. Among females, sexist subjects took a slightly longer time to learn syllables associated with appropriate scenes than those associated with inappropriate scenes compared to nonsexists. Among males, nonsexists learned syllables paired with inappropriate scenes faster than those paired with appropriate scenes, while sexists showed relatively little difference in learning rates as a function of appropriateness.

The study was designed to collect and analyze the verbal protocols of 11 seventh grade students involved in introspection as they responded to standardized measures of reading comprehension. The protocols were taped and later transcribed for analysis. A tree diagram feature analysis of the verbalizations was used to classify the responses into discrete strategies. The analysis scheme was subjected to a test of applicability. The proportion of agreement (.86) obtained by 10 independent judges was judged to be satisfactory to insure the reliability of the technique. Descriptive and statistical data reported frequency  of use and successes, and showed significant strategy effect and a strategy-times-item type interaction for each individual. The study demonstrated the usefulness of introspection as a method for gathering information about the process of reading. It also supported the notion that reasoning strategies can be identified by careful and systematic analysis of students' verbal protocols. (Author/WR)",

Testing and data collection was conducted between December 1973 and May 1974 and included pre- and post-testing of reading achievement, completion of individual student and staff data forms, collection of attendance data, and administration of an attitude scale and of staff questionnaires. Classroom and tutoring activities were also observed. Analysis of the data revealed, among other findings, that: students who were older, had more prior schooling, and had highest  entry level skills gained the most; students and adults who perceived their attendance as voluntary did better than those who did not; and the number of hours of participation in the programs did not relate to outcome, but students who attended the greatest proportion of classes did better than students with irregular attendance.

The ARDS method has built into it three major essentials for the acclimatization acceleration of uneducated and undereducated adult readers: acknowledgement of need for self improvement, capability for progressing at their own rate in terms of self-imposed goals and  time limits, and provision for evaluation of specified intervals. The ARDS follows an orderly progression through sensory experience: look at a visual, talk about the visual, listen to summaries of student reactions, read these reactions, and add to audio and visual materials on the subject. The materials are compiled and graded by readability scores and the learning package is developed around three content areas: ecology, family convergence, and employer-employee relationships. (WR)",

Tasks calling for word recognition indicated that subjects could recognize and pronounce the words in the English reading passages. Subjects mastered English-to-German-to-English translations with concrete samples, but were dissatisfied when they applied the same procedure to sentences with abstract connotations. When further abstract sentences were examined, students  resorted to manipulating words in order to attain meaning. Pedagogical changes suggested by the study include preparation (exposing the bilingual student to main ideas of the new reading-learning experience), direction (directing the bilingual student to silent reading), discussion (challenging the bilingual student to use the weaker language in a discussion of the silently read passage), and application (letting the bilingual students expand and refine their own language facilities).

As in the analysis of congruence in geometry, a definite and concrete set of proposals about congruence of meaning depends essentially on the kind of theoretical framework assumed. For this analysis a fixed, context-free grammar is assumed. Four definitions of congruence are established. This is followed by a discussion of the properties of congruence: first, a discussion of the natural analogues of classical geometric theorems about congruence of figures; second, an examination of the relation between congruence and groups of transformations; finally, a consideration of some conjectures about the  expressiveness of language when the congruence relation is that of paraphrase. The geometrical analogy further suggests a relation between congruence of meaning and transformational grammars that has not yet been explored in linguistic or philosophical literature. This semantic theory, or the tools of logic, may eventually play the role in the study of natural languages that classical mathematical analysis has played in physics. (HOD)",

        "description":"Today's inclusion of semantics within the overall language design offers proof against the earlier mistaken view that semantics was irrelevant to the study of language. Sociolinguistics have reassessed language as a social matrix that encompasses the sum of linguistic variation present in a given community. Variability in language is described by sociolinguistic rules which specify the grammatical options a speaker may actually select, given a number of conditions. Common to these formulations is the notion of constraints--factors that may or may not prevent a speaker from making a certain linguistic decision. Sociolinguistics has a far reaching consequence for English instruction in our schools, bringing to our attention the idea of a cultural-linguistic continuum. No longer can  the teacher's goal be that all children should speak alike. New educational goals should be subsumed under one main objective: the acquisition of communicative competence. Teachers must have the ability to assess unemotionally the nature of speech varieties that children bring to school and to recognize the value of code shifting within everyday speech events. (HOD)",

        "description":"In recent years, considerable attention has been focused on freedom of the press, censorship, and students' rights because of litigation involving the issue of ownership where high school and college newspapers are concerned. Those favoring protection of student publications under the First Amendment argue that the model of hierarchical organization applicable to commercial newspapers does not fit student publications. The school (college, university) is not the publisher of the student newspaper, and the university president is not the owner. In order for the school to be granted control of student publications in the same way that owners of commercial publications control newspaper content, the schools would have to finance the paper and be clearly liable for a publication's  torts. The solution to the ownership controversy lies in applying the academic freedom concept to student journalists so that student publications are free to publish what they wish within the bounds of libel and obscenity, and are subject to the review of their peers, their audience, and the more general community.

Groups 1 and 2 consisted of 80 black children from low-income homes. About half of these children had attended an integrated school in a suburban area since their entrance into school. The remaining children had attended an all-black school in their own neighborhood. Groups 3 and 4 consisted of 60 middle-income, mostly white children, who had attended a segregated school in their own neighborhood. Results revealed  that black, low-income children performed significantly better than white, middle-class income children in recalling nonstandard sentences. Black, low-income children who had attended an integrated school were both better on standard and poorer on nonstandard sentences than similar children who had attended a segregated school. (SW)",

These assumptions are based on subjective impressions gained by teachers and students, and on tentative results from small-scale investigations. Methods promoting a more effective manner of studying are not often the product of premeditation on the part of students. Some methods are discovered by mere chance, others through experiments made by individuals in an effort at getting as much done as possible  within the briefest span of time, and others are the result of thorough scientific research. In any case, more efforts need to be directed toward educational research aimed at defining, investigating, and determining those study methods which will prove useful in helping students to learn.

The Research Section, Directorate of Studies, Staff Development Branch, Public Service Commission of Canada carried out three TESL-oriented linguistic studies on the characteristics of written and spoken English that federal government employees used at work. The first study demonstrated to what extent register exercised constraints on the native speakers' selection of lexical verbs structures in speech and in writing. In this study the lexical verb types of administrative correspondence and boardroom discussion were analyzed. The second project involved a syntactic analysis of 10,000 spoken sentences and over  5,000 written sentences. A tagmemic model analyzed the sentence and its parts in terms of both function and form. The third project analyzed over 130,000 words of spoken English to isolate a range of fixed expressions used for such purposes as capturing attention, holding the floor in conversation, providing encouragement and feedback, and so on. It was hoped that the findings would contribute to more comprehensive course design and more effective teaching. (HOD)",

Pedagogical grammars should, among other things, supply information on how and how often the grammatical items and patterns are used, in what typical situations and between whom, and when they are most frequently and appropriately used. An ad hoc but systematic description of relevant registers would supply the kind of analytical, quantitative, and contextual information required by pedagogical grammars. Such a description was provided by several register-oriented  and ESL-oriented research projects carried out in Canada (described in detail with accompanying graphs and charts). The groups used in these projects were the English- and French-speaking government employees who need to have skill in the registers of administrative and boardroom English--both in writing and in speaking.

Response to the magazine has generally been favorable; however, some early objections were raised by those who object to profane language in print. The advertisements did gain readers.

A path analytic approach was used to test a popular model of literature achievement among a subsample of Swedish 14-year-olds. A pooling procedure was used for controlling the influence of sex and the amount of effort expended on school work. Analysis showed that both the cultural resources of the student's home and his verbal ability, as mediated by his level of reading comprehension, account for most of the explained variance in the model. Some conventional beliefs regarding achievement in literature were not  supported by the analysis. Thus, variables such as reading speed, the hours spent reading for pleasure, and literary attitudes had negligible effects and were omitted from the final revised form of the model. The final form was composed of policy variables potentially manipulatable by within-school teaching strategies. (Author/HOD)",

        "description":"This paper examines the supply and demand for early evening news and public affairs programing aired by major market commercial television stations. The sample consists of 493 thirty-minute programs aired by 99 stations between the hours of 5:30 and 8:00 P.M., E.S.T. A frequency analysis of programing indicated that stations owned by three commercial television networks and newspapers devote considerably more time to local news during the early evening hours than do stations controlled by group owners, that is, those firms which own more than one station. All multi-media owners devote significantly more time to local news than do stations controlled by single owners. A regression analysis of audience share accruing to various types of programs indicated that the demand for local  news programs aired by multi-media owners was significantly greater than local news provided by single owner stations. It was also estimated that local news tended to be more profitable than is commonly believed. Average annual revenues generated by sixty-minute early evening newscasts accounted for approximately 75 percent of the total programing expenditures of the average commercial television station in the top 25 markets.

        "description":"Doublespeak can be defined as language which is purposely ambiguous, deceptive, or evasive. If we want to promote integrity between act and word, we must teach by living out of the kind of consistency which we hope for in others. Functioning honestly in departmental and pedagogical as well as other personal dealings can be the most effective thing English teachers can do to counter the flood of doublespeak. By realizing that sender-message-receiver-context are intermeshed in complicated ways in the language act, students can study and avoid semantic abuses. Students can also explore aspects of the medium of language and discover ways in which the public is manipulated through language. The study of rhetorical principles can help students avoid using doublespeak while helping them  recognize others' doublespeak. To ask students to write in certain highly artificial situations is to ask them to produce doublespeak. However, appropriate writing instruction in all the school years can help preserve students' authentic thoughts and emotions. Teachers should also work to develop students' media literacy skills so that students can begin to recognize and deal with public doublespeak. (HOD)",

This experimental study explores psychological pressures on the reporter in a theoretical framework of balance theory and social perception. Specifically, it deals with reporters' attitudes toward their sources, their expectation of a future meeting with the sources, and the type of stories they write. It also seeks to determine whether perceptual screening, resulting from the journalist's attitude toward the source, is a factor in reportorial performance. Objectivity for this study is defined as fairness or balance in decision making, information seeking, and presentation of information. The most important finding of this study is the evidence that attitudes of reporters toward the source seemed to have  little impact on news stories or editorials. The data also provide evidence indicating that selective perception is not a particularly strong restraint on reportorial activity. (TO)",

The paper concludes that the pervading conception of myth in the book seems to be related on many levels, past and present, to an idea of the perfect social order and the preservation of that order.

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to suggest a comparative morphology of groups which would be applicable to the whole of social scientific research. The key to the morphological classes suggested is not a focus on the group system itself but on its relationship with the next higher system--the group system's environment. The information exchange between the group and its environing system provides the group system with its energizing life force, i.e., tensity. The precise nature of that information exchange differentiates among classes of tensity. The morphological classes--extensive, intensive, detensive, distensive, and attensive--are described and illustrated. Preliminary empirical testing through correlations of interaction analyses of five groups suggests that it is possible to  differentiate among tensive classes by differences in interaction patterns. The data suggest further that groups not possessing a specific variety of tensity can be identified through their interaction patterns as belonging to a specific tensive class. Results from preliminary empirical analyses suggest numerous implications for further research in order to integrate and increase the ability to generalize group research. (Author/WR)",

Since smaller, less complex organizations are considered to have a higher degree of integrativeness, the increased size and complexity of an organization diminishes the integration of communication processes and makes them more difficult to measure. This study compares individual integrativeness, cohesiveness, and satisfaction scores of 963 members of a financial organization with a set of structural communication and other variables. Communication network roles as well as integrativeness scores were generated through a network analysis computer program developed at Michigan State University. In addition, a regression analysis provides the  linear and certain curvilinear relationships between integrativeness, cohesiveness, and satisfaction and a set of interrelated, independent variables. For organizations whose communication control and decision making processes are largely disintegrated, the study suggests direct implications with regard to integrating those processes occurring among functionally distant or non-cohesive individuals and groups.

The research literature on group uniformity processes and on theoretical models of these processes from an information processing perspective is reviewed. An important proposition derived from the model is that the greater the communication network integration of a group, the greater the uniformity in the behavior, and the perceptions of the environment, of members of the group. Communication network analysis is performed on data collected in a large, complex organization, and the relationship between network integration of groups and uniformity is examined in the resultant 56  groups. Moderate support for the hypothesis is found, suggesting that further exploratory research of this nature is justified. The implications of the research are discussed with respect to previous uniformity research, the validity of network analysis, organizational \"climate\" surveys, diffusion of innovations, and organizational development and design.

The behaviors were classified into a workable number of categories. The prosocial code is largely verbal and contains seven categories which fall into two major groups, interpersonal and self-control. The level of prosocial content on network drama programs is low. Many of the instances which clearly fit the definitions in the code are very low-keyed and probably have little impact, in contrast to most of the aggressive and neutral programs, which constitute the largest part of commercial television drama. Prosocial behaviors are incidental to the main plot. Only on the relatively rare  prosocial programs are prosocial behaviors a central theme and thus likely to have a significant effect on viewers.

Although the test items were generally original, a few items came from the Dove Counterbalance I.Q. Test. The test was validated through four forms with over 200 students taking the various forms of the test. The test was administered to 20 black and 20 white students at TCU to determine readability and answerability for the questions. Eighty-seven items were chosen for Test Form Two, which was administered to 20 black, 20 Chicano, and 20 white high school-aged and junior college-aged students from local church groups. The questions tend to show fairly consistent difficulty and  discrimination indices from form to form. Incorrect answers to certain questions suggest a lack of knowledge about black and Chicano history and literature. The unwillingness of many students of Mexican-American descent to be classified as \"Chicanos\" posed a problem for the test constructors. (SW)",

This may be seen when examining &quot;Long Day's Journey Into Night.&quot; The play is replete with examples of the four characters' avoiding confrontations among themselves, dealing with content issues rather than with the process issues which have made their lives wretched. In addition, the characteristics attempt, to a great extent, to shut off abruptly verbal communications by the other characters,  thus invalidating the perceptions of the other characters. A recent production of this play in which all characters jointly shared responsibility for the problems forming the drama's matrix seemed a more satisfying experience than that provided by an earlier production depicting the traditional protagonist.

An equal number of Title I and non-Title I children was randomly selected from each school. Questioning was based on areas expected to be familiar to the informant such as childhood games, school activities, and favorite television programs. The research was divided into two parts. Casual conversation was obtained from the children and data from the first part of  the study was analyzed. Games, word lists, and reading passages that were based on the children's actual speech were designed and utilized in the second round of interviews. Results revealed that there were no qualitative differences in the speech of Title I and non-Title I children, and that a few more Title I children used the more highly stigmatized grammatical forms such as multiple negation than did non-Title I children.

The variable of ego-involvement was controlled by equalizing the value of this variable across three groups. \"Sex-biasness\" of an issue was controlled through a series of pilot studies by the selection of an issue which was near equally ego-involving for both sexes. Additional pilot studies disclosed that the message was discrepant to the majority of subjects' beliefs and that both sources were consistently evaluated as highly credible. Pretest subjects included 876 students from introductory  speech courses who completed semantic differential attitude scales to determine their initial attitude and level of ego-involvement. Only 186 of these subjects met the criteria to continue and take the posttest. Results indicated that highly ego-involved receivers were less susceptible to persuasion than lowly ego-involved receivers, regardless of their sex. However, there was no significant differences in the amount of attitude change between highly and lowly ego-involved subjects on latitudes of rejection and noncommitment. (HOD)",

School finance reformers were perplexed by these defeats. This study sets out to explain the gross inconsistency between the desire, as sampled by widely-accepted polls, of citizens to eliminate the property tax and their behavior in the voting booth. The study's research design combines two methodologies: case studies, including interviews and analysis of secondary sources (campaign literature, etc.), and aggregate voting analysis, using both correlation and multiple regression techniques in order to link support of amendments  to census characteristics of localities. The findings indicate two major explanations for the amendments' defeat: the content of the proposals and the constitutional amendment process itself. Socioeconomic status variables were not found to be important explanatory variables. (Author/DN)",

In compliance with the court decision, the county assessors began reassessing properties in January 1966. A great controversy arose over the new assessment procedures and problems. This study evaluates the results of the 1966 reassessments and develops a way by which the assessment procedures might be improved. The study first determines the effect of the 100 percent assessment in one area of Kentucky, giving particular emphasis to how well it improves the degree of equity among property assessments. It then describes the development and testing of a method that improves the 100 percent assessment procedures through the use of a regression model involving  computer data processing. (Author/DN)",

Critics have charged that during this period State agencies were not responsive to the national priorities but rather allocated Section 503 resources to extend and carry out entrenched, traditional functions and activities independent of the mainstream of emerging educational needs. The fiscal year 1973 Federal budget proposals brought the most serious challenge to the SEA support program by recommending that Section 503 funds be eliminated. The purposes of this survey were to identify activities and programs  funded by Section 503 allocations and to determine whether these activities and programs were consistent with the Congressional intent. Major findings of the survey are reported and relevant data, including a copy of the survey instrument, are included in an appendix. (Author/JF)",

        "description":"Parental decisionmaking is the keystone of any voucher model. This paper examines the parental decisionmaking process as it has unfolded in the educational voucher experiment in the Alum Rock school system near San Jose, California. The author assumed at the outset that parents cannot make intelligent choices between schooling alternatives if they lack knowledge about the alternatives or if they are unable to see the differences between the alternatives. The author found that the Alum Rock experience seems to support the voucher model premise that parents want to influence school decisions and that the use of vouchers will increase parental interest in school decisionmaking. The assumption that parents are competent to make schooling decisions received only mixed support from the  results of the Alum Rock demonstration. At the onset of the demonstration, ignorance of voucher opportunities and policies was greatest among the segment of the population that was supposed to benefit the most from having a choice in schooling--the educationally disadvantaged. But, as the voucher demonstration progressed, awareness of vouchers increased although non-English speaking Mexican-Americans continued to be the least aware of voucher opportunities. (Author/JF)",

In synthesizing the knowledge base, the study establishes and emphasizes the great need to link the knowledge banks of the producers' world with the users' stations. Several findings support this conclusion: (1) a wealth of knowledge exists; (2) although there is no lack of information, lack of utilization does exist; (3) gaps exist between research and practice worlds and between private and public sectors; (4) the user must be more active in the selection process; and (5) Educational Management Development Centers (EMDCs) may provide a beginning to a new institutionalized linking role. The study reviews two kinds of linkages: (1) producer/consumer linkages through EMDCs and 2) EMDC linkages  (networks). The EMDCs, in linking for ERIC-like information, will build a capability for linking multiple types of resources--human and technical. Recommendations are made for building effective linkages within EMDCs. Also, the networking concept is presented to provide a mechanism for keeping centers abreast of developments from other agencies working to improve educational management. (Author/WM)",

Has the task of raising low expenditure school districts to a standard such as the U.S. median expenditure level become easier or more difficult over the past 10, 20,  30, or 40 years?

        "description":"The Pennsylvania Legislature funded a two-year program to enable interested local schools to conduct exploratory programs on all-year scheduling. Funds were allocated by contract on the basis of the local school's need and readiness to conduct some type of all-year school program or to study the feasibility of such a program. Findings indicate that year-round operation can produce major economic savings if there is a need to construct a new school or an addition to a school. The potential savings in the year-to-year operational budget is less clear. A remedial program that helps prevent students from failing a grade can produce an economic as well as a social savings. An accelerated program can cost more in the short run, but, because a student spends fewer years in school, may  not cost more in the long run. An enrichment program will probably cost more than a regular program because of the extra services provided. Year-round programs tend to offer a greater variety of courses and to serve as a vehicle for the implementation of mini-courses and individualized instruction. A flexible year-round program can provide equal opportunity for a quality education in terms of a more humane learning environment, a more relevant curriculum, a more appropriate instructional process, a more flexible use of time and learning facilities, and a more rational pupil evaluation system.

        "description":"The Oregon school graduation requirements, the trends and events that led to their development, and the implementation program that followed their adoption are the subjects of this report. The requirements, adopted in September 1972, call for districts to establish minimum &quot;survival level&quot; competencies that each student must meet in addition to completing modified requirements in designated course and attendance areas. A number of educational trends contributed to the development of the requirements; many of these emerged in meeting and studies that preceded adoption of the requirements. The major implementation actions of the State Department of Education and of several of the State's school districts are reviewed. Arguments for and against accountability in education and  competency-based educational programs are also discussed, accompanied by suggested options for future research into the effectiveness of the State's competency-based education. The implementation program of the Albany Union High School District and its relation to actions by the Department of Education are reviewed in an appendix to the main report. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"In this booklet, the Council of Supervisors and Administrators of the City of New York seeks to offer hope that teachers' and principals' capacity for the reasonable exercise of authority has not been exhausted. There is a body of legal opinion that supports the authority of the principal in disciplinary matters. It is a misconception that a student is deprived of this rights if, as an outcome of an administrative hearing, he is suspended from school or denied further public education. The courts are far from committed to the doctrine that each and every disciplinary decision is subject to trial; the courts do not always see the principal as an adversary in his relationship with students. In the sections on due process, suspensions, free speech, free press, respect for the flag,  personal appearance, and searches and seizures, the author suggests that fairness, common sense, and experience remain the staples in school discipline. The courts have not enjoined principals from acting on the belief that parents send children to school to learn and that no learning can be carried on where some students are permitted to prevent others from learning.

But what emerges from the information is clear: there are many different kinds of alternatives. In providing a brief description of each school or program, the editors have attempted to use the words of the educators in the school. The schools and programs themselves break down into certain clear categories. There are the small independent &quot;family&quot; schools such as Albany, New York's The Free School, and there are the schools-within-a-public-school such as Princeton, New Jersey's Learning Community. There are programs within schools, public and private, that are an option for a particular grade or age level; while  guidance or career-oriented options like Horsham, Pennsylvania's are also frequent. Then, too, there are the experimental elementary schools--large ones like Philadelphia's Pennsylvania Advancement School and small ones like the Bucks County Montessori Association's Children's Academy in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. These elementary schools seem to be dedicated to early childhood education as it has been developed by continental educators or, more recently, as it has been demonstrated by the &quot;open plan&quot; schools in Leicestershire, England.

Among student concerns are student councils, honor committees, students in advisory capacities, faculty-student senates, all-school meetings, and constitutions. Faculty concerns cover faculty associations, salary scales, faculty representation on boards, faculty meetings, and faculty roles in governance. Effective systems that involve students in governance, the author asserts, are invariably honest, simple in structure, small, challenging, unique to themselves, constantly changing, and based on a belief that some of our students are morally capable of making important decisions.

It was further agreed that the major obstacle to setting up measures of accountability has been a lack of knowledge: school personnel have not known what to do or what to identify in demonstrating and describing the effectiveness of the educational enterprise. Before school personnel can be held completely accountable, there must be a sharper focus on the goals and objectives of teaching and learning. (Author/WM)",

The conferees made the following recommendations. All school administrators should set up an appropriate recordkeeping system in order to pinpoint patterns of school crime in an effort to anticipate problems. Oversized schools that foster an impersonal atmosphere must be reorganized to create smaller units that give rise to a feeling of community among the students. Increased involvement of students and citizens in all aspects of school life is imperative if the schools are to comprise a safe and humane environment for all. School systems must offer appropriate program alternatives and  options that will provide substance and meaning to the broad range of student abilities to be served. If the rate of crime reaches a point at which it is necessary to employ security personnel, the school system should employ a professional staff with a law enforcement background rather than use guards and uniformed police in the halls. Substantial resources should be allocated for the development of curricula that emphasize the teaching of moral and ethical values. Photographs may reproduce poorly. (Author/MLF)",

Data were compiled on the number of bond sales, the average net interest cost, the issuing agency, and the term of maturity. The report also provides summary information regarding bond elections held, the number approved or defeated, and the par value of the issues voted on. The U. S. Office of Education issues this report annually for the benefit of school administrators, school board members, and others who require up-to-date knowledge of school construction financing. The publication indicates that in fiscal year 1973, 1,273 school bond elections were reported proposing the issuance of a total of $4.0 billion in  public school bonds. Bond issues were approved in 719 of these elections for a total of $2.3 billion. The number of issues approved represented an increase of 32.7 percent over fiscal year 1972. The percent of elections approved in fiscal year 1973, 56.5 percent, is a sizable increase from the 47.0 percent approved in fiscal year 1972. Numerous charts and tables are included. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"This study investigated two different responses to the need to develop effective means to mobilize and improve the delivery of educational resources. The top-down approach is an effort to replace the centralized State department of education with a decentralized network of Regional Centers (RCs). The bottom-up approach is a grass roots movement by some school districts to join in Voluntary Collaboratives (VCs) to share resources and work cooperatively toward common goals. Both approaches have their strengths. A network of RCs would improve interschool communication and disperse educational innovations on regional and Statewide levels and could facilitate distribution of State and federal resources. VCs would facilitate the sharing of change strategies among cooperating districts  and would be highly responsive and adaptive to the needs of individual school districts. The study concludes that both approaches are valuable and that Massachusetts should support and attempt to coordinate the concurrent development of both RCs and VCs. (JG)",

This report describes the planning required and evaluates the potential savings of such a system. The objective of the study was to develop a model for sharing the transportation of the special education children of the nine contiguous TEC towns. Some of the general subobjectives are: to demonstrate a savings in the operation of the transportation system, to improve service quality and consistency, and to centralize transportation administration to foster continued efficiency and  control. Ancilliary objectives are to suggest legislation, to facilitate cooperative action among school districts, and to encourage other towns to join in undertaking cooperative enterprises. The report describes the development of a centralized office to coordinate transportation activities and to handle the data needs of those activities, presents costs analyses of the current transportation operation and of the projected regional transportation system, and presents some cost comparisons and recommendations for further action.

        "description":"The Working Party on Aims and Objectives reports on its reappraisal of elementary and secondary education in New Zealand. Attention is focused on four major concepts: 1) the school as a professional unit, 2) lifelong education as a continuing process beyond the formal school system, 3) continuity throughout the educational system, and 4) school community cooperation and mutual support. Within this framework, priority is placed on the continuing education of teachers, human and material resources reorganization and development, the strengthening of school-based curricula and the eliminating of national exams, and the fostering of change and innovation through research and evaluation. Specific areas of emphasis include the training of adult educators and the development of  community schools, parent education and the rationalization of levels of training, the strengthening of the school as a professional unit, continuing for all teachers, courses for training officers and strengthening of vocational guidance, the establishment of a unified teaching profession, the development of school-based curricula, moral education as a planned part of the curriculum, and the strengthening of school-based assessment. The complete set of recommendations is a part of the narrative of this report. (Author/DW)",

It is pointed out that throughout the course of historical development, the basic system functions and objectives have remained unchanged even though the system equipments have varied. With equipment changes, man's physical functions in system operation have also changed. In predicting the effectiveness of man in a future system operational environment, an approach independent of equipment differences is required. Such an approach in which man is conceived as an information processor is described. The approach is applied to the human operator roles in manned aerial reconnaissance and surveillance and in targer  acquisition. (Author)",

Turner suggested that, through selection for one of several forms of secondary education, individuals are sorted into different strata that largely determine their level of attainment in later life. Analysis of the data showed that school selection did have an important effect on later attainment, although the effect became less significant as the subjects grew older. Ability was the second most important determinant of attainment and was the most important factor in secondary school selection. Social background also had a definite effect on school selection. Opportunities for further education after secondary school and the awarding  of formal qualifications according to universal standards were seen as factors that tempered the effect of sponsorship in later life.

The purpose of this study is to examine current utilization in order to develop criteria and guidelines for the definition of the scope of practice of physician assistants and to delineate training standards for assistants. Both physician assistants and their supervising physicians were surveyed. The instruments were designed to provide data on three issues: the market for physician assistants, the  impact of assistants on health care delivery, and the satisfaction of physician assistants and their supervising physicians with training and the assistant role. The survey provides an analytical data base for relating the state situation regarding assistants to that of the nation as a whole. It is hoped that this study will raise the visibility of physician assistant training and credentialing issues in the medical community to stimulate their input into the policy development process.

(2) In the community colleges, the per student expenditures for faculty in the vocational area was 1.2 times greater than for academic courses. (3) The total average per student expenditures for the universities and state colleges increased $87 and $86, respectively, over 1969-70. Community college expenditures reflected a 6.7 percent decrease ($46). (4) Significant differences in instructional costs between major discipline groupings  were determined. In the 4-year institutions, the discipline groups with the highest average unit costs were the health sciences, agriculture and natural resources disciplines, professional programs, and fine arts. The groups with the lowest unit costs were the social sciences, business, and humanities. (5) The amount of average state support per full-time student in 1970-71 ranged from $754 for a lower division transfer student at a community college to $3,310 for a university graduate student. (6) In terms of student fees available for general institutional use and exclusive of the health sciences, resident students bore from 5 to 16 percent of their average instructionally related cost at the various instructional levels in 1970-71.

The CEEB, the Council on Library Resources, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the U.S. Office of Education are jointly funding the Office of Library Independent Study Projects (OLISP) of the CEEB. A pilot program of service to independent learners was implemented in a few libraries. Then 800 libraries and 1037 librarians were surveyed to find participants for the full  scale program. With the help of seminars, workshops, and guidance from OLISP, the participating libraries have developed their adult independent learning programs, and will implement them after some further planning and testing.

Flexible interactive opportunities (via broadcast, newsletter, phone, mail, personal contact) were utilized; resources not available were provided, while at the same time local options were preserved and encouraged. Use of the phone was limited during the pilot to protect against jamming the system and against incurring project costs beyond means. A questionnaire surveyed student and faculty opinion on the subject of involvement and interaction. The student TV module was found to be the most important interactive component. Ninety-four percent of the teachers responding to a followup questionnaire said the series was more useful than an ordinary educational  television series. (WCM)",

Two major decision areas, specifying performance expectations and selecting appropriate educational experiences, were identified, and five major processes involved in WIS-SIM were specified: testing, achievement profiling, diagnosing, prescribing, and instructing. The WIS-SIM model was applied to two of the Wisconsin R &amp; D Center's instructional programs--the Wisconsin Design for Reading Skill Development and Developing Mathematical Processes. A summary of the implementation schedule, identifying three successive annual applications of WIS-SIM is also presented. (Author/WH)",

The problem is due primarily, but not exclusively, to the failure of academic institutions to consider the needs of industry in ordering their priorities and goals. Other causes are the specific failure of industry to make its needs known to academic institutions and the general lack of communication between these communities. Several progressional societies are trying to bridge the gap with programs for the certification of professionals. Re-ordering of priorities within undergraduate programs and an application-oriented  undergraduate program are presented as a means of solving part of the problem. Specific suggestions of other steps that may be taken in the industrial and academic communities to strengthen the profession at large are also discussed. (WCM)",

The study produced a thumbnail sketch of the center; a description of the principal linkages between the center and local education agencies' resource persons and groups, and practitioner persons and groups; a description of the center's philosophies and strategies; a description of the center's major programs; an identification and verification of the important impacts of the center; and an identification of the weaknesses in the center's role as a linkage agency. To acquire information,  extensive on-site interviews were conducted with local education agency members, and data were also obtained from the school system clients of the center. The result of the case study documents in detail the innovations in the center's local education agencies as a result of knowledge utilization and fully describes the processes of resource utilization, communication, and innovation in a systematic manner.

The common feedback loop was analyzed, and information theory was applied to the problems of noise. To provide effective communication, the educational linking institution needs to meet three requirements. These requirements include: 1) the ability to access needs, 2) a knowledge of resources. Four models of communications linkage agents (Shannon, Ackoff, Havelock, and the Educational Information Consultant) describe the complexity of the task. As a result, the linking organization should be given adequate opportunity to prove itself before it becomes identified with extensive role descriptions. With adequate training, this role can be performed by  many--from graduate students to mothers with teaching experience. In short, the prime and permanent linkage at the local level is an organization which is both local in control and flexible. Through projects, this organization (operating within systems analysis) effects innovation at appropriate levels of a local educational structure. (WCM)",

The main criteria were: developmental and operational costs; degree of individualization; the use of behavioral objectives, criterion tests, and computer management; coverage of elementary grades; comprehensiveness of subject areas covered; and the need for differential staffing. Only the PLAN Project (Westinghouse Learning Corporation) met all the specifications, including the requirement for computer support, and was chosen as the best program available and preferable to inhouse development. Activities provided schools the opportunity to self-select into the  PLAN Project. With the implementation of the program, the various segments were continually reassessed and reevaluated; the overall objective was 80 percent of the students meeting 80 percent of the objectives. Dissemination activities of the program are outlined in this interim report which precedes a final evaluation report published later. (WH)",

The first phase entailed the development of a two-hour CAI program on the identification of edible plants. The second phase was experimentation to determine the effectiveness of learner control. Each of 162 undergraduate student subjects was placed in one of four groups: a control group who always used mnemonic devices, a control group who never used them, and two experimental groups who were given learner control over access to mnemonics, but differed in the extent of instruction on the use of that control. Responses to a state anxiety measure, learner control requests for mnemonics, and errors committed on segment and final  tests were the dependent variables. Measures of individual differences were taken in the areas of task specific memory, locus of control, and achievement via independence. Providing mnemonic devices didn't have a facilitating effect, and thus, learner control, which depended on the devices, was not successful in reducing anxiety as predicted. (Author/WH)",

This, the third phase of a project, substituted pictorial mediators for mnemonic devices as the facilitating variable in an instruction program on edible plants. Four experimental groups were formed with the facilitating variable crossed with information on the utilization of learner control. Responses to a state anxiety measure, learner control requests for pictures, and errors committed on segment and final tests were the dependent variables. Measures of individual differences were taken in the areas of task specific memory, locus of control, and achievement via independence. The affect of pictorial mediation was statistically  effective, yet learner control, which depended on the facilitating variable, was not statistically different. The achievement via independence measure was able to predict individual differences in learner control behavior.

A portion of the LPP was converted to an automated method of instruction, accomplished mostly through the use of tape-recorded lectures and supported by visual aid frames. A comparison study was then made with the conventional lecture-conference presentation. Three successive leadership preparation classes were matched on General Technical Aptitude Area scores and then randomly assigned to either an automated or conventional training section. The conclusions drawn were that: 1) use of the automated method of presenting leadership preparation training as part of the leader preparation course was effective and practical, with minimal support costs, and reduced instructor requirements;  and 2) the package content may be used in a number of ways, depending on the user's need.

        "description":"Computer networking technology is adequately developed now to support research and experimentation to expand computing resource sharing. Whether progress will be made depends upon organizational initiative among multiple institutions to pool personnel and capital so as to effectively address the major issues in management approach, support, and software design that limit the feasible interdependence of computing operation. The organizational requirements are partially revealed by examining progressive stages of resource sharing in organizational and operational terms rather than such technical aspects as load sharing or program sharing that have been introduced in the past. Five stages are identified, ranging from simply establishing multiple service access to the advanced stage  where multiple institutions organize for joint development of new resources. A preliminary evaluation framework for new management arrangements results when these stages are mapped against the four functional levels inherent in computer network management. Future needs for networking experimentation and research are briefly described, and other National Bureau of Standards technical results are identified in context. (Author)",

The instructional system must accomplish this by generating and scheduling a suitable instructional sequence for each student. The developmental steps, from job task structure analyses to computer programs, are described. Higher-level programing languages and general purpose programs are two categories of techniques for generalizing these procedures.

Experimental versions of the course were administered to over 900 subjects in various experimental groups. Criterion and retention tests based on actual job problems were used to measure subject's performance, along with in-training measures. Results in a series of prompting/confirmation variations indicated that giving subjects extensive stimulus  support during training helps motivate them and improves scores during training, but hampers them in using what they have learned. Requiring subjects to fully write out rules during training hindered them in developing problem-solving skills applying these rules; however, using mnemonics during training aided subjects in retaining what they had learned.

All students were given a pretest and a posttest measuring attitude toward CAI, attitude toward mathematics, and achievement in the mathematical content of the CAI units. The following conclusions were drawn: 1) the experimental group's attitude toward CAI improved significantly fron pretest to posttest, but the control group's attitude toward CAI did not change significantly; 2) attitudes toward  mathematics improved in both groups but this change reached significance level only in the control group. However, an analysis of covariance controlling on pre-test math attitude scores revealed no significant differences between the two groups in posttest scores measuring attitude toward mathematics. Finally, 3) both groups showed significant achievement gains in mathematics, and there was no significant difference between the achievement of the two groups. (Author/WCM)",

In addition to traditional library services, instructional design, materials production, computer operation, printing services, bookstores, learning labs, and information networks are possible future library responsibilities. New guidelines for library staff and facilities are emerging, in keeping with new trends of library service. Future trends may include: wider availability of computer output microfilm; wider community use through lifetime learning and college-without-walls programs; increased telecommunications and television use; more  involvement in communication networks; and metamorphosis of the library into a campus-wide educational resources system.

Tables and statistics have been provided for: number, type, status, and academic department of users; frequency of use; satisfaction and success in finding desired information; journal use; hours of library use; and use of materials. Major findings were basically that library effectiveness had not changed since the previous study, usage had dropped slightly, and the satisfaction level had risen. The study also raised the possibility that the libraries should invest more in lending stock and less in reference and other non-circulating materials, since lack of  seating space has limited the use of in-house materials.

The Council charges that CBS has failed to meet its public interest obligations, as well as its obligations under the fairness doctrine, with respect to advertising aimed at children. The Council says that it first raised its concerns with the network, attempting to meet the FCC's requirement of good faith attempts to resolve disputes between citizens and broadcasters outside its legal processes. The Council maintains that CBS chose to deny its responsibilities to children rather than accept the mandate of the Communications Act. As a result, the Council has been forced to come to the FCC to seek  enforcement of this obligation. The Council urges the FCC to reaffirm broadcasters' obligations to children by requiring CBS to present information to children that would educate them about television advertising. The Council also urges the FCC to investigate CBS's failure to inform adult viewers of the children's advertising issue to determine whether it has violated the first, as well as the second leg of its fairness doctrine obligations.

Standardization is accomplished by presenting selected bibliographic data in a prescribed order and identifying the data through the arbitrary use of symbols which happen to be punctuation marks. Although the standard bibliographic description is of vital importance for the conversion of data to machine-readable form, it also facilitates the comprehension of entries in unfamiliar  languages and permits descriptions of various origins to be integrated readily into a single system. Virtually all of the provisions of the standard have been incorporated into the revised rules for description in the North American Text of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, so that national cataloging agencies in the Western hemisphere may participate in the international effort to achieve universal bibliographic control.

The findings reported here provide feedback to the series' users and producers. As in the first year study, the data up-date information on the technical capabilities of schools to use television, on applications of educational television, and on the attitudes of students, teachers, school administrators, and the educationally involved public toward television as an instructional medium. The data are based largely on information provided by sample surveys of elementary school principals and teachers who were questioned nationwide during the 1972-73 school year. Three mailed surveys were involved. The results of the surveys showed that in-school utilization expanded considerably  in most areas of the nation, with the series being used by an increasingly diversified range of schools. Some but not all of this expansion was due to improvements in the technical capabilities of schools. At the same time, pupil viewing patterns shifted somewhat to give even greater exposure to slow reading target pupils, and to provide more selective use of the series for a limited number of grade levels in an adopter school. Rural and private schools have gradually achieved utilization levels equal to urban schools. (WCM)",

This study addressed the area of minor incompatibility that can cause transportability of customized Coursewriter software at individual sites to become difficult. Nonetheless, customizing software is basically good in that it allows additional capability and greater flexibility. The disadvantages, and impact on transportability, occur when separate installations make modifications that are mutually exclusive and conflicting. A solution lies, in the forum ADCIS provides, for concerned installations to work together to coordinate customizing. This allows desired modification while minimizing the  impact on courseware transportability. The author suggests that installations form a subgroup under the Coursewriter Systems Implementation Group. In general, the subgroup could examine and exchange information on modifications of this nature with an effort toward achieving some standardization or set of guidelines to minimize the possible danger.

Six essential items were identified: authoritative treatment, comparisons with other books, a scope statement, a description of the author's background, a basis of work statement, and a purpose statement. The study was limited to the November 1971 through August 1972 issues of School Library Journal, Library Journal, and Publisher's Weekly.

The degree of involvement involved five choices, from no student involvement to completely under student direction. The students favored no student involvement in selection of college president, faculty hiring, faculty promotion, teaching loads, class size, teacher salaries, and requirements for degrees and certificates. In five areas, the students favored some student involvement: setting institutional goals, establishing attendance policies, allocation of annual college budget, allocation of student  financial aid, and determining the administrative structure of the college. The 17 areas in which equal student involvement was favored were: selection of college officials directly related to student affairs, allocation of student activity fees, regulation of student conduct, recognition of student organizations, approval of guest speakers invited by students, alterations in college calendar, distribution of student-initialed literature on campus, release of student records, admissions standards for curricula, curricula or course changes, student probation and suspension policies, development of physical facilities, planning commencement exercises, college publications, grading policies, and faculty evaluation. Students wanted to largely control student publications. (DB)",

In addition, information about the Alexander City State Junior College program offered at three Alabama correctional facilities was obtained. The results of the study show that Okaloosa-Walton Junior college had made available all programs, degrees and vocational, to the Eglin Federal Prison Camp. The community college program at the Federal Correctional Institution is operated by the Tallahassee Community College. The program offers the inmates an AA degree when they have 60  college credit hours, including basic education requirements. In Alabama, Alexander City State Junior College offers both a day and night college program at Draper Men's Prison, Tutwiler Women's Prison, and Frank Lee Youth Center. It is recommended that community colleges and prison educational staff seek ways to establish educational programs for the prison population.

Information sources were student followup data from the community colleges and enrollment data of all higher education institutions. The followup data showed that the trend from 1970 through 1973 had been a rather consistent distribution of transfers among the various segments. In 1973, the percentages of transfers to the segments were: out-of-state, 12; state-owned, 25; state related, 37; state-aided, 6; private, 20. The most significant change was a doubling of the number of students transferring to the state-aided segment over the 4-year span. Of the 3,112 students transferring to state-owned or state-related schools, 1,242 transferred to state-owned institutions,  and 1,870 transferred to state-related universities. State-related universities not only absorbed the largest number of community college transfers but also accepted a larger percentage as juniors. The study data are provided in 43 tables. (DB)",

The median age of the students was 19.1 years, with 97 percent being 17-21. Of the 127 students in the program, 73 percent remained until paroled and 34 percent dropped out. Those who remained in the program completed an average of 2.7 quarters during their average stay of 8.8 months.  They accumulated an average of 39 units of college credits, and their median grade-point average was 3.3, with 46 percent attaining 3.0 or higher. Personality tests, administered on a pre-post basis, showed that gains greater than would be expected by chance were made on Self-Acceptance, Self-Esteem, and Personal Competence Scales. The students' reactions to the program, as elicited by questionnaire, were largely in the &quot;very favorable&quot; category. Follow-up data revealed that 60 percent of the students continued college during their first six-months after parole; nearly two-thirds attended college four months or longer. About 90 percent were involved with jobs and/or school during this period. The findings suggest that the program had a rehabilitative influence and was conducive to  academic achievement. (DB)",

        "description":"To assess the effectiveness of television courses offered by the Coast Community College District and to determine the characteristics of the television students, data from 1,126 students during three semesters were obtained. Sources by which the data were collected were a post-course evaluation questionnaire, weekly course diaries that rated 10 aspects of each lesson viewed, interviews, and demographic questionnaires. The results are presented in 56 tables. These results show that: the students were, in the main, Caucasian; more women than men took the courses; 60 percent were between 26 and 45 years of age; three in four were married; a high proportion had legal dependants; 10 percent had no prior college experience, but one in five had more than 60 units of college credit; and  the strongest reason for taking a TV course was to earn credit toward a degree. The reactions of the students to the courses indicated that the majority of students felt that the material was presented to rapidly; most wanted more review sessions and seminars and at more varied times; some desired additional quizzes and how-to-study instruction; all felt that the opportunity to contact their facilitators was important; and all were enthusiastic, to a varying degree, about television as a way of learning.

Chapter 1 compares comments of various government-sponsored reports. The second chapter reviews ideas and evidence about both curiosity and questions and the link between them. Chapter 3 analyzes the linking between perceived value, relevance, and surprisingness, via interest, to the amount of questioning. Chapter 4 looks at a number of problems outside the constraints of traditional classroom experimentation. While the fifth chapter yields a clear picture of social class differences in reported boredom, chapter 6 does not yield a similar result for questions, and recasons for this are  discussed. Chapter 7 reports the findings of social class differences in the efficiency with which individual questions are posed by 7- to 10-year-old children. These findings are analyzed in relation to the discovery that this same social class difference was not obtained with middle and working class adolescents. Chapter 8 looks at factors associated with the selection of persons to whom questions can be posed. Chapter 9 poses two basic problems: Does the posing of questions in fact facilitate learning? Will the teacher's questions encourage learning as much as the pupil's own questions? Chapter 10 provides an overview and discussion. (CS)",

Discussion indicated that the American students encountered problems in their 11-week stay that  hindered the achievement of their goals. Culture shock and the role of the directing teacher were two forces over which they had little control; other teaching difficulties involved their organizational skills, ability to define problems decision-making capabilities, ability to ask leading questions and to define standards for the children.

Selection criteria were birthdate cutoff, physical maturity, emotional and social maturity, academic skills, appropriate pupil behaviors, preschool experiences, and mental age. Six issues which need further consideration are also discussed: previous studies in early admission, necessary research design, age as a  criterion, children for whom early admission should be considered, the effect of the school program on early admissions, and issues concerning readiness.

Thirty-five white, middle-class 3-year-old children and their teachers participated in the study. The children were enrolled in two separate day care centers which served as control and experimental environments. The value of the staff training is described in terms of its effect on the children's levels of intellectual and visual perceptual functioning as measured in pre- and posttests by the Slossen Intelligence Test and Frostig Developmental Test of Visual Perception. Prior to the initiation of the educational program in the experimental center, the staff was trained through workshop sessions on child development theory. All parents were contacted  in regard to the research; letters addressed to the parents of children in the experimental group also requested that they initiate activities related to those introduced in school. Results revealed that the children in the experimental group made (1) a measurable, but not significant, increase in intellectual functioning; and (2) a significant increase in perceptual functioning. Directions for further research are indicated and there is a brief review of day care literature and programs. (SDH)",

Early child care in the nuclear family provides a secure wholistic relationship between mother and child, but it also sets that relationship in the context of roles which alienate family members from each other. There may be an inevitable relationship between real long term solutions to the growing child care crisis and a restructuring of the now accepted sexual division of labor. Described are some of the issues and problems involved in the creation of the State Street Center parent cooperative in New Haven, Connecticut.

A total of 43 randomly selected, first grade, Mexican-American children were chosen as subjects and divided equally into a control and an experimental group. In each group the children were further subdivided into two groups in which either pre- and posttreatment measurement was conducted or only posttreatment measurement. In the pretreatment group baseline data was taken on each subject's question-asking ability. Instruction and modeling in question-asking techniques were then given and followed by another assessment of the subject's ability. In the next phase the mothers of the experimental subjects were trained in five sessions to use skills such as  reinforcement, cues, and modeling that would increase their children's question-asking behavior as well as shift their question-asking from the predominant nominal-physical questions to causal questions. The results indicated that: (1) trained parents had a significant effect on the target behavior of asking causal questions; and (2) the experimenter's modeling procedures in the pretreatment condition also had a significant effect on question-asking behavior. Concluding discussion focuses on the importance of home instruction and support for school children and possible potential use of parent skills. (SDH)",

        "description":"This paper is an empirical statistical analysis and interpretation of data relating to school readiness previously examined and reported on a theoretical basis. A total of 118 white, middle class children from six consecutive kindergarten groups in Dearborn, Michigan were tested with seven instruments, evaluated in terms of achievement, ability, and overall maturity by their teachers, and physically examined and x-rayed. In comparing these diversified bodies of information, which also included sex and chronological age, 69 independent variables related to school readiness were counted which represented the range of phenomena to be factor analyzed. Performance of the analysis permitted the synthesis of new entities, or factors, which were far fewer in number than the initial raw  variables. Analysis findings revealed seven facets of readiness which together are basic determinants of overall school readiness. They include cognitive readiness, chronological age, reading readiness, body of knowledge, perceptual differentiation, physical development status, and biochemical maturity factor. In the interpretation of each factor, the most highly loaded variables are listed and examined. Discussion focuses on the changed readiness concept, sex differences, chronological age, the importance of knowledge, and the accomplishments, limitations, and implications of this factor analysis.

At present too much emphasis is placed on structured learning activities and it's suggested that more \"open spaces\" be allowed for in a child's day. In spontaneous play, adequate space and time must be allotted for investigation and unhurried experience. Good play equipment can be used in many ways and may be manipulated by the children. Both spontaneous and structured play should be planned for in a balance that is unique to the needs of the children in each classroom. Structured play activities directed by the teacher should be carefully planned and presented to meet individual and small group needs. General discussion presents supporting informationfrom work done by Piaget, Erik Erikson, and  Lili Peller. Four stages in play development defined by Smilansky are reported: (1) Functional play; (2) Constructive play; (3) Symbolic play; and (4) Games with rules. Examination of these stages may help the preschool teacher determine which stage the child has reached and how she can help meet his needs for play experiences. (SDH)",

Volunteer teachers from school districts in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, and Milan and their students in grades K-2 participated in the project. The main concept providing structure for the program is that teacher skills are a major factor in the development of initial cognitive skills in children. Project objectives and goals are stated; measurements of both teacher variables and student response are reported. The criteria for success was met by teachers in these areas: (1) the number of teachers recruited and remaining throughout the program; (2) ability to prepare a lesson sequence including at least four  cognitive skills; (3) maintenance of a 5:1 ratio of &quot;teacher asking to teacher telling&quot;; (4) maintenance of a 5:1 ratio of open-ended to closed questions; (5) significant increases in cognitive skills of students; and (6) greater fluency in identifying specific skills of the BASICS model; and (7) self-evaluation indicating increased proficiency in seven phases of classroom instruction. The expected frequency of teacher-asked support questions and a 2:1 ratio of student talk to teacher talk did not occur. (SDH)",

A program of observation was devised to answer three questions: (1) Do patterns of behavior change as children continue to attend school? (2) Are there different patterns of behavior during the initial period of adjustment? If so, how are they related to subsequent patterns? and (3) Do individual children show a stability of behavior patterns over a period of time? Subjects were 16 boys and 8 girls attending the Chetan Balwadi Nursery School; trained observers recorded behaviors of each child for three sessions and classified them in four major areas: response to parents in the initial parting situation and subsequent self-reliance,  interaction with teachers, interaction with children, and behavior indicating acceptance of school. Results indicated that: (1) behavior patterns did change as children remained in school; (2) at least 2-3 different patterns of behavior were observed at each session, but only trends, not interrelationships, could be discerned; and (3) no conclusions could be formed about the stability of individual behavior patterns. Specific data for each observation session is reported and discussed, and the recorded observations for three individual subjects are presented. (SDH)",

Preliminary analyses focused on the selection of the growth curve, its evaluation in the 208 individual cases, and the subsequent decision that it did not present an accurate description of the data. To compensate, an approach was initiated which compared each subject to a common standard and classified the subject into one of three categories: fast, normal, and slow growth. Results indicated that subjects were equally divided among categories in mental growth and that one-half of the subjects were in the normal category in motor growth with the remainder  equally divided between the other two. In measuring the growth velocity of mental and motor development a curve closely approximating the velocity pattern was fitted. Curve examination showed a prominent peak for both areas in the first six months followed by a gradual decrease in velocity that was less severe than that found in the observed data. Concluding discussion focused on the limitations of the growth curve and implications of the testing conditions. (SDH)",

Many of the projects mentioned in the skill sections were designed by the teacher, but one chapter detailing activities  especially initiated by the children is included. Independence to pursue individual interests is encouraged in the classroom, and special emphasis is placed on teacher-student verbal exchanges and teacher observation of students to ensure that the children's academic and social qualities and needs are recognized and given attention.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to begin to seek new ways of measuring some of the previously uninvestigated areas in which Project Follow Through might be having an impact. In particular, the rates of promotion in school, assignment to special education classes, and assignment to low ability groups were investigated. The following three hypotheses guided the research: 1) there is a lower rate of nonpromotion for Follow Through children than for non-Follow Through children; 2) non-Follow Through children are more likely to be assigned to special classes or schools than Follow Through children; and 3) after the third grade, Follow Through children will be assigned to higher ability tracks more frequently than their non-Follow Through counterparts. The second and third hypotheses  proved to be unfeasible so the report focuses on the nonpromotion study which was carried out. This report is divided into four main sections. Section 1 provides an introduction, Section 2 describes the non-Promotion Study, Section 3 presents the feasibility study for investigating the impact of Follow Through on assignment to special education classes, and Section 4 reports on the feasibility study for assessing the impact of Follow Through on ability group placement. This section includes a discussion of the problems of locating an appropriate sample and identifying ability groups. The appendix includes a breakdown by ethnicity of promoted and nonpromoted children in Project Follow Through and in non-Follow Through in 22 sites, from 1969 to 1971. (CS)",

From this sample 72 nonconservers were assigned to one of three conservation training conditions: reversibility training, discrimination training, or no training. Impulsive-reflective and leveling-sharpening children were represented in approximately equal numbers in each of the training conditions. Two posttests of number conservation and transfer conservation were administered, one immediately and another two weeks later. Results indicate that: (1) prior to training, natural conservers made fewer errors on the impulsivity-reflectivity measure than nonconservers; (2)  impulsive children were more susceptible to reversibility training, and reflective children profited more from discrimination training; and (3) in the transfer tasks, reflective children improved their conservation status from immediate to delayed posttests while impulsive children did not. In contrast to the impulsivity-reflectivity dimension, the leveling-sharpening dimension did not seem related to conservation in any consistent manner. (Author/SH)",

        "description":"A total of 100 3- and 5-year-old children were trained and assessed individually on the concept of equilateral triangle at three levels of attainment: concrete, identity, and classificatory. Five training conditions existed: (1) visual inspection; (2) visual inspection and verbal orienting instruction; (3) visual inspection, free haptic activity, and tactile-kinesthetic training; (4) visual inspection, free haptic activity, tactile-kinesthetic training, and verbal orienting instruction; and (5) unrelated play activity (control). Subjects were trained with 36 geometric blocks varying in shape, color, size, and thickness. After training, each subject's knowledge of the concept was tested at the three levels. Two sets of tasks were administered for testing: transfer of training  using the training material as test stimuli and transfer of training using two-dimensional representations of geometric forms. The results indicated that: (1) there were transfer effects for both sets of tasks; (2) training conditions 2, 3, and 4 were more facilitating than 1 and 5; (3) condition 4 was most effective; (4) 5-year-old subjects performed better than 3-year-olds at each level; and (5) in some tasks, 3-year-old subjects did better when aided by manual activity and 5-year-old subjects performed better with verbal orienting instruction. Concluding discussion focuses on some theoretical and educational implications of the results. (Author/SDH)",

        "description":"This monograph, a Planned Variation study, examines the impact of Project Follow Through (FT) on three sets of analyses, each of which approaches parent data exclusively, and assumes the relationship of parental attitudes and behaviors to pupil cognitive and affective growth. The first set of analyses summarizes the initial demographic characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors of the Cohort III kindergarten parents. The second set of analyses assumes the Project Follow Through should change the behaviors and attitudes of parents and examines indicators of parental behavior and attitude measured during the spring of a child's third year to determine if differences between FT and NFT parents exist both overall and within sponsor. The third set of analyses begins to examine the  relationships which exist among the parent variables. First, the criterion variables examined in the first two sets of analyses are further explored by examining them in relatively 'uncontaminated' form by controlling statistically for a number of potentially mediating variables. Second, the influence of specific potential mediating variables on parent attitudes and behaviors is examined; and third, these data are examined to determine if variable interrelationships are different for FT/NFT within different sponsors. An exploration of parent information may provide both a background for understanding what is happening in the classroom and a perspective on the extent to which Follow Through is achieving its goal of increased parent involvement.

Forty 18- to 24-month-old children and their mothers served as subjects under three different conditions: Full Treatment Program of home training, home visits, group meetings for mothers, and curriculum materials; Partial Treatment Program of home training and visits and no educational materials or group meetings; and No Treatment. The mothers in the Full and Partial Treatment Groups modelled new and expanded action and verbal patterns during daily, familiar activities in the home during a 3-month period. Measurements of sustained attention included a mental development scale, a rating of language development, and a Sustained Attention  to Verbal Stimuli Scale developed for the study. Results showed that the Full Treatment Program was significantly more effective for increasing young children's sustained attention to verbal stimuli than the Partial Treatment Program and the No Treatment. Theoretical and practical aspects of these results are discussed. (Author/CS)",

The methodology and techniques, which were left to the evaluator's discretion, included questionnaires, observations during school visits, interviews, and parent opinionnnaire. Program information categories selected for review and evaluation were presented and discussed with the San Juan Pueblo school staff and school board in separate meetings. Designated categories were: (1) school philosophy and goals; (2) curriculum; (3) instructional program; (4) testing and self-evaluation; (5) out-of-class  activities; (6) administration (school, agency, and area); (7) school facilities and plant; and (8) community involvement. For the reports in this publication, each evaluator compiled and analyzed the data, presenting the findings in a summary form. Some findings are: (1) 57 percent of the respondents (school board, PTA, tribal officials, and parents) felt the present program goals and objectives were satisfactory; (2) there were few planned or competitive sports and recreation events due to a lack of facilities, equipment, staff, and money; (3) food services suffer from insufficient staff; and (4) 63 percent of the parents felt their children would be ready for public school on completing study at San Juan Day School.

        "description":"Like all capitalist nations which have gone through a development process, the United States has relied partly on the rural-to-urban transfer of resources for the growth of an industrialized urban complex. The existence of a market-dominated rural sector and a noncompetitive (administered-price) urban sector has resulted in a major transfer of capital while the adoption of labor-saving technology within the farm sector has resulted in vast quantities of human migration. Because this rural-to-urban flow has also been affected by the educational system, this paper focuses on educational finances and migration of educated persons from rural areas in Kansas. Discussed are: geographic (rural-to-urban) transfers; an analysis of paying ability with respect to rural vs. urban counties  and socioeconomic and occupational groups; and the effects of various statewide taxing schemes. Tabular data cover six groups of Kansas counties (most rural, moderately rural, slightly rural, slightly urban, moderately urban, and most urban) for: per capita revenues from county and outside sources; annual per pupil educational costs and losses due to out-migration; per capita indicators of property taxes and paying ability; effective rates of income, sales, and property taxes paid according to individuals' adjusted gross income; difference between the average cost per pupil and the per pupil revenue generated had the State imposed a statewide taxing scheme; and per pupil State aid under old and new formulae.

        "description":"The assistance program to American Indians enrolled in public schools, known as the Johnson-O'Malley (JOM) Program, has drawn increasing attention in recent years for Indian people, the general public, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). This has resulted in the need for changes in the BIA Manual and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) material dealing with these programs and funds. Beginning with the passage of the JOM Act in 1934, this document explains the original act and its revisions, including its initial intent. Up to the FY 1975 appropriation, the position of the Administration and Congress has been that the JOM program is intended for public school Indian children who live on or near reservations. There has been, though, considerable expression of a desire to  expand the program beyond the present eligibility restrictions and to include Indian children wherever they may live, so long as they are from a federally recognized tribe. The BIA has instigated assessments and audits aimed at improving the JOM program and is now working to change the CFR so that it better reflects the many changes that have been and may be made relative to the program. The report includes many of the various memos, drafts, proposed budgets and legislation, and reactions to proposed regulation changes. These cover special education programs, authority and definitions, contract eligibility, community participation, and general contract requirements. (KM)",

Since its Government and Parliament have subscribed to the principle of maximum mobility across national frontiers, more than 400,000 foreign citizens and 200,000 former aliens reside in Sweden today. Immigration to Sweden is not completely free, though. A policy of controlled immigration exists as a means of realizing equal treatment of native and foreign subjects. Access to employment and housing are conditions for labor and residence permits. One of the fundamental principles of this policy is to give immigrants a free choice between staying in Sweden and returning to their country of origin or emigrating to a third country. If they decide to stay, immigrants receive: (1) time off with pay to  learn Swedish, (2) compulsory schooling for their children, and (3) equal opportunities to participate in labor market training. This paper discusses Sweden's immigration policy, legislation, and research, giving statistics on the migrant worker population, the educational situation of workers' children, and the education and training of migrant workers.

Phase 1 of the study explored the number and distribution of native youths in Edmonton (both transient and resident), estimating that there were 2,000 during May 1970. Phase 2, covered in this report, determines: (1) needs of native youths; (2) the availability and adequacy of resources to meet these needs; and (3) actions that may be taken where these resources are nonexistent or inadequate. Additionally, four groups of objectives were outlined to correspond  with interest areas: (1) agency information--perceived general resources and needs; (2) education information--perceived educational resources and demographic information; (3) social information--general attitudes, values, and personality factors; and (4) employment information--demographic information. Findings were given for needs, correspondence between native and non-native needs, and adequacy of resources, which in turn were analyzed for agency, education, employment, and social information. Very broadly, the study suggested that there are native youth characteristics and needs specific to them; however, the resources present to meet them are as inadequate for the total youth population as they are for the native population.

The initial impetus for university involvement in the problems of single, displaced agricultural workers resulted from contacts between the university and the Sacramento Singlemen Selfhelp Group, Inc. (SSSC), an organization representing a segment of the seasonal farm labor force. Research was conducted at a housing project operated by the Sacramento City-County Housing Authority from October 1, 1969 through April 15, 1970. Information was gathered by the in-culture research method, which operates on the  philosophy that persons who participate in a culture or subculture are a valuable information source on their needs and lifestyles. Case studies, interviews, and a questionnaire were used. This report discusses the three types of men living at the center (farmworkers, hustlers, and misfits); their attitudes about themselves and the living facility; and the history of some problems encountered at the project. Some of the findings indicated that the center became an institution with the same problems encountered in jails and prisons; and that the men needed meaningful roles in the development, operation, and maintenance of the housing facility. A glossary of terms and statistical data on the 774 men housed at the center are given in the two appendixes. (NQ)",

        "description":"A series of research and service projects designed to better the condition of single male farmworkers in Stockton and Sacramento were sponsored by the Department of Applied Behavioral Sciences at the University of California, Davis. The Stockton Singlemen's Project, begun in January 1971, had two basic elements: (1) research and (2) community development. The research was conducted at locations such as public parks, privately owned gathering places, and offices of various social service organizations, with a day center called &quot;The Place&quot; as the focal point. Information was gathered through observations, conversations, staff impressions, but primarily through the in-culture research method which uses members of a culture or subculture in the process itself, from developing  questionnaires to conducting and writing interviews. The research team completed 140 interviews. This report assists various public and private Stockton agencies in better dealing with these indigent single men. The research results which examine the subculture of single employable men, the community's role in their past and present lives, and the availability of public and private social services are presented. The four sections discuss: the availability, quality, and quantity of social services as well as the attitudes of the various agencies' employees; the role of the Skid Row community in the lives of these men; and characteristics of the Skid Row man. The conclusion examines the future of this subculture which has been rendered superfluous by progress. (NQ)",

        "description":"In spring 1974, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) embarked on a specific project related to Indian control of schools. The objective was to have, by the end of FY 75, at least 1/4 (50) of the bureau schools operating under a management system chosen by those served by the schools. This report reflects progress on the project, covering June, July, and, in some instances, August 1974. BIA education personnel started working with Indian tribes relative to assuming control of schools at least five years ago, also developing ongoing activities directedly related to the project objective which have a similar but different conceptual base. Considering options, this first progress report reflects a period of adjustment to these ongoing activities. For FY 75, 78 schools will be included  in the project, 50 of which are Alaskan day schools. A review of existing contract schools revealed that seldom does a tribe take over complete control of a school, especially if it is a Federal school. Most schools are a combination of the options (a tribe may choose to continue a Federal operation, take over via a contract, operate under public arrangements, or do a combination of these). However, tribal control, even for combination or cooperative schools, does take place. Appendix A gives Presidential/Secretarial objectives for Indian control of schools; Appendix B gives an example of the operating plan developed by each BIA area office. (KM)",

The bulk of the workers' families lived in or near poverty and were highly dependent on famale as well as male income. Preliminary analysis revealed that being female had a high negative correlation with their incomes earned in the 12 months preceding the survey. The 1970 nonmetropolitan data were collected from two rural villages and a town of about 5,000 persons in east Texas, which were located in a county characterized by a higher proportion of blacks and a substantially lower median family income than for Texas as a whole. Most of the residents, both male and female, were employed in the  area's poultry and lumber industries. The metropolitan data were collected a year later in a lower class, black ghetto of Houston. The median family income in this ghetto was among the lowest of any ward in the city. Individuals were sampled for sex, wage income, occupation, time worked, job training, education, and age. The study found that, among both nonmetropolitan and metropolitan groups, being female had a strong negative effect on wage income. Considering the high dependence of working and lower class black families on female incomes, the study suggested that sexism is an important factor to be investigated in future studies of black poverty.

        "description":"In 1965, a youth aspiration study was initiated in six southern states. Data were first collected in 1966 from 10th grade students in selected high schools. In 1968, 12th grade students attending the same schools completed questionnaires. Then, in 1972, a stratified random sample was taken of 1,226 young adults who were previously examined. This paper is a preliminary report on the educational aspiration and attainment data for this regional sample. Attention focused on the nature of change in educational aspiration over the critical period in life from late adolescence to young adulthood. Educational attainment reflected the short-run achievements realized during the first years following the completion of high school. Aspiration as a theoretical construct was not considered;  the referent in this instance was restricted to educational goals for which the aspiration serves as an abstract or idealized goal orientation. Within this frame of reference, the paper describes: (1) what happens to educational aspiration during the transition period; and (2) the level of educational attainment at an early point in adult life. Findings revealed that this sample was even more strongly oriented toward college and graduate study after having been out of high school 4 years. Urban white males were most oriented toward these goals; rural white females were the least. Black men and women from both rural and urban backgrounds were substantially equal in their orientation toward college. (KM)",

        "description":"Migrant is a relative status which historically has been quite diverse, not only in origin and makeup, but in style. The trends in migrant workers' status and method of operation by broad historical epochs are described. Wherever the migrant is, he has wandered there through a series of circumstances, identities, and relationships which have seriously altered the very nature of this population. Emphasis is placed on what has happened since the Civil War (when an economic style opened the door for more extensive mobility among farm laborers) and the impact of \"modern history\" (especially industrialization). The document covers: (1) farm laborers in Colonial America, (2) migrant workers in the West and Southwest (beginning in the 1800's), and (3) the migrant worker since World War  II. Hope for migrant workers, a minority group with little power, may lie in unionization, although the unwillingness of the government to enforce labor laws is only one part of the problem in making these efforts effective. Some other difficulties are: (1) low educational levels, (2) the inability of workers to settle for \"deferred gratification\", (3) the lack of effective leadership, and (4) the incongruent life style inherent in the concept of the \"organized transient\". In summary, the migrant situation is anything but clear and predictions are hazardous. Whether those remaining in the migrant stream can ever move out of this status depends on a number of variables, i.e., if the economy can absorb them and if they are not completely eliminated from agricultural pursuits by  industrialization.

Assuming that these variables need clarification, this paper: (1) examines some of the conceptual and methodological problems involved in rural-urban differentiation, (2) proposes a multidimensional continuum and typology, and (3) tests the empirical utility of this continuum and typology. Using the Wirth-Redfield conceptual framework, these criteria were adopted within a given spatial-temporal context: an urban center, in contrast to a rural one, is characterized by larger size, greater density, and a preponderance of persons engaged in nonagricultural economic activities. In this definition, the demographic  dimensions of size and density of population, and the occupational dimension indicating cultural differences are emphasized. There were 18 measures of urbanization employed--11 unidimensional and 7 multidimensional. All of these measures were then correlated with four dependent variables--fertitlity ratio, average number of persons per household, divorce rate, and income differences between professionals and laborers. A rural-urban typology was then developed, based on three major variables--size, density, and heterogeneity. The typological method of analysis compared favorably with the contimuum analysis of rural-urban variations. Additional testing with a Profile of Types of Rural Counties gave further evidence of the empirical utility of a typological analysis of rural-urban  differences. (KM)",

Interviewee responses were coded according to the Duncan Socioeconomic Index of Occupations. The most significant finding was that race appeared to be the major determinant of OGD.  Sex also appeared to be a strong determinant, but the difference in OGD scores for males and females was partly due to a function of the Duncan Socioeconomic Index of Occupations. By itself, residence had no affect on OGD; when controlled for race and sex, significant differences did exist. (NQ)",

With no representation in local government, and lacking the power and cultural sophistication to make the political process work for them, many Indian emigres have developed an almost institutionalized distrust of and concommitant failure to utilize the political process, which compounded their alienation from urban society. The Indian Paraprofessional Services Program (IPS) was initiated in 1972 to interrupt this cycle. The first of its kind in the nation, the program trained Indian &quot;ombudsmen&quot; to act as buffers between urban Indians and the alien city environment. The role of the 5 paraprofessionals, mostly from Washington tribes, was to assist Indians  caught in criminal and civil legal processes and bureaucratic complications. The 3 month training program emphasized bodies of law and sociology pertinent to Indian clients, covering such things as consumer law, welfare rights, criminal law, housing rights, and counselling skills. Because of increasing case loads and fee generating cases, lawyers who had indicated interest in Indian causes were invited to join the panel. A successful program, the most profound effect of IPS was upon the attitude of urban natives toward the legal process itself, showing that a dispossessed minority can, from among its own leadership, ease its people into their new urban life style while working within the established order.

Approximately equal numbers of 10th- and 11th-grade biology students (N=57) from two intact classrooms were involved in the study. Learning materials from the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) Green Version High School Biology (1963) were adapted to self-paced instruction. Students in both groups were given several guiding questions to be answered. For one group, teacher-specified activities were provided to help answer the questions. For the other, referred to as student structured experiences (SSE), students were asked to develop their own activities to provide the answers. The Q-sort of Single Adjectives, used to measure  self-image of achievement, was administered at the beginning of the experiment and after 43, 98, and 120 days of classroom activity. Achievement was measured both by the BSCS Quarterly Tests One and Two and by the BSCS Comprehensive Final Examination. The investigator concluded that independence of learning required gradual development by most students. The academic performance of the teacher-structured group was superior to that of the SSE group but some SSE students were able to develop independent learning behavior as evidenced by superior achievement scores.

        "description":"Reported is a study to measure one aspect of teacher effectiveness, using teacher classroom behavior and the attitudes developed by students toward their science class, science laboratory, science teacher, and school. Data were obtained from a variety of sources: the Science Classroom Activity Checklist; Student Semantic Differential; Annual Self-Inventory for Science Teachers; Teacher Semantic Differential; Teacher Concern Statement; content tests in biology, earth science, and physical science; and personal information (age, sex, years of teaching experience, teaching area, background preparation, GPA). Forty-eight secondary school science teachers selected for participation in a NSF-funded summer institute (1971) were involved, with 32 of these individuals being considered for  statistical analysis. The six questions posed for investigation were translated into six null hypotheses for testing. Statistical analyses revealed that participation in the summer institute program appeared to alter a teacher's classroom behavior patterns toward more student-centered and indirect behaviors. No changes in student attitudes toward their science course or school were identified. Teacher attitudes provided little evidence of alteration, although the participants did express a strong feeling that the institute experience was a valuable one. (PEB)",

This information was considered to serve as base-line data for determining gaps in the science education literature and for making recommendations with regard to areas for research and dissemination of information. A total of 2,093 articles of an average  length of 2,607 words were published in the nine journals for the period under analysis with the number of articles being about equally divided between the two years. Contributors represented over 500 different schools, with these being primarily colleges and universities. Articles related to science education for preschool, kindergarten, and junior high school groups had limited representation in journals during the period surveyed. A geographic representation of authors for the period was as follows: northeastern U.S., 24.7 percent; southeastern, 17.8 percent; central, 23.2 percent; southwestern, 8.2 percent; and far western, 13.5 percent.

He identifies the constraints affecting the success of environmental education programs and concludes that these are typical of most school systems and are similar to those affectig the success of other instructional programs. A ten phase strategy for establishing a comprehensive environmental education program is outlined. The phases are, in brief, (1) establish a committee to develop, implement, and  evaluate the environmental education program and to facilitate communication, (2) establish environmental education goals, (3) establish environmental education objectives, (4) review the literature, (5) establish program goals, (6) establish the curriculum (instructional model), (7) establish a comprehensive inservice teacher education program, (8) develop a reinforcing environment, (9) devise a strategy to overcome program constraints, and (10) develop instruments to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.

Basically, however, he attempts to identify how engineering and technology fit into the situation. He states, as a simple fact that, within the context of our cultural and societal traditions and practices, the by products of technology we have all demanded, encouraged, and supported, have created the great environmental perils that now confront society. The purpose of the Conference at which this paper was presented was an inquiry into ways the state's engineering colleges may most appropriately respond to the needs created by environmental problems.  The author speaks to the idea that the good engineer must be sensitive to the social forces of his time and must be educated toward this goal.

One other element considered to be of particular importance to such a teaching experience was style. The author briefly considers each of the parameters. Students are evaluated in terms of prior education, prior experience, ethnicity, and cognitive skills. The instructor is described in terms of three roles: evaluational, relational, and synthetic. A model for general education science curricula is presented using three orthogonal concerns: subjects, themes, and alternatives - with emphasis on the fact that one must move through all three dimensions of this model,  not just one or two. Some of the possible organizing themes are briefly examined. These include: epistemology, methodology, history, philosophy, sociology, technology, esthetics, and ethics. (EB)",

Students (N=over 200) enrolled in an introductory college chemistry course for science majors were randomly assigned to two experimental treatments. Treatment O was designed to help students understand the objectives of the course and to emphasize the importance of the objectives. Students in treatment R also received a list of objectives for the course but emphasis was on providing feedback concerning their progress toward meeting these objectives via a weekly 10 point quiz. Half the students in each class in treatment R were told they had to score at least 8 points on the quiz or they would receive a zero grade for that quiz. They could, however, re-take the quiz as often as they  wished in order to achieve a score above 8 points. The other students in the class could also re-take the quizzes but they were under no coercion concerning their scores. For treatment O, the appropriate experimental unit is the class section but the appropriate experimental unit for treatment R is not clear. The opportunity to re-take a quiz appeared to indicate that the appropriate experimental unit, for R, was the individual. (PEB)",

In his research, the investigator conducted a partial evaluation of these two courses and assessed the knowledge about science and scientists possessed by grade eleven and grade twelve students in Saskatchewan. Thirty-eight teachers were randomly selected to participate in the study; 28 agreed to do so. Student data were collected via the Nature of Science Scale--form SASK (NOSS), an instrument originally designed to assess the effect of university science programs on university students' understanding of the nature of science; the Science  Process Inventory form D-SASK (SPI); and the Test on the Social Aspects of Science (TSAS) which deals with the interaction among science, technology and society. The use of t tests for matched pairs indicated that both chemistry courses had a negligible effect on students' knowledge about the scientific enterprise. Qualitative data revealed a balance between a gain in understanding and an acquisition of misconceptions. Also identified were specific ideas which indicated strengths and weaknesses in students' understanding about science and scientists. (PEB)",

        "description":"Reported is a study representing a chronological history of selected objectives for the teaching of secondary school chemistry in the United States during the 1918-1972 period. Periodical literature was the primary source of materials reviewed, consisting of \"School Science and Mathematics\" (1918-1972), \"Science Education\" and \"The General Science Quarterly\" (1918-1972), \"The Journal of Chemical Education\" (1924-1972), \"The Science Teacher\" and \"The Illinois Chemistry Teacher\" (1934-1972), \"The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists\" (1945-1972), and \"The Journal of Research in Science Teaching\" (1963-1972). The 1918-1972 time span was divided into six subperiods: 1918-1933, 1932-1941, 1939-1946, 1945-1957, 1954-1964, and 1963-1972. (Reasons for these subdivisions are provided in the  report.) The investigator identified 18 distinct types of objectives and found that, while yearly fluctuations existed for numbers of articles and statements concerned with objectives for teaching secondary school chemistry, the number of distinct objective types remained fairly constant. Sixteen of the 18 were found in literature for all 6 subperiods, no objective appeared in the literature of later subperiods that was not present in subperiod 1, 1918-1933. (Author/PEB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether a teacher's involvement in a National Science Foundation Summer Institute Program designed to increase his content competencies would alter his perception of self and subject, and subsequently alter his students' views of science and education as a whole. Thirty-two teachers participating in a 1971 summer program (Group I) and thirty teachers participating in a 1972 summer session (Group II) were studied. The Student Semantic Differential, Teacher Semantic Differential, Annual Self-Inventory for Science Teachers, and Teacher Concern Statement were taken on both groups of teachers prior to their participation in the institute: after the first year following the institute; and for Group I teachers, after the second year following  the institute. Findings showed that there was only partial positive group effect on the attitudes of Group II participants' students toward the world of science; Group I showed no change at the close of the first year, but the second year study revealed a possible beginning of student attitude change. There was an apparent negative effect on participant attitudes immediately following the institute that was reversed during the following year of teaching. The professional self perception of all participants was markedly improved, but less success was noted in the ability of the participants to increase the maturity of their concerns about teaching.

The first stage of the study compared the programs with respect to (1) the sequential presentation, (2) the use of materials to provide sensory training, (3) practice acquired through activities, and (4) the role of the teacher. Conclusions were that because S-APA and Montessori seemed to have common elements and because both had taught the process of observation, there was a reasonable justification to compare student competence in observation. The second part of the study compared the competence on observational tasks of three groups of 25 children, ages 5 and 6. The first group received Montessori  training for two years in preschool, the second group used S-APA for one year with background of another type of preschool that excluded Montessori, and the third group which served as a control had neither Montessori nor S-APA training in their two-year preschool experience. Students were tested on a set of observational tasks from the text, the Science Process Instrument. Findings showed no significant differences between the Montessori and the S-APA preschool students in regard to competence in observation. Both the Montessori and the S-APA groups scored higher than the control group. (DT)",

Answers to the following questions were sought: (1) Do sex differences in appraisals of policemen continue into the senior year of high school? (2) Is there a significant relationship between how students perceive police and how they have been treated by policemen? (3) Is there congruence between adolescents' appraisal of policemen and their appraisals of school authorities--teachers and administrators? Four hundred and nineteen high school seniors in San Jose, California responded to three questionnaire items asking for an evaluation of police fairness. The students were also asked if they had ever been in a situation in which they had felt unjustly treated by a policeman and/or by teachers and other  school authorities. Findings showed that: (1) Girls continue to rate policemen more favorably than do boys. (2) Those treated unjustly by a policeman had a poorer opinion of policemen. (3) There is congruence between adolescents' appraisal of policemen and their appraisals of school authorities. (Author/RM)",

The purpose of the project is to redesign an introductory American history course so that students might pursue particular interest areas, have close and frequent contact with faculty members, and engage in a variety of learning modes tailored to their needs and learning styles. An unusual aspect of the project is that it draws on the insights and experiences of 13 honor students in the course who are, as their major activity for the course, involved in all aspects of  its redesign. Background on the development center and on the use of students in the development process is presented, followed by a discussion of problems encountered and their possible solutions, accomplishments, and evaluation of the project, and conclusions. Appendixes contain the results, the open-ended responses, and notes on the predevelopment opinionnaire. (Author/KSM)",

The programs serve as models for other attempts to aid adolescents toward feeling that they can make a difference in the world around them. Obstacles for youth enroute to adulthood--prolongment of adolescence, pervasive peer group culture, rapid change, mass media, growing numbers of youth in crisis, youth's increasing social commitment, and new laws on voting--stimulate the need for student action programs. The nine projects dealing with drugs, community health, tutoring, and teaching by adolescents, community action, film production, and a national student journal are examined for the problems they  were designed to meet, their goals and operating procedures, and their benefits for the people involved. The strengths of these programs suggest the components of a model for other programs, described in terms of its key elements and practical guidelines, as well as some hopes and dreams for the future. A bibliography of background and practical documents concludes the publication. (JH)",

Condorcet's design for a system of public schools was aimed at providing instruction for all French men, women, and children in order to educate them for citizenship and prepare them for the future. The intellectual control over what was to be taught would be exercised by enlightened men, and the power to select teachers was divided between enlightened men and heads of households. This system would have enabled the French people to use the financial resources of the state while relying on the intellectual authority of enlightened men  and moral authority of the family. Integral to the plan was the separation of instruction, the teaching of specific skills such as reading, writing, and reasoning, from education, the moral and manual training that could be provided by a family. In the course of the Revolution, the National Convention adopted other education plans which replaced the moral authority of the church with that of the state rather than the family. (Author/JH)",

        "description":"Two cartoon strips were the vehicle for surveying perceptions of power use in everyday situations. A stratified cross-sectional sample of 430 adults in Los Angeles were interviewed. Their task was to choose a behavior, illustrated by a cartoon panel, most likely to be employed by a policeman in one instance and a nurse in another to secure compliance with a request. Also, the person interviewed was to choose the reaction of the cartoon subject to the request. Frameworks for analyzing the data were patterns of compliance; choice of power base, whether informational, legitimate, coercive, expert, referent, or reward; compliance contingent on power base; and demographic difference. Among the demographic factors of age, education, and sex, age differences generated the most striking  effects. Use of the cartoon as a medium to study perception of power was dictated not solely because of its feasibility but because of a suspected underlying affinity between the message and the medium. Emphasis should be placed on the fact that the data represent perceptions of behavior, not actual behavior. (Author/JH)",

The purpose of this exploratory study was to reveal the natural museum habitat and criterion behaviors of visiting fourth through sixth graders. Children's responses were characteristic of four categories--orientation, verification, discovery, and integration--which were found to vary in different museum settings. The four categories were sufficiently described to further the development of a standard which could be used to judge the quality of a tour experience, to understand better the nature of children's experiences in different museum settings, and to apply them to docent training for  which three proposed studies are described. Recommendations for changes in the Pharmacy Tour also resulted from this study. This report of the study contains an appendix with samples of observation, instruments, settings, data and logic employed to gather the results described, and an appendix of designs for future studies.

        "description":"It is time to reevaluate the myths of the nineteenth century and the structures they created pertaining to education. There is a need to utilize new power relationships to creatively build a pluralistic educational system. It must be recognized that conflict can lead to collaboration if respect is present, whereas collaboration which ignores conflict will not in the long run be productive. The simplistic truth orientation of the social reformers of the nineteenth century, who felt that they could build our democracy and school systems on a foundation of acculturation and moral education, did not recognize the legitimate rights and humanity of the people they wanted to help. Today we reap the legacy of these policies; but hopefully we are more willing to recognize the necessity of  citizen involvement with its accompanying conflict so that differences will not be suppressed and legitimate procedures will be established to educate citizens, help them create alternatives viable for their children, and help us to bring about needed changes and reconciliation of conflicts. In order to do so, simplistic dichotomizing between those who have the \"truth\" and those who do not will have to be replaced by acceptance of different approaches and temporary, issue-oriented coalitions of citizens and professionals.

Understandings, or objectives, consider the following: that the very nature of some social aims, such as brotherhood, places them beyond the limited capacity of law; how the capacity of law may be limited by lack of agreement that law should be used to further a particular social aim; that law is limited in furthering some legal aims because some of the aims of society conflict; how lack of knowledge about the cause or cure of a particular social problem may limit the capacity of law to alleviate the problem; how limits of technological capability may impose limits on the capacity of law;  and ways in which the difficulty of accurately determining the facts serves to limit the capacity of law in the appropriate application of legal rules.

        "description":"Data on the problem of the loss of professional manpower by developing countries to develop countries is reported and analyzed from a survey of over 1,300 foreign students in over 30 U. S. colleges and universities. The ideological and scholarly debate generated by the brain drain and approaches to the study of professional migration are reviewed, and a sociological model of student nonreturn is presented. The sampling and field work procedures for gathering the data utilized for identifying a pattern of student nonreturn in the U. S. are described. Factors considered as operating in responses to student nonreturn include characteristics of the students' countries, opportunities for work and education, social group influences, and motivational states. These factors are seen as  operating at two time periods: the period before arrival and the period of study in the U. S. Discussion focuses on social group effects on nonreturn as well as objective opportunities and their perception by students within these two time periods. In the last chapters, multivariate regression models are proposed and analyzed. Finally, some of the policies that have been suggested to deal with the brain drain are discussed and evaluated in the light of the survey findings and analysis. (KSM)",

        "description":"The president of an independent university asks why, in the face of a decline in the private educational sector in the United States, this sector cannot be left unmonitored but well supported in order to make its contribution to American society. His answer, or argument, is twofold. First, the tide appears to be running against the private sector in American life generally. There is concern not for equality of opportunity but for equality of results; there is a new-found passion for rationalizing the allocation and use of resources throughout our society. Secondly, the case for survival and support is subtle and difficult to make. The defense argues from the overall advantages of pluralism to society and from the viewpoint that the contribution of independent schools derives from  the variety and individual uniqueness. The suggested course of action begins with making the best possible case for pluralism. A second and related point is to improve understanding of other institutions and individuals involved with independent schools. Next, it must be demonstrated that the claims of excellence and individuality have been lived up to. Lastly, those in independent educational institutions must retain their capacity both to innovate and, where it is important to do so, to resist innovation. (Author/KSM)",

The rationale of the experiment--to implement a program relevant to students, to encourage a dialogue across disciplinary lines among faculty, and to encourage student participation in the classroom--is discussed, and the two core courses which inaugurated the program are described. Results show that the college is successful in providing a multidisciplinary perspective, less successful in imparting a basic body of knowledge, and that it is too early to know if students have been sufficiently interested to pursue indepth studies in the  program's related courses. The perspective, structure and content, related courses, and classroom strategies are described along with the important function of student journals and the role of the faculty. The first year is characterized as a modest success, and several recommendations are made for ensuing years. Basic data about the program and its participants, course syllabi, instructions on keeping a journal, and some excerpts from student journals are appended. (Author/KSM)",

Students enrolled in an introductory sociology college course were given questionnaires at the beginning and end of each term. A semantic differential technique was used with a seven-point scale for several polar opposites. In addition, questionnaires at the end of each course included a critique of the course and several background items. The hypotheses that college students would share a consistent image of sociology  and that selected personal variables would not affect their images of sociology or sociologists were supported by the data. A third hypothesis, proposing little changes in student images of sociology after the introductory course, was not supported: student images did appear affected by the course.

        "description":"Discussed in this report are the results of the first social studies assessment from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a project of the Education Commission of the States. Exercises especially designed to test the attainment of social studies skills, knowledges, and attitudes were administered to a random sampling of 9-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 17-year-olds, and adults. Among the findings are the following: (1) Less than one half of America's 17-year-olds and young adults understand how to use all parts of a simple ballot; (2) relatively few Americans can read and interpret graphs, maps, or tables effectively; (3) a rather large gap exists between the attitudes Americans profess to hold and the actions they take in specific situations; (4) young Americans generally  have very little knowledge about the contributions of minority groups to our culture and history; (5) blacks show a marked disadvantage in skills, knowledge, and attitudes assessed at all age levels; (6) females outperform males on both skill and attitude exercises during the school years, but fall behind the males by age adult; and (7) Southeasterners consistently perform below the national levels of success in all three areas.

First, students' attitudes and descriptions concerning the introduction of controversial course material into the social studies curricula are investigated; and, secondly, the possible consequences of such material are examined. Data collected from 588 secondary students in three southern Illinois communities through a questionnaire administered to English classes shows that students strongly prefer an emphasis on controversial subject matter in social studies, that they expect the teacher's role to be active, and that half prefer the expression of personal opinions by the teacher. The consequences for the student in a civic education class with open discussion  of controversial subject matter are investigated in relation to positive educational outputs of attitudes, behaviors, or perceptions. General conclusions drawn from measures of these three correlates are that secondary students prefer a comparatively strong emphasis on controversial subject matter in social studies and that, when allowed to discuss controversial materials openly in the social studies class, students display marked behavioral and perceptual effects not manifested in students more constrained in this activity.

Antagonism, anxiety, and accusations characterize the extreme we-they split among those interviewed. Anthropology describes such a society with two major divisions as a moiety, one of two mutually exclusive divisions of a group. The educator community studied exhibits the characteristics of a moiety form of social organization in its two divisions of teachers and technocrats, and their two totems, students and reports respectively. The moiety perspective challenges the hierarchical bureaucratic model of school organization by showing a reasonable distribution of power between  moieties. Educator moieties exhibit reciprocal behaviors, such that each division is dependent on the other and cannot maintain a viable educational subculture alone. The traditional subdivision of moieties into phratries and/or clans extends the scope of the analogy, explaining, for example, most teachers seem to find more in common with teachers of the same levels as themselves. Lastly, the moiety notion suggests an equilibrium model for examining educational change and for explaining the stability of the educational subculture in general. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"The development of political thinking during adolescence was studied by interviewing 463 suburban and urban schoolchildren of average intelligence in grades 6, 8, 10, and 12. Each subject was interviewed individually by means of a Piaget-type questionnaire. Analysis of the questionnaire responses revealed a very distinctive developmental pattern. Younger subjects tended to have an authoritarian and restrictive concept of government and were largely unaware of broader political issues. Older subjects had a much more facilitative and democratic view of government and were relatively sophisticated about political problems. There was also, however, some evidence of increased political alienation with increasing age. Although there were minor sex, race, and area differences, the  developmental differences were far more striking, appearing on almost every item of the questionnaire. The author concludes that except for being somewhat uninformed about the functioning of political parties, the average 12th grader is well-equipped to exercise his franchise. It is suggested that the public school system may play an important role in bringing about the observed results. (Author)",

First the characteristics of an educational philosophy are discussed, including the common characteristics of progressive and open education. Next the meaning, use, and origin of the term incentive in an educational setting are discussed, which lead to the conflict between the educational philosophies historically propounded in the United States and incentive systems and to the long term consequences of incentives systems. Justification for an incentive system, as for  an education policy, is taken up last and is touched on in light of the major issue of values. Five proposals are made: definition of the term \"incentive\", studies of the long range consequences of use of incentives in changing people's motivations, relative merits of inducements versus incentives, study of the permanency of incentive-induced behavior, and review of philosophic thought directed toward reasoning as it occurs in justifications of educational policy.

Indoor activities include reading and writing to record facts and create impressions, verbal interaction in discussion groups, activity planning, and listening to speakers. Students use instamatic and movie cameras to document their investigations. Student surveys of community characteristics such as neighborhood street lights and numbers of occupants per dwellings create  spinoff community activities that are improving neighborhoods. Support for teachers participating in the program includes workshops, teacher-student curriculum materials, and in-school consultants services.

Using film-strips, cassette recordings, slides, 16 mm films, book illustrations, and the printed word, the project translates the learning materials found in the classroom into the Navaho language. Major objectives of the San Juan Educational Program are to provide instruction in the language the child understands best so that he does not become retarded in the academic  areas while learning the common instructional language; build a positive self image of all children; and develop closer communication and understanding between parents and teachers. Evaluation shows that the Navaho children in the program have improved in their reading and in their attitudes toward school. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"The Quinmester Visual Arts Education Curriculum is a long range developmental effort directed toward providing a general education for learners in the art education field. The course of study, developed basically by teachers for teachers, emphasize involvement of the student in the learning process. All courses of study are designed to provide a broad framework of goals and objectives, a description of content, instructional procedures and strategies, and suggested learning activities. Various courses include special sections of vocabulary, work sheets, or other resources for learner and teacher. Documents SO 007 722 through SO 007 729 belong to the Arts Education Curriculum as do ED 059 226, ED 061 231 through ED 061 236, and ED 087 695, 696. This Quinmester course, Potter's  Wheel II, III, follows ED 061 236, Potter's Wheel I, and advances the student's ability on the wheel using more complex and larger forms that require more than one section. Shape, form, surface decoration, glaze application, and exploration of materials are stressed. Historical background and evaluation of students' work by the teacher are included. A listing of resource materials and organizations completes the guide. (JH)",

Methods used to achieve these gains were voluntary performance contracting by teachers and administrators, the use of special teachers to work with low achievers, incentives for students, and the use of teacher  assistants. It is reported that each of these methods seems to be sound and to help produce achievement gains even though some of them need to be further tested and improved. Fifty classes were measured in this project. Seventeen of the classes met the first objective satisfactorily, and 24 showed some increase in student achievement. Seven classes met objective 2 satisfactorily with 21 of the classes showing some gain in &quot;achievement to ability index.&quot; (HMD)",

Two self-scoring systems were combined with two disclosants for a total of four experimental systems administered to 128 children. In the count method, the child counts the number of stained teeth; in the rating method, the child selects one of five color photographs that looks most like his own mouth. While both methods appeared to be satisfactory for scoring plaque, the count method does not depend on additional materials and is superior in reliability and teachability. The authors state that while self-scoring systems may not be satisfactory for routine evaluation in a preventive program, they are reasonable substitutes for professional  indexes in epidemiological surveys.

        "description":"The evaluation of the California Teacher Development Project for the 1972-73 project year reports data for four performance criteria. These criteria relate to the expected behavioral changes of teachers involved in an inservice workshop program in individualizing instruction. One criterion relates to teacher knowledge of individualized instruction (cognitive behavior); three criteria relate to teacher attitude toward individualized instruction. To determine the effectiveness of the 1972-73 inservice program, a comparison group was formed using data from participants in the 1971-72 program. Instruments used to measure the effectiveness of the workshop program were: (a) the Fremont Test of Individualized Instruction, (b) the EPIC Individualized Instruction Attitude Inventory, and  (c) workshop evaluation forms which were completed by workshop participants. Participants in the 1972-73 workshop program did not perform as well as the comparison group on either the Fremont Test of Individualized Instruction or the EPIC Individualized Instruction Attitude Inventory; however, the difference in the performance was not statistically significant, and the 1972-73 workshop program is considered to have satisfactorily met its objective of disseminating individualized instruction techniques through inservice programs.

        "description":"This study describes an intensive 10-week teacher training program for minority group college graduates prior to teaching in the public schools. The Personal Orientation Inventory and the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory were used as pre- and posttraining measures to assess attitudes and value change over the duration of the training program. The authors conclude that the training program appears to have changed the attitudes and values of the college graduates into ones more congruent with good teaching and self-actualization. Also the program seems to have been more successful with those trainees going into secondary rather than elementary education. (An eight-item bibliography and seven tables are included.) (PD)",

These institutes, conducted by seven teacher education institutions, were carried out in the context of the four-phase model of implementation utilized by the Wisconsin Research and Development Center for Cognitive Learning in cooperation with state education agencies, teacher education institutions, and local school districts. The four phases are awareness, first-year installation, maintenance-refinement, and institutionalization. The one-week institutes comprised one set of activities carried out in the maintenance-refinement phase during the 1971-72 and 1972-73 school years. The  evaluation shows that such institutes can feasibly be conducted by teacher education institutions and that they are a viable means for providing experiences to help school staffs refine IGE practices.

The issues discussed include the following: (a) reliability of instructional systems in producing desired outcomes, (b) identification of relevant competencies, (c) level of specificity, (d) prespecification of outcomes, (e) the theory-practice continuum, and (f) the problem of transfer. From a program perspective, there are three phases leading to competency mastery for the educational leader. Phase one focuses on learnings at the knowledge and comprehension level. Phase two places greater stress on application-level learning, which could be realized through  simulation activities, lab sessions, and school-centered projects. Phase three is the administrative internship. Eleven basic guidelines for developing a competency model conclude this paper. Program goals and a program structure are illustrated; a 15-item bibliography is included. (PD)",

        "description":"This paper presents a model for the identification and validation of competencies, designed as an all-inclusive framework, which may be adapted for specific situations. The criteria for including data in the validation process are as follows: (a) if the data are to be employed in making decisions about individuals or groups, all available evidence should be gathered before attempting to interpret the results; (b) if the data are to be used for prediction or selection, the instruments should be validated in the specific situation for which they are to be employed; and (c) ideas about what is being measured as well as what the instruments measure must change as new evidence is forthcoming. LOGOS (Language for Optimizing Graphically Ordered Systems), used in the development of this  model, outlines the processes for meeting the proposed project objectives. The LOGOS model, consisting of two cells--developing competency statements and establishing construct validity and reliability, is outlined at the conclusion of this paper.

The McKay Campus School is an IGE (Individually Guided Education) school. The college interns worked with students aged 6 to 14.

Ultimately, the college intern developed two prescriptive programs, one for a primary-age child and one for an intermediate-age child (competencies exhibited during this part of the program are  listed in the document), and taught a mini-learning experience packet for a group of elementary-age children.

By being sensitive to the concerns of users and by seeing the use of an innovation as a developmental process, adoption agents are expected to be able to reduce the threat which change poses to individuals and to increase  the likelihood of an educational institution integrating an innovation at a high quality level of use.

The package is divided into four units or learning modules, which are preceded by a general overview. The purposes of the four units are to: (a) give prospective teachers an overview of nonverbal communication and provide a cognitive base from which to operate, (b) provide the participant with an opportunity to learn how he relates his feelings and attitudes to others without words and to improve his  perceptions of the feelings of others, (c) provide participants with information about nonverbal communication to enable them to determine its value in the learning situation, and (d) prepare the student to discriminate between messages given on the kinetic and vocal channels and to discuss the critical interdependence of the channels on each other. Enabling activities for the modules include readings, discussion in large and small groups, role playing activities, individual exercises, and the design of mini-lessons.

Procedures included workshops, inservice professional conferences, systems management activities, the development of instructional modules, the assessment of changes in perceptions, and general evaluation of competency-based aspects of the teacher education program. Data from the assessments and evaluation indicated positive changes in perceptions and cognitive  development, and use of materials and procedures centered around competency-based criteria.

Thirty educators, mostly black and female, responsible for comprehensive planning activities attended a 3-week workshop covering the areas of needs assessment, goal development, planning, project management, implementation evaluation, progress evaluation, and product evaluation. The areas of instruction were selected from results of a training-needs assessment and were implemented in the workshop via appropriate instructional modules (in the field-test stage) as developed by various education agencies. Results indicate that the instructional materials were appropriate for the audience as determined through product evaluations and trainee  ratings. Followup evaluations indicate that most of the trainees felt very positive toward comprehensive planning, and over half of the trainees were involved in comprehensive planning activities. Most developers of modules used in the workshop indicated that evaluation data would help modify or clarify the nature of their instructional products. Additional products developed in coordination with the training program include a needs assessment instrument, implementation procedures, and a catalog of instructional products relating to educational research and development.

These models were developed as a result of a grant to develop new ways in which scientific research associations can create coordinated, continued, and more systematic approaches to research training. The purpose of Model A is to design a traveling research training institute in which a particular course directed by scholars with a particular expertise will be available in different geographical locations three or four times a year. The intent of Model B is to make a concentrated  attempt to reach those individuals defined broadly as educational researchers.

        "description":"This memorandum reports on the preliminary research using a 24-item inventory designed to measure teacher's positions in relation to education issues and teaching decisions. The instrument, whose development is reported, is intended to identify representatives of two dichotomous styles of teaching: traditional, teacher-centered teaching and experimental, pupil-centered teaching. Each item in the inventory consists of a pair of extreme positions on an issue, to which the subject gives one of five responses ranging from strong agreement with the first statement to strong agreement with the second statement. The items were assigned to four subscales: Controlling, Rigidity, Individualism, and Professionalism. Scales, scores on two combined scales (R+C, P+I), and total scores were  computed. In addition, Teacher Attitude Inventory (TAI) scores were compared with observations of teacher behavior obtained on an observation instrument developed as part of a larger project that the TAI also served. The TAI was administered twice to primary and intermediate teachers in two school districts attended by students of different socioeconomic strata. Differences in teaching styles between the two groups of teachers, as informally observed by the experimenter, were shown by self-reports on the TAI to exist, except in relation to Professionalism. Data on reliability and validity are included, and conditions suitable for obtaining accurate self-reports are described. (Author)",

Team conferences are conducted weekly; coordinated parent and teacher and teacher programs are offered. The staff in each component works on an individual basis to provide teacher and parent conferences and to  meet the needs of students. Efforts are coordinated with community agencies such as the county public health department. Data are being collected related to services rendered in service programs such as medical and dental treatment, the team conferences, and the parent involvement activities.

These theories are the economic theory of the human capital model, the institutional theory of internal labor markets, and a probabilistic Markov model. The literature on each of the theories is briefly reviewed, and the substantive notions of the human capital model and the theory of internal labor markets are combined with the Markov model to develop a theory of teacher mobility. Some of the hypothetical implications of the theory of teacher mobility described are that: (a) interdistrict movement of school teachers should depend on both pecuniary and nonpecuniary differences among school districts; (b)  teachers who are located in assignments offering relatively low financial rewards should be more likely to leave teaching than those in more attractive assignments; (c) school districts should prefer to hire teachers who have more teaching experience and advanced degrees in education; and (d) relatively experienced teachers should be less mobile than less experienced teachers because they are more likely to be located in an assignment they consider attractive. The consequence of these implications is that the more attractive schools will have faculties with greater experience and educational attainment and that the same will be true of entire school districts.

        "description":"The aggregate measures of teaching staff per pupil or total educational staff per pupil can conceal substantial differences in the mix of educational professionals utilized and may yield erroneous conclusions about gaps in the relative educational service levels among local public schools. This study of staffing patterns in U. S. local schools, using unpublished data from a staff survey of local schools conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics in 1970, reveals that, in general, elementary schools have more nonprofessional health staff per teaching staff and less services supporting instructional staff per teaching staff than secondary schools do. Moreover, both elementary and secondary schools in large cities have more nonprofessional staff per teaching staff  and more services supporting instructional staff per teaching staff than schools do in metropolitan areas surrounding large cities and in all other areas. This analysis of local school staffing mixes indicates substantial differences in staffing patterns by location, size, and economic status of the school. These differences reinforce the hypothesis that use of aggregate pupil/teaching staffing ratios has been overemphasized and could produce inaccurate assessments of the quantity and quality of educational services by a specific school.

A sample of 59 graduates of the teacher preparation program of the university, who were teaching in the schools of Tennessee, was selected. The graduates completed questionnaires about the teacher preparation program, their experiences on the job, and a personality measure. Principals and students of the subjects rated the individuals using three instruments. Especially trained research assistants visited the subjects on two occasions during the 1973-74 school year and gathered data using interaction analysis and other  observation techniques. Results of the study indicated that the adapted model could be used for gathering data in a systematic manner about the graduates of the teacher education program. In turn, the data can be used for improving the teacher preparation programs of the university. In general, the results of the application of the model indicated the graduates had many of the characteristics of good teachers as reported in the literature. (Author/JA)",

Teams of trained observers observed each teacher in the classroom during both behavioral and inferential techniques of observation. Findings indicated that the experimental group engaged significantly more in experimental classroom practices. Teacher-centered, right-answer focus was less evident. The perceptual organization of the experimental teachers was positive to a significantly  higher degree; more specifically, in their perceptions of others as able and of goals as larger, in their tendency to see themselves as more adequate and to be more self-revealing.

After developing the program, McREL designed a diffusion project in two phases. The objectives of Phase I were to select installation sites and establish CUTE programs using specially  trained installer teams recruited from the site staff. Phase 1 evaluation consisted of testing program students and site-visit reports by McREL monitors. All eight sites proved to be operating successful CUTE programs. Phase 2 of the diffusion program utilized the original eight installation sites in further diffusion of the CUTE program to 20 additional universities. Again, evaluation consisted of testing students and on-site reports by McREL monitors. Evaluation reports are positive and show that the 28 sites operate effective programs and that of the almost 2000 graduates, most intend to remain in inner-city schools and almost all are highly successful, according to their supervisors.

        "description":"This paper discusses two areas of knowledge that educational professionals must develop to help resolve the crisis in the city and the suburbs. One area concerns key urban economic factors affecting elementary and secondary education. Eight factors are discussed: (a) the flight to suburbia, including some implications of the flight of the middle class; (b) city dwellers, who are largely the poor and disadvantaged; (c) diminishing funds for schools and public services; (d) serious education inequities; (e) steadily rising school costs, which include teacher and administrative salaries, and inflation; (f) the inner city--a syndrome of sociocultural disadvantaged; (g) some implications for the inner-city school curriculum; and (h) characteristics of teachers for the inner-city  school, including a description of the Goldberg Model Inner City Teacher. The second area of knowledge concerns six special problems of the culturally disadvantaged that teachers face. Hyram's List of Seventeen Human Relations Principles, a list of teaching strategies based on the concept of human nature as essentially vast potentialities, and a list of teaching strategies and the human relations principles from which they flow are included. A 27-item bibliography is also included. (PD)",

Student teachers are able to choose their own teaching experience from several projects. The Shawnee Project gives the novice teachers the opportunity to cope with inner-city school problems in real situations. The Urban Semester Project combines student teaching, community experiences, and residency in inner-city Indianapolis for a full semester. Here, the students are exposed to institutions and contacts who have the most profound effects on the inner-city students. The American Indian Reservation Student Teaching Project places teachers on four reservations in Arizona. The Latino focuses on children of migrant workers and students live and teach in bilingual sectors of the country. The  Atterbury Job Corps Center Project focuses on programmed learning, diagnostic techniques, and small class situations for adults, most of whom have been dropouts. Most of these programs have not been evaluated, but educators are optimistic and feel that they enrich the student teaching experience. Since the student teachers spend more in the school, they are able to see the actual development of pupils in the classroom. (PD)",

Subjects completed a four-item questionnaire prior to a demonstration of the whys and hows of dental care and again completed the same questionnaire 30 days after the demonstration. An analysis of the responses shows that of the four dental practices involved, significant behavior change occurred with regard to only one, type of toothpaste used, although desirable but not significant change occurred with regard to brushing and flossing techniques.

The sample represents approximately 20 first grade and 20 third grade classrooms for each of seven Follow Through sponsors, at five or more sites per sponsor. Program implementation in the classroom is judged on the basis of the extent to which a sponsor's classrooms are found to be uniform on selected implementation variables, and the extent to which they differ from the traditional non-Follow Through classrooms on the same set of variables. The following were observed in the classrooms: (a)  methodology used in the study of implementation, (b) implementation findings, (c) child behavior, (d) test scores, and (e) results of analysis of variance study. Findings show that the educational practices employed in Follow Through classrooms seem to be resulting in predictable and desired outcomes for the children. The author concludes that the Follow Through program of planned variation is being successfully implemented, and that the seven sponsored models considered in this report are each working to the advantage of children--not by chance but by careful design.

        "description":"A model for the selection of individuals into institutions and their subsequent socialization is formulated which is defined in terms of qualitative rather than quantitative data; these data are hierarchical in character and are defined at several points in time. Variables defined for individuals and variables defined for institutions were distinguished. This partition of variables and, therefore their effect, implies a hierarchical model. This model allows the separation of the effects of policy-important institutional variables into structural (direct) and compositional (indirect) subcategories. The individual-level component of the model allows assessment of the distinct effect of each individual-level variable. On the basis of the institutional-level component of the model,  two kinds of institutional effect may be assessed: those on the distributions of individual-level variables, i.e., on the kinds of persons acting in different institutions, and those directly on outcomes. Via the above decomposition of total effects in the model, both direct and indirect effects of institutional-level policy variables on outcome may be assessed: those mediated through the distribution of kinds of institutional actors and those directly affecting outcomes.

The results of contingency analyses and correlational analyses are reported. The identification of learning hierachies is stressed. Such hierarchies are apparent in the early learning of reading skills, but reading tends to merge into a few major skills as proficiency is increased. The overall structure of the relationships among the 90 objectives is displayed and described.

Data used to define goals consist of statements that parents made in the course of tape-recorded, personal interviews.

Percentages were then calculated of the parents and administrators who placed their statements under each category.

The second section outlines in detail the methodological procedures used in the preceding section.

This experiment was designed to look at the effects of the cognitive styles of field dependence, category width and equivalence range, initially-presented homogeneous, heterogeneous or completely randomized stimuli, an explicit sorting cue and resorting versus no resorting on total sorting time, and the number and quality of manifest categorization. Based on a review of the literature and results of a pilot study, a conceptual model of sorting was generated to predict the results. Subjects for the study were 12th grade, male students drawn from two schools within the same district  of white middle class communities. On the basis of this research it would seem that some cognitive styles and variations in sorting procedure do affect sorting outcomes. Specific results are presented. (Author/RC)",

The data were collected in Cycle III of the Health Examination Survey of noninstitutionalized U.S. youths during 1966-70. The GHDT instructions were modified for use in the survey to require each youth to draw two figures--a &quot;person&quot; and a &quot;self&quot; figure. Sexual differences in preferences and performances levels in drawing male and female figures are reported. Three charts present mean raw scores earned by boys and girls at each given age on the drawings of a man and woman. Two of the graphs contain data from the Cycle II examination of children 6-11 years of age so that the developmental trends in the drawing of a &quot;person&quot; can be seen from age 6 through age 17. These two  charts also present similar data from Harris' 1963 standardization group for comparison with the survey's findings. Twenty-three tables provide raw score data and norms for the modified GHDT in the form of standard scores and percentile equivalents. These data are presented for the &quot;person&quot; and &quot;self&quot; drawings by the type of drawing (man and woman) and the sex and age of the subject. (Author/MLP)",

        "description":"The Vocational and Occupational Interest Choice Examination (VOICE) was designed to measure the interests of enlisted men entering the Air Force. Items forming the inventory were primarily generated by examining job analysis in relation to the airman classification structure. The purpose of this effort was to develop and validate a prototype of an interest inventory that could be used by recruiters with the Guaranteed Enlistment Program. Both a priori and eight occupational scales were developed based on responses obtained by mail inventory administration of airmen who indicated satisfaction with their career fields. Scales were developed on half-samples, and a cross-validation technique employed. A comparison was made, in order to assess validity, of the number of individuals  correctly predicted to be members of a service career field or &quot;men-in-general&quot; using the scales versus the number of individuals one would expect to correctly predict without use of the scales. Scale weights developed in one half-sample were applied to responses obtained in the other half-sample in the above comparison. Recommendations for further developmental effort were made.

Hunt's &quot;distributive memory&quot; model and A. Newell's concept of the &quot;production system&quot; as possible bases for developing an alternative theory. Such a theory of cognitive abilities rests upon the individual differences displayed in the parameters of the tasks found in typical tests of intelligence. It is hypothesized that factor-analytic common factors arise when two or more tasks share features in which there are individual differences with respect to (1) the types and contents of memory stores involved, (2) the types and sequences of cognitive operations required and cognitive strategies employed by individual  subjects, and (3) the types of responses elicited. It is claimed that from this point of view, cognitive tasks are complex, and cognitive factors resist classification by any rigid taxonomy such as Guilford's Structure of Intellect model; there are probably no such things as truly &quot;pure&quot; factors.

Raw score data were generated randomly, then translated into grade equivalents, percentile ranks, stanines, and standard scores using norm tables from Metropolitan Achievement Tests. This procedure was replicated five times for three levels of t and r, for three sample sizes, for two tests.

The first was to explore the use of an inferential technique called Tukey's Jackknife in establishing a confidence interval about cooefficient alpha reliability. The second purpose was to study the robustness of the Feldt and the jackknife procedures when the data fails to satisfy usual normality assumptions. Using a linear model of test score, computer simulated data representing a matched item-examinee sample from their respective populations was employed. The two jackknife procedures, is this situation, were less conservative. For log-normal distributions of examinee score components, Feldt's procedure gave reasonable interval estimates for low values (=.60) of population alpha, but for higher values of population alpha (=.90), the  Feldt procedure was not found to be robust. The two Jackknife procedures, on the other hand, were found to be relatively robust over the entire range of investigation of values of alpha. None of the procedures was found useful in interval estimation of coefficient alpha when the distribution of examinee score components were of extreme double-exponential form. (RC)",

Of primary importance is an explicit statement of the objectives of the classroom activities, together with a specification of methods for determining progress toward these objectives. There are two aspects to a thorough evaluation paradigm: formative and summative evaluation. Formative evaluation procedures are on-line measures which provide immediate, corrective feedback to teachers and  model developers. Summative evaluation provides information about the model's effect on more generalized dimensions, and evaluation efforts today focus on this type of measure.

In particular, there has been special concern for the assumption of linearity. Debate has ranged from whether linearity referred to the functional relation of the criterion and predictor to whether it was in the context of a linear statistical model, if not both. This paper extends the Johnson-Neyman technique to the curvilinear case and then illustrates this extension by reanalyzing data from two previously published research studies which have considered only a linear  relationship between a covariable criterion.

It is postulated that insofar as prejudice can be regarded as a cognitive phenomenon, it comprises three elements: (1) perceptions of the nature and extent of group differences; (2) explanations of how such differences came about; and, (3) prescriptions for public policy and personal involvement to perpetuate, accentuate or  diminish racial inequalities. Six baxic types of explanations. referred to as explanatory modes, are identified. Three major findings are reported: (1) explanatory modes differentially predict prescriptions endorsed; (2) respondents are differentially recruited into explanatory mode categories from different segments of the social structure; and, (3) relationships between the mode positions and policy preferences are not reducible to those which exist between structural characteristics and prescriptions.

Centers were operated in six elementary and one junior high schools, each staffed by a teacher and educational assistant/associate. The program entitled Educational Assistants to Aid Underachievers, funded under Title 1 of the 1965 Elementary Secondary Education Act as part of the Optional Assignment Program, was designed to improve the reading and mathematics skills of the &quot;optional assignment&quot; students who are also economically and educationally deprived. Each of the educational assistants was, where  necessary, to work with small groups and individuals under the direction of the teachers, supervise optional assignment children on buses, aid with homework, and arouse interest in reading. At Public School 269, which was designated as a Title 1 school, remediation services were provided initially to improve the reading and mathematics skills of approximately 370 eligible pupils in grades 1-6. Several modifications were made to the program at P. S. 269 in February 1974 to service an additional 98 pupils. (Author/JM)",

In public hearings in St. Louis, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., between January 1970 and June 1971, the Commission documented the problem with the testimony of more than 150 witnesses. Further testimony was gathered by the Commission's State Advisory Committees in these cities and in Boston, Milwaukee, and Phoenix. The report concludes that despite a plethora of far-reaching remedial legislation, a dual housing market continues today in most metropolitan areas across the United States. Inadequate enforcement by Federal agencies and circumvention or, at best, lip-service adherence by local authorities, builders,  real estate agents, and others involved in the development of suburban communities have helped to perpetuate the systematic exclusion of minorities and low-income families. The result has been the growth of overwhelmingly white, largely affluent suburbs, and the concurrent deterioration of central cities, overburdened by inordinately large and constantly increasing percentages of poor and minority residents. Two of the sectors hardest hit by extensive residential segregation have been education and employment. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Education can help eliminate prejudice and form ethical attitudes. Unfortunately, education is not always such a positive force. Today, many majority youngsters leave our schools with excellent mathematics and reading skills, but with attitudes of racial bias and hatred that grossly contrast with democratic ideals. At the same time, we allow many minority youngsters to leave our schools without the quality education and meaningful skills they need. Many of these young people leave school as dropouts or pushouts, very bitter and disillusioned. There are several key factors, however, that can help majority youth assess their view toward racial and lower income minorities. These same factors may be instrumental in helping minority youth reassess their self-image, self-dignity and  essential worth. This paper focuses on: (1) the concept of neutrality or objectivity as it affects those in our society who would be advocates for social change; (2) the role of the educational environment in reshaping academic achievement; and, (3) the very significant role that teacher attitudes can play in fostering academic achievement. The initial focus is on the consequences of mideducation: Examining the forces of advocacy, environment and attitudes, we may discover ways to eliminate disillusionment and discontent. (Author/JM)",

For this study, children from 13 of the 22 poorest schools in the city of East St. Louis, Illinois, were selected. The sample comprised 43 percent of the third and sixth grade students enrolled in those schools during the 1970-71 academic year. It was found that low birth weight children are far above their proportionate share of the classes for the mentally handicapped. Birth weight does persist as a significant variable in school  achievement even in an area characterized by poor educational preparation and results. But though this relationship interest in that it does persist beyond infancy and does occur in a generally uniform (and poor) social and economic environment, academic failure cannot be accurately predicted from birth weight nor can one, from this information, predict that a child will be born at low weight. These data do not indicate that improved prenatal care might have more effect than special education programs for the poor. (Author/JM)",

Twenty male and 20 female students were randomly selected from each of three classifications of the 1970 freshmen class: regularly admitted students, educational opportunity program students, and regional service program students. The college data included such information as semester grade report averages, cumulative grade point averages, credits attempted, credits completed, number of times on probation, and number of times disqualified and reinstated. The data suggest that special program students earn lower cumulative grade point averages, more failing grades, and credits at a  slower rate than regularly admitted students. However, the results indicate that the Office of Special Programs, with its supportive services, has been fairly successful in enhancing the academic achievement of persisting special program students. In addition, the study supports the argument that the chances for success for educationally disadvantaged students are greatly increased when they are placed in a program designed to meet their academic, financial, cultural, and social needs.

These 17 separate appeals raise a host of divergent issues. The United States initiated this action on May 31, 1968, pursuant to sections of Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint charged the Board of School Commissioners for the City of Indianapolis with racial discrimination in the assignment of faculty and students. The faculty portion of the charge was resolved first. Public school teachers in Indianapolis then obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent transfers of teachers and staff without the consent  of the teachers involved. Defendant school board and its members removed the case to the federal district court, which promptly dissolved the restraining order. The student portion of the 1968 case was tried before the court on July 12-21, 1971. In accordance with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; the court found that the Indianapolis school board was deliberately operating a de jure dual school system on May 17, 1954, and had not changed its policies in order to eliminate de jure segregation on or before May 31, 1968.

This review was occasioned by two events: the proliferation of early childhood education programs in the State and the growing body of research which suggests possible adverse effects of early schooling on young children. A departmental task force was assembled to review the research and to make recommendations. The literature utilized in the review included educational research dating from the early 1930's, medical studies, and the work of developmental psychologists. Research evidence led the task force to three major conclusions. (1) Early schooling, in the form of structured, cognitive training is not warranted for the  preschool child. (2) Most children, by age 6, are emotionally and physically developed to the point that they can benefit from some form of institutionalized enrichment program. However, school programs designed for children ages 6-8 should focus on development of academic readiness skills. (3) All children, ages birth-6, benefit from exposure to a variety of environments designed to enrich the child's experiential base. However such enrichment experiences are best provided through the home. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"This paper examines the concept of equal educational opportunity (EEO) in some detail, addressing the following questions, both generally and with special reference to Alaska: Is the EEO concept valid? If so, is there sufficient basis for government intervention? If so, what types of interventions are most/least likely to be successful? What types of governmental programs are possible and which are most desirable? The basic concept initially examined is the position of the so-called &quot;environmentalist&quot; social scientists: Stripped to its bare essentials, it holds that all human beings are essentially equal at the time of conception, and that their intelligence and scholastic achievement are determined by their environments during their prenatal development and formative years  (except for cases of obvious genetic defects such as Mongolism). It is concluded that from the available evidence it seems that the EEO concept should be more applicable to Alaska than to most other states because of Alaska's high rates of social problems. Under these circumstances one would expect that the average low socioeconomic status child in Alaska would have a higher native intelligence that the average low-SES child in the country, and that compensatory education programs would therefore have a higher potential here. It is thought that much more information is needed regarding the nature of learning and the effectiveness of specific interventions with specific types of children. Much of this information could come from the careful evaluation of existing supplemental education  programs. (Author/JM)",

Sixty seven socio-economically disadvantaged Black students with reasonable potential for college work began their collegiate education by participating in a summer experimental program at the University of Missouri-Columbia. The project students were assigned into two groups--experimental (E) and control (C). Both groups enrolled in two lecture courses, but the experimental group was also assigned daily laboratory sections in each course. Half of Group E consisted of subjects with high  exposure to Whites, and half consisted of those with lower prior exposure. Findings indicated that for the total group, experimental treatment did not make a difference in so far as the number of students who dropped out, or in grade point averages earned during the summer session and fall semester. There was no effect on GPA of students with high prior exposure to Whites. However, there was a negative effect on Black females with lower prior exposure to Whites and a positive effect on Black males with low prior exposure, on GPA. (Author/JM)",

The study was carried out in a high school which serves students in the lower to middle classes, has been racially mixed for a long time, and has had some past record of racial discord. The methodologies of participant observation and interview were employed over a period of months. The study concluded that informal interracial interactions were virtually nonexistent, that formal interactions occurred only in highly structured  situations, that attempts at integration were discouraged by other forces operating within the school, and that attempts to reduce potential race conflict consumed an enormous amount of organizational energy. The concluding model suggests that bi-racialness has two effects. It creates conflicts and simultaneously prevents the creation of a consensual basis to resolve that conflict. Therefore, the organization must structure itself so as to prevent conflict, and this leads it to adopting many characteristics which might be termed \"repressive.\" (Author/JM)",

First, school officials must be able to diagnose where problems exist. Then they must learn to apply treatments systematically, to assess carefully the success or failure of the treatments applied, and last, but by no means least, to alter the treatment in accordance with the results of the assessment. No school system does all these things at present. Instead school officials are loathe to make decisions, and in those instances where decisions are made, they are even more reluctant to alter a chosen course of action based on the results of their efforts. These statements reflect three years of working  closely with a large urban school system, that of Atlanta, Georgia. The bulk of this discussion is divided into five parts. The first section sets out the assumptions which shaped our work in Atlanta. The next two sections explain the technique developed for signaling extremes of relative performance and the uses and limitations of that kind of information. The final two sections describe the impact of information about relative performance on selected activities of Atlanta administrators. (Author/JM)",

Part 1 contains a brief description of middle schools as they have developed throughout the U.S. since the beginning of this century. Part 2 reviews the history of middle schools as they have evolved in the Seattle School District. Emphasis is placed on the role that the district's mandatory and voluntary desegregation program, as well as the introduction of commercialized learning units as part of an individualized curricular approach, played in the evolution of the middle school idea in Seattle. In Part 3, the original planning toward the middle schools is described in terms of a &quot;prototype middle school model.&quot; The five areas covered by this planning document (student progress, curriculum development, staff development, and  internal and external organization) provide a conceptual framework for discussing the 1971-72 and 1972-73 middle school evaluation results. Part 4 includes the goals agreed on for evaluating middle schools during the 1971-72 school year and the results obtained from this evaluation. Part 5 follows with a discussion of the 1972-73 middle school goals agreed on for evaluation and the accompanying evaluation results. Thirteen appendixes, containing supporting data for the report, have been included. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The research reported here is an exploration of the effects of Culture Assimilator Training. A procedure emphasizing behavior with respect to hardcore unemployed blacks was utilized for the training. White male university students were randomly assigned to a trained or untrained group. After the training, subjects were placed in a situation requiring that they work with a black confederate of the experimenters on a complex performance task. Each black confederate worked with both trained and untrained subjects. The confederates did not know who were the trained subjects. They rated the subjects on a number of dimensions, thus providing us with indices of the effectiveness of the trained and untrained subjects in interpersonal relationships while doing the task. A multi-method  assessment of the dependent variables shows that the assimilator improves the attributions that the white subjects make concerning the causes of the behavior of blacks, reduces the perceived conflict between blacks and whites, and makes whites more tolerant of blacks who are dressed in a mod or hip fashion. On the other hand, there is no evidence of favorable change in the behavior of the whites. The optimal combination of assimilator training with other forms of training is discussed. (Author/JM)",

This research addresses two issues: the interaction of individual student characteristics with aspects of educational environments, and the relative educational benefits of &quot;open&quot; vs. &quot;traditional&quot; classrooms. It combines the two issues by investigating the possibility that each type of classroom has advantages for certain types of students and disadvantages for other types of students. The present project also has as a major focus the investigation of the possibility that certain cognitive and motivational characteristics of individual children may interact with these classroom dimensions to effect a combined influence on  educational outcomes. The research plan called for an initial pilot study, to be done in six classrooms, three open and three traditional, whose primary purpose would be to develop and refine instruments, measurement techniques, and analysis procedures; and a subsequent main study, to involve a much larger number of classrooms, so that measures of more specific and descriptive dimensions than &quot;open&quot; and &quot;traditional&quot; could be obtained and investigated for direct effects on educational outcomes as well as for interactions with the individual child characteristics.

        "description":"The objective of this study was to discover what has happened as a result of school desegregation. The research was guided by a major premise that the behavior of students in schools is linked to the social environment from which they derive. Hence the research encompassed the total community as a setting of the differences between blacks and whites as well as the specific neighborhoods from which students come. Contrast was provided through examining two high schools with rather different student populations and the 9th and 12th grades in each. The facts are that the school authorities are conscientiously attempting to achieve an equitable racial distribution, and in the two high schools under observation the official policy is to suppress any discriminatory practice. The  absence of serious overt tensions or concern is neither a conspiracy of silence nor a lack of a potential for racial disturbance. The apparent quiet exists because students have created a parallel system based on racial identification which effectively isolates the two groups, at least sufficiently to minimize the possibility of overt eruption, although that is an unintended consequence rather than a major explanation for the observed groupings. Furthermore, this biracial structuring is tacitly accepted by the staff in a variety of ways. (Author/JM)",

Variations in race relations among schools and among individuals are related to. (1) students' experiences outside of high school--e.g., family, grade school, and neighborhood influences; (2) students' personal characteristics; (3) characteristics of the school and of the school situation; and (4) students' perceptions of, and feelings toward, schoolmates of another race. The study was conducted in 11 schools, composed of 12 school sites (the freshman class of one school was located separately from the rest of that school). These 12 school sites varied widely in racial composition, ranging from 1  percent to almost 100 percent black students. School sites also varied in a number of other important respects, including rapidity of change in racial proportions and distribution of students in the various academic programs. Following informal interviews with students, teachers, and administrators at each school site, questionnaires were administered to a sample of students of each race at each school. For all schools, a total of about 2,000 black students completed each part of a two-part questionnaire. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"One of the most important implications for professional adult educators drawn from this review of the literature (emphasizing seven research studies which focus on the individual learner) stems from the increasing evidence that adults plan a great deal of learning for themselves without any assistance or intervention from professional adult educators. The studies indicate that an adult's learning project is a specific, personal, and individualized effort. The need of reliable subject matter resources for self-planned learning projects challenges the adult educator to increase the diversification in &quot;packaging&quot; subject matter (e.g., tapes, cassettes, single topic newsletters, television) for individual learning projects. Learners perceived, probably accurately, that group learning  did not fulfill personal goals. Current education models must change; new techniques for building learner goals into group learning activities must be explored. People engaged in self-planned learning need and want help with their learning. How will coordinating mechanisms be formed to provide the necessary counseling, resources and referrals? Future studies must focus on the major areas and issues of self-planned learning. (Author/AJ)",

The findings are based on data from 56 responding programs out of a sample of 70 selected from a population of 863 full-year Head Start programs listed in a 1971 Office of Economic Opportunities inventory. The study in its recommendations and findings tried to answer three broad questions: How much movement is there in terms of turnover and promotions?; What causal factors can be linked with the mobility patterns?; What amount of impact does turnover have upon Head Start Programs? The study was administered through the use of various questionnaires (Current Employee and Former Employee Questionnaires, Grantee Agency Project Data Questionnaire, and a  Delegate Agency Project Data Questionnaire) and subsequent followup interviews. One-fourth of the document deals with the studies, findings, and recommendations, while one-half is devoted to four appendixes on glossary terms, questionnaires and study guides used, methodology used, a review of the literature concerning employee turnover, and detailed mobility rates for each Head Start organization.

        "description":"The introductory guide and the four related consumer education curriculum modules were developed by North Dakota State University in response to the U. S. Office of Education's request for materials to help learners function in their roles as consumers. The modules are adaptable to various content areas and for use with learners of varying abilities, ages (grades 9-14, adults; including elderly), and socioeconomic/cultural backgrounds. Designed with a process approach and a spiral organization, the modules will continue to remain useful regardless of changes in products, product standards, services, legislation, and regulations. Behavioral objectives and mastery of competencies are emphasized; inquiry, valuing, decision, and action have been identified as the primary processes  for consumer competency. The introductory guide describes the development of the modules, field testing and revision, and adaptations for different groups. The included eight-page behavior inventory was developed to diagnose the level of the learner's behavior and attitudes. Approximately half of the document lists and describes the materials which the authors reviewed (curriculum guides, readings, periodicals and newsletters, evaluation guidelines, bibliographies, instructional units, learning packages, and teaching aids and materials) and offers additional sources of information.

        "description":"The collection of three documents offers a two-page summary of research conducted in 1970 and the two resulting papers. Most of the work involved the preparation and analysis of data from the Survey of Economic Opportunity. The first paper, Why is the Unemployment Rate So High at Full Employment? examines the nature of the unemployment that remains even when aggregate demand is strong. A basic theme is that the Keynesian dichotomy between frictional and involuntary unemployment is not a very useful way to look at the problem of unemployment at full employment. The main part of the paper is devoted to an empirical study of data on workers who were unemployed at some time in 1966. The implication of various alternative hypotheses about unemployment are tested. Other research  results together with subsequent research are reported in the second paper, Prospects for Shifting the Phillips Curve through Manpower Policy. The paper examines a variety of alternative manpower policies and attempts to make a quantitative appraisal of their effects on the trade off between inflation and unemployment. The paper surveys criticaly existing and proposal federal programs of all three kinds and concludes that only a relatively small shift in the Phillips Curve could be achieved through programs that are politically feasible.

Skills center staff and employment service personnel were interviewed. Questionnaires were administered to a sample of students attending classes at the time of the field review, and data were also collected from records of a sample of previous enrollees, to provide information on enrollee characteristics, completion, and placement rates. Data collected point up major findings concerning women in manpower programs. (1) Female trainees are generally being trained in the same occupation as that  of their last full-time job. (2) There is little enrollment of trainees in courses traditionally reserved for the opposite sex. (3) Manpower training for women is directed primarily toward upgrading previously acquired skills and affords few opportunities for training in alternative occupations. (4) There is evidence of stereotyping in training placement of female enrollees--by both personnel and trainees themselves. Other relative findings show lower average wages and narrower ranges of training choices for women. A four-page summary of the complete MDTA project has been included. (MW)",

The hypothesis that prisoners behave as if they were failure threatened is explored. (Author)",

The report covers the first stage of AFL-CIO efforts in dealing with this problem, bringing together concerned persons in labor and education. Following the opening of the conference by Walter G. Davis and John A. Sessions, Nat Goldfinger and Moe Frankel discuss economic literacy problems in two addresses under the heading of \"Labor and Economic Education.\" Making up a major portion of the report, \"The New York Experience\" offers an examination of three specific examples of labor activity in developing K-12 teacher resource materials in the New York City school systems. It includes excerpts of speeches by Albert  Shanker, Carl Golden, Irving Sloan, George Wessel, and Samuel Sackman. \"The Youngstown Experience\" describes that community's initiative in attempting to correct imbalances in the treatment of labor in elementary and secondary school curriculum, with speeches by Al Shipka and Marcella Crann. Concluding that objective programs and a more balanced involvement of business and labor in education are needed, specific recommendations are set forth. An appendix offering a selective book list for young adults and children concludes the report. (MW)",

IRIS systematizes the use of commercially published reading instructional materials for self-pacing, individualized, or independent learning. It consists of six modularized instructional tracks, beginning with reading readiness and progressing to the seventh grade level and above. The student is placed in an appropriate reading track where he can experience success before moving into more challenging modules of instruction. Most of the programmed instructional material is reusable and only two types of machines are required--the cassette player and the card reader. One reading  manager can manage one instructional lab accommodating approximately 15 students of varying ability levels. The system is oriented to adults, but may be used by other age groups, It can be used in most basic skill programs, particularly in conjunction with programs of adult basic education, correctional education, vocational-technical basic education, and manpower training.

The employer's contribution to the supply of women in technical and scientific occupations was perceived as the attraction and retention of women employees and communication and  interaction with educational and other institutions. Participants emphasized that the secondary schools' objectives are not and should not be limited to occupational preparation; students need to become aware of manpower projections, demographic factors, combining family/work roles, women in the labor force, and continuing education.

        "author":["Small, Hazel Christine"],
        "description":"The monograph reports the problem, design, and findings of graduate student research directly related to adult basic education teacher training. The objectives of this experiment were to assess: (1) the degree of relationship among reinforcement, learning, and self-concept for adults using computer assisted instruction (CAI); (2) changes in learner performance with changes in reinforcement schedule; and (3) the contribution of self-concept to changes in learner performance when reinforcement schedule is varied. It was concluded that the sample of adults exhibited self-concepts which were significantly lower than had been predicted. Data indicated significant differences between correlations of self-concept, treatments, and all four learner performances: (1) achievement, (2)  trials, (3) time, and (4) errors. An examination of overall CAI performance indicated that those learners with the least enabling ability required more trials but made more actual gains without regard to self-concept scores on treatment effects. Having investigated a number of variables aiding in the design of CAI materials and programs, problems for further research are suggested. A 30-page bibliography and appendix concludes the document.

Noting that the average duration of unemployment is similar for white and black males, the analytical emphasis is on the flow of new unemployment which is decomposed into turnover flows and conditional unemployment probabilities. The links between racial wage discrimination and racial unemployment differentials are also examined. The results include findings that differences in quit and layoff rates between the races are quite small, that the practice of wage discrimination or occupational segregation tends to widen racial unemployment differentials, and compensatory post-school training investments do not seem to be the main road to  racial wage equality among males. The analysis did not support the dual market view of racial wage differences. (Author)",

The first in a four-volume series, this Project Baseline report is mostly devoted to specific tables on vocational enrollment statistics; student-teacher ratios; enrollment by age and percent of population; enrollment by occupational area; the rank order of individual States by minority group, sex, Federal program area, and other limiting enrollment factors; expenditures for vocational education by Federal, State, and local  levels per student for secondary, postsecondary, and adult education; and percentage increases in Federal expenditures. This State-by-State presentation also treats strengths and weaknesses, research and change, and new developments affecting vocational education, and offers recommendations.

Total employment posted the greatest percentage increase since 1955, with adult men and women each gaining about 1.1 million jobs; the number of jobless dropped to 4.3 million, as the unemployment rate declined. As the year came to a close, however, the emerging energy shortage began to affect employment policies of firms. The extent to which joblessness might rise and employment and hours might fall in the months ahead could not be determined, but consumption patterns of households, business, and government were being altered and it was obvious that some economic disorder would occur.  Thirty-three pages of tables of statistical data supplement the text. (Author/AJ)",

The data were obtained from questionnaires sent to all vocational agriculture instructors responsible for adult instruction in a three-State area. The cooperation of others is measured and analyzed in four different program areas: enterprise events, agriculture mechanics farm management, and special events. Cooperators in these areas and their functions are illustrated in bar graphs; evaluation of cooperation of agencies in the four  categories are presented tabularly. It is concluded that there is wide diversity in the amount of cooperation received from among potential cooperating groups, the principle cooperating groups being industry representatives, private businessmen, county agents, and other agricultural teachers. Generally, the teachers find the cooperation of others valuable and rely heavily upon others to assist in planning, organizing and coordinating but not in evaluation. University specialists are not used in any significant degree. (AJ)",

        "description":"After giving an overview of the private retirement system and considering deferred wages and labor costs, the study explores the extent of the influence of private pensions on early retirement and on job opportunities of older persons, and the influence of lengthy job tenure requirements on worker mobility. The study weakens the case for across-the-board increases in social security benefits based on old formulas for computing base level benefits by which social security will become an increasingly inefficient instrument for putting money in the hands of the poor or near-poor aged. The fact that a large share of workers are likely to remain uncovered by private pensions strengthens the case for splitting social security's pension function from its antipoverty function. Present  formulas attempt to provide the most generous treatment to those who contributed least; as private pensions grow, this policy may yield increasingly haphazard results. Finally, some of the findings demonstrate how unfair the social security retirement test is, making difficult the attempt of the aged worker without a private pension to use earnings to supplement his social security benefits.

Section 4 discusses the four major sources of unnecessarily high unemployment among adult workers and specific policies are suggested. Section 5 deals with the particular problem of improving the incentive effects of unemployment compensation. A brief summary section is followed  by critical comments on the innovative and controversial policy suggestions offered in the study; five economists and statisticians with expertise in the area of employment and unemployment analysis were invited by the committee to comment.

Traditionally, simulators have been less important for training than have aircraft, but they are currently emerging as primary pilot training vehicles. This new emphasis is an outgrowth of systems engineering of flight training programs, and a characteristic of the resultant training is the employment of techniques developed through applied research in a variety of training settings. These techniques include functional context training, minimizing over-training, effective utilization of personnel, use of incentive awards, peer training, and objective performance measurement. Programs employing these and other  techniques, with training equipment ranging from highly-realistic simulators to reduced-scale paper mockups, have resulted in impressive transfer of training. The conclusion is drawn that a proper training program is essential to realizing the potential training value of a device, regardless of its realism. (Author)",

The course provides the opportunity for the fashion design student to work with half scale basic patterns used for making garments. The student learns by the flat pattern principles how to alter the basic pattern in order to achieve a new garment design. Experiences in designing a variety of necklines, sleeves, bodices, skirts, and waistlines will be provided. Although the development of the ability to make patterns is the primary purpose of the course, it will also give the student a better understanding of pattern alteration, garment fitting, and use of fabric grain.

A study manual containing relevant readings, study objectives, and self-tests was prepared. Diagnostic exams were developed and used to evaluate the achievement of a class of drill sergeant candidates who used the manual in their pre-school study program. Results showed that men using the manual demonstrated only slightly higher learning than those who did not use it. Failure to study may be the cause, which suggests that low motivation may be a problem. The report suggests allowing the men more time for monitored study, establishing a minimum qualifying score for entry to the school, and using the diagnostic exams to screen  potential candidates.

The project concentrated on the allied health fields, establishing a two-phase work program of data gathering and project implementation. Twelve cooperative goals were established and methods and procedures determined. Major areas of concern were: (1) utilization and attrition, (2) hospital training programs, (3) college level education programs, and (4) counseling and recruitment. Two major  barriers to effective planning were a need for further cooperation between health care facilities and academic institutions, and educating the community to the opportunities in the health fields. Two conferences addressed these problems, and 10 recommendations for further cooperative planning were outlined. Four new programs growing out of this project are described to demonstrate the need for a coordinating agency in a comprehensive health care delivery system. An 80-page appendix offers survey instruments and five project working papers. (JC)",

A structured, intensive analysis of the data obtained in a series of in-depth interviews with key individuals in professional associations and registry groups, and others with a potential interest, focused on organizational factors and certification practices to clarify the potential values and problems of a national  system; possible alternative approaches were defined, and a series of feedback seminars held. The major conclusion is that a system, national in scope and based on voluntary collaboration of certifying bodies, is feasible. Four acceptable alternatives exist among the various courses open to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. To implement the recommendations made by the study, governmental support of a small interim secretariat is suggested. (AJ)",

The wide variation in driver education costs--from $49 to $362 per pupil--is attributable to the method and approach used to teach the course. Driver education taught using the dual control method during the regular school day cost an average of $162 per pupil. The same course taught at a time other than during the regular school day cost an average of $93, making the regular school day program  $69 or 74 percent more costly. Costs could be greatly reduced by scheduling driver education programs before or after the regular school day, on Saturdays, or as a summer program, and contracting with a commercial driving school for the laboratory portion.

Using the operational definition of sex bias as any factor that may influence a person to limit career opportunities solely on the basis of gender, these areas are explored and the following recommendations, among others, made: Interest inventories should not have separate forms of the instrument for males and females, and the same set of items should be used for both, with care that an item is  not inherently more applicable to one gender than the other; in the development of externally based scales, every effort should be made to collect adequate samples of males and females for each occupation represented on the inventory's reporting of results; and caution should be exercised against differentially including items that represent non-valid sex differences.

Such analysis was done within the framework of six categories: interactive dialogue, data files, the computer program, on and off-line interest inventories, audio-visual support materials, and printed support materials. Relatively little was found which indicates serious sex bias. The descriptive content of the data files seems to have high potential for problems. The degree of sex bias or fairness which interest inventories have will have serious implications for the scope of a student's vocational exploration in systems which make use of such instruments to suggest or guide exploration. Supporting visual materials or community visitation  programs can also be a source of subtle sex bias. (Author)",

Much data is presented portraying the black woman as more likely to enter the labor force, more interested in doing so, more likely to work full time and continuously, and more necessary to the financial welfare of her family than her white counterpart. It is equally true that black women choose occupations traditional for women, are motivated perhaps more by a sense of responsibility than by achievement need, are much more traditional in their sex-role attitudes; thus, concern for the occupational options of white women can be no less directed towards them than towards any other women. An examination is presented  of some of the technical aspects of the problem of preparing assessment instruments for minority group examinees in order to emphasize the need for further work in this area. The basic contention is that there may be a discontinuity or mis-match between the interest structures developed from the background of minority females and those possessed by the criterion groups used to validate an interest scale.

        "description":"The paper surveys the costs of interest-inventory revision and concludes that, ultimately, the elimination of sex bias in career interest inventories will depend on project funding. After the issues of criterion sample, item pool, instructional orientation, interpretation, and legality have been settled, researchers and publishers will have the guidelines necessary for removing, or at least minimizing, sex bias in the use and interpretation of interest inventories. Then attention must focus on the issue of finances. Funding must include a yearly $75,000 to $80,000 allowance for personnel. Construction of one empirical occupational scale costs $1,900 to $2,000, complete revision of an interest inventory costs a minimum of $270,000, with publishing expense bringing the total to  $385,000. Three years is the absolute minimum estimate for a complete revision. Financial support for researchers must increase. Possible funding sources include publishers, universities, and scoring services; Federal government; professional organizations; and special interest groups. (Author/AJ)",

No test case has included or noted interest measurement instruments; employing the method of \"doctrine of analogy,\" however, inferences regarding the legal issues have been drawn. To the extent that interest inventories support stereotypic sex and occupational linkages or restrictions, the tests are biased; should a sex-biased instrument discourage an applicant from educational or employment opportunity, or be used in a negative  decision in the case of the applicant because of differentiating scales or inappropriate sex-based normative data, then it would appear that the spirit of the law was denied. Two remedies seem clearly indicated: (1) revision, with greater specificity regarding the use of interest tests and the applicant's stake in the decision-making process, of extant guidelines supporting law, and greater specificity within guidelines to be developed to support Title IX of the Education Amendments; (2) the development of future laws should definitively state the dimensions of concern.

        "description":"Research related to the issues of sexual bias in the use of interest inventories is reviewed, particularly from the client's view of the career exploration process. Since counselors refer to manuals and interpretive materials to obtain norming information and guidelines for score interpretation, these sources are examined and found to contain both explicit suggestions and subtle implications which, if followed by the counselor, could have deleterious effects on their women clientele. Recommended changes for manuals and interpretive materials are aimed at maximizing the counselor's effective use of interest inventories on the client's behalf. It is a complex issue, since other factors interact with interest inventory results; corrective interventions suggested include: (1) alter  prevocational experiences to maximize the range of interests and aspirations; (2) examine the development of interests, particularly women's vocational goals; (3) provide counselors with an awareness of sex roles and strategies to counter stereotypes, through workshops; and (4) revise interest measures. High priority is given to the immediate revision of inventory manuals. (Author/AJ)",

A careful scrutiny revealed no empirical data to evaluate the hypothesis that the linguistic structure of items does or does not influence results on career interest inventories. Conclusions drawn from other fields (applied sociolinguistics, social psychology, clinical psychology) strongly support the need for the linguistic aspect of inventories to be examined via a series of studies. The American Psychological Association and National Vocational Guidance Association guidelines for the construction of tests and for career information materials also support the need  for such a series of studies in the interest of insuring unbiased tests.

An examination of the re-entry woman deals with socialization and self-concept, changing attitudes, and new expectations. Bias against women among the professionals to whom they turn for aid is documented, and the potential danger of placing a sex-fair interest inventory in the hands of a sex-biased counselor is pointed out. New concepts concerning the re-entry woman as student, in the work force, as family member, and as achiever are cited and recommended to counselors interpreting interest inventories. The discrimination against women desiring training for a second career is  discussed. The paper examines selected material from various inventories as examples that are seen to affect the usefulness of an interest inventory in relation to the reentering woman. Language, items, instructions, and interpretive materials are discussed, and recommendations are made for each area, as well as for counselor education and for research. (AJ)",

        "description":"Men and women are not now similar in all their likes and dislikes, but it is an unanswered question as to which of those dissimilarities are directly related to job satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Basically, the sex difference problem raises an issue which is emphasized throughout the paper: that the goal of interest measurement is to predict job satisfaction because the methodology and validation of interest measurement are only indirectly related to that goal. New problems for interest measurement--the question of applicability to women of approaches based on men, and the questions raised by the current dramatic break in the socialization process of women--are examined in terms of the two types of interest measurement surveyed, one of which relies on stable socialization and  is heavily tied to the past; the other does not take into account the experiential effect on interests. The contemporary view of career guidance emphasizes continuing exploration of career and self, and appropriate use of interest inventories with women may lead to focused exploration in totally new areas. Interest inventories should no longer be merely reported, they should change behavior. (Author/AJ)",

An overview is given of interest measurement techniques: in selecting a pool of items, developing scales, and norming the scales. The issues raised at each step are surveyed. Interpretive practices are briefly discussed. Suggestions are offered for minimizing sex bias at each of the three major technical steps in developing a new interest inventory, and for its interpretation. Twelve specific guidelines are presented in summary, including these: The content of interest inventory items should not imply that any occupation or activity is more  appropriate for one sex than for the other; scores on the same scales should be available for both men and women; norm groups for occupational scales should contain men and women in equal proportions or the effects of both groups should be statistically equalized; published interpretive materials should indicate clearly that sex norms for homogeneous scales do not imply anything about the predictive validity of the scales.

Four types of computer-involved guidance systems were in use in 1970: indirect inquiry systems, direct inquiry systems without system monitoring, direct inquiry with system monitoring, and direct inquiry with system and personal monitoring. Of the 25 to 30 systems existing then, only five remain. They are direct inquiry systems, and all but one are directed to secondary school students. They are cost feasible, use standard terminal equipment, and specialize in providing career decision making information, retrieval, sorting, and synthesis. DISCOVER is the newest computer-based guidance system under development in the  United States. It differs from other systems in objectives, functions, and population. Further developments in the field are anticipated involving self-initiated, self-directing, self-correcting learning, based on the theory that only each man can help himself. (AG)",

Two major manpower training objectives are used for the basis of the report: to provide education, supportive services, and training opportunities for unemployed and underemployed individuals and to provide education and training to update the skills of individuals which have been made obsolete by automation or other technological development, foreign competition, relocations of industry, and shifts in labor market demands. The report covers institutional manpower training activities funded, developed, and supervised by the State Education Department's Manpower Bureaus. The report identifies major program goals, describes steps taken to achieve the  stated objectives in both statistical and narrative forms, and presents recommendations for improvement of the programs reported. Six appendixes are included, one of which is a 100-page collection of tables listing projects approved and accompanying data. (Author/AG)",

        "description":"This study was designed to determine the relative impact of dichotomized task performance data compared to percent time-spent estimates for those members performing each task on the group job descriptions determined through application of the Comprehensive set of Occupational Data Analysis Programs (CODAP). Using groups identified by a routine application of the CODAP system, the percent members performing vector was found to correlate in the mid to high 90's with the percent time spent by a total group vector or group job description. These findings suggest that in groups of five or more individuals, dichotomized task performance data, which has previously been shown to have high reliability and validity, is the most critical component in the resultant group job description.  Further possible time-spent inaccuracies in individual job descriptions would not be expected to cause major changes in the group job description since its unique contribution accounts for effectively less than 10 percent of the total variance. These results are consistent across different sized groups of varying homogeneity. This report will be of interest only to those agencies engaged in occupational data analyses employing the CODAP system. (Author)",

Comparisons were made between surveys conducted in 1972 and 1973. It was found that the Air Force and the Navy ROTC scholarship programs were the most popular with the youth surveyed. Higher likelihood of applying was found among youths from low income families. Travel, adventure and the opportunity for technical and professional training were strong motivators in applying for officer training programs. Prominent among the specific reasons for affiliating with military programs were: being able to attend the college of one's choice; getting tuition paid; and the term of obligated service. There was very little awareness of officer compensation and the  service sponsorship of the various programs offered. (Author)",

Most of the data were collected from the Employment Security Automated Reporting System at the Washington Office of the Manpower Administration. Counseling, referral to a nonagricultural job, and job placement were the three major service areas selected for analysis. The data relating type of service and age of ES applicant revealed, with few exceptions, that the proportion of the age group receiving a particular service consistently declined as age increased. Differences are shown among States in the services provided to ES applicants and to middleaged and older applicants in particular. It is the concern of the National Council on the Aging, not  that middleaged and older workers be given special treatment, but that they receive as much attention as younger persons. An analysis of service plans of States with high rankings on services to the 40-plus applicant may provide more insights into equitable service delivery. Another concern raised is whether the recent thrust of Federal efforts to eliminate all categorical manpower/employment programs will present further employment obstacles for the over-40 worker.

The report concludes that theoretically sound progression models can be designed but that implementation of anything other than training and counseling calls for a different state of &quot;readiness&quot; than that found in the two plants. Most probably, the report states, this can only be achieved if the top corporate and International Union officials, jointly, work with plant and local union officials to change seniority clauses in the collective bargaining agreement and plant customary  practice. The rationale for the work described in the report was that the design and introduction of career progression systems within a major multi-plant manufacturing corporation would provide high visibility for a successful project, providing insight into transferability of career progression designs from plant to plant and deal with problems fundamental to the effective utilization of the labor force in the United States.

Adoption of more rational systems was perceived to be a long term objective. The report describes the design of career progression systems for three segments of the industry: Institutional Food Service, Commercial Restaurants, and Hotel Foodservice. However, given the historical attitudes of the industry toward its manpower, the short-term return of one-step upgrading and related training is apparently  much more acceptable to management.

It seeks to develop new options for upgrading workers in four occupations: addiction services, child development, occupational therapy, and teaching. The policies and practices of educational institutions, employers, unions, professional associations, credentialling bodies, et al., which hinder upgrading of lowlevel employees, are investigated and, where possible, altered. The major thrusts are to make credentials more relevant to job duties; give greater credit for work and life experience; foster mobility among human service occupations; and make it possible for paraprofessionals to obtain education and training while fully employed.

The goal of the statewide residency study was to develop a strategy for the design and allocation of physician residencies consistent with statewide needs. A graphic model of the physician manpower production process was developed which enhanced understanding of the manpower problems facing Louisiana. Through the model, available data, and personal interviews with senior medical students and postgraduate trainees, data were compiled and analyzed regarding the need for physicians in Louisiana in 1982, where and how the number of physicians can  be increased, the status of primary care treatment, likely sites for practicing physicians, and related concerns. The general conclusions point to several significant manpower production problems in Louisiana in its preparation for future needs for physician services. The study committee proposed several recommendations to meet the problem. (Appendixes contain supplementary tables and interview forms.) (AG)",

The research focused on the Special Projects Program authorized under section 309(b) of the Adult Education Act of 1966. The document contains: (1) a few key observations of the role of the U. S. Office of Education, explaining some of the hisotrical factors that have contributed to problems of 309(b) dissemination; (2) analyses of a selected sample of projects to understand how they function and to look at what is disseminated, to  whom, in what ways, and with what success, emphasizing factors that seem to facilitate or inhibit successful dissemination of project outcomes; and (3) discussion of the characteristics of local ABE programs associated with innovativeness generally and with 309(b) adoption in particular. Nine recommendations based on the research findings are presented and a model innovation-dissemination network described. (AJ)",

Much of the officer's job will depend on his ability to make decisions and to avoid the mistakes and disproven beliefs of the past. The course material includes discussions of mistakes which other men and women have made on the job; this anecdotal background material was supplied by Federal Jail Inspectors. This sixth book of the course discusses a number of special prisoners, those whose physical disabilities or mental condition require special treatment and care while they are in jail and the ways in which the jail officer  can effectively recognize and handle these people.

The paper is actually a case study of one of 20 communities that have been involved with a training program within U.S.O.E., Region VI Drug Education Effort, \"Help Communities Help Themselves.\" The program involves a small group of people from the community attending a 2-week training session in which the trainees explored the various aspects of drug use and abuse and developed team skills to take back to their community. The vehicle for action after their return was the Parents  Are Responsible Program--an adult education program that offers a survey of the contemporary drug scene and is designed to help parents develop a personal perspective on the complexities of the drug problem. The paper describes reactions of the team members to the training sessions and their efforts in bringing their new expertise to their community. (Author/HMV)",

The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of the technical problems involved in construction, scoring, and interpretation of interest measures as related to sex differences and to suggest guidelines within these technical issues which will help eliminate any factors that may influence a person to limit--or cause others to limit--his or her consideration of career solely on the basis of gender. The technical issues revolve around sex differences in item responses, appropriate composition by sex of criterion, reference, or norm groups, what to do about occupations involving primarily one sex, and interpretive and explanatory materials related to the above. Operational  guidelines are provided on suitable technical procedures for different types of interest inventory scales as well as helpful interim procedures for use when changes in current procedures require a long period of time for implementation.

These effects were determined, in part, by an analysis of the woman's concept of self, the external support given, and the various coping mechanisms utilized in the pre- and post- abortal phases. Age, race, marital status, education, occupation, income and number of children were found to influence women's general attitude towards abortion and their pre- and postabortal behavior. Postabortal emotions reflected feelings of relief and happiness in most women studied. Recommendations were made that the health disciplines improve the orientation of patients regarding abortion procedures and hospital  routine, and also extend postabortal services by teaching contraceptive use and importance.

The program consists of 12 numbered cards on each of which is written a short descriptive statement of an issue related to the topic of sex roles. A student takes case #1 and reads it aloud to the group, then reacts to the issue raised. Once that student has finished, the other participants are invited to join in a discussion of the issue. The purpose of this group activity is to raise the awareness of both girls and boys to the issue of early sex-role stereotyping in our society.

The workshops attempted to counteract insularity in current counselor education programs (textbooks and tape recorded interviews) by providing new and more potent methods for counseling disadvantaged students. The training sessions used videotaped stimulus vignettes, small group interaction exercises, and Interpersonal Process Recall demonstrations and recall sessions. The trainees were 12 masters degree candidates in Counselor Education at New York University; simultaneously, they were employed as counselors and teachers in &quot;inner city&quot; schools in New York City. The stimulus materials were videotaped by the workshop leader, and situations  used in training were directly relevant to the trainees' ongoing needs and experiences in their work settings. Workshop sessions consisted of small group participation in structural exercises, which were videotaped, and large group discussions. Trainees viewed 12 threatening and immediate stimulus vignettes during which they were videotaped; small group interactions and total group discussions were also videotaped and played back, and IPR was used as a continuing vehicle for counselor supervision throughout the workshop series. Results of the workshop were rated as positive by the trainees. (Author)",

Generalizations made on the basis of such a restricted sample are considered tentative and should be interpreted with caution. These generalizations are: (1) students tend to view the counselor as helpful in educational or vocational planning more than personal concerns; (2) students tend to view improving themselves, as opposed to getting  into college or job training, as the most important reason for being in school; (3) there is a discrepancy between the kinds of services which students think they need and the kinds of services they will accept from their counselors.

While it is common procedure for state agencies to purchase private psychological services, the criteria governing service contracts, standards, and fees vary considerably. The survey data revealed that state agencies vary with regard to standards and methods of selection, qualification, and performance of psychologists. Information regarding the numbers of clients and psychologists involved, and the total amount of  monies spent for psychological consultant services was obtained from approximately one-third of the responding states and was found to vary widely from state to state. It is likely that some of the influencing factors accounting for the large discrepancies are the size of the state agency, the rehabilitation case loads, the availability of public and private psychologists, and interagency cooperativeness.

The results of the long term study were statistically significant in support of several base hypotheses developed  by the authors in previous research. Lessons in the short term study produced highly significant increments between pre-and posttests of achievement, but few differences were found for the diverse reward effects.

Seven hypotheses were formulated as well as a questionnaire designed to test these hypotheses. General findings from the study showed that 43 percent of the women gave career salient responses and that the greater proportion of these women were from urban backgrounds. Four-fifths of the career salient women said that their mothers were satisfied with the role  of homemaker, and two-thirds of the mothers of these women who were employed had positive feelings about their employment.

        "description":"This report presents the rationale, methods, and results of research that was planned to develop a way of identifying relatively effective children. The report contains the conceptual bases and development of the Hypothetical Situation Questionnaire (HSQ) as the means for distinguishing effective children. The HSQ contains three subscales that measure social orientation, task orientation, and self-assurance. These subscales were combined to yield profiles identifying children who were: (1) effectively responsive in situations to both social and task components; (2) primarily task oriented and effective or ineffective; and (3) primarily socially oriented and effective or ineffective. Experiments using the HSQ indicated that the instrument could differentiate types and levels of  effectiveness among children. Identifications of subject variables and their specific interactions with situational variables permitted reliable predictions of the behavior patterns of the children. (Author/PC)",

They are designed to help trainees to: (1) understand contributions and life styles of various racial, cultural, and economic groups in our society; (2) recognize and deal with dehumanizing biases, discrimination, and prejudice; (3) create learning environments which contribute to the self esteem of all persons and to positive interpersonal relations; and (4) respect human diversity and personal rights. This document offers an hour-by-hour description of the program which incorporates the guidelines into a single, reasonably cohesive package.

        "description":"In Denmark a large and complex group of social, legal, educational, health, and financial services are available to all women who are pregnant and/or have children under 2 years of age. These services are the subject of two joint reports. The first report describes the history, organization, and administration of the program and the services for pregnant women. Through the nationally organized Mothers Help centers, almost half of all women in Denmark come into contact with and receive help from the centers during their pregnancies. Services provided include maternity allowances, counseling services, educational programs, and abortion counseling. Special services are provided for single parents in the form of: (1) legal aid in connection with affiliation proceedings against the  child's father; (2) extensive counseling on whether or not to interrupt the pregnancy; and (3) special maternity homes for single pregnant women. A second report describes services for women with children under 2 years of age and concludes with an analysis of the problems and future of the program. In brief, services offered mothers with children under age 2 include: (1) family planning services; (2) domestic assistance; (3) housing, financial assistance, and educational programs for single mothers; and (4) children's allowances. The authors describes some implications of these extensive health services for the United States in terms of providing for the health and well-being of pregnant women--particularity young, unwed women.

Through controlled thought and perception, he is helped to channel his anxiety into growth by employing the perceptual senses to redirect energy away from the need to defend, and by the interaction of the audiovisual, verbal, and kinesthetic methods which reinforce each other to \"let in\" environment. This therapeutic approach separates and concretely defines one's feelings from one's perceptions about what is actually occurring. Working on the concrete level aids one in clarifying, verifying, and establishing communication, and ultimately breaks down the neurotic reaction by separating feelings from  fact. Once the patient has learned the concrete phase, he is helped to work on the abstract level, or feeling stage. (Author/PC)",

The study, using the North Carolina correctional system as an indicator of fair and equal justice, as manifested by our judicial ideals, shows that this is not the case. Direct relationships seem to exist regarding class, race, and sex in that there is a greater chance for lower classes, racial minorities, and male offenders to be prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated than is the case for other offenders. While whites account for the majority of felony arrests, blacks are the ones who are adjudicated most harshly, accounting for the majority of incarcerations. Although females, in general,  are subjected to reverse judicial discrimination, those adjudicated represent the same discriminatory patterns found among their male counterparts regarding class and race. Justice is viewed by the author as being relative in that it is defined not according to some rational, ideal standard but in line with the power elite's own value system, one that often is used to perpetuate the power differential between itself and perceived threatening outgroups in the society.

This realistic yet imaginative residential program is described from its inception in 1972 to the present date, and includes conversations with staff, public officials and runaways  themselves.

The analysis concentrates on three major issues: (1) the relation of traditional \"situational\" variables (career phase and group contact) to inmate perspectives, (2) the relative impact of situational versus \"imported\" characteristics on inmate perspectives, and (3) the relevance of labeling theory notions of retributive justice to prisonization research. In general, it was found that the patterns involving career phase and group contact were similar to those typically found among males and similar to the  most recent analysis among females. Moreover, of all situational variables examined the traditional situational variables were the most strongly related to inmate perspectives. On the other hand, the background variables, age and felony status, were more strongly related than situational variables. Finally, career phase and group contact were more strongly related in some categories of inmates than in others and the pattern of \"interaction\" found seems to have been anticipated by labeling theorists. This latter set of findings suggests that prisonization models might be \"specified\" by drawing on notions of retributive justice. (Author)",

Control variables included geographical area, grade in high school, and socioeconomic class. Race-by-sex interactions were largest when socioeconomic class was controlled, and were highly related to the size of the main effect of sex as well. White boys and girls differed more than black boys and girls regardless of whether the overall sex differences favored males or females. Sex-by-grade and, to a lesser extent, sex-by-area interactions were also moderately large and consistent with the size of the sex main effect. Because there were no consistent relationships with other main effects, and because the measures producing  sex differences also tended to produce the interactions, it was concluded that sex differences and the interactions with sex share the same causes.

Seeking to assess the impact of these programs, the state provided money to cover the cost of this comprehensive, year-long survey of both methadone maintenance and drug-free treatment projects. The findings generally supported the New Jersey State Law Enforcement Planning Agency's funding policies and commitments toward drug treatment, but the study also contained some revelations. It challenged some traditional views about treatment and suggested that certain program changes could result in more effective treatment. Of major significance was the general conclusion that drug program effectiveness could be measured; also that both major methods of treatment were helping to  reduce crime while helping addicts and ex-addicts to lead lives without crime. Neither method was found to be more effective than the other.

The process itself is a decision-making strategy that can be learned for creative career development by individuals of any age group. The Kansas Model may be applied to all learners because they can enter the process wherever they are, at any stage in their own development. Individuals may exit and recycle, if necessary, because they are taught the use of the process as a decision-making paradigm, and they learn to assess their progress toward the outcome action.

Counselors who were rated high by their counselees on interpersonal characteristics tended to be assertive, happy-go-lucky, venturesome, suspicious (hard to fool), and self-sufficient.

Honest self-appraisal and development are viewed as prerequisites to the development of helping relationships with others. Typically, counselors are trained to model behavior in isolation, to emphasize therapy rather than prevention, to function in an environment separate from that of their clients, and to operate without understanding the goals of the institution. The counselor emulates behavior which may prevent him from identifying himself; and he often counsels in a setting where interaction is restricted. For effective counseling, the author outlines the following conditions: (1) counselors must counsel in the client's world; (2) they  must counsel within the framework of the institutions which utilize their services; (3) counselors must perceive of themselves as educators; (4) areas in which they can be effective leaders must be defined and then entered; (5) they must define roles and priorities consistent with their personalities; (6) they have to learn how to help their clients understand the moral issues involved if realistic decisions are to result; and (7) counselors need to work in learning systems where interactive behavior permits personal and professional growth.

        "description":"It is postulated that the standard framework for psychotherapy, a cooperative transference neurosis, does not validly carry over to the successful psychotherapy of a two-generation family group. In many disturbed families, the necessary and sufficient dynamics for change must be initiated, controlled, and augmented by a group dynamic power-play, precipitated by the psychotherapist. Indeed the therapist, or the therapeutic team, would be wise to regard the beginning of psychotherapy as a political process quite similar to that in the opening phase of a chess game. There is evidence that dominating the center of action, protecting the king at all costs, saving the all-powerful queen until mid-game, and positioning the group members to protect each other, are part of a valuable  metaphor for understanding the success and failure of family psychotherapy.

It does not attempt to address all aspects of knowledge, and deliberately bypasses those areas in which new information may be developing but has not yet reached a sufficiently reportable level. This report offers: (1) an authoritative guide to understanding what scientists and scholars are currently studying and reporting, (2) a picture of current realities, and (3) a basis for thinking about problems related to alcohol and their possible solution. This publication is not an authoritative guide for solving moral issues which belong in the realm of personal decision. Emphasis is  given to the important and expanding role of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and its progress toward \"programs for people.\" The legislative mandate for the states to produce a working, viable plan for the provision of alcoholism services has now been implemented in every state of the union, and this mandate is viewed as the most significant progress made in recent years to provide effective, quality treatment to every alcoholic person who needs it.

The evaluations of marijuana and LSD experiences reported in 1968 were very similar to those at California Institute of Technology in 1967. Evaluations varied by drug, but were predominantly &quot;beneficial and helpful&quot; (marijuana, hallucinogens, tranquilizers/barbiturates), or &quot;no particular effect&quot; (amphetamines, beer, liquor, tobacco, narcotics). In the class of 1972, evaluations were positively related to number of usage experiences, and remained steady over time for all drugs except hallucinogens; these were seen less positively in later surveys. More negative experiences resulted from hallucinogen use than from any other drug. Statements about drug effects  were evaluated by the subjects in terms of their own experiences and expectations and those of their peers. Counselors and educators should be aware that most drug-related experiences are viewed by students as either beneficial or neutral. (Author/PC)",

In short, the author suggests that the solutions to problems are not independent of how they are perceived, and one may learn more about alcohol problems by not focusing on them per se, but on how care workers think about them. Issues under examination include: (1) organizational self-preservation; (2) the physical setting and environment  as a significant impact on an organizations' processing of its clientele; (3) the displacement of goals by an organization; (4) the biases of health care providers; (5) social stratification variables as they affect one's perception of problems; and (6) the effect of suggestion, label, variability, and labeler on the deviance-defining process.

It focuses on the immediate and practical concern of identifying those antecedent variables which, because of their close association with success in chemistry, could be used to predict success. Multiple regression analysis determined that the most satisfactory predictors of chemistry grades were measures of mathematical ability, previous study of chemistry, and overall academic achievement. A regression equation was developed which could be used to identify individual students who might, because of inadequate preparation, benefit from tutoring or an alternative course sequence. Suggestions for program development included a cooperative effort toward reducing the likelihood of failure  experiences for students through programs which foster cognitive and affective competencies. For those students who do not succeed, colleges should be prepared to offer academic, career, and personal counseling to assist them in evaluating their situation and in choosing wisely among available alternatives.

To identify sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, eight Navy ratings (occupational career fields) were analyzed. Individuals in each of the ratings were required to respond, on a one-to-five continuum, to statements associated with 33 job factors. Review of these ratings indicated that, although individuals were provided with the opportunity to assume responsibility in carrying out assigned duties to completion, they were dissatisfied by an apparent lack of sufficient recognition for their efforts. In addition, they were dissatisfied in their perception of the way in which the  military system operates. In a separate study conducted to determine the relationship between job satisfaction and reenlistment, equal satisfaction was found for both first-term and career force personnel who stated that they planned to reenlist. Satisfaction factors apparently play a much greater role for first-term personnel than for career personnel. (Author/PC)",

It was hypothesized that, in comparison with Indian children, the non-Indian children would show significantly superior performance on objective tests of cognitive clarity in learning to read. The subjects consisted of kindergarten children from two school districts. In District 1 all the Indian boys and girls were tested and compared with a sample of non-Indian boys and girls selected by random procedures. In District 2 the same sampling procedure was followed. Five subtests of the Canadian Reading Readiness battery were administered to the subjects. This test is experimental and contains the following  subtests: orientation to literacy, understanding literacy behavior, technical language of literacy, visual letter recognition and letter-name knowledge, and initial phonemes. The results supported the hypothesis derived from the Cognitive Clarity Theory of learning to read. The Indian children were significantly less able to recognize the acts of reading and writing, their ability to recognize and name letters was significantly poorer, and their concepts of word and letter were significantly less than those of the non-Indian children.

(2) Reading is usually a silent activity, and there are very few outward signs of what the behavior involves. (3) Children do not know the basic concepts involved in thinking about the tasks of reading and writing. (4) Under reasonably good conditions the child works himself out of the initial state of cognitive confusion into increasing cognitive clarity about the purpose and nature of the skills of literacy. (5) Although the initial stage of literacy acquisition is the most vital one, cognitive clarity continues to develop throughout the later stages of education as new abstract concepts of language are added to the student's  undertaking. In a model of the cognitive process of the literacy learner, the learner is assailed simultaneously by three voices: linguistic stimuli, the voice of the school culture, and extraneous stimuli. Applying this model to the data from the Comparative Reading Project, it becomes clear that there are many hazards in the child's linguistic and educational environments which may cumulatively cause the total level of cognitive confusion to become intolerable.

This does not imply that nothing of importance has been accomplished, but does indicate that communication barriers exist. One major impediment to progress is the lack of understanding by classroom teachers as to what research is all about. Another difficulty is devising ways to effectively bridge the communication gap so that the findings of research may be formulated into practical classroom methods and materials. If research is to have a more direct impact in the classroom, teachers should be asked where they think the focus should be in the next ten years. Much of this future research will have to be conducted in the schools with real students if it is to have  value. The schools, classroom teachers, and researchers must work together to develop appropriate strategies to implement research which will be valid as well as useful for students. (TO)",

A chi-square test for independent samples was used for each of the variables. The results indicated that there was no significant increase in the number of nonfiction books read as the grade increased, but that an average of one-fifth of the books read by each grade was nonfiction. Reading ability was also shown to have no effect on the books read by boys and that read by girls. (WR)",

To determine modality preference, reading and listening scores were compared for the highest and lowest thirds in reading and again for the highest and lowest thirds in intelligence. The most dramatic difference between reading and listening was found when the reading and listening scores were compared for the lowest third in reading ability and the lowest third in intelligence. In both cases, subjects scored  significantly higher on the listening comprehension test. In the highest thirds in intelligence and reading ability, no significant difference was found between modalities.

The graphic cues or structural meaning works as a system the description of which can be outlined in three parts as the vocabulary, the structure, and the sound. What has been neglected in the area of vacabulary is the concept that words alone do not carry precise meaning until they are placed in the structural and intonational system of the English language. An individual's sense of structure gives the written work meaning or determines how it means in contrast to what it means. Intonation functions as a controller of meaning. Generally speaking, the structural and intonational signals are not new. What is new is  that this description of how meaning is structured is linked to the language that the child already knows intuitively so that the whole system can be taught without technical terminology at an early age and as the child is learning to read. What is also new is that this knowledge of the signals is not isolated as part of a spelling program or a grammar lesson but in the context of meaning in reading. (WR)",

The first research investigation compared reading pretest and posttest scores of Chicanos tutored by other Chicanos in English, Chicanos tutored by other Chicanos in Spanish, Chicanos tutored by Anglos, and a nontutored Chicano control group. Results showed that tutors of the same sex have a greater influence on scores than any other group and that Chicano students did not perform significantly better with Chicano tutors. The second research investigation was not based  on ethnic considerations and was devoted to arithmetic, concentrating on possible sex, school, and sub-test part-score differences. Findings comparing pretest and posttest scores of the experimental and control groups showed significant gains by the experimental group (tutored pupils) over the control group.

The cognitive clarity theory already seems to show some power in explaining some puzzling findings in reading research. Some examples of these paradoxes are: earlier letter-name knowledge is highly correlated with later reading achievement yet teaching letter-names does not help children learn to read; some children with reading disabilities are superior to normal readers in visual discrimination; learning to read two languages is easier than learning to read only one; and it is easier to learn to read in two writing systems than in only one. Reading and learning to read must employ processes already available for more general functioning. Thus, learning  to read is the application of general cognitive abilities to this task. (WR)",

Hence all teachers, regardless of the grade level or subject they teach, should know what the fundamental reading skills are and how to teach them to children who need help with increasingly more difficult and varied subject matter textbooks. In addition to phonics, picture clues, sight words, context clues, structural analysis, and dictionary usage are useful decoding tools. The comprehension skills advance from literal comprehension through interpretation and critical reading to creative or individual reading. Students should be taught study skills in their content classes because each subject carreis its own vocabulary, and  there are unique differences in skills used in various subject fields. Learning to read fluently and rapidly is another basic skill to be developed since there are many different kinds of materials and purposes for reading. And after the primary grades, all reading skills can best be developed using actual materials in subject area classes. (TO)",

In the first, 340 workers and their 340 supervisors in 27 different occupations answered questions related to mathematics and communications skills. In the second survey, 490 workers and 480 supervisors in 37 occupations, 18 of which were repeated from the first survey, completed questions related to mathematics, communications, interpersonal, and reasoning skills. From the data, certain core skill requirements for work performance appear evident. All  occupations require reading and listening at least the literal level of comprehension--reading forms and writing words/phrases on forms. Most of the skills of one-to-one conversation are common requirements and all occupations require instructional communication, the ability to demonstrate and instruct. Complete data are presented in tabular form and conclusions and implications are discussed. (TO)",

Two of these are controlled by a public corporation, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC); one is operated by a number of commercial companies under the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA). Both the BBC and IBA have expanded their educational output in recent years and cooperate with each other in broadcasting to schools. Over the past ten years one or the other of the broadcasting companies has provided a weekly series, extending over a school year, which deals specifically with learning to read. The earlier programs used a central figure in the role of teacher, and their shape and form followed a normal classroom lesson very closely. In 1970 a series was written which attempted to bridge the  gap between pre-reading and reading, taking in a pre-school as well as a starting school audience. The human teacher was no longer used and the series was written around the fantasy world of animated puppets. The programs were essentially a stimulus. The teaching was left to the teacher in the classroom. Another recent development has been the production of a series for slow learners based on the thinking of a research team, rather than one particular author. (WR)",

Once a reading rate objective has been phrased, the next step is to examine all available resources of help in reaching that objective. These resources include films for use with regular motion picture projectors, films for use with special projectors, and vocabulary-building aids in film, television, slide, card, or textbook form. The next step is determining exactly what techniques are best. Here student feedback is crucial, for, to be effective, all techniques must be solidly grounded on an exact awareness of which student and teacher attitudes are helps and which are hindrances or roadblocks. Motivational techniques are also important  considerations for increasing students' reading rates. Some possible means of motivation include active self-discoveries and visual expeditors. Some specific instructional techniques teachers can use include pacing, determining the best practice rate, using specialized reading-type skills, and asking pupils to keep individual progress sheets.

Of primary importance to the critical interpretation of the information received is the development of the critical reading skills of analysis, integration, and evaluation.

The observation scale used for studying the task behavior resulting from the task demands of the method consisted of 44 categories (32 tasks, of which six had three forms--auditory, visual,  and auditory and visual). The results indicated that teachers can be separated into groups on the basis of their task setting behaviors, that a relationship exists between teaching styles and the achievement of pupils, and that such relationship generally do not appear to be different among groups of pupils with different initial characteristics.

        "description":"This paper presents a survey of scientific research, professional literature, and doctoral dissertations on reading comprehension done from 1948 to 1972. The following reading factors believed to affect reading comprehension were identified: fate, vocabulary, sentence structure, questioning, and purpose setting. The research pertaining to the selected factors was analyzed to develop generalizations and conclusions which were then used to formulate a partial construct of reading comprehension. Reading comprehension was found to be a complex process composed of interrelated elements which mature in accordance with the reader's proficiency in utilizing selected factors which are related to the demands of the reading task. Reading comprehension was found to be a process which was  affected by the experience and ideas which the reader brings to the printed page; the relationship between the oral language patterns and the printed language patterns in the text; the reader's knowledge of grammatical structures used in the reading material; the depth and breadth of the reader's vocabulary; the types of questions asked and the location of questions in the reading material; and the reader's purpose, rate, and intellectual capacity.

        "description":"It has been shown that incidental stimulus attributes are not utilized as much under conditions of high anxiety. It was hypothesized that the nature of this restricted encoding may be interpreted within a levels-of-processing framework. The physical attributes of verbal items (e.g., orthography, sound) may be thought of as shallow features, requiring relatively little processing compared to the semantic properties (i.g., meaning), which may be said to require deeper processing. It was hypothesized that high anxiety systematically reduces the depth of information processing which the subject does, so that the peripheral deep features may not be processed. A false recognition study and two free recall experiments are reported as tests of this notion. In general, the  differential-depth hypothesis was not supported, though in retrospect the methodologies used probably did not involve processing at different levels. (Author/WR)",

Two hundred fifty-six college students enrolled in an introductory educational psychology course were randomly assigned to one of three instruction modes of material presentation: a linear programed reading mode without illustrations, a linear programed reading mode with color illustrations, and a paragraph mode which was not in a programed format. Instruction for all modes was individualized in that students worked at their own pace and took unit tests at their own convenience. The results indicated that although criterion could be achieved in the least time in the linear mode, gain and rate were  poorest in that mode. The linear mode with illustrations took the most time but showed the best results in terms of gain and rate.

The data were analyzed to determine if sex of subject, IQ, or type of school reading curriculum were related to the ability to retain overall reading ability or specific reading skills. Subjects in the study were 311 first-grade pupils enrolled in nine northeastern Wisconsin elementary schools. Approximately one-half of the subjects were enrolled in an objective-based reading program while the remaining subjects were enrolled in basal reader curricula. It was concluded that sex of subject, intellectual ability, and type of school reading curriculum do not appear to be important variables related to  the retention of overall reading ability and specific reading skills. While significant losses were found on 11 of the 14 measures, when the data were examined in terms of percentage of subjects considered to have mastered the skills in the spring and fall, only 15 percent of the subjects needed to be recategorized.

In one experiment, college subjects were shown a mixed series of words and pictures either while simultaneously engaged in shadowing (repeating aloud) a prose passage presented via earphones or while free of such distractions. On a multiple-choice recognition test, it was found that the verbal shadowing task interfered with word performance but failed to affect pictorial recognition memory, indicating that verbal information and pictorial information may be processed independently in parallel recognition memory systems. In a similar experiment recall rather than recognition was the dependent measure. While the usual pictorial  superiority was found, the verbal shadowing task interfered with picture as well as word retention, suggesting that in memory tasks where verbal reports are required, subjects characteristically attempt to translate easily labelable pictorial information into verbal terms during the encoding phase. Thus there does appear to be a separate visual iconic memory system, but it normally operates in total independence of the verbal system only when the anticipated use of information is nonverbal in character.

The innovations vary in form and complexity: radio, television, videotape recorder, computer, film loop, cassette, tape recorder, and microforms are but a few of the materials. There are many arguments which could be presented for and against the use of nonprint material in the reading program. However, instead of debating whether print will be superseded by other communication forms and in what ways other communication forms are more effective than print, educators need to explore the ways in which educational technology can make greater contributions to success in reading. Instructional media and the concept of educational technology are still in their infancy. Many devices and  plans are presently available for use within the reading program; many devices and plans are in the developmental stages; others are just sparks in some creative imagination. The media do not determine success in reading--rather, it is the teacher's effective use of technological aids that determines success in reading. (WR)",

Performances for the two and four second-per-item rates of presentation did not differ and were similar to those obtained by Ellis for rates of presentation of two seconds or less. However, when stimuli were shown for six seconds each, performance was facilitated. In experiment two, seven stimuli were presented at rates of four, six, or eight seconds per item. During this interval stimuli were exposed for either two seconds or for the entire interval.

        "description":"An assessment of Black Elk's poetry reveals that Indians' attitudes toward words differ from ours. For example, on certain occasions Indian songs become instruments which bring an influx of energy into a whole society or draw rain or heal sickness. Words which recreate or conjure the agents of the poet's vision are relevant because they uplift the quality of living. Black Elk believes that words \"give away his vision,\" but they are practical because they contain power or influence. Words also have energy and direction, and when they are received in visions as songs, hymns, invocations, prophecies, or conjurations, they are spoken of as \"Voices Sent.\" An unexpressed power, or \"The Compelling Fear,\" motivates Black Elk to perform the Horse Dance ceremony, which consists of vision  songs and the conveyance of the content of the vision. Indian poetry is brief and it reveals that colors, lightning, and the sunset are signs of the power of the west. The purpose of the Indian song is to transmit the affective situations of the vision to the beholders of the ceremony, so that they may profit from it psychologically, medically, and practically.

Among areas of contrast are vocabulary, syntactic constructions--especially punctuation--and the more complex use of auxiliaries in writing. These differences between speech and writing affect the English curriculum in the teaching of reading, composition, and literature. Reading and writing instruction should be approached systematically with increasingly sophisticated constructions and with the realization that reading is a passive recognition of symbols while writing is the active production of symbols. Leading students to understand and appreciate  literature leads them to understand and enjoy the language they write. (JM)",

        "description":"The American concern for prescriptive correctness in linguistic behavior, which derives from eighteenth centry British notions, met with considerable and significant challenge by the contrary descriptive notion in the first half of the nineteenth century. The energy of this challenge waned by mid-century and the prescriptive drive for linguistic uniformity and conformity not only revived, but took on new energy from nineteenth century American culture. The persistence of the prescriptive notion in the minds of educated and intelligent Americans throughout the twentieth century poses an interesting cultural problem. The &quot;Third International&quot; controversy and the black English controversy demonstrate the remarkable hold that the correctness doctrine has on our time. These  controversies also give some insight into the means by which the status quo of prescriptivism is maintained within an alien general culture--principally by utilizing genteel co-optive devices and by linking the prescriptive linguistic goals with seemingly desirable social and political goals.

Festivity as a communal celebration can expand awareness of an historical period beyond the academic or new critical classroom by allowing the class to engage collectively in a group experience.

In the university, new areas need to be developed (mixing Canadian, American, British, and translated foreign materials, or emphasizing the local and peculiar within Canada), while older areas need to be re-developed (courses on Shakespeare, Dickens, nineteenth century poets, Hardy).

Two writing samples were collected from each pupil prior to and following the 20-week treatment period, and each paper was rated by three judges using the \"Glazer Narrative Composition Scale.\" This study supports the hypothesis that literature study is one means of helping pupils  improve in their ability to create narrative compositions.

The course focuses on genre, content, and theme and includes readings, discussions, lectures, and compositions. The objectives, which are sometimes stated behaviorally, try to meet the needs of all students whether they are lovers of prose or poetry. For example, in a study of Hawthorne's short  fiction, the students develop an understanding of the author's style, literary devices, theme, Gothic Romanticism, and creative use of language. They then write and revise a short story by trying to use Hawthorne's techniques. A similar approach is taken to the other Concord authors. (SW)",

The purpose of the program is to graduate professionals who are competent to work immediately in the mass media. Approximately $14,000 was made available to provide facilities and develop a suitable program to fit the needs of the students. The newsroom was designed to be used for both the print and broadcast programs; plans for other facilities  which will serve several functions are not yet complete. While these plans have limited use at a major university, they are workable and economical for smaller institutions. The planning recognizes that the problems of the new technology can be faced within a budget by providing facilities for immediate use with the capacity for future growth.

        "description":"This research project was designed to analyze by quantitative methods a corpus of writing produced by four groups of American college students enrolled in German courses and by one group of professional German writers. Analysis was undertaken in order to determine whether or not significant quantitative differences in the use of selected syntactic structures exist between the American students and the German writers and to test the validity of the Hunt method of measuring syntactic maturity when applied to the writing of second language learners and native Germans. Findings of the study indicated that developmental stages in the acquisition of written German syntax did exist and that these stages were clearly definable between every other level; similarity of developmental stages  was present in so far as the second language learners attained a comparable level of syntactic growth reached by representative English speakers; syntactic maturity consists of the writer's ability to pack more information into sentences and T-units by lengthening independent clauses and by using more subordination; and modified sentence-combining practice might prove to be an interesting way of hastening syntactic development in German.

The industry's concerns, as expressed through editors, are paper, printing, postage, people, and profit. The Magazine Publishers Association (MPA) seems mostly concerned with Washington lobbying activities about postal rates, while studying alternative forms of distribution. MPA seemed to believe higher magazine subscription prices were inevitable, and though lower sales would result, so would higher profits. Highlights of the visit and discussion with individual editors of each shop are described. Two final points are reinforced: successful magazines are run by businessmen or women first and editors second;  and the best editors have strong personalities which pervade their operation and product. Most faculty participants expressed satisfaction with the initial seminar and encouraged others to attend future sessions. (Author/RB)",

One hundred eight students at Temple University viewed one of two videotapes contained eight news reports--four included film and four did not for each tape--and read one newspaper account of each of the eight events. Results showed that television reports with film were consistently more preferred than newspaper reports, but newspaper reports were not consistently more preferred than television reports without film. Results concerning media credibility showed that television reports with film were  generally more believed than newspaper reports, and that newspaper reports were generally more believed than television reports without film. Results tended to show that the effect of the use of news film--particularly for believability--depends to some extent on story content. The finding is consistent with results obtained in prior studies of media believability. (Author/RB)",

Also contained in this paper is an exploratory study of the Bernstein hypothesis, which pertains to restricted and elaborated language codes. This exploratory study observes college students and operationalizes slang as an instance of the restricted  code. A statistically significant difference was found between the number of greetings given in the highest context condition and those given in the lowest context condition and between the number of slang phrases used in the highest context condition and those used in the lowest context condition. The findings suggest that context may be an important condition to include in a study that attempts to investigate language systems. (Author/RB)",

Women's salaries were somewhat lower than those of minorities, with minority newswomen being paid less than minority newsmen. Few of either group expresed overall job dissatisfaction. But two-thirds of the newswomen and one-third of the minority newspersons said they had been discriminated against on the job. Women were also more likely than minorities to say they had been favored on the job.

A fourth of their supervisors said that minority newspersons did not perform as well as nonminorities, and an equal number said newswomen did not do their jobs as well as newsmen.

        "description":"The Supreme Court of the United States has issued three significant rulings on the question of prior restraint by government officials of material to be published in print media. Each time it ruled that only in exceptional circumstances will prior restraint be permitted. Lower federal courst have not taken the same view regarding prior restraint in public high schools. Several have held that school officials may censor material before publication in high school student newspapers or periodicals, whether school-sponsored or not. However, one Circuit Court of Appeals has taken a strong stance in opposition to high school precensorship, holding that while punishment may be imposed after publication of material that is not otherwise protected, prior restraint is permitted on the  secondary level only under highly unusual conditions. While school officials may establish reasonable rules regarding time, place, and manner of distribution of student publications, a reading of the Tinker case indicates that prior censorship may not be permissible in the high school. The conflict among the Circuit Courts of Appeals, however, seemingly can only be resolved by the Supreme Court. (Author/TO)",

The media behavior unit is used in several ways. First, by looking at particular attributes, researchers can determine whether an individual is consistent in medium behavior--whether John Doe usually reads the newspaper in the same sequence. If the attribute in question is not medium-bound, then researchers can determine how consistent an individual is across media behaviors--whether John Doe is more consistent in his affective evaluation of content consumed during newspaper reading than of that consumed during television viewing. Secondly, the analytic unit described allows researchers to focus on relationships  in the actual media situation. For example, when people are lonely are they more likely to turn on the radio for company or do they seek a particular content? This example illustrates two concepts introduced in this paper, media-seeking and content-seeking. Content-seeking is viewed as the process in which individuals desire that a function pertaining to content be fulfilled and then engage in media behavior. In media-seeking the function the individual wants fulfilled is not tied to content. (Author/RB)",

The directors also were asked to report the ratings of their evening newscast and to indicate the reasons they felt were behind the ratings. The data indicate that the major sources of personnel for television news departments are other television news departments and college broadcast journalism sequences. The directors cite courses in broadcast reporting, local and state government, and speaking and rhetoric as preferable for broadcast journalists to courses in newspaper writing skills, psychology, and some sociology  courses. Reasons for hiring specific personnel stress the social characteristics of the candidate without making reference to educational background. The directors suggest that good visuals or good air presentation and good news coverage are most important to achieving high news program ratings, but also note that poor signal strength and a lack of staff, among other things, can hurt ratings.

        "description":"The focus of this paper is on three questions: Who are the professional women on newspaper staffs? How do they feel about their jobs? What are their job expectations? Questionnaires were sent to each of Wisconsin's 35 daily newspaper editors (all men), a brief form for the editor and a longer form for each woman on his news-editorial staff. Tabulation of the results indicates that a typical newspaperwoman is a full-time reporter, a college graduate with a major in journalism, 28 years old, and about as likely to be single as married. She has five years experience in newspaper work, is making $180 a week, and plans to have or has had a long career in journalism. These women perceive their jobs as no different in performance than those of men, and most of their editors agree. Most  women are satisfied with their jobs but have felt discrimination and expect opposition from their male co-workers. They feel their jobs provide poor opportunities to advance and only fair to poor use of their abilities. Their occupational expectations are not high; few seek to be managing editors, publishers, or editors-in-chief. And they feel their chances of getting into management positions are less compared to their male co-workers. Several ways for gaining equality in the newsroom are suggested. (TO)",

        "author":["Bostian, Lloyd R."],
        "description":"This paper reviews various studies of media development patterns, all pointing to mass media growth's association with urbanization. The development and use of mass media differs greatly among urban, suburban, and rural areas. However, media development patterns are similar among countries, differing in the stage but not the pattern of media development. As modernization occurs, the media spread from larger urban centers to smaller towns and eventually into rural areas. When media development and availability are equal in urban, rural, and suburban areas, media use is similar. Greater media availability means greater media use, in time and in numbers of media, no matter what the geographic area. The choice and use of media definitely relate to one's place of residence and  interest in community. Media choices are also influenced by social context and daily living and work patterns. Although personal and demographic factors such as income, education, and literacy are associated with mass media use, these variables have little predictive power in explaining urban, suburban, and rural communication pattern differences. In fact, mass media availability and relevant content can supersede the barriers of illiteracy in rural areas of developing nations. Research needs are suggested. (Author/TO)",

Representation on the board has been disproportionately great for metropolitan areas, for states with metropolitan areas, for areas with relatively few newspapers, and for the morning field of publication. Directors' profiles reveal that less than 50 percent had professional journalism  experience and that there were low levels of membership in national, regional, or state journalistic organizations but high levels of involvement in government and non-media corporate affairs. Republicans outnumber democrats two to one, and the board is overwhelmingly Protestant for that half of the directors indicating party and religious affiliation. (Author/RB)",

The data obtained are reported in five levels of operating budgets with a summary of the statistics for each area of news gathering and reporting capability. The data indicate operating budgets rise directly with staff size and equipment holdings. Data on motion picture equipment holdings and on intentions to purchase new equipment indicate that the 16mm motion picture camera remains the basic television news tool with little or no trend developing toward portable VTR or 8mm equipment. The data also indicate that middle-class stations ($100,000 to $199,999  annual operating budget) tend to spend a higher proportion of their efforts in news processing as opposed to news reporting and that 43 percent of television news personnel work in \"large\" departments with annual budgets of $300,000 or more.

This paper attempts to demonstrate that under certain information stimuli conditions, the conclusions of several authors quoted concerning the role of communications in causing positive responses among fatalists should be modified. When the immediate and/or individual benefits of an attitude object are  explained to high fatalists, they respond more to such information content across subjects of communication then to exhortation, reward enumeration, future reward explanation, or to society reward explanation.

Multidimensional scaling allows the researcher to simultaneously observe change and rates of change within the policy's attitudes toward the candidates and issues in election campaigns. Multidimensional scaling also reveals which dimensions the voters use to differentiate the candidates and their stand on various issues. By observing the trajectories of the candidates' movement through multidimensional space, it becomes possible to accurately predict the outcome of a election. Also included is a study using this technique to measure the variable effects the media have in political advertising. Finally, it reports the results of a study using multidimensional scaling  to plot the changes in voters' attitudes toward the major political figures and issues in the 1972 presidential election. A random sample of the voters from Champaign County, Illinois, scaled sixteen concepts at five points in time. At each time three dimensions emerged. The trajectories of the two major candidates suggest a lawful motion through the space, which yields a prediction of the outcome of that election. (Author/RB)",

More importantly, this paper illustrates the social and political changes which can result when a locally-produced documentary examines a significant community problem. Judging from this case study, a locally-produced documentary can contribute substantially to the understanding of some community problem and even help eliminate that problem. Several factors appear to enhance the probability that the documentary will be influential. First, a strong case must be made within the documentary itself that there is a significant community problem, and solutions for that  problem should be advanced. Second, the initial documentary should be supported by subsequent news reports on related issues. Third, public officials must be motivated into taking appropriate action on the issues involved. Finally, the station must be committed enough to its public service responsibility to withstand the pressures and criticisms which may follow a documentary attacking existing political and social structures.

On balance, the U.S. media have reported or commented on Latin American social revolutions mainly by exploiting sensation and ridicule. Economic interests probably predispose the U.S. press toward a conservative stance. Perhaps more significant, however, is the cultural conception of individual reporters and editors that the U.S. political system of representative democracy is inextricably bound up with the economic system of private ownership of property. Most U.S. reporters have a difficult time covering social revolution simply because it is alien to their experience. They tend to  regard the world as a giant police court where property rights take precedence over human rights. (Author/TO)",

Four groups of Filipino subjects with known group characteristics were tested. The criterion group consisted of American subjects with known group  characteristics. Seven a priori hypotheses concerning international communication comprehension were tested using multiple linear regression. The overall results of the study strongly supported the position that the clozentropy procedure is both a sensitive and a valid measure of international communication comprehension, and pointed out the importance to the international communicator of studying his various international audience subpopulations, even when the audiences are monolingual.

A content analysis of the letters written to the station indicated that 49 percent of the writers specifically stated support for public affairs type programing. The survey does, however, cast some doubt on optimistic predictions of a new-found public television audience of contributors. Those who reported watching public television before the hearings began generally reported that their level of viewing had not changed after the Watergate hearings. Likewise, although a slight trend was noted, there were no significant relationships between how a viewer's attitude  toward public television was affected by the hearings and any subsequent willingness to contribute to public television. These factors of viewer continuity and contribution should be of particular interest, because this population consisted of persons who were committed enough to their opinions about the coverage of the Senate hearings to write letters expressing these opinions.

In the lab studies, three different audience groups (junior and senior high school students and parents) were shown three different anti-drug abuse messages. Various levels of audio distraction--similar to \"real world\" viewing situations--occurred during exposure to the messages which were presented in the context of a current television program. The findings were: student groups generally commented about the ads less than parents, senior high students counterargued more and connected less than other groups. and adults were particularly sensitive to distractions. In the second lab study adult subjects were mailed a  booklet about drug abuse two weeks following participation in the experiment. Compared to a group that saw no anti-drug ads, those who had seen anti-drug ads were more likely to recall receiving a booklet, to have read it, and to have had a drug discussion recently. In the field experiment two key ads were run during a 32-day period via split-cable facility on the West Coast. Telephone interviews conducted pre-, during, and post-exposure indicated that both ads stimulated interest compared to pre-campaign levels. (Author/WR)",

The purpose of the study was to find how these journals reconciled their obligations under the social responsibility theory to represent fairly the viewpoints of an identifiable minority with their responsibility not to provide information about internal dissent to the nation's enemies. Conscientious objectors received substantial attention from four of these journals during the Vietnam era--24 editorials and 38 other articles. Amost all items conveyed a favorable bias toward objectors--46 were positive, 13 neutral, and 3 negative. Almost  half the coverage was provided by one magazine, the &quot;Christian Century,&quot; which supported not only traditional objectors, but also those who refused to fight on novel grounds. The thematic content of the editorials failed to support Siebert's hypothesis that &quot;the enforcement of restraints increases as the stresses on the stability&quot; of society increase. The evidence indicates that some editorialists exercised a great deal of freedom in defending minority opponents of United States policy during the Vietnam war. (Author/RB)",

This effort to protect privacy poses challenges to statutory protection of public, and media, rights of access to public records and suggests a new dimension of privacy law with implications for the mass media. This paper analyzes the movement to protect privacy of personal data, with particular attention to the HEW report. It then examines, as a case study, the process which led to the only personal data protection law thus far enacted, a statute passed by the 1974 Minnesota legislature. The paper also reviews  efforts to protect privacy of personal data at the federal level and to reach a reconciliation of access to records and privacy principles. Attention is paid to both Congressional and Executive branch institutions with interests in the subject. Finally, some suggestions are advanced as to why there has not yet been a successful simultaneous analysis of the principles of access to public records and the growing movement for privacy of personal data.

It provides a logical, step-by-step description of possible failure events within a system and their interaction--the combinations of potential occurrences which could result in a predetermined undesired event. The analysis for a fault tree begins with a precise statement about an undesired event of critical importance in a decision making process. This statement stands at the top of the tree, and the analysis proceeds downward. Contributing failure events are then interrelated by means of &quot;logic gates&quot; (e.g., AND and OR) to illustrate the cause and effect relationship which results  in the undesired event. (A description of the FTA approach and its applications is included.) (RB)",

The procedures include the identification and evaluation of various kinds of networks, assessment of the organizational hierarchy, appraisal of various departments within the organization, and evaluation of individual communication behavior. The report begins by describing and illustrating the essential concepts of network analysis, thereby providing a vocabulary for talking about the process. In the second chapter several comparative techniques are described for evaluating the network, including overlaying the actual network on the organizational chart and comparing different networks. Several important network metrics, called communication structure variables, are identified,  and their relationships to important aspects of organizational processes are suggested in the third chapter. Finally, information is provided to enable a reader to gain access to and utilize existing software for conducting a large-scale network analysis by computer. (Author/RB)",

After duplications were eliminated, a list of 925 institutions of higher education remained. A questionnaire was prepared that was of a restricted, relatively forced-choice format. Two mailings about a month apart took place. Of the 925 questionnaires sent out, 467 replies were received. Some of the results  indicated that: the majority of forensics programs are directed by full-time faculty members; almost half of the programs are independent of the speech-communication curriculum; most programs rely on student volunteers to build the forensics program; improvement in critical thinking, analysis of issues, and analysis of arguments are the goals of most programs; and tournaments, meets, and festivals are prominent characteristics of forensics programs.

In attempting to diminish the heckler's impact, the speaker usually appeals to one of two segments of the audience. He may direct his response to his supporters as the intended auditors, or he may respond in an attempt to effect change in the actions of the hecklers themselves. Counter techniques principally designed for his supporters' confirmation include such measures as ridiculing the antagonists, turning the tables on them, and using the hecklers as an example. Counter techniques mainly aimed at altering the  hecklers' perceptions include preaching or scolding, teaching, disarming, defying, and counter threatening. The fitting response selected by the speaker must take into account the rhetorical situation. (WR)",

Random samples in two metropolitan areas in different regions of the country (Atlanta, Ga., n=281; and Philadelphia, Pa., n=279) were surveyed by phone to test specific hypotheses. Several regional inter-city differences were noted: Philadelphians indicated greater general exposure to mass media political advertising, while Atlantans were more inclined to recall specific advertisements; respondents in both cities were highly likely to say that they were exposed to political advertising on television; and three of every four first  recalled advertisements were seen on television. It was concluded that a negative correlation exists between a medium's propensity for exposure and the individual's selective retention of political information presented through that medium, and that a medium rated high for exposure mentions will be rated low on selective retention mentions, and vice versa.

The subjects were 28 pairs of college speech-communication students, randomly selected. The only criterion for selection was that the two members of each pair be strangers, in order to avoid possible contamination from preacquaintance. The measurement instrument was a set of statements about a controversial national topic, followed by five-step Likert-type scales of agreement-disagreement. The statements were developed by using pilot subjects from the same population as the ones used in the study. Each was asked to compile a list of 15  possible topics for discussion concerning the Watergate affair. From these lists, 15 attitudinal statements were generated. The subjects then talked together continuously for 20 minutes about their attitudes and feelings concerning Watergate. Finally, the subjects completed the questionnaire. The results indicated that in every case, when a subject's perception of his own attitude was compared with his partner's perception of his attitude, significant differences were found. (WR)",

        "description":"In preparing urban teachers to become effective classroom communicators, urban speech teachers should involve their students in interpersonal communication within an intergroup context whenever possible. Students must be taught to become sensitive to word choice, aware of the importance of verbal and nonverbal codes, and more empathic. To accomplish this goal, teachers must investigate the feelings and attitudes of people of other groups by learning facts about them via children, parents, and books. They can also get additional communication training through self-analysis and intergroup and interpersonal situations designed to develop empathy. Some approaches which may be used to accomplish this goal are simulation games, communication effectiveness exercises, role playing, and  self-disclosure. Guidelines for future urban educators include the following: (1) interracial communication is facilitated when the communicators share a common coding system; (2) meaning communication in transracial contexts requires the proximity of source and receiver; and (3) interpersonal communication with transracial contexts often fails because the sender and the receiver do not share or seek each other's point of view.

Using Holsti's formula for multiple coders, dual coder reliability was established at .99. Results showed television as trying to orient the female child to  traditional feminine roles in society as the typical wife and mother concerned about her appearance and accepting the role of a sex object. The concept of women as being independent and successful in the business world is not shown. (JM)",

The course content should help students come to grips with their internal and external problems, rather than avoid them and seek only quick solutions. To aid students in dealing with controversies, teachers must introduce them to the verbal and nonverbal uses of language and to the communication process. In carrying out a program based on this concept, the school should offer a broadened and more interpersonalized approach to teaching persuasion and debate. First, students should understand the meaning of communication and examine why people argue. Then they should focus on the uses of arguments in their own interpersonal  relationships. Students should learn not only to analyze, share, and defend their own views, but also to listen to and respect others' positions. They should notice what motivates people to meet in groups to which they belong and should be able to identify the kinds of controversies in problem solving group settings and public communication. Preparing students to use language effectively in communicating to solve problems should be the main purpose of this course, regardless of the focus. (SW)",

The Temple City model provides an example of vertical differentiation, while the Top of the World Elementary School plan is given as a model of horizontal differentiation. Obstacles to DS implementation, arising both from the objections of groups of people and from the nature of organizational change, are outlined. The various claims about the cost of DS programs are examined, and the report observes that a DS program could cost about the same as, or a little more than, a conventional program once it is implemented. The report contends also that the shared decisionmaking characteristic of DS programs could strengthen, rather than  weaken, the principal's role in a school. A 53-item bibliography is included.

The study was based on the general hypothesis that the structure and functioning of the public schools is influenced by the modernity of the sociocultural context which they serve. Sixty-seven Florida counties and their school systems provided the analytical units of the study. The structural index of modernity was constructed using the attributes of median level of education, proportion of county residents employed in white collar occupations, the percent of families earning over $10,000 per year, and population density. To assess the validity of the general hypothesis, 12 specific hypotheses were developed. These  hypotheses focused on relationships between the level of modernity predominating in the social system and selected school district attributes The school district attributes were grouped into: (1) the characteristics of the district's personnel, (2) its financial attributes, and (3) the attributes resulting from the types of orientation instilled in its pupils. Results for nine of the specific hypotheses supported the general hypothesis. The conclusions and implications of the study are discussed and suggestions provided for further research. (Author/MLF)",

The role of coordinator came into being as a response to a particular set of needs. An analysis of the changing nature of those needs provided a basis for deciding whether the coordinator role should be continued in its present form; continued in a new form; have its component tasks, functions, and relationships divided up and made part of other preexisting or newly created roles; or abandoned totally. The report analyzes the school system's needs for leadership along two dimensions: the changing instructional program and the changing needs of the system's administrative team. It then presents three alternative plans for meeting system needs. Data presented for each plan  include the position changes entailed, organization under the plan, qualitative differences, and the budget.

With the existence of a fully developed and operational system, planning and management of resource allocations can be made that can lead to an improved quality of service offered to more individuals for the same amount of money. In view of the growing concern by society for the conservation of financial resources, a flexible and responsive system for accomplishing accountability is needed. The data included in the system should provide not only for the planning and management needs of the user, but also for those information needs imposed by guidelines and regulations. With the availability of  such a system, those individuals responsible for planning and administering the delivery of day care services can have readily available the supporting information required to make \"rational\" decisions for planning and/or evaluation purposes.

        "description":"This report explores the possibility of using the discrepancy measures to assess the implementation of educational innovations. The discrepancy measure was derived from the decision to segment the educational market, and to select or develop marketing strategies, on the basis of discrepancies between the potential user and the requirements of a product. Discrepancies occur because the nature of the product is incompatible with the nature of the user. The first section of the report considers the discrepancy measure in the general context of implementation assessment and indicates that the measure makes a potential methodological contribution in this area. An analysis of existing data, in the second section of the report, indicates that, even in its present form, the measure  generates relatively rich data on implementation and permits a rough classification of different implementation behaviors. A number of modifications which could be made in the measure to make it even more suitable for the collection of implementation data are discussed in the third section of the report. (Author/DN)",

Specifically, it argues for a marketing approach which involves starting with the real needs of a particular population and planning a coordinated set of products and programs to serve those needs. The authors focus on using marketing concepts and techniques to help in situations where educational products already exist. The publication first discusses past beliefs about the approaches to educational change and how these beliefs have led to confidence in the potential usefulness of a marketing approach. Secondly, it reports the results of empirical work done to apply one such marketing concept to educational change--that of market segmentation. The application of the market segmentation concept  to educational dissemination and utilization assumes that the market for educational innovations is heterogeneous, and further, that variables can be found which meaningfully divide the market into homogeneous subgroups which are expected to respond differently to marketing efforts. A discrepancy model is divided for use as a basis for market segmentation and as a guide for market selection and marketing strategy development. (Author/DN)",

Even though discipline is now called classroom control, these articles indicate that some educators question the desirability of precise prescription in the classroom. Running through the articles is a common thread: discipline is less of a problem when the instructional content and process are interesting and relevant, constitute stimulating activities, and arouse natural curiosity. Since, as many of the articles point out, what constitutes meaningful curriculum or stimulating activities for one student may be irrelevant for another, the matter of motivating individual students appears to be the critical problem. However, since some students become discipline problems  despite meaningful curriculum, other approaches are suggested. These approaches range from an attempt to match a teacher's teaching style to a student's learning style, to a strict behavior modification where the forms of behavior--and not the attitudes behind behavior--are the primary concern.

        "description":"As part of the objective-based component of the Statewide Evaluation and Assessment Program, New Mexico school districts have selected local priority objectives for the past 3 years. As a means of assessing the districts' progress toward achieving these objectives, objective-based measures for the most frequently chosen objectives are administered in each district in the spring semester of the school year. In a continuing effort to keep the public informed of the current activities within the Statewide evaluation effort, this document has been prepared to explain the manner in which school districts select and rate specific basic cognitive skill objectives, describe any Statewide trends relating to the objectives being selected as priorities, and provide the reader with a summary  of this year's priority goals as compared to those of the previous year.

This variety has motivated the development of a descriptor to relate features of instructional programs which offer individualization. This descriptor identifies, quantifies, and graphically represents the significant dimensions of a program's individualization. During the development of the descriptor, a preliminary version was field tested at 15 sites with programs in mathematics, reading, and teacher education. The utility of the descriptor was examined for purposes of description, comparison, and development. The descriptor proved to contribute to communication, dissemination, and development regarding individualization. (Author)",

Data were collected from faculty members and principals in 40 elementary and 40 secondary schools in New Jersey. A set of hypotheses and research questions was tested using analysis of variance and correlational techniques. The Machiavellian orientation of principals was not significantly related to the prinicpal's behavior in terms of initiating structure, consideration, authoritarianism, emotional detachment; nor was it related to openness (or closedness) of school climate, teacher loyalty to the principal, teacher loyalty to the school, or teachers' rating of the effectiveness of the  principal. Machiavellianism of principals, however, was found to be significantly related to job mobility. Contrary to the findings of the experimental research on Machiavellianism, the expected relationships between Machiavellian orientations of principals and teacher-principal interactions were generally not found in the school setting.

        "author":["Kirst, Michael W."],
        "description":"This paper examines previous changes in school finance reform, makes some future projections about the direction finance reform might go, and indicates what strategies seem particulary effective. It begins at the Federal level by taking a look at the overall Federal budget picture and its implications for the Federal role. The author proposes that the Federal Government monitor expenditure disparities caused by differences in school district wealth rather than differences caused by free local choices of tax rates or differential funding for disadvantaged pupils. At the State level, the author sees that one fundamental factor in State school finance reform is that overall State treasuries remain very much in surplus. Trends in finance reform in the last 2 years indicate that: (1)  States with the most thoroughgoing reform are for the most part those without large city school districts; (2) there is a lack of massive property tax relief in reform measures; and (3) State court suits have continued to be crucial to reform efforts. Specific reforms in certain States are discussed. Some school finance issues have made little progress because of no real good data on different costs of education for pupils with special needs; no linking of finance plans to accountability; unresolved adjustments in State formulas for big cities; a lack of information about the full impact of capacity equalization; and little empirical evidence to define or measure \"local\" control.

Four of the seven objectives established for the project, those dealing with implementation of the Trimester/Modular Scheduling Plan, with the attitudes and achievement of students, and with the acceptance of the scheduling plan by teachers, were achieved. The two objectives for inservice teacher education and the objective for acceptance of the innovative schedule by parents were not achieved.

This book gives much attention to emerging leaders, whether they be teachers, curriculum consultants, superintendents, principals, or guidance specialists. All individuals and groups have leadership potential and exhibit leader behavior to some degree. Official leadership assignments may either enhance or reduce the effectiveness of leader behavior. Much attention is given, therefore, to the ways in which  the official leader may increase his effectiveness through achieving a mutuality of goals and group solidarity. (Author/WM)",

It is not clear what the changes will be, although some elements appear likely to endure, such as a new conception of intellectual development reflected in reconceived subject matter; a reexamination of the teacher's function; a considerable increase in the breadth of educational materials; greater flexibility and variation in school organization and in a student's progress through school; a considerably increased sophistication of testing procedures; and more and better school guidance. Generally speaking, curriculum designers want the curriculum to respect intellectual, humane, and social considerations. The authors of this  volume have attacked the knotty problem of reducing these generalities to specific and disciplined formulations. Written by 12 authors, the comments represent several points of view held by curriculum workers. (Author/DN)",

        "description":"Today local control over education seems to face the most serious challenge in its history. The movement to reform school finance raises the specter of the State assuming its formal consitutional powers and removing autonomy from the communities. Hence, it is argued, as the State takes over control of taxation and expenditures it will want to assure accountability for its dollars by becoming heavily involved in all educational decisions from curriculum to personnel to determination of snow days. This paper argues that the question of financial reform need only affect the revenue raising aspects of local control, and State inroads into fiscal support may only be partial at that. The author contends that local districts are already restricted in their options in the present  financial context of heavy dependence on local taxation. The factors presently limiting autonomy are examined. (Author/JF)",

This guide suggests how practitioners might pursue the problem of sharing educational success in their State. Included are a brief summary of how adoption/adaption might occur, observations on the roles and functions of the originator of a successful practice (the &quot;producer&quot;) and the potential &quot;consumer&quot; who has need of a solution to an identified educational need, as well as the individual or agency (the &quot;linker&quot;) that brings the two together. The process defined for the sharing of education success is referred to as the &quot;Producer-Linker-Consumer&quot; (P-L-C) strategy. The P-L-C strategy is not  intended to be a model, but rather a starting place or a generator of ideas for the practitioner.

This paper takes up three aspects of the passport idea as developed at the Educational Testing Service: (1) reasons for developing the passport; (2) characteristics of the passport; and (3) issues and problems concerning the passport. The passport itself would be a single sheet of microfiche in an envelope. On the microfiche would be all the characteristics of one's educational progress; for example, high school grades, recommendations  from teachers, scores, college grades, instructor's comments, narrative testimonies, summaries of special projects or special training, outcomes of experiential learning, personal statements of accomplishment, and so on. The student would be able to include in the passport what he chooses, and a student can construct his own passport if he chooses. Reproduced from best available copy. (Author/PG)",

This paper attempts to overview the historical significance and present the problems of Asian Americans in higher education. The first problem is the lack of oral and writing skills among Asian Americans. Part of this problem is cultural, referring to traditional Asian values of obedience and subordination. A second problem is the stress resulting from pressures for high levels of school achievement from families and communities. A third problem area concerns the reluctance of universities to hire qualified Asian American administrators, faculty, and staff, to actively recruit Asian American graduate and professional school students, to provide financial assistance and support  services in line with Asian American student needs, and to include the history, contributions, and problems in the college curriculum. Asian Americans are often not seen as legitimate minorities, either because of their small numbers in a particular locale, or because of their mobility in the middle class.

The essential focus is upon the undergraduate and the learning process via an integrative interdisciplinary basic program which extends beyond the usual classroom limitations. The program is humanistically oriented and deals with seminal figures and problems. The goals sought by the program include modification of students' values and perceptions toward more comprehensive and humane ends. The accomplishment of these goals is sought within a collegiate environment which stresses the inherent value of this undergraduate program in contrast to a program which is merely transitional and preparatory for graduate and professional education. Ottawa  University received support from the National Endowment for the Humanities to continue the implementation of the new plan of education. Specific activities emphasized summer faculty workshops; faculty forums and mini-retreats through the course of the project; several total staff and faculty retreats; some use of external consultants and evaluators; employment of key visiting faculty; and attention to varied teaching and learning strategies. These elements are treated in the narrative report and in appendices. A final appendix includes sample syllabi of the interdisciplinary common core. (Author)",

Many past assumptions for predicting enrollments are inadequate. Projection studies have utilized techniques and produced results that have constructively shaped thinking about the enrollment picture of the future. This analysis of projection models is directed along two dimensions: first, a description of the studies in terms of strategies employed and the intended purpose of the study, and second, a comparison of the studies that identify problems with definitions, methodological limitations, and key assumptions.  Strategies employed are grouped into 3 categories: trend extrapolation, policy alternatives, and futurist approaches. Projection studies analyzed were developed for purposes that include demographic description, planning information, resource needs, manpower supply and demand, and policy recommendations. The comparison of projection studies utilizes categories that are congruent with the information needs of leaders in educational systems and institutions. (Author/PG)",

The author of this speech presents a prelude about Augustana College up to and including its 1969 budget crunch, then describes the procedures that Augustana has followed these past 4 years to solve these problems, and finally draws from its experience 9 propositions to help other administrators in the same situation. The conclusions and suggestions for small college management include: (1) Most colleges are not managed too well. (2) Morale is more important than money. (3) Size is not necessarily a sign of quality. (4) Faculty does not want to make hard decisions, but they do want serious input to those decisions that utimately affect their lives and careers. (5) There is nothing like a budget crunch to  open up a college curriculum; there is also nothing like a budget crunch to make a faculty conservative.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the planning, problems, and implementation of this cooperative program. For the academic year 1972-73, Millikin agreed to offer the Community College of Decatur (CCD) certain courses on a contractual basis and also to permit coenrollment of CCD students in specified Millikin lower division courses on a space-available basis. For all courses offered, the institutions agreed that (1) CCD would have responsibility for registration, course material, scheduling, student evaluations, submission of grades, and disciplinary matters; (2) CCD would have the  right to cancel any course if the total enrollment fell below ten students; and (3) Millikin would have the right to select faculty for the courses. During the three quarters of the 1972-73 academic year, Millikin offered on contract 35 class sections that represented 13 separate academic courses. In all, 574 CCD students received instruction in those courses. There is every indication that the 1973-74 winter and spring quarter offerings will show a continuation of this trend. (Author/PG)",

Sixty students enrolled in the 1973 course, including five who withdrew from the 1972 course. An attempt is made here to identify shifts in student performance during 1973 in an effort to validate policy changes made at the close of 1972 and to identify additional changes that should be initiated. Well over 100 changes in course materials were made at the close of the 1972 semester. The 1973 students generally showed improved pacing over first semester students.

        "description":"This study suggests that the position of department chairman can be viewed from two perspectives: the roles required of the position and the preparation of faculty for these roles. A taxonomy of the major roles of chairmen was provided. Investigation of chairmen's activities in their academic, administrative, and leadership roles permits a better understanding of the duties performed, the amount of time required, and the satisfaction or lack of it derived by chairmen. The 1,198 respondents to the questionnaire indicate that they feel most comfortable in the academic role, although frustration occurs because of competing demands on their time by administrative and leadership functions they are required to fulfill. Although they state that they derive the least enjoyment from the  administrative role, they recognize the importance of the activities associated with it. The leadership role incorporates both positive and negative aspects, but, in general, the department chairmen surveyed felt it is an important responsibility from which they derive satisfaction if not pleasure. Chairmen express interest in obtaining more information on management techniques. Orientation sessions with attention to local procedures, leadership techniques, and management procedures appear wanted and needed. In this area, higher education needs to internalize the same philosophies of improvement from learning that it continually exports to the remainder of our culture. (Author)",

Five major points are emphasized: (1) The pluralism of the United States is reflected in its postsecondary education system and its clientele's educational needs; (2) Part-time students are the new majority in postsecondary education; (3) Their educational motivations are more complex than full-time students; (4) Their financing patterns range from the most advantaged to the most disadvantaged students; (5) A larger proportion of part-time than full-time students have family incomes below $15,000. Yet they are discriminated against by postsecondary institutions in tuition and student aid programs, by state and  federal governments in institutional and student support programs, and by certain provisions of tax laws. It is suggested that prior to any examination of alternative financing programs for postsecondary education, it is essential that discrimination against part-time students be eliminated.

The sections were separated into five groups depending on the proportion of students taking the class as a requirement. These proportions were as follows: more than 4/5 of the student enrollment was mandatory, 3/5 to 4/5 of student enrollment was mandatory, etc. Identical analyses were performed on each sample with identical results. One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) on each of the six subscales of the CEQ yielded statistically significant differences among the mean ratings of the five groups. Polynomical trend analyses subsequently showed that the linear trend was significant (p .01) in each case. This result implied that as the  proportion of students taking a class because of a requirement increases, the ratings given to the course and instructor decreases. Suggestions were made to caution instructors about interpreting CEQ results for classes that have high or low proportions of requirement-enrolled students. It was suggested also that further investigations be performed in this area before the results presented here are regarded as conclusive evidence. (Author)",

The average grant amounted to $349. (2) Twice as many students received Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, and approximately 565,100 students received assistance under the  College Work-Study program.

If open admissions students were given a reasonable opportunity for collegiate success, then retention rates would lose much of their significance in evaluating the programs at the CUNY. But remediation has not been adequately administered, class size limitations have not been honored, the University's academic support program in the form of curricular research and professional training is still being developed, and the assessment of outcomes has been meager and simplistic. All that is on the public record is a misleading picture of retention that generates expectations among the students and the public.

The subject is accountability and the issue is the development of national procedures and national standards for the varied institutions found in higher education. The author finds deficiencies in the report as: (1) failing to provide adequate discussion of the problems involved in financing institutions of higher education; (2) failing to discuss access to graduate or graduate professional programs; and (3) failing to say anything about the financing of research and public service. However, the report's stress on accountability is valid. Higher Education must establish units of measurement and enumerate outputs in terms of these units.  Moreover, it needs to be stressed that accountability is more than quantities. It is up to higher education to make accountability an instrument of enlightenment rather than a weapon of repression.

A rapid increase in the number of programs and the number of student participants began in the mid-1950's and continues presently. This research project was conducted during the 1972-73 academic year with students who participated in study abroad programs. Its purpose was to increase the understanding of the effects of study abroad on American students. Participants represented a variety of backgrounds, interests and characteristics and most were juniors. The claims that study abroad results in significant changes toward more international, liberal, open-minded, self-confident attitudes were not supported  by the study's findings. Also, the theory that direct contact with a foreign people results in more positive attitudes toward them was not only not supported, but the opposite result was discovered. The results indicate that student's perceptions of the host country became more realistic and, therefore, less positive during the stay abroad. This research project was designed to accomplish the following purposes: to indicate what types of students change in what ways; as an aid in the selection of students for study abroad; to indicate the relationships between certain experiences and situations while abroad with attitude and value changes; as an aid in structuring study abroad programs; and to stimulate further research in this field.

The author suggests some external and internal factors that have a significant bearing on the general state of unions: substantial reforms in teaching, changes in college counseling centers, transformations in residence halls, and development of student subcultures off-campus. The internal factors are: paternalism, encapsulation, and preoccupation with management. The author attempts to relate these factors to a discussion of human development philosophy and methodology in comparison with union goals. Finally he gives emphasis to the relationship of governance to the development of effective citizens in a democracy as a critical educational function of the union. (Author/PG)",

The major programs consist of: (1) nonrepayable monetary awards, and (2) guaranteed educational loans. The purposes of the Commission's programs are to: (1) equalize educational opportunity; (2) preserve diversity in higher education by permitting freedom of institutional choice; (3) conserve public funds by making it possible for needy students to utilize unused spaces at Illinois nonpublic colleges; (4) permit a student's in-school employment or loans to be at a modest level so as to not affect his studies or career plan; (5) combine with institutional and federal aid and parents funds to meet the  college costs of the institution of the applicant's choice. The Monetary Award Program provides nonrepayable aid to needy students; neither test scores nor records are assessed when application is made. The Illinois State Scholarship Program identifies high school seniors with superior ability; and the Illinois Guaranteed Loan Program guarantees loans made for educational expenses. This document also presents statistical tables concerning the Commission's other programs: grants for children of Illinois prisoners of war, scholarships for bilingual students, and payments for veterans at public community colleges.

It shows that the students' response is related to the academic preparation they have received. In general students want evaluations to provide information to instructors concerning their courses and teaching. Part II assumes that student characteristics are related to student attitudes and that attitudes are related to responses on course evaluations. Evidence is presented that tends to support this assumption, but the author cautions against placing too much weight on this evidence. (Author)",

The differences in faculty salaries are investigated in relation to the extent these differences can be explained by relatively objective factors, such as lack of the Ph.D. and differences in performance, and to what extent they appear to be the result of discrimination. Using regression on more than 25 predicator variables, the salary of all faculty, of men faculty, and of women faculty in various types of universities and colleges and in various fields are estimated. The predictors that are not important in determining salary are not always the same for men and women, but both salaries are well predicted with a typical R of 0.8. It was found that when the estimated salary of a man and a woman of the same  abilities and performance were compared, the woman tends to be underpaid by about $1,500 annually, on the average. The amount of underpayment is more pronounced in the research universities in the biological and physical sciences, and at the higher levels--just where salaries tend to be highest and women are scarce. The apparent discrimination in faculty salary due to sex is strong and persists for every race. (Author)",

The total first-time freshmen class of 4,614, however, is slightly down for fall 1973 and fall 1972 indicating that vacancies existed. The first-time minority percentages are somewhat elevated as a result.

In addition to previous questions, the 14 schools with the greatest increase in new black freshmen over a 4-year period were compared with the 13 schools showing the greatest enrollment decrease on items relating to their methods and programs. Results from 109 of 110 schools (99%) indicate that new black freshman enrollment has increased to 6% nationally in the fall of 1973, compared to 5% in 1972, 4% in 1970 and 1971, and 3% in 1969. The Middle States area (which include Maryland) has made the greatest gain since 1969 (13% versus 6%). Schools are tending to use high school record and standardized tests (ACT,SAT) to admit all students more than in the past few years, but less weight is  being given such variables or recommendations in admitting blacks to special programs. Additionally, many fewer schools are using different admissions criteria to admit blacks to regular programs (14% in 1973, 26% in 1972, 20% in 1971, 36% in 1970 and 45% in 1969) despite evidence that the same admissions criteria are not equally fair for all students. Special programs for Native Americans and Spanish speaking students have increased while special programs for blacks have decreased in the last few years. The school most successful in enrolling blacks tended to emphasize academic programs (special or general, while the least successful schools tended to emphasize money in recruiting black students.

Chapter 3 deals with the market adjustment process characteristic of Ph.D. labor markets, by which individuals and enterprises respond to  supply-demand imbalances. One possible scenario for the doctorate market in the future is sketched out. Chapter 4 discusses policy implications of the analysis and suggests some practical next steps that would further improve our understanding of this complex subject.

The commonly claimed assumption that blacks are being given unfair and undeserved advantage over whites is examined at length and found unjustified. Bringing together relevant statistics and other data bearing on the effectiveness of equal employment opportunity programs more directly affected by federal laws and regulations, the study concentrates on 3 areas: government employment, federal contractor employment, and employment and admissions in institutions of higher learning. The report demonstrates how dramatic but misleading statistics can be and frequently are cited as indications of how far blacks have advanced in recent years. The report stresses that  economic growth has produced a favorable rate of advancement for both minorities and whites, but analysis makes it evident that after a decade of affirmative action policy the increased pace of minority progress is still not fast enough to ensure proportional representation even at the lowest management levels. It is suggested that perhaps disproportionate attention has been focused on the new access blacks have gained to the prestigious white institutions, but the proportion of blacks on campus remains low; they comprised 4.5% and 5.6% of total freshmen enrollment in 1969 and 1970, respectively.

        "description":"Among the freshmen who entered the City University of New York (CUNY) in fall 1970, about 63% were enrolled without interruption in each of their initial four semesters. Approximately 70% of them were enrolled in CUNY during spring 1972, the fourth semester since their original enrollment. At the senior college, more than 75% were in attendance during the fourth semester; this was true for 60% of the students from the community colleges. At both, high school average was positively associated with retention. Among students who left college, about 18% returned and were present for the fourth semester. While attrited students from community colleges were more likely to return than those from senior colleges, the differences were quite small. With regard to net retention rates, there  was considerable variation among the colleges of CUNY. There was even more variation in the rates of return of attrited students. When the CUNY net retention data over four semesters are compared with national data over eight semesters, it is apparent that considerably more attrition will have to occur before the CUNY net retention rate approaches the threshold defined by the national data.

        "description":"Since South Carolina had depended on graduate library schools outside the state for its source of professional library manpower, it was necessary for the University of South Carolina to establish in the State's first graduate library school a program that was relevant to the information needs in South Carolina. During 1971-72, ten library educators were recruited for the faculty of a new graduate library school. The purpose of the institute was for these ten educators to achieve three main goals: 1) to formulate goals and objectives for a new professional graduate school; 2) to design a curriculum consistent with the goals and objectives; 3) to select teaching methods and techniques capable of maximizing learning. They worked to achieve these goals through group dynamics. Both  the process and the product of the program were observed and evaluated at various points during the year. Assistance and assessment came from both the University personnel on the campus and from individuals of other institutions and recommendations concerned strengthening faculty and other resources to guarantee continuation of the innovative features of the projected program.

For example, document centers, clearinghouses, referral centers, and special libraries deal mainly with information in a broad sense. The main function of information analysis centers, however, is to optimize the ratio of knowledge to information generated. The key activities involve the analysis, interpretation, syntheses, evaluation, and repackaging of information. These functions and services are performed by high level professional personnel and subject experts. Because of this capability to distill reliable knowledge from information, information analysis centers can play a critical role in making better use of information already generated. (CH)",

A review of the literature relevant to school library services was made. In addition, interviews were conducted with people knowledgeable in the library field. The questionnaires were sent to librarians and teachers of 111 Ohio school districts, based on their size, economic condition, and geographic location. The quantitative results showed that many of the schools sampled did not meet all the minimum Ohio standards, and very few met all the standards of the American Library Association. A qualitative survey of the library services and their effectiveness, as well as the condition of the book collections and their current value to  the educational programs, revealed even greater deficiencies. There were extremes of high and low resources in small schools as well as in medium-sized and large schools, whether they were elementary, junior high, or senior high schools. However, there was a tendency for the deficiencies to be greater in the elementary schools. Recommendations were made concerning a state-wide program of library development, library physical facilities, library materials, library programs, and library organization and operation. (CH)",

Over the years, OE expenditures on library programs have had significant impact on public, school, and academic libraries. Now, the very success of these funding programs, and the assumption that they can now be better handled by state and local agencies, has prompted the Office of Education to gradually phase out funding, and to consider new initiatives which conform to a known Administration posture--that all Federal initiatives be closely tied to local innovative services. The proposed Information Partnership Act is based on  this percept; that the Federal government has a joint role with the states and localities. The Act's purpose is to encourage, support, and provide incentives to local, state and regional groups to work together to provide more accessible and comprehensive information services to more people. Included will be support of a wide range of cooperative information networks and of new information delivery systems for all types of libraries. (SL)",

First, the differences between the pre-coordination and post-coordination of terms are examined and a distinction is made between the library and documentary systems for indexing literature. Special attention has been paid to the manner of written and systematic presentation of index languages. Next, short, analytic descriptions of a number of existing thesauri or thesauri in preparation serve to introduce the problem of specificity versus universality in classification systems and thesauri. The Eudised  Thesaurus is placed side by side with others for this purpose. From the comparison of methods of construction used by the various thesauri, the conclusion is drawn that an increasing integration between classification systems and thesauri may be expected.

        "description":"Computers can effectively promote learning, but only if they are used in ways which are consistent with the natural processes of learning. The analysis of several computer-assisted instructional (CAI) projects reveals that computer-related learning environments are most successful when they closely resemble the natural learning environment found in the non-school world, thereby capitalizing on the student's inherent motivation to learn. This suggests that educators should adhere to the following principles when utilizing computers. First, the computer-related learning environment should be interactive and subject to learner control, thus permitting creativity. This means that students will help plan lessons, define problems and solutions, use tests as learning experiences, and  judge their own success. Secondly, students must be given the opportunity to make things work--to write and debug computer programs, for example--and should receive realistic recognition and rewards according to their degrees of success. Finally, students whould be encouraged to share what they have learned to do well by teaching it to others. (LB)",

Students in an engineering course received either conventional or computer-assisted instruction (CAI), and curvilinear regression procedures were used to construct models of achievement. Findings showed the CAI students achieved better in the course, although their overall grade point averages for the semester were not significantly better. Significant relations were found between instructional modes  and student factors in terms of achievement, but homogeneity of regression equations was not manifested. It was concluded that: 1) CAI was an effective instructional mode; 2) models of the student could be developed to predict achievement with a particular instructional mode, but their predictive value was limited; and 3) it was not possible to construct a predictive model of achievement which did not take into account the instructional mode.

The basic model created consisted of six function sets: 1) user self-servicing; 2) need processing; 3) solution building; 4) solution processing; 5) microsystem building; and 6) macrosystem building. Phase II of the project involved the application of the model to an applied research and development organization to determine if it would: 1) promote understanding of the perceptions of the DU process  held by members of the organization, and 2) help predict the internal behavior of and applied contributions made by the organization. The model did accurately describe the activities of the organization and helped the organization's researchers conduct attitudinal self-assessments.

EASSEED functions by directing students to instructional materials, the completion of which fulfills the goals set by the student. The system is organized into content and structure modules; the former direct the student to materials related to achieveable goals while the latter decompose broad goals into progressively more manageable sub-goals until a level is reached at  which a suitable instructional material is available. Goals are processed by the system's semantic net; all terms in the system are located in the net and pointers lead the student to higher order, equivalent, and implied terms. The system provides the basis of computer constructed education, for it can be used as a course prerequisite, supplement, or substitute, for course design and subject area definition, as a resource evaluator, and for generalized program support.

The computer program is branching and non-linear, with a small specialized dictionary. It provides the student with a series of 15 case histories and a list of laboratory studies from which to choose. For each case, the student receives and verifies the results of the tests he specifies and then makes a diagnosis.

This was achieved despite inequities in cognitive skills related to student background factors and inequities in resource distribution. In selected schools, 75% of the variance in cognitive skills in grade 7 could be predicted from background factors; this dropped to 66% after three years' participation in the reform program. In addition, students in reformed schools using ITV showed greater achievement than their counterparts in reformed schools without ITV. These results run counter to findings in the United States where background factors continue to dominate over innovations. There are at least three possible explanations. First, the  El Salvador study used a longitudinal rather than a one-shot, cross-sectional approach. Second, ITV might have had a greater impact in El Salvador because it represented a larger and qualitatively more significant input to the system, relative to the previously existing levels of service. Finally, the ITV was of consistent quality, whereas innovations in the United States often vary in quality. (LB)",

Based on the previous findings that improved attitude led to improved and more effective utilization, the Media Attitude Profile was given to students who had taken either the media or the methods course. The former group exhibited significantly more positive attitudes toward media. This was most likely due to the facts that these students were given greater information support with respect to media and were prepared to conceptualize more properly the role of instructional media in education. In addition, the students in the media  classes were at a more advanced stage in the teacher training program and thus it can be hypothesized that they more fully understood the overall integration of all aspects of the teaching-learning situation and were less anxious about using various instructional tools. In the light of these findings, it behooves teacher educators to include media training in teacher preparation programs, since media will be an increasingly important factor in education.

        "description":"Programed instructional techniques have been attacked as dehumanizing, dull, and restrictive. The possibility, however, that these deficiencies of programed instructional techniques have derived from a lack of creativity in application, rather than from the inherent nature of the techniques. To test this hypothesis, an evaluation was made of the Achievement Competence Training instructional materials which were used in the 5th grade of a number of schools in the Philadelphia area. The following features were built into these materials: 1) they used music, art, and humor; 2) they required interaction with other learners; 3) they presented a variety of activities; 4) they permitted the learner to report and manipulate self-data; and 5) they provided open ended learning activities.  An evaluation of the Achievement Competence Training program showed that programed instruction could be interesting and enjoyable, that it could promote content mastery, and that it could foster positive attitudes by the learner toward himself and his environment. In short, programed instruction can be humanizing if properly applied. (Author/PB)",

The Rhode Island system houses its agents in the Department of Education, rather than in local agencies, utilizes persons who were formerly subject matter specialists, and regards information services as one component of overall program development assistance. Evaluation of the system indicates that: 1) the role transformation from subject matter specialist to information specialist can be accomplished; 2) the extension system is effective, since it provides necessary information which  has an impact upon local schools; 3) the information system functions best when it adopts top and middle level management personnel as its local targets; and 4) that consultants function most effectively when they stress that information services are properly regarded as part of total program development assistance.

Two hundred and ninety-five students in public secondary schools in Indiana participated in the project; these were divided into experimental and control groups which received instruction in United States History. The former employed the simulation-Gaming techniques, the latter the lecture-discussion method Posttest results showed that both groups performed equally well with respect to cognitive achievement, but that students in the experimental group performed significantly better on a delayed interval posttest measure of cognitive retention. It was thus concluded that the simulation-gaming techniques represented a  pedagogical tool which significantly enhanced learning. (Author/PB)",

The paper first describes an algorithm as a procedure guaranteed to produce a correct result and lists its features as: 1) having a reasonably finite number of unambiguously defined operations; 2) having zero or more inputs from a specified domain; 3) having outputs with a relationship to the inputs; and 4) having operations sufficiently simple to be completed in a finite period. The second section reviews the use of algorithms to describe cognitive processes in learning and problem-solving; and the third, their use in developing instructional strategies. The fourth part of the paper examines the use of algorithms in task analysis; and the following section, their application to instructional materials.  The concluding segment discusses research issues related to the use of algorithms in learning and instruction, including the order in which the operations of and paths through algorithms are best taught, the demonstration of the interrelationships among an algorithm's components, and methods of teaching students to synthesize the steps of an algorithm, including the retrogression approach.

After three weeks the pupils were supplied with a series of art reproductions and professional photographs to serve as stimuli. A random sample of the final total of 3,480 pictures taken was analyzed in terms of subject matter, style, theme, and technical competence. Results indicated that people were the chief subject matter of the snapshots and that there was little change in this factor over the duration of the project. However, the pictures did change  in style and theme after the stimuli were presented, indicating that the children sought new ways to use their cameras. In addition, technical competence with the camera increased. It was concluded that experiences with the medium of photography promoted visual awareness. (Author/PB)",

Abstracts of articles providing opinion, new methodology, evaluative summary and literature reviews were of a summarizing descriptive nature. Abstracts of articles reporting sampling studies, correlational analysis, and experimental data were prepared more comprehensively so that they might often be used in lieu of the article. A common format was used with a bibliographic/indexing  information page and an evaluation checklist being included. The principal results of the effort are as follows: 1) a paper file of 2,693 abstracts, 2) a card file of titles, 3) a coordinate index, 4) a comprehensive key work index and bibliography, and 5) MT/ST tapes of 1,950 of the abstracts.

One approach considers reviews on a continuum of criticality ranging from the bibliographic review through the interpretive to the critical. Another considers types of reviews as information requirements necessary to the development of innovations or the solution of problems. A third alternative characterizes reviews according to the purpose of the producers and the consumers. A final approach shows how criteria may be derived from 1) the type of intellectual processing applied to the preparation of the review, 2) its characteristics (readability, currency, etc.), and 3) its substance.

Section two concerns citizens' evaluations and perceptions of their nearest library. Section three is concerned with usage or potential usefulness of various public library services. Section four details attitudes  toward libraries--likes and dislikes, desirable purposes for libraries to fulfill, and opinions on particular issues of interest.

The first chapter of the report provides some background on cable in New York City and reviews the project's work in education, research, advocacy and programing. The next two chapters deal, respectively, with costs and examples of programing generated by the public. Chapter IV reports on the Center's production experiences, Chapter V on municipal uses of the channels, and  Chapter VI on city, state and Federal regulations and related topics such as liability, censorship, and the common carrier status of CATV channels. The conclusions reached are that broadly-based usage will occur only if greater audience penetration is achieved, if viewers adopt interactive rather than passive attitudes toward CATV, and if better technical equipment and financing are obtained.

With the introduction of moderately priced graphics terminals, it will become even more important in the future as rapid graphic interaction between the engineer and the computer becomes more feasible in computer-aided design (CAD). To provide a vehicle for introducing undergraduate engineering students to the applications of CAD in the automatic control area, a series of three programs--named Control Oriented Interactive Graphical Analysis and Design (COINGRAD)--has been written. These incorporate the basic calculations in this area, including time response, frequency response, and root locus; in addition, a limited optimization facility is included with the time and frequency response programs. The major  features of the programs include graphic interactive capability and ease of operation for the user. (Author)",

A survey was sent to 375 randomly selected districts throughout the State requesting information about model programs dealing with any of the following: curriculum, staffing patterns, office organization, gifted programs, slow learner programs, programs for the emotionally disturbed, individualized learning, advisory committees, career and vocational education, the use of department chairmen, or other innovative programs. The returned data were organized into a taxonomy of educational programs in order to facilitate easy retrieval. The six major categories of 1) alternative education, 2) career-vocational education, 3) curriculum, 4)  instructional techniques, 5) management, and 6) special education were developed; subcategories were constructed for each of the foregoing and programs arranged alphabetically in each class. Each of the more than 800 citations in the taxonomy supplies information on the program's title, a description of its features, the district's name, location and chief characteristics, and the person to contact for additional details.

The following major recommendations were made. First, it was suggested that the Advisory Council on Libraries created for the study, be maintained, and that a centralized public library system be developed with adequate financing, administration and staff provided. Second, it was recommended that centralized acquisitions be made, that a community resource file be developed, that an audiovisual software collection and delivery service be established, and that professional collection for teachers be housed in the public library. Third, the study concluded that school libraries needed to be  upgraded, particularly with respect to their reference collections, equipment and processing, that recreational reading titles should be placed directed in classrooms, that a school volunteer library group be formed, and that a library arts center be created. Finally, it was recommended that teachers be given library inservice programs and that library education count toward the necessary units for teacher recertification; at the same time, it was felt that students should also receive additional library education.

Strict controls can be approached in the laboratory setting, but as the experimenter moves from the laboratory to the field study, especially in developing countries, concessions to realism must be made. In these situations, the experimenter finds his control over conditions eroded by geographic isolation and the lack of financing and facilities, by the degree of commitment and interference of administrators, and by the moral imperative for total reform which denies the opportunity to exclude control groups from innovation. Nevertheless, cross-media field studies can be useful in evaluating the success of new systems,  for conducting pilot studies, and for planning purposes, for what they lose in controls they gain in realism. Such studies are particularly effective when the researcher is aware of necessary trade-offs, provides the client group with descriptive and cost data on a full range of dependent variables, develops local tests, and helps to designate the maximally effective instructional system under a given set of environmental conditions.

Pictorial analogues of verbal materials and tests were developed and the added measures of 1) Cloze Comprehension, 2) Concept Cloze Comprehension, and 3) Post-Instructional Concept Similarity Ratings were used. Analysis of performance measures indicated that the Inscal technique aided the definition of information complexity of technical material, the development of sequences of concepts, and the creation of an index of  inter-rater consensus. Parameter values selected for the Phase II experiment included: 1) determination of presentation rate; 2) selection of performance measures; 3) refinement of presentation and test modes; 4) selection of three instructional sequences; and 5) inclusion of individual difference measures to assess variance in student aptitude.

The continuous flight task was broken into discrete categories of flight; each category combined an instrument configuration with a return-to-criterion aircraft control response. Three methods of sequencing categories during pretraining were compared. One group was pretrained by the presentation of categories in a natural task sequence; the second group was pretrained on categories presented in random order; the third group received no category pretraining. Significant positive transfer was found for both the sequenced and random forms of pretaining relative to the control group. Transfer percentages ranged from 7% to 48% throughout transfer practice.

First, technology is generally an added-on, teacher-dependent tool, although there is a trend to student-focused, individualized uses. Second, technology does not lead to increased learning, although it can offer advantages such as time savings and curricular enrichment. Third, educational technology is expensive and as long as student time in school is fixed independent of learning, less capital intensive approaches will be more cost effective. Finally, the activities of the Federal agencies are focused upon the newer technologies such as educational television, simulations, computer-assisted instruction and multimedia systems. Thus, it is evident that technology is not about to  revolutionize education by radically lowering costs or increasing instructional effectiveness. There is a need for both the coordination of Federal activities in the area of educational technology and for greater dissemination of information about successful implementations. Finally, educational technology's hardware needs to be standardized and more attention should be paid to the use of technology for special applications and with special populations, rather than as a substitute for conventional instruction.

Structured interviews were held to assess the information needs of both researchers and practitioners and an investigation was conducted of 10 computer-based information storage and retrieval systems which could serve as the basis for a technical information system. Question-answering computer systems relying on artificial intelligence concepts were reviewed and considered in terms of providing a prescriptive interactive system. It was concluded that practicable generalized semantic information retrieval systems would require further development. It was further decided that the design and implementation of a natural language  automated information retrieval system encompassing the rudimentary features of a prescriptive system was feasible, both in terms of the technical information resources provided and its cost-effectiveness. Lastly, an on-line interactive retrieval system was designed and a model data base of approximately 500 literature-derived comprehensive abstracts was implemented and tested to confirm the feasibility of the system.

A consumer message team was developed by CCT and the stations, consisting of experts on medicine, nutrition, child development, and television production, along with diverse groups of parents. A series of educational &quot;sports&quot; or &quot;ads&quot; were produced and televised; indications were that these had an  impact upon children's behavior.

These games were designed to run on digital computers and to deal with material from either biology, physics, or social studies. Distribution was achieved through the Digital Equipment Corporation, which disseminated teacher manuals, resource manuals, and student manuals to over 600 teachers and 25,000 students in 400 secondary schools during the 1972-73 school year; these target populations were expected to quadruple in the following year. Evaluation of the use of the computerized simulation games led to the conclusion that they made a significant contribution to learning. This was particularly true in situations in which students were denied direct  experience with the phenomena being studied due to such problems as the students' inexperience with experimental techniques, the lack of laboratory equipment or time, difficulty or danger in obtaining adequate samples, and the impossibility of controlling extraneous variables in real life.

It illustrates the development of the library catalog and associated systems as both realistic and practical. It indicates what kind of repercussions will be felt by the library and how it could improve the service to the readers. The advantages and disadvantages of the various alternative means of producing the new catalog are discussed. It is considered that the relative complexity of microfilmed catalogs, compared with the printed catalog, might well generate further adverse public comment. For this reason the feasibility study team considers the printed book version as the most satisfactory method of producing the catalog. The  use of disc storage facilities is expected to reduce annual operational costs. Initial development and conversion costs are estimated on the basis of the existing installation at County Hall, though future hardware provision may necessitate some modification. At the current rate of growth, under normal conditions, the size of the catalog is expected to increase by approximately 5-10% per annum. This is not likely to cause insurmountable processing problems. (Author/CH)",

On the other hand, the global method provides only brief introductions to particular aspects of programing and plunges students quickly into writing their own programs. It is more effective because it  gives them actual experience, thereby paralleling the manner in which natural languages are learned. Secondly, the education of computer programers would be greatly enhanced if the students were allowed to use the computer itself more often; such hands-on experience stimulates interest, reinforces factual learning, and promotes creative development.

The goals of the institute were to increase librarians' understanding of the culture and needs of the Spanish-surnamed, through lectures and discussion with the participating community leaders, and to translate these needs into effective use of library materials. Each team  developed such a plan for the library of their own community. Major efforts at evaluating the institute were concerned with the anonymous reports submitted on the last day by the participants.

The 22 participants examined the tasks performed by various library personnel and attempted to evolve new task groupings which would fully utilize the talents and increased educational background of library personnel of all levels. A product of the institute was a series of detailed job descriptions for library aides, technical assistants, library associates, librarians and senior librarians. The institute was evaluated by two questionnaires administered to the participants: one, a scaled reaction to the goals of the institute, the other, an open-ended questionnaire to gauge participant satisfaction with the  two-week program. Detailed analysis of the questionnaire returns is provided in this report. (SL)",

The conclusion is reached that microforms are an inexpensive, flexible means of storing large quantities of materials in small areas. Given the increaseing trend toward the availability of microforms and the  decreasing resistance to them by users, it is recommended that the Polytechnic's Library and Learning Resources Service begin to acquire microforms of major periodical runs and special collections and to invest in the necessary equipment.

Male volunteer college students in good health were assigned to three groups, depending on their having extensive, little, or no computer experience. All subjects completed a non-projective anxiety measure, received a lecture on computer utilization, and worked through a computer task. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and electro-dermal response measured anxiety. Results indicated that regardless of previous exposure, subjects experienced anxiety, as reflected by physiological changes, during the initial part of the  computer task, but that continued \"hands on\" manipulation reduced anxiety below the pre-exposure level. Additional research should determine how to control extraneous anxiety-producing variables, investigate the effects of a variety of anxiety-reduction techniques, and examine the cause-effect relationship between anxiety and computer terminal operating efficiency.

One section of the students in the basic survey course, Foundations of Librarianship, used microfiche copies of their assigned readings, the other two sections obtained the same readings in the reserve book room as usual. At semester end, an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to the class. Although sample size and study limitations precluded drawing firm conclusions, results indicated that reaction to the microreadings was positive by all concerned; the microfiche were felt to be preferable to the  reserve book system. Problems noted were the availability of microfiche readers and the technical difficulties and costs of the microfilming process and of obtaining copyright release from publishers.

A description of the goal-setting efforts of ten major libraries illustrates various steps in this process. Many libraries have responded to the challenge of planning by undertaking systematic programs of management analysis. One such program is the Management Review and Analysis Program (MRAP), developed by the Association of Research Libraries. Becasue most written statements of objectives have been formulated recently, conclusions about their applications and effectiveness can only be tentative. While mission and objective  statements have value, a statement that does not include performance goals may risk remaining only a statement of intent. However, because the process of setting performance goals can be costly and time-consuming, very little work has been done to develop explicit goals; and it can be concluded that the use of objectives as a management tool is not yet a fully developed process in library management.

Results showed that speed and ease of use were the controlling factors in an urban information system and that there should be centralized input of recent acquisitions which should include statistical, legislative and administrative information. A computerized information retrieval system was found to be feasible, despite some anti-computer sentiment. Libraries were willing to provide terminal hardware, but wanted user support for input and searching. User agencies appeared conditioned to expend time on  information retrieval, but not to contribute money. Thus it was felt that it would be necessary to demonstrate the cost-effective nature of computerized information systems to urban agencies which were heavy users of information before such systems could be implemented.

These attitude, evaluation, and use factors were considered in relation to the actual quality of the system as rated independently by the information services department staff. Data were collected on input-output quality; adequacy of training; management support; quality and kinds of reports generated; input error ratings; usefulness; accuracy; timeliness, flexibility; completeness; and pressure to reprogram the system. Step-wise multiple regression  was used to analyze the data, which did show an association between actual quality of systems, and quality as perceived by users, with favorable user attitude. These favorable attitudes and evaluations were also positively associated with system usage. Further, increased voluntary use may be predicted by favorable attitudes, which provides good reasons for information services to develop high quality systems and favorable user attitudes. (LS)",

        "description":"An investigation was made of the feasibility of computer-managed instruction (CMI) for the Navy. Possibilities were examined regarding a centralized computer system for all Navy training, minicomputers for remote classes, and shipboard computers for on-board training. The general state of the art and feasibility of CMI were reviewed, alternative computer languages and terminals studied, and criteria developed for selecting courses for CMI. Literature reviews, site visits, and a questionnaire survey were conducted. Results indicated that despite its high costs, CMI was necessary if a significant number of the more than 4000 Navy training courses were to become individualized and self-paced. It was concluded that the cost of implementing a large-scale centralized computer system  for all training courses was prohibitive, but that the use of minicomputers for particular courses and for small, remote classes was feasible. It was also concluded that the use of shipboard computers for training was both desirable and technically feasible, but that this would require the acquisition of additional minicomputers for educational purposes since the existing shipboard equipment was both expensive to convert and already heavily used for other purposes.

Results from a questionnaire completed by aides and from interviews with the participating families showed that the use of a larger type size, of illustrations, and of colored paper each positively influenced the users' evaluations of the materials.

They serve as film analogues to the Rorschach and Thematic Apperception Tests and have been used in such varying fields as gerontology, drug abuse education, driver training, mental retardation, jurisprudence, human relations, dental education, and library science. They provide an initial stimulus and only the most pertinent information, deal with realistic situations,  and conclude at an open-ended high point where the conflict is unresolved and alternative solutions are possible. They are useful in group discussion and, when properly used, serve to break down defense mechanisms and to provoke thoughtful consideration of problematic situations. (Author/PB)",

Teachers were successfully trained in the use of Coursewriter and prepared courses in audiology, mathematics, engineering economics, and cost accounting. Posttests administered to small groups of students who took the courses revealed that both performance and attitude correlated positively with aptitude, although the attitude measure was more likely a function of performance than a reaction to CAI as a method. Since aptitude correlated with criterion-referenced achievement, the goal of maximum criterion achievement  for each student via individualized CAI was not attained; likewise, since the number of errors made by students correlated negatively with posttest scores, it appeared that the remedial branches were not serving their intended function. The high incidence of substantially correct answers entered improperly showed the need for building complex answer processing capabilities into the computer. (PB)",

The former used the CAI program SPELL, relying upon an IBM 1410 system and the COURSEWRITER I language; the latter received conventional instruction. Posttesting after 15 weeks indicated no significant overall differences between the two treatments; significant gains for low-ability students from one school were noted, irrespective of treatment, and for low- and medium-ability students in the CAI group in a second school. It was also learned that the  pupils accepted CAI despite some hardward problems, that is was possible to discern the mode by which individual students learned best, and that school personnel could be trained to use CAI.

An historical perspective reviews the study and teaching of these skills, examines relevant research and theoretical positions, and presents information on the use of television and other media in teaching these skills, lastly, the complexity of a life-coping skills curriculum is cited as necessitating a series of curriculum projects as opposed to one massive effort. It is therefore recommended that a prospectus be prepared for another level of the &quot;Inside/Out&quot; series in life-coping  skills education. In Part II, the recommendation is made for a new television series similar to &quot;Inside/Out&quot; and consisting of 15 programs for children aged 11 to 13. This series would stress the major individual and interpersonal concerns of early adolescence and would include the development of support material for teachers. (Author/PB)",

The programs will focus upon essential skills in the areas of communications, computation, inquiry, and analysis and evaluation and will be organized at three levels for children of kindergarten age through eight years, eight through ten, and ten through 12. Instruction will emphasize increasingly difficult uses of these skills and stress their continuous practical application in realistic situations. Each program will be brief and based upon sound educational principles relating to instructional design, pre- and post-assessment, evaluation, reinforcement, feedback, and application. Specialists drawn from among teachers, educational  researchers, psychologists and television professionals will comprise the production team and insure that the programs are faithful to these basic instructional precepts.

Adult education requires coordinated planning, effective guidance and counseling, improvement in faculty training, and curricula that meet the demands of mature students. A model for adult education programs is presented which provides for a centralized administration of resources and services supervised by the community college Dean of Community Education and Services. This administrator is assisted by an advisory committee composed of citizens and faculty members. Faculty and counselors are recruited from each local district as well as from the community college staff. The community college is responsible for  developing and conducting inservice professional education programs. Curriculum, staff selection, and instruction are determined primarily by the school district. The management and distribution of resources is thus accomplished at a centralized level while educational decisions directly affecting the citizen are made by those closest to him. (Author/SW)",

Board members' opinions were obtained as well to determine their perceptions concerning the major problems facing community colleges and the level at which resolution to these problems should occur. The main objective of the inquiry was to determine what the State board members feel are the major problems in governance and to relate the time spent at meetings to these concerns. Board agendas and minutes and members' opinions were obtained via mail. Analysis of agendas and minutes reveals that State boards devote the most time to financial matters, facilities  and curricula, in that order, followed by personnel, policy matters and students. Board members considered the three most pressing matters to be finances, curricula, and articulation-coordination. Other problem areas mentioned were facility improvement, sources for planning, and insufficient staff. Responses are tabulated in an appendix, and a copy of the questionnaire is provided.

Rather than increase local attendance rates, the public junior college appears to substitute attendance locally for attendance elsewhere in a manner inversely related to social status. Among persons of lower social status backgrounds, in particular, the substitution effect is such as to replace attendance at non-local four-year institutions with attendance at the local  public junior college. It is suggested, therefore, that public junior colleges may function latently to divert lower status persons from going on to the four-year institutions and, in the process, \"cool-out\" social group demands for entry into the more prestigious four-year institutions of higher education. Public junior colleges may act, then, to reinforce prevailing social inequality rather than to diminish it. (Author)",

Adult education is often a specific assignment to the public school system, to the community colleges, and to the universities. A large amount of energy is expended by professional people in each system attempting to carry out their assignments. Some reactions to this problem are listed, including (1) laissez faire or no assignment of responsibility, (2) assignment according to age, (3) assignment according to level of content, (4) assignment according to prior commitment, and (5) assignment through a planning process.

Attrition is defined as withdrawal from a mathematics course and registering the following semester. The main purpose of this report is to examine the underlying causes of the department's attrition problem and to formulate policies and solutions. A detailed comparison is made between the students enrolled in Math 107 in Fall 1971 and in Fall 1972.

Evaluations were made through the use of a semantic differential-type attitude scale. Analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant increase in favorable evaluations toward the Vietnamese only. The reason the evaluation toward the Negroes did not demonstrate similar change may have been due to the fact that Caucasian subjects' attitudes toward Negroes are too psychologically significant an issue to be  modified by a single session of conditioning trials.

The term &quot;handicapped preschool child&quot; is defined, and a list of handicapped conditions and the special needs they may generate is presented. For purposes of identification and discussion, the following categories are considered: auditorially-handicapped children, chronically-ill children, emotionally-disturbed children, mentally retarded children, orthopedically-handicapped children, speech-impaired children, visually-handicapped children, and multiple-handicapped children.

The effective implementation of a comprehensive child care model that will sustain the youngster in his family/community requires critical changes in priorities, programs, and in the locus of decision-making power.

(1) The nutrition component is aimed at helping parents make the best use of food resources through good planning, buying, and cooking. (2) The health program involves provision of medical and dental services to the target children of Home Start, and to siblings and parents when possible. (3) Psychological and social services include family counseling by Home Start staff members, and referral and consultation services by mental health agencies in the area. (4) The education component focuses on parent instruction. Educational materials are provided for use at home, and parents work with the children at a Home Start center one day a week.  A daily television show for the children is included in the program. (5) The major emphasis of Home Start is on Parent Involvement. Parents are considered the major source of help for their own children. They learn to improve interactions with the child at home, and are encouraged to communicate openly with peers at group meetings. Also, participation in community decision making is strongly encouraged. Staff development is a major concern of the TARCOG program and pre-service workshop and ongoing in-service training experiences are described. Finally, discussion focuses on the benefits of the regional approach and interagency cooperation. (DP)",

It was found that sucking and rooting are precursor attachment behaviors that may become tied into the attachment system if a baby is allowed much initiative in attaining the breast, but that the behaviors do not necessarily become so. From an analysis of mother-infant interaction, it was concluded that the feeding situation does have a significant relationship to the kind of attachment the child develops, to later problems in feeding, and even to later so-called 'oral' problems that are not directly related to  feeding. One of the conclusions of the study was that the time has come to reopen the issue of the effects of breast versus bottle feeding on both maternal behavior and infant behavior and the interaction between them.

Short daily lessons were given to an entire kindergarten class simultaneously and were centered around a set of 40 cards containing various lines and shapes. Children were asked to analyze and describe these elements on the cards, locate objects in the room containing the elements, and then replicate the design themselves on a work sheet. The visuals start with a single line element and progress with increasing difficulty to shape/line combinations. In an attempt to show the growth generated by the pilot program, children were pre- and posttested in experimental and control classes with the 'A' (pretest) and 'B' (posttest) editions of the Knobler Perception  Development Series.

Further, it was hypothesized that praise in Spanish would be more reinforcing to a Mexican-American child than praise delivered in English. A bar-pressing task was used to assess the child's continued motivation to perform. The results indicate that examiner ethnicity was a much stronger determinant of bar pressing behavior than the language in which praise was given.

Preschoolers acted out sentences in which the use of the two principles would lead to different results. The results strongly favored their having adopted the Semantic Role Principle. In the second study, it was found that situational relations among lexically unspecified actors were also inadequate to explain preschool children's performance. The hypothesis adopted was that as children use contextual information to interpret the reference of missing complement subjects, they relate this  interpretation to semantic role relations among the lexically specified deep structure noun phrases of the main clause.

Data were gathered by means of questionnaires and interviews conducted in the homes of 559 mothers of young children. An in-depth analysis was conducted on a subsample of 132 mothers. The majority of mothers experssed feelings of concern for their own status when considering child care services. Their role perceptions and expectations tend to dictate that whenever possible the mother should be in the home caring for her  own children. Relatively few referred either to their child's needs or to the pragmatic aspect of early child care.

Self-esteem was assessed by the &quot;How I See Myself&quot; inventory, which was administered to 377 parent educators at the beginning and end of the '71-'72 school year. Teaching behavior was analyzed by viewing videotaped interactions between teacher and parent educator and between parent educator and mother for the following variables: (1) Praising and accepting, (2) open questions, (3) closed questions, (4) lecturing, and (5) directing. Tapes were available for only  11 teachers and 10 parent educators. Life style changes were evaluated by two questionnaires, completed by 535 parent educators and project coordinators. There were significant gains in one of four factors (competence) of the self-concept measure. Teaching behavior changed in desired directions for all variables except closed questions. Finally, life style changes were reflected in self reports of increased effort to continue education, feelings of increased ability to speak &quot;school type&quot; English, and more confidence in understanding and managing children.

Twenty-four pre-kindergarten children were interviewed with the Photodoll Sociometric Instrument to gain information on their choice of playmates and peer models, and on their perceptions of peers showing positive and negative behavior. Social class and race were significant factors in the choice of playmates and peer models in the fall, but these effects were reduced by spring. Low income and ethnic minority children were more frequently named for showing negative behavior both in the fall and spring.

        "description":"Discussion centered on three sets of factors that may influence the variability observed in &quot;concept identification&quot; (concept formation and discrimination learning) studies: stimulus characteristics, incentives employed, and subject characteristics. Stimulus characteristics are described in terms of the number of dimensions simultaneously present in the conceptual task. A study which investigated developmental differences in concept identification when memory aids were introduced for tasks of varying levels of complexity was described. The aids were helpful to all children, but especially to older subjects, and there was a remarkable variability in performance noticed. The incentive conditions of such studies may account for some of this variability, as indicated by reward versus  punishment studies in which the punished subjects performed reliably better on complex tasks than rewarded subjects do. Finally, the effect of subject variables, in terms of cognitive style was investigated through a study of relationships between impulsive style and Stanford Binet I.Q. Thirty-three disadvantaged preschool children were administered two tests of ability to inhibit motor ability. Results showed that the two measures did correlate with the Binet in this sample, and the ability to inhibit motor performance had little to do with understanding of test instructions. Thus, cognitive style may be an important determiner of conceptual identification. (DP)",

Six home day care systems were studied in order to provide the Office of Child Development with relevant information about the organization of such systems, how they changed over time, and the major problems involved in home day care. The research methodology involved initial needs assessment of existing family home day care systems based upon their degree of compilance with the 1972 requirements. Through ongoing assessment procedures, trends of improvement or regression were analyzed and rated for each system. In each of the six sites, 20 home-based centers served as the demonstration group, receiving input from  the project, and 20 were designated as controls. Conclusions of the evaluation were generally optimistic, suggesting that compliance with federal standards can be achieved at relatively low cost.

The importance of play is reviewed from the perspective of many different theories of development. A general normative sequence of development of play behavior is presented for infancy through age five. Daydreaming and sociodramatic play are  discussed in terms of the role of the adult, recent research findings, environmental and equipment influences, and sequence of development and significance of imaginative ability. Finally, common observation methods are reviewed, with emphasis on the need for parents and teachers to refine and use observational skills. (DP)",

        "description":"The Joint Hearing before the U.S. Senate's Subcommittee on Education and the Special Subcommittee on Human Resources was particulary concerned with the problems of bilingual education. The hearing, held February 1973 in Los Angeles, California, focused on the Southwest in general and on California in particular because of the greater bilingual needs in these areas. The Bilingual Act first became law as a part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments (ESEA) of 1967. Now, however, since nearly $100 million has been spent under the bilingual education program during the past 5 years, the time has come for an assessment of the needs of bilingual education and the ability of the act to meet those needs. Statements on the needs of Mexican Americans in both California  and the Southwest as a whole were presented by community representatives, manpower development personnel, Southwestern and Los Angeles educators, U.S. Representatives from California, and members of the California State Department of Education. Additional information was covered by articles and publications, such as &quot;Bienvenidos: Mexican Americans Hail Opening of Occupational Center&quot;, and &quot;The Excluded Student: Educational Practices Affecting Mexican Americans in the Southwest&quot;. Selected tables detail: California -- total and Spanish language population by county (1970); Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Budget (fiscal 1972, 1973); Spanish surnamed students -- University of Southern California; and U.S. Government employment statistics (1970).

Chapter I, The Project Rationale and Setting, explains that the project focuses on small farmers in less developed countries, specifically Costa Rica. It was assumed, however, that the system of analysis developed would have general application to the study of public institutions serving agriculture. Chapter II, Data Gathered by the Modules of Inquiry, includes a general view of the agricultural task environment, covering the small farm setting, the agricultural agent, the regional organization, and the orientation and knowledge level of national administrative leaders, An Evaluation of the Modular Research Approach (Chapter III) attempts to set forth some of the problems the research team  encountered, especially the political issues that were the consequences of particular interests of the other organizations involved in this project. For Chapter IV, Suggestions for Facilitating Institutional Change, the study team accepted the premise that public institutions, a dominant force in agricultural development projects, should have small farmers share in the development process so that their needs can be more effectively met. Covering the management workshop, change agent training, and small farmer organizations, the chapter concludes that new institutions or major revisions of old ones will be required to meet the expanding needs of the small farmer. The Appendix, Management Training for Rural Sector Change, explains organizational change strategies and the organizational  process. (KM)",

In addition, numerous conversations were held with various Bureau of Indian Affairs officials, personnel involved in Community Action Programs, police personnel, and school officials. The data were put into table forms; e.g., cases involving juveniles charged with delinquent acts dealt with by the Court of Indian Offenses, and charges against  juveniles by the Lander Police Department and the Fremont County Sheriff's Department during fiscal year 1971. The 16 major findings cover various areas, such as: from 1967-71, 1,047 cases involving juveniles were adjudicated by the Court of Indian Offenses; and approximately 2/3 of the delinquency cases involved males and 1/3 involved females. Ten specific suggestions for delinquency prevention and treatment programs are listed; e.g., every effort should be made to increase employment opportunities for both Indian adults and youths and the existing alcoholism rehabilitation program on the reservation should be evaluated and every effort should be made to make it as effective as possible.

Therefore, a self-report questionnaire on delinquent acts, alcohol use, and drug use was developed during the spring of 1972 and administered to 9th-12th grade students at Lander Valley High School and Wind River High School. The findings were based on a sample of 355 white males and 315 females; 68 Indian males  and 62 females. There was little overall difference in the delinquency involvement of Indian and Anglo males--with the notable exception that Indians were more involved than Anglos in offenses centering around the school. Compared to Anglos, a significantly higher portion of both male and female Indian youths had doubts about whether or not they would complete high school, did not plan to attend college, felt that they were not as smart as their peers, received lower grades in school, and had dropped out of school. With respect to illegal drug use, a higher porportion of Indian than Anglo males had used drugs, other than marijuana, and a higher proportion of Indian than Anglo females had smoked marijuana. The fequency of various delinquent acts were presented in tabular form.  (FF)",

The report covers the first NIBEC held in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1973, and presents a prologue to the second NIBEC to be held in Billings, Montana, May 6-9, 1974. The 5 conference topics included in the proceedings are: bilingual classroom strategies, bilingual staff development, community participation, bilingual program administration, and bilingual materials development. Though the styles of these 5 articles differ greatly, they all emanate from the same resources, the recorded tapes  of all the 1973 NIBEC sessions. It is hoped that the recording of the 1973 ideas will help NIBEC 1974 in maintaining this valuable dialogue among Indian educators.

Citizens' committees, boards of education, administration, and teachers provided consultant information about their schools. The evaluation committees, comprised of citizens from the Pawnee and Divernon School districts, provided most of the information included in the 7 chapters of this report. This report covers: (1) a historical background of the communities and school districts; (2) curriculum; (3) building facilities; (4) pupil services; (5) financial status; (6) population trends and school enrollent; and (7) staff. Most of the recommendations made by each committee reflect their own values, hopes, and expectations for their children and their  schools--for instance, chapter 6 recommends that, on the basis of recent population and school enrollment trends, it would appear both feasible and desirable for the 2 districts to consolidate. The 25 conclusions include such things as: Divernon's future population is more difficult to predict; both high schools had very good holding power records; and the dropout rates were low. Recommendations favor consolidation for these reasons: (1) the number of Illinois public school districts has decreased every year since 1945; (2) the trend in Illinois is toward consolidation; and (3) small school districts frequently lack an economic and population base adequate to support an effective educational program. Data concerning the 2 high schools--such as course offerings, library facilities,  equipment, salaries, and enrollment--are presented in tabular form. (FF)",

Safety programs in schools should develop knowledge, habits, and attitudes in order to eliminate, as far as possible, the dangers of accidental death or injury to children. It should inform these future adults of their responsibilities for providing safe and efficient school plant and transportation facilities, including adequate instruction and a medical examination for school bus drivers. Safety is usually considered an area of health instruction and should receive emphasis in relation to the students' and the community's needs. In this curriculum guide, students are divided by grade into 5 categories (i.e., grades 1-3; grades 4-6).  Desired outcomes in terms of knowledge, attitudes and practices, suggested experiences and activities, and evaluations are given for each. For grades 10-12, suggestions are made for including safety instruction in subject areas such as home economics, agriculture, and science. First aid practices that every student should know are explained for both elementary and high school students. The document also includes references, sources for free safety materials, and a source and availability index for filmstrips. (KM)",

In terms of man-months of labor, rural counties provided less than 25% of the total seasonal farm employment in 1973, while urban Yakima County alone provided 31%, even though agriculture is the predominant activity in rural areas. Of the approximately 10,000 migrant farmworkers who enter the state each year, over 43% work in Yakima County. The brief annual summary is broken down into: planning; economic developments (especially industrialization); employment and unemployment trends; services for rural people; rural manpower programs and activities for farmworkers; and community and public  relations activities. The only serious problems in the program were those caused by staff reductions. The major recommendation is the implementation of adequately funded results-oriented programs designed to satisfy the needs and desires of the persons to be served. Workers indicated a preference for more housing rather than more housing regulations, for contra-seasonal jobs and job training rather than more studies, and for dignified compassionate treatment rather than pity. The tables which comprise the majority of the report, include such areas as employment of seasonal agricultural workers by area, local office, and crop activity; composition of interstate farm migrant groups; and temporary seasonal rural manpower offices and activities.

The 4 verbal act modes in the model were called appraisal, prescriptive, informational, and questioning. This observational study attempted to test verbal interaction relationships at the bilingual elementary school level in classrooms of varying racial/ethnic composition, intelligence, and achievement. The sample consisted of 36 audio-taped classroom lessons recorded during a 10 day observation period. Four lessons from each of the 9 elementary (K, 1-3) bilingual classrooms in the program were selected. The racial/ethnic composition of the classrooms ranged from 35-68%  Mexican American, 3-52% black, and 4-55% white. A total of 2,010 classroom interactions were observed, recorded, and analyzed. Results showed that teacher expectation were related significantly. The Metropolitan Readiness Test and Otis-Lennon Mental Ability Test scores were not correlated significantly with pupil verbal performance in these bilingual classrooms. Prescriptive standards were related specifically to the initiated acts of male pupils and the positive self-referenced acts of female pupils in the high Mexican American classrooms. It was also suggested that considerable teacher attention, interaction, and emphasis on prescriptive control was directed at Mexican American pupils. (FF)",

A sample of 100 migrant household heads were interviewed to learn why they had moved to Seattle, to gain insights into the adjustment process, and to search for ways to facilitate their accommodation to an urban life style. All of the Spanish speaking minority group have adaption problems, such as language, but distinct subgroups have differing social and economic characteristics that are identified with unique adjustment problems. The primary discerning variable is whether the migrant household moved from a rural or an urban background. An effort was made to ascertain, from the migrant's vantage point, the role and effectiveness of public agencies in facilitating the  adjustment. The report concludes with policy recommendations for alleviating some of the individual and societal dysfunctions of this transition--i.e., the establishment of a widely publicized bilingual information agency.

Its primary purpose is to provide basic manpower information essential for planning and developing effective services and programs for the Acoma Pueblo Indians. Manpower resource characteristics are presented for age and sex, family characteristics, and educational attainment. Although population registers maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs listed 1, 654 people 16 years of age or older, when a random sample of 500 of these names was selected, only 275 could be located on the reservation. On the basis of this, the population 16 years of age and over is estimated at 910 people. It is noted that about 41 percent of the Acoma working-age  population are in the labor force. Information is presented on sources of income and consumation patterns. The consumption patterns show that Acoma families depend heavily upon off-reservation stores for their consumer goods. A major conclusion was that Acoma successes in raising their level of living will be dependent upon their ability to obtain off-reservation employment. (PS)",

Since no accurate records of people residing on the Laguna Reservation were available before this study, a list maintained by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) was modified to arrive at a sampling frame. The size of the reservation's total working-age human resource was estimated at 1,064 based on the modified BIA list. It is noted that about 47 percent of the Laguna working-age  population are in the labor force. Information is presented on sources of income and consumption patterns.

        "description":"The Indian Manpower Resource Study (IMRS) was undertaken to provide basic information essential to the planning and development of effective programs to make use of the manpower resource of reservation Indians in Arizona and New Mexico. In the past, decision making has largely been undertaken with a minimum of valid information. The reservations studied were Fort Apache, San Carlos, Acoma, Laguna, and Papago. Data indicate that Indians of the Southwest have substantially lower incomes than other Americans. Also, although most reservation families live in a rural setting, they should not be considered farm families. The study, in addition to income and available manpower supplies, also gathered information on age and sex, family characteristics, industry and occupational  experiences, and consumption patterns. This study supports the hypothesis that the creation of on-reservation opportunities would be met by a willing labor force. Generally, information indicates that Indians may require more concentrated efforts to resolve their employment problems than other disadvantaged U. S. citizens because of their relatively greater deprivation. Natural and human resource development of reservations should be encouraged. Industries can be developed in tourism and recreation where feasible. (KM)",

Since no one publication that dealt specifically with the historical and cultural background of Arizona Indian tribes could be found, they consolidated their notes into this resource bulletin. The writers of the papers found that all authors do not agree on the early history of the different tribes, so there are some duplication of facts and several different versions of the same topic. The 23 papers cover 4 categories: desert tribes, high mesa tribes, mountain tribes, and river tribes. Major topics include agriculture, clothing, education, history, housing, legends, language, religion, and social life. (PS)",

The tissue mill began in a building formerly occupied by a North Carolina furniture manufacturer. Initial financing came from the Area Redevelopment Administration, local and State organizations, and private industry. Failure of the operation was attributed to lack of skilled employees, frequent breakdowns of secondhand machinery, variability in the quality of wet pulp, and an inadequately developed market. After foreclosure by the Small Business Administration, the plant was leased to another company to produce carbonizing paper. Finding solutions to Picken's problems and those of other  depressed areas will require continuing systematic efforts at Federal, State, and local levels. (Author/PS)",

The gachupines and criollos ruled the government and exploited the indios and mestizos. When the criollos became dissatisfied with being secondary to the gachupines, they began talking about a revolution. On 16 de septiembre, Father Miguel Hidalgo gave his \"Grito de Independencia\" speech stating a revolution was inevitable. There were 2 stages to the revolution. The first stage (under Father Hildago and Jose Maria Morelos) was aimed at changing colonial class, political, economic, and cultural systems of New Spain. The final stage of the revolution (under Agustin de Iturbide) left things just as they had  been during the colonial period. This contradiction in the movement led to the formation of 2 main political parties--liberals and conservatives. As objectives of this unit the students will demonstrate their comprehension of \"el 16 de septiembre\" by correctly answering orally the discussion questions. The poem \"Corrido de la Independencia\" is included. (NQ)",

Rural youth, for the most part economically, socially, and educationally disadvantaged, were not found to be chaffing at the bit to enter the value configurations and behavioral patterns of \"Consciousness III\". They are still very much imbued with a strong desire to achieve higher social rank, more material amenities, and to improve their basic life chances. Although there is great heterogenity along a number of dimensions among those that might be labeled rural youth, there are also some common attributes of circumstances, values, aspirations, needs, and prospects that cut across the majority of these diverse groups: most are at a relative disadvantage to compete with  metropolites, most have high mobility aspirations, and most lack facilitation of any kind to accomplish their goals. Two publications which listed many of the needs for changing rural schools were cited: \"Rural Education and the Educational Occupational Attainments of Youth\" (Haller) and \"Vocational Education in Rural Areas\" (Griessman and Densley). The need for strong, well organized cooperation between Federal, state, and local governments was also stressed. Eight institutional structures impeding the possibility of innovative changes in counseling, training, and occupational placement of rural people were given, along with 4 structures that should be established to replace these.

Sex comparison was emphasized, because the process of change and its concomitant value and role confusion may be producing conflicting orientations toward future familial roles and spouses' expected roles. Specifically, the study focused on boys' and girls' projected age of marriage, number of children, work of their spouses and selves outside the home, and the importance the youths accord desire to marry relative to other goals. It was hypothesized that the orientations of girls will deviate from tradition more than boys. The sample population was questioned in 1966, when the boys and girls were high school sophomores, and again in 1968, regardless of school status. All  of the youths resided in rural East Texas at the time of the first interview, and the large majority maintained a similar residence in 1968. The sample area was also characterized by low median family income and a large Negro population. A striking result of this investigation was that the marital-family orientations of the Negro and white boys and girls did not change appreciably over the 2 year period. The boys and girls differed most significantly for orientations toward their spouses or selves, respectively, working outside the home. In contrast to the boys, almost none of the girls, Negro or white, appeared to adhere to the traditional ideas that &quot;a woman's place is in the home.&quot; (KM)",

It focused specifically on the aspiration choices of 8,802 tenth grade students in 4 southern states: Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina. The relative effects of class, race, and residence were investigated. An adaptation of the &quot;backward elimination procedure&quot; was used to select models for analysis. It was found that the proportion of students with high level occupational aspirations in all subclasses was relatively high. Approximately of the students in the more disadvantaged groups had high level aspirations; e.g., of the rural Negro students whose fathers had low level occupations and  education, 53% had high level occupational aspirations. There were similar findings for the other disadvantaged groups. It was hypothesized that, as the adolescent begins to consider the means required to obtain his occupational goal, the likelihood of the perception of limiting factors (goal blockage) increased. It was anticipated that students in the lower classes (rural and Negro students) would tend to have lower aspirations. The failure of the Negro students to follow the general pattern of the other disparity groups presented a conceptual problem for the original formulation. (KM)",

A multivariate analysis of variance was employed to generate separate cultural profiles for individuals within ethnic groups and between groups, while controlling for academic ability and socioeconomic status. A major area of concern was whether high achieving students of diverse ethnic groups have become &quot;Anglicized&quot; to be successful in the U.S. school setting. Similarly, low educational achievement was considered in relation  to the degree of &quot;conflict&quot; with school values. This research suggested that ethnic minority students were being asked to make a choice between their own cultural group and that of white middle-class America in order to win success within the present educational system.

        "description":"The report questions whether there is evidence to indicate a significant undercount of the Spanish speaking background population in the United States in the 1970 Census and whether the undercount, if any, was due to the U.S. Census Bureau's methodology, including its collection techniques. The report also notes that these issues are not unique to persons of Spanish speaking background. Data includes: (1) important issues of Census data, such as voting rights, federally assisted programs, and equal employment opportunities; (2) the Bureau's estimates of population undercounts; (3) indications of a Spanish speaking background undercount, also covering the black undercount and independent reports and surveys; (4) the Bureau's methodology and data collection, especially field  collection techniques, bilingual or Spanish questionnaires, and methods of identifying persons of Spanish speaking background; and (5) Bureau of Census employment for community education specialists, census enumerators, and general employment. The report found that, while it is clear that in the 1970 Census the Bureau's efforts to enumerate persons of Spanish speaking background were greater than in any previous Census, they were not well thought out and, as a result, were inadequate. There is strong evidence that the Spanish speaking background population was undercounted substantially. The documentation lies especially in the Bureau's undercount of blacks, its methodology for the collection of data, and myriad independent surveys and reports.

Ten BSCS teachers participated in the study. Verbal behaviors occurring in inquiry situations were compared with those in noninquiry settings, using three observational instruments: the Flanders system, the Revised Inquiry Analysis Instrument, and the Affective Behaviors Instrument. Teachers were found to talk the most in a noninquiry setting, less in a teacher-centered inquiry setting, and least in a student-centered inquiry setting. The total proportion of teacher talk decreased throughout the program but became more direct in student-centered inquiry than in either  teacher-centered inquiry or noninquiry settings. This may have been due to the percentage of time they spent responding to students' questions in student-centered inquiry as opposed to other types of teacher talk. The investigators concluded that, using a well-designed staff development program, teachers can modify their behaviors and thereby promote more effective inquiry. A related document is SE 017 734.

Three hypotheses were formulated to the effect that children who receive ESS instruction will achieve higher scores on Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) Figural and Verbal, and on the investigator's test of Observation and Classification. The sample consisted of four third-grade classes in two elementary schools with heterogeneous populations. After the pre-test, two classrooms were selected as the experimental group and the remainder served as a control. Four ESS units were taught in the experimental classrooms over a period of eight weeks while regular instruction went on as usual in the control classrooms. The pre- and posttests  were scored for nine different measures and analyzed using the one-way analysis of covariance. On the basis of this analysis two hypotheses were accepted, while the third, which was rejected, gave some evidence of significant results. The outcome of the study was quite conclusive, indicating that ESS materials are useful for promoting creativity in elementary school children. (Author/JR)",

Students were randomly assigned to experimental (9 students) and control (10 students) groups. The vehicle for skill development was microteaching, involving the use of peers as pupils for practicing the skill of set induction and of students at a local junior high school for the skill of probing questioning. The microteaching format involved viewing a model lesson on tape; five minutes of microteaching; review of the videotaped lesson by self, peers and supervisor; and reteaching a modified lesson to four new students. Analyses of data revealed that (1)  student teachers who had practiced the use of nonverbal cues did devote significantly more time to nonverbal behaviors during student teaching; (2) there were no significant differences in the use of congruent behaviors exhibited by the experimental group during student teaching as compared to the control group; (3) teachers in the experimental group exhibited significantly (.05 level as measured by the calculated t) more positive nonverbal interactions with their students; and (4) the pupils of the student teachers did not perceive the members of the experimental group as being more effective than those of the control group.

A total of about 30 teachers and their classrooms were used. One group used the old syllabus in the first year and the new syllabus in the second year. The other two groups used the new syllabus in both years. Instruments employed included: a classroom activity checklist, classroom tapes, a process of science test, a teacher opinion scale, an earth science test, and the Regents Earth Science Examination. Results obtained indicated differences between teaching strategies, but not opinions, for teachers who changed to the new curriculum. Teachers  participating in the development of the new curriculum held new opinions. No advantage to students' learning under either curriculum was observed concerning the ability to use the processes of science. Student achievement was specific to the material used in the classroom.

General conclusions are that students with SEED instruction do somewhat better in mathematics and that most like the program. There is no clear-cut evidence that this instruction has a significant effect on the child's general self-concept or that it has a lasting impact  on the regular teachers' behavior.

Student achievement was portioned out into four independent variables to be used in a multiple linear regression analysis; they were growth in understanding, growth in problem solving, growth in computation, and overall achievement. Tests to measure these variables were constructed by the researcher and made compatible with the content being taught. Teacher variables include knowledge test scores, attitudes toward traditional or \"new math\" programs, academic preparation, and principal rating scales. All test instruments are included in the appendix. The population for this study was 61 fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade classes and their 61 teachers, selected randomly from 400 possible  classes. There were no significant relationships between any teacher variables, when taken individually or in groups, and student growth in any of the three areas--understanding, problem solving, and computation--when taken individually or in groups.

        "description":"This study examines the correspondence between a representation of subject-matter structure and a representation of the cognitive structure in students as a result of instruction. Eighty-seven eighth-grade students were assigned randomly to experimental and control treatments. The experimental students (N = 43) studied from a programmed text on probability developed by the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG). The control group (N - 44) studied from a programmed text on factors and prime numbers. Digraphs, graphs and task analysis were used to map out the content structure. A word association test (WA) was used to measure the existing cognitive structure. The WA test, an achievement test and an attitude measure were given before, after and at a delayed post-experiment time. The  results indicate that: (1) eighth-grade students were unfamiliar with the concepts of probability; (2) instruction in probability changed subjects' cognitive structure concerning concepts in probability; (3) the experimental group learned a significant portion of the structure of probability as a matter of instruction while the control group learned almost nothing; and (4) this learning of structure was retained until the retention-test time.

At present there is little empirical evidence to support any contentions that there is a match between the subject-structure taught and the cognition in subjects' memories resulting from the instruction. This paper presents methods for examining subject-matter structure in prose material and methods for examining representation of a subject-matter structure in subjects' memories. Data bearing on the validity of structural interpretations of these measures are examined. Such measures provide methods which might be used to evaluate the extent to which a mathematics curriculum communicates the structure it has been developed to  communicate. (JP)",

Results of 24 items were analyzed by means of sign tests. Converse tasks were found to be easier than contrapositive tasks. Increased activation improved performance on the converse tasks but seemed to interfere with performance on the more difficult contrapositive tasks. Of special interest was the finding that contrapositive tasks with more negatives were easier than those with fewer negatives. (LS)",

Two groups of 24 students were randomly chosen from two lists of 150 students in the classes of these teachers. The first 24 students were the control group. Pre- and posttests containing 25 multiple choice responses were used to measure student performance. Data were analyzed using a multiple linear regression program. The investigators found (1) the I.Q. (obtained from data on the California Test of Mental Maturity in  school records) of the students produced a significant difference in cognitive gains in both systems, and (2) the system employing immediate reinforcement and feedback produced significant and greater gains in cognitive learning than did the system without immediate reinforcement and feedback.

        "description":"In order to assess the degree to which learning is taking place in a particular school, it is necessary that the desired outcomes the school is trying to develop in its students be translated into clearly-defined performance objectives. These objectives then can become the basis upon which curriculum decisions can be made. This study's purpose was to evaluate a performance objective-based high school chemistry program. The evaluation was based on cognitive achievement and attitude toward chemistry developed as a result of being enrolled in this program. Seven sections of chemistry, taught by four teachers, were involved in the study. Students were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: (1) teachers taught directly from the stated objectives, students were given a copy of the  objectives for each instructional unit, activities and experiments were geared for the accomplishment of the stated objectives; and (2) teachers agreed on the validity of the objectives but taught in the same manner as in previous years, with students receiving no copies of the objectives. Data on student achievement in this one-semester study were obtained from four achievement instruments developed by the teachers. Students' attitudes were measured by the Attitudes Towards any School Subject developed by Silance and Remmers. A groups-within-treatments design was used for data analysis. The objective-based curriculum in chemistry appeared to have a significant effect upon student achievement as well as a significant effect upon student attitudes towards chemistry. (Author/PEB)",

A related purpose was to examine the relationship between teachers' open- or closed-mindedness and their use of the basic science process skills. The population used was 76 preservice teachers enrolled in a professional year program at a Midwestern University. The results of the study show that the instruction in basic science process skills had a significant effect on teachers cognitive achievement, selection of process objectives for a science unit and their lesson  planning practices. Although providing teachers instruction in the basic science process skills did not significantly affect their attitudes toward these skills, a significant positive correlation was found among subjects who were \"open minded\" and those who used basic science process skills in their lesson plans.

The second module studies the discipline of anthropology and the topics human origins, small non western societies, and societies in transition. The third module, Comparative Religions, deals with the \"need\" for religion and the religious dimension and how it is expressed.  The fourth module, Introduction to American Studies, is the required introduction to a series of American Studies courses and as such provides the skill, process, and content framework for all the courses.

To this end, a conference addressed itself to formulating the meaning of such an approach at the secondary level, planning bridges to other learning modes and to particular disciplinary studies, considering strategies suitable to work within the organizational structure of the secondary school, finding an equitable allocation of resources among disciplines, discussing undergraduate and graduate teacher training experiences, and examining potential issues in evaluation of this approach. Participants were  drawn from various curriculum projects, from teacher training programs, and from the ranks of skilled teachers and supervisors. Topics covered included the following: the urgency for a problem-solving approach in education; delineation of a comprehensive problem-solving-based curriculum for secondary schools; an overview of suggestions for curriculum development; implementation and assessment; and recommendations for action by school and community groups. An appendix contains topics for a comprehensive problem-solving-based curriculum. (Author/KSM)",

The data-gathering model for the Assessment has yielded differences of various groups' performances in the area of political knowledge. These results seem to imply that the academic approach to the teaching of political knowledge is advantageous only to those with strong academic traditions and achievement motivation. Consequently, the existing goals of civics, the course in the social studies curriculum responsible for promoting political knowledge, seem to be less than successful. When the traditional concept of the &quot;good citizen&quot; is revised to that of the &quot;evolving individual,&quot; new social studies goals arise compatible to the  need for a more favorable socialization of children and for civics courses responsive to all groups of students. A school environment oriented to the changes called for by the implications drawn from the Assessment encompasses the following: the fostering of total student development; creation of a self-actualizing situation for teachers; use of informal learning environments; study of actual political models such as the school; advancement of students toward affective, as well as cognitive, goals; and the opportunity for critical thinking and conflict resolution experiences.

Twenty-five Mennonite adolescents and twenty-five public school adolescents, all of whom were twelfth-graders, were given a self-description inventory in which they were to answer sets of items as to a) what they thought they are really like (the actual self); b) how they thought they ought to be (the ideal self); and c) how they thought the typical adolescent in their age group would rate himself. It is noted that definite conclusions should not be made from the results since such factors as the adolescent's candor, insight, and attitudes may influence the way in which he responds to the items. The comparative  results tend to show that there is actually not much difference between the self-concepts of the Mennonite and the public school adolescents. Several significant items noted in the various self-descriptions indicate that: public school adolescents are more socially oriented than their Mennonite counter-parts; Mennonite adolescents stress religion more than the public school adolescents; public school students desire to be All-American, well-rounded individuals, whereas the Mennonites are nonconformers; the majority of both groups plan to go to college; and significantly more public school students than Mennonites hope to move from their community after completing school.

Ninety boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 10 were interviewed individually. Each child was asked a minimum of 15 questions in each of the following subject areas: 1) war and peace; 2) power and practice of power; 3) deviating groups: prisoners, mentally ill, bums, and the rich; and 4) protection of nature. Questions asked were mainly concerned with a knowledge of facts, but some also required evaluation and value judgement. Following a brief introduction, the report presents a description of the children's conceptions in the four subject areas and points out the similarity of and differences in the ideas of the  different age groups. Observations on the children's conceptions and a comparison with earlier studies are made.

Activities in four different formats (micro-explanatory step-by-step, reflective inquiry and narrative summary) are outlined.  General procedures and activities are suggested for both in and out of school. Topics of the units include the following: interviewing friends; shopping centers; TV news and weather reports; analysis of black radio stations; and juvenile crime.

The author's aim is to indicate the role of modern education policy in the world's socio-economic development, especially in developing countries. Access to education is observed to be an important political problem as it is the subject of contradictory interests of social groups and classes. Lack of personnel is another obstacle analyzed in detail for particular continents, with a focus on educational costs. The future aims of educational development are characterized and the financial needs of education are indicated in relation to shortages of funds in developing nations. The necessity to  carry out radical changes in present education systems is emphasized. In conclusion it is noted that achievement of these goals in educational planning and development will rely on joint action between developing nations and international agencies such as Unesco.

        "description":"Societies are constantly changing; there is no natural end to social evolution. Societies can be regarded as modernizing in the sense of continually undergoing change, but also in the sense of trying to achieve specific goals already achieved elsewhere. A society can become modernized in the latter sense by becoming more specialized or industrialized or democratic, or by improving health services or educational facilities, as long as it is assumed that it is overcoming some gap that separates it from other societies. Specialization may be the most plausible notion involved in the concept of modernization, suggesting that modernization is but another expression vaunting the good of state formation. It is doubtful whether state formation is good in itself, although it becomes  necessary for smaller, less specialized units in vulnerable positions. Thus modernization, even conceived in a very minimal way as a transit from less to more specialized forms of social control, is not an end nor a good in itself. It merely calls attention to the need to create a greater equality between some societies and others without which some would remain significantly vulnerable to others.

        "description":"John B. Carroll's Model of School Learning is a paradigm which describes the degree of learning that takes place in school setting as a function of the time spent on a learning task divided by the time needed for its mastery. The components of opportunity and perseverance in Carroll's model have particular relevance to a form of school organization such as nongradedness which has as its primary objective the provision of unlimited time opportunity during which a student can actively engage in a learning task until the time spent is commensurate with the time needed. The purpose of this study is twofold: 1) to identify Carroll's model as a possible theoretical basis for the organizational structuring of schools and 2) to test seven hypotheses derived from the model which concern  the amount of perseverance and the degree of learning that actually occur under varying conditions of quality of instruction and ability to understand instruction when unlimited time opportunity is available. The sample consists of 160 students divided into three ability levels, randomly assigned to two levels of treatment. Statistical analysis are made by way of ANOVA, ANCOVA, and Fisher's transformation to z. (Author)",

Thirty Yale history professors worked with a comparable number of high school teachers and created approximately eighty &quot;mini-courses&quot; in United States History, replacing the required survey course. The summary report of the project lists the participants of the New Haven School System, ale History Department and other Yale faculty and outside visitors, the rationale for the project, the responsibilities for the teachers, coordinators and professors and an analysis of what the future will hold based on reactions to the project thus far. Appendices list the titles of the mini-courses  offered at the three participating high schools. The teacher's guide, after repeating the staff responsibilities, introduces the inquiry approach and steps to developing a mini-course. A categorized list of skills and a skill and concept sequence are suggested. The specific techniques and activities of panel discussions or debates, mock trials, field trips, student taught classes and sound light shows are outlined. Appendices contain a teacher curriculum and a Yale seminar questionnaire. (Author/KSM)",

Pupils in grades 2, 3, and 4 took the Primary Test of Economic Understanding while students in grades 5 and 6 took the Test of Elementary Economics. All students took a form of the Flanagan Test of General Ability. After teachers had completed their units in economics, the economics tests were administered again. Change scores were computed for each pupil; mean pre-test, post-test, change scores and mean scores were computed for each class.  Each workshop group was tested separately. The results from the Des Moines group indicated that pupils studying under workshop teachers learned significantly more than similar pupils. In seven of the eight other workshop groups, the pupils of the workshop teachers learned more than similar pupils under teachers who had not attended workshops. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"Third grade pupils from a suburban school district were subjects of a study which examined the effects of two social studies teaching strategies, demonstration deductive and directed discovery inductive, and two intelligence levels as they affected mastery, immediate retention, immediate transfer, delayed retention, and delayed transfer. Three elementary teachers conducted the teaching and testing of a series of instructional lessons and mastery tests. It had been hypothesized that the demonstration strategy would be more efficient and aid subjects to mastery in fewer trials. It was found that the directed discovery group took fewer trails but the difference was not significant. It was also found that intelligence and the interaction between intelligence and strategy were  nonsignificant factors related to trials to mastery. Recommendations based on the results are offered and it is concluded that if, as the study suggests, the demonstration approach is as effective as the directed discovery approach, then the use of the demonstration mode as a well organized strategy deserves greater attention in teaching.

The Anthropology Curriculum Project's &quot;Race, Caste and Prejudice,&quot; designed to enhance intergroup attitudes and behavior, is a supplementary secondary school unit of study, text and handbook, dealing with race, caste and prejudice from a cross-cultural anthropological standpoint employing student activities emphasizing affective involvement such as simulation and field research. The multimethod assessment of the materials employs statistical analysis and the technique of non-participant observation, or ethnography. The latter is composed of daily non-participant observation of classrooms, informal student and teacher feedback, unstructured interviews with a random sample of  experimental group students and a formal teacher evaluation conference. Results from analysis of covariance reveal a significant difference in ethnic attitude changes as measured by a cognitive-affective scale. Through ethnographic analysis, the most influential factors in classroom interactions are found to be student sensitivity to the material and situation and the class ethnic composition. Other findings of teacher and student behavior and reactions are discussed, as are implications for further research. References are included. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"In 1970 an evaluation of a national textbook program implemented by the Ministry of Education of Ecuador was carried out. The pre and post test design involved three treatment types: 1) classrooms with new textbooks, guides and orientation to teachers in the new textbook programs; 2) classrooms with new textbooks and guides but no teacher orientation; and 3) classrooms with other, or no, textbooks, and no teacher orientation. The design was field experimental with treatments assigned to particular schools. Findings, discussed and summarized, indicate that only the subject area of reading showed a significant interaction. Several significant differences between school types (graded, multi-graded and ungraded) were revealed by analysis. Only one out of nine comparisons was  significant among the three field experimental conditions, with classrooms with new texts and no orientation having the smallest reading gains. Variables in the change process are identified in the discussion section and theories of adoption of change are related to the findings. References and supporting data are included in the report.

        "description":"The lack of empirical data on teacher self-perception led to this study of the effects of selected courses in humanistic education on the self-perceptions of preservice teachers. Changes in self perception of students in three courses -- Values Clarification, Discovering Your Teaching Self, and Transactional Analysis -- and differences in those taking these courses and student teachers who did not were assessed by a seven point semantic differential rating scale. Factor analysis and factor similarity provided data shown in tabular form for each of the concepts of Real Self, Ideal Self, and Teaching Self. Results for those in humanistic education courses showed that Real Self perceptions were lower in self-esteem and a sense of personal well-being but Ideal Self was viewed more  positively in terms of capability, intelligence and leadership. Students completing the courses perceived their Teaching Self as better adjusted to its environment and more capable of doing something about it.

        "description":"Nine sets of encyclopedias are reviewed and evaluated for their treatment of the life and history of the black American. While all nine sets surveyed include comprehensive general articles on the topic of the Afro-American, each is believed to be a summary treatment offering limited information and little understanding to the student reader on researcher. The number of pages of the general article and the eminence of the black historian author is not considered as real a measure as how much material about the black American appears within separate entries on other topics. Another criteria in this connection, apart from integration of relevant material, is the number and range of separate and specific entries on blacks of significance. An important factor in the evaluation is the  question of whether the major school topics in which the role of black Americans has been commonly distorted reflect the lastest historical scholarship and revisionist interpretations. Only one set is found to fulfill the goal of a truly integrated general reference encyclopedia which succeeds in doing historical justice to the black Americans and demonstrates that this can be done without diminishing its overall quantitative and qualitative standards.

Assessment was accomplished by a questionnaire administered to randomly chosen groups of members of the National Council for Social Studies. The following items from the questionnaire are discussed in this report: awareness of population education, meaning of the term; determination of whether or not population is taught; allocation of time spent on teaching about population; and attitudes toward population. Questionnaires dealing with the influence of the April issue indicated a greater awareness of the term Population Education and an increased allotment of time spent on  population education in the classroom. Questionnaires assessing the impact of the enhancement techniques, which included letters sent to sensitize Council members to the April issue and a mailing of resource materials, revealed little or no impact on the proportion of subscribers who read the issue or on their likelihood of teaching the subject.

The choices of museum programs studied were determined by indications of success in working with the schools, in developing effective teaching materials and methods, in recruiting and training personnel, in funding expanding programs, and in reaching into the community. The study is in two parts. Part One is a set of fourteen case studies, each of which analyzes the program of a single museum under eight subject headings. These follow identical schemes to facilitate comparisons and are arranged geographically. Part Two discusses, under the same subject headings (exhibits, programs,  extension services, staff, funding, coordination with schools, facilities, and publications), programs of special interest that did not lend themselves to the case study format. Notes on inter-museum cooperation, further information resources, references and illustration credits conclude the study. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"While inquiry teaching has been a popular term in the social studies literature over the last decade, the empirical research appears to have paid little attention to specific inquiry models. All published papers and dissertations purporting to measure inquiry teaching for the five year period, January, 1967 through November, 1972 are reviewed and analyzed in this paper. The major section of the paper presents details of the 28 studies reviewed. The analysis is based on results of experiments on inquiry teaching classified with respect to significance of results over other teaching methods, to inquiry situations and forms of evaluation, to criteria for selection of groups and group instructors, to sample size and period of time of experiments, and to experimental design and  significance of results. While it is shown that the inquiry teaching method appears to be superior in terms of recall, transfer and retention of data and in terms of developing specific skills in questioning and concept building, these results are described as tentative due to research deficiencies and lack of specificity about the nature of inquiry teaching as perceived and measured.

The study measured the effectiveness of student teacher materials in the teaching of basic economic understandings and an in-service program for teachers. The sample consisted of 24 teachers and 504 second graders. Three treatment groups included group one using the conventional social studies materials; group two using the specially designed economic education materials; and group three using the same materials as group two, but whose teachers had received in-service training. The five week study began with the administration of the SRA Test of General Ability (TOGA) and the Primary Test  of Economic Understanding (PTEU) and ended with a second administration of the PTEU as a post-test. Conclusions are as follows: 1) Basic economic concepts can be taught at early elementary grades and growth in students' understanding of them can be measured; 2) A close relationship exists between materials provided for teachers and students and pupil growth in economic understanding; 3) Full-scale programs in economic education for teachers may not be necessary. Eleven recommendations are included in the report. (Author/RM)",

The Navy, faced with the problem of establishing schools in Micronesia, did not create new institutions. Drawing upon their past experience, they decided to create a secular, coeducational, public school system with compulsory attendance laws, thus establishing the kinds of schools with which they were familiar. The lack of a clear-cut indigenous educational policy resulted in education practices which promoted the rapid Americanization of the Micronesian. By 1951 the system consisted of a six-year elementary program, a three-year intermediate program, and the Pacific Islands Training School, offering communications, general education, and  teacher training. Elementary curriculum consisted of English, the vernacular, arithmetic, social studies, art, handicrafts, and gardening; English studies were taken up in the third year and became the medium of instruction. The intermediate schools, geared to both preprofessional and terminal education, offered English, social studies, commercial subjects, industrial arts and vocational training. (Author/JH)",

Normally textbooks are selected by a professional committee whose recommendations are adopted by the Board. In 1971 \"The Americans,\" edited by Edwin Fenton and recommended by the selection committee, was attacked and all of Fenton's works excluded from the list. In subsequent meetings of the Board of books were reinstated, then finally excluded from the list. At the same time the Board specified four books out of the 39 listed as appropriate for history and government at the 11th and 12th grade level. A protest, based on economic considerations and mounted by school superintendents, postponed implementation of the latter  restriction. Action brought by the social studies educators resulted in legislation removing the power of the State Board to approve specific texts. Further interpretation of the law, however, confirmed the Board's general approval powers. The South's fear of subversion is not unique but should be overridden by recognition of the difference between informed evaluation by professionals and personal bias. (JH)",

The seven case studies contributed to this volume illustrate ways of balancing organizational processes and the free initiative of individual schools and teachers, within the varying traditions of each country. This volume is the first of a series of four which present case studies in education innovation (see ED 085 327 and SO 006 884). The &quot;central level&quot; means national level in three instances and state of provincial level in four, although, the national level may be involved, as in the United States, through federal legislation. Case studies include the Schools Council, United Kingdom; the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education  (OISE), Canada; the National Council for Innovation in Education (NCIE), Norway; the New Jersey Administration, United States; the National Board of Education (NBE), Sweden; The Bavarian State Institute for Educational Research and Planning, Germany; and Research for Better Schools Inc., (RBS), United States.

Diverging views of the term &quot;culture,&quot; however, emphasize the appropriateness of &quot;decentralization&quot; and lead into a description of two local cultural efforts -- one in the United Kingdom and one in the United States. An overview of the cultural policies of each of the five countries represented, discussed in relation to the concept of decentralization, is presented followed by a discussion of practical and theoretical considerations inherent in a  decentralized policy. Benefiting for interaction among government agencies and private groups, such as city planners and people involved in mass media, are practical goals. The overriding theoretical concern, however, is the ability of old institutions to generate new forms and functions of cultural activity. A list of eleven questions &quot;for the future,&quot; indicates the areas for concern discerned by the groups. A list of seminar participants concludes the document. (JH)",

Educational climate was identified as a significant independent variable and other sources of variation, such as family and peer group environments and personality dimensions, were assessed. A multiple regression equation was formulated to ascertain the relative weight of factors influencing students' toleration of dissent. The most important finding was that neither of the socioeconomic status indicators had a relationship to toleration of dissent in adolescents. Both sex and ethnicity were significant, as were student  perception of strictness of family, openness of expression of conflict with friends, and friends' interests in politics. Significant school-related variables included the number of controversial issue courses taken and the student's perception of freedom to express views in a classroom. References, tables, and measurement scales are included. (Author/KSM)",

        "description":"Most materials on value clarification techniques have been written by professionals working at university schools of education. To examine value clarification from another view, to see what difficulties teachers are having in translating new techniques into classroom realities, an eighth grade social studies teacher relates his classroom experiences while developing techniques discussed by Louis Raths and his co-authors in &quot;Values and Teaching&quot;. Raths approaches value clarification with a seven-part valuing process which encourages children to prize one's beliefs and behaviors, to choose one's beliefs and behaviors, and to act on one's beliefs. Methods for implementing these steps emphasize the clarifying response and value sheets. The teacher's experiences with both of these  techniques reflect several problems and pitfalls of their use in the classroom situation. A basic problem confronted in using the techniques is the extent of neutrality or direction on the part of the teacher. Student-teacher relations as affected by the techniques are considered. Systematic measure of the effects in the classroom are closely considered and means for accomplishing meaningful recordkeeping are suggested and developed. (Author/KSM)",

This unit is one of three model units (see ED073980), all dealing with India but reflecting certain basic themes in human society and using differing techniques for university-level teaching. These units, bringing innovative ideas to those interested in teaching about the Third World, suggest urbanization as a theme for historical exploration. The guide defines the  concept of the city as a functioning entity and makes some suggestions for coordinating the films and the guide materials with various student activities. The guide includes an historic and economic context for each city; a bibliography on urbanization and Indian cities; a table of 1971 Indian census data; and a section called Scene Identifications, which coordinates with the filmstrips.

The four networks identified for music and used in the development of the Southwest Regional Laboratory (SWRL) Music Program are the variable-value, the whole-part, the process-stage, and the class-member networks. Content analysis and task analysis are two aspects of curriculum design in which analytic networks have figured importantly. Task analysis in curriculum development can be defined on three levels, analytic, systemic, and particular. Task levels can be coordinated with the networks as the examples from the variable-value network indicate. Systemic tasks were generated through the network/task analysis procedure to produce the  content of the SWRL Program. As a bonus, evaluation is simplified by the existence of these predetermined tasks. Other advantages include placing a premium on the subject matter competence of the curriculum designer and on the integration of the processes of the discipline rather than their superimposition.

Uses of park sites are divided into active and passive recreation: a nature preserve is classified as passive recreation; a golf course, as active recreation. The factors involved in the analysis of the site are general ecology; topography, which includes classification of slopes, geological formations, and potential pond sites; soils and other environmental factors; existing manmade features; and esthetic considerations. Various uses of the parks are analyzed  for functional relationships which would enhance the planning of the site. Coordination of land uses with the actual park site is the final design of the master plan. Land criteria are given for campgrounds, picnic areas, interpretive centers, hiking trails, and roads. Working drawings and specifications are intended to be prepared for the site development plan. A five-item bibliography is included in the booklet. (BRB)",

The latter hypothesis is difficult to test under ordinary classroom conditions because of differences in subjects taught and other factors. This defect in design was remedied by randomly assigning 12 English teachers and 12 social studies teachers to classes to which 20 students had been randomly assigned. Each teacher taught the same 2-week course in his own subject area. Students' achievement was measured at the end of the course; all students rated their teachers. A modest relation was found between achievement and ratings in both English and social studies classes. A strong relation between aptitude and achievement is associated with a weak  one between achievement and rating. (Author/JA)",

Data were collected via structured group interviews and a double Q-sort administered twice at the end of each year of the program. The study was designed to answer the following questions: Is the new curriculum at USF achieving its objectives? Does exposure to the new curriculum change students? How do graduates of the new program at USFcompare with graduates of the old program? How do the graduates of USF compare with the graduates of UP? What are the reactions to the new programs at these institutions? Recommendations made on the basis of the study findings include: a) faculty should  demonstrate greater recognition and deeper concern for students as individuals, adults, and potential professionals; b) the substance of professional learning experiences should be increased; c) efforts should be made to individualize learning experiences; d) more in-depth professional experiences should be planned for the final year of the programs; e) team teaching should be readjusted or other strategies considered for the program; f) learning experiences in terms of family content should be reassessed; and g) faculty should reconsider their roles as professional nurse models and educators and adjust those roles within the demands of program objectives.

The program in art education was expanded and an experimental model prepared and developed for use in the New Jersey State Correctional Institution for Women in Clinton. The new model provided art majors pursuing teaching preparation and certification with an opportunity to add the teaching of art to prisoners, youthful offenders, and the mentally retarded to their regular teaching experience in the public schools. The program also oriented the college student to institutional life, to the teaching of art as a school function and recreational activity, and to  living in a controlled residential situation under security regulations. Supervisory visits and seminars were conducted regularly on site by the program coordinator.

Seven hundred and one of the state's 735 operating school districts (New York City and certain very small districts were excluded) were asked to supply the local, categorical, and direct Federal in-service expenditures for their districts during the 1970-71 and 1971-72 school years. Eighty-five percent of the districts responded both years. Of those, 65% reported expending funds for in-service education over the 2-year period, and 35% reported no in-service expenditures either year. Results are broken down in terms of source  of funds for in-service education by population served (classroom teachers or other professional staff) and percentage of total approved operating expenditures used for in-service activities according to geographical region within the State. Less than 0.05% of the total operating expenditures was spent on the maintenance and improvement of professional staff. The amount of money spent on in-service growth was found to have little relationship to the amount of money that a region commands. There appeared to be no relationship between the numbers of professional staff regionally and the in-service monies allocated for their training. (DDO)",

After a brief description of the daily and weekly program at Battersea School, the author discusses some of the strengths and weaknesses of the British open school system. The weaknesses are that a) although each child is expected to proceed at his own pace, the gifted children receive more attention than the children with learning difficulties who need more attention; b) theory often differs from practice; c) there is a lack of educational alternatives within the schools which results in poor service for  about 25% of the children; d) there is little concern for children with learning problems such as dyslexia; e) the British headmistress has autonomy and authority which is unparalleled in North America; and f) the emotional exhaustion of teachers, caused by the constant movement and aggressive behavior of children, results in an extremely high turnover rate. The author notes the following strengths of the British open school: a) teachers are very dedicated; b) teachers are committed to the programs which their headmistresses initiate; and c) while teachers are severely underpaid, abundant resources are allocated for equipment and materials necessary for the operation of experiential learning programs.

Materials developed to assist elementary classroom teachers in bringing the five arts activities into their instructional programs were pilot tested in eight randomly selected classrooms. During the pilot testing, teachers evaluated the materials in terms of their likelihood for increasing (at 0.1 confidence level) elementary school students' participation in the five humanities areas. Five arts specialists selected from 55 applicants evaluated the implementation of the materials. Before and after surveys were administered to the eight pilot classes and to eight  randomly selected control classes. Results of the surveys indicate an increase in humanities instruction sufficient for the seven school districts to approve future pilot implementation of the materials by all elementary classroom teachers in 12 pilot schools.

The approach consists of four components: knowledge, values, practicum, and seminar. The knowledge component recommends that teacher education students learn about cultural styles, specific learning characteristics, and effective teaching behaviors for working with minority group children. Students can gain this knowledge via films and other visual devices, readings, and small-group discussions. The values component recommends that students learn about the values of people from different backgrounds by means of group discussions and analysis of case studies. The practicum component suggests that teacher education students learn from  actual contact which can take place in various settings, including public school classrooms, private institutions, and tutoring programs. The seminar component recommends discussion of experiences and problems confronted in the practicum setting and the exchange of ideas for teaching the culturally different. In conclusion, this design combines the theoretical and the practical in an effective approach for developing creative activities for educating pre- and in-service teachers to work with culturally different children.

Since the university supervisor spends a relatively short time in observing the student teacher in action compared to the time spent by the cooperating teacher, it seems obligatory that the cooperating teacher be trained to make a more constructive contribution on a day-to-day basis. It appears entirely feasible that at the  beginning of each quarter, all of the cooperating teachers in a certain area of concentration could come together for a meeting. At such a meeting, the methods teacher could explain the methods he is teaching and clarify any questions about them. The university supervisors likewise could contribute their expectations of the student teachers. Later, the university supervisor could meet with the cooperating teacher and student teacher to plan specialized teaching procedures, taking into account the individual student teaching situation. Techniques of counseling could be discussed at this initial meeting also. In this way, the student teacher would receive closer supervision during his teaching experience. (Author/DDO)",

Comparisons were made between the experimental and the control school using 13 different instruments administered  throughout the 3-year project to determine if continual emphasis on creativity did improve the learning atmosphere and encourage the development of teacher and student creativity. Strict analysis and interpretation of the results are hampered by a) the fact that the control school staff incorporated many of the innovative techniques of the experimental school either because of the felt competition between the two or because they were valuable and produced results and b) the fact that the really valuable things produced by the experimental school were either not quantifiable or unrelated to the original measurable objectives of the project.

After there is a common basis of understanding of the general characteristics of the year-round or extended school and of the four specific plans, the second step is initiated. This involves dividing the group into smaller groups, one for each plan to be discussed, and having the individuals in each group choose the role they wish to play: principal, superintendent, teacher, school board member, townsperson, or student. The task of  each group is to discuss the plan assigned with reference to their own particular school situation, determine the advantages and disadvantages of the plan, and make a recommendation to the larger group. As the third step, each group reports its findings, and the facilitator of the simulation again summarizes some of the characteristics of the plans which have been used and mentions some of the more common modifications of these plans and locations where implementation is taking place. He might also summarize some of the advantages and disadvantages of various plans as derived from the national conferences on the topic. (DDO)",

Evaluation of the TIPS programs shows that a) students initially have difficulty in this kind of informal setting but, given support and encouragement, they will adjust and accomplish more than in traditional programs; b) the attitude and philosophy of the participating classroom teacher is critical to the student's success; c) the professors' work load for this type of program is enormous and must be taken into account in the planning stages; and d) while increased resources of all kinds are necessary for the successful implementation of such a program, the resulting benefits make the allocation of such resources worthwhile.

        "description":"A persistent problem confronting the teacher of the culturally different child is the need for finding learning materials that the child can relate to and utilize in his learning situation. The increasing availability of mass-produced learning materials for these children, although helpful, has not solved the problem of providing socioeconomically and/or culturally deprived children with a sufficient number and variety of learning aids. The more options provided for both teachers and children, the better the chance that the learning activities of the culturally different will be meaningful and helpful to them. Preservice and in-service training of teachers can be oriented toward creative teaching styles via involvement in creative teaching development. Activity-oriented teacher  training is a substantive way to initiate new forms of teacher behavior. This paper makes various suggestions for activity-oriented college classes for training teachers to work with the culturally different child. (Author/DDO)",

The education literature differentiating between the two concepts is reviewed. The author borrows a number of concepts from the field of linguistics, especially those of Chomsky and his colleagues, to construct a theory with respect to teacher education. Using as an analogy the distinction linguistics make between &quot;competence&quot; and &quot;performance&quot; in language formation, the author defines &quot;teaching performance&quot; as what the teacher actually does; i.e., observable teacher behavior; and &quot;teaching competence&quot; as the underlying, tacit knowledge which a teacher possesses, including knowledge of content, pedagogy, and sociocultural settings. She adds that teaching competence is not a systematic  inventory of items but a system of generative processes in the mind of the teacher that he or she is capable of storing and utilizing. The author stresses the need for distinguishing between performance and competence, with the result that observation would be limited to teaching performance, which does not perfectly reflect a teacher's competence. The author notes that reaction to this distinction will depend on the individual's role in teacher education. Use of Bayesian analysis for making predictions about teaching behavior is suggested.

In addition, the report examines the applicability of the British teacher center model to American teacher education and school reform. The British teacher center is a facility providing space, materials, and equipment in which a) teachers engage in curriculum planning and development activity and receive instruction pertinent to the design, development, and implementation of primary and secondary school curricula; b) the products of local and national curriculum development activities are exhibited; and c) teachers convene for purposes of relaxation and  refreshment. The centers serve approximately 1,000 teachers and are located to afford teachers easy access during or after school hours. A number of full-time and part-time staff are employed for the purposes of administration, instruction, technical assistance, secretarial/clerical assistance, and custodial care. The budget is provided by the local school district from public funds; the centers are governed by an advisory committee including teachers, school administrators, college and university faculty, and teacher center administrative staff. Teacher participation in the center program is voluntary. This report concludes that the British teacher center model has relevance for American school reform and teacher education. (DDO)",

What are the relative effects of audio and visual cues in eliciting teachers' stereotypes? Stimulus materials portraying students from different ethnic and social class backgrounds were presented to teacher subjects via three modes: audio, visual and audiovisual. Teachers evaluated students using a semantic differential constructed from a random sample of public school teachers' criteria for student evaluation. A three-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was employed to test for any significant main effects for ethnicity, social class, and presentation mode and for possible interaction effects among  these independent variables. The results of this study confirm results from previous studies (surveyed in this paper) which showed that teachers stereotype on the basis of ethnic and social class cues. They also confirm earlier findings that ethnic and social class cues are transmitted through both the audio and visual modes and that the audio mode provides more information for making judgments. The study extends previous findings to the classroom and confirms their applicability to teachers' evaluations of students on classroom criteria.

Two polar views of the proper purpose of schooling are discussed first: education for maturity and education for enculturation. The opinion is then set forth that American public schools approach more closely the enculturation rather than the maturity ideal. Interscholastic sports are held to be an important mechanism for fostering enculturation; they contribute only in a limited way to the maturity of the participant or spectator. Several implications of this analysis for educational policy toward sport are drawn. It is felt that sociologists of sport can and should actively contribute to a more humane system of  school athletics by addressing themselves to policy-related questions and by helping to plan, implement, and evaluate new models of sport and physical education.

The clusters are the primary mode of instruction in this competency-based teacher education program. Many of these modules are based on a list of teacher competencies developed by members of the Elementary Education Department at Glassboro State. The list represents the core competencies and is intended to be representative of a behavioral approach to teaching. All of the modules specify competencies and describe a scenario for self-paced learning in a field-oriented setting. The purpose of the module cluster which comprises this document is to develop knowledge and teaching strengths in several reading instructional areas: reading readiness,  beginning reading experiences, word recognition, comprehension, and general elementary reading instructional practices. For each of these instructional areas the student is required to define the reading skill area, analyze the reading skills which characterize the mastery of the reading instructional area, examine materials related to the area, observe an experienced teacher developing skill in a specified area, and teach skills which are part of each reading instructional area.

The basic aims of this center are to research the effect of teacher education on teaching behavior, to research the effect of such teaching behavior on relevant aspects of child learning, and to develop a teacher education system composed of many small instructional modules. Included in this report are descriptions of various projects and activities in areas such as data processing, learning technology (consulting), mathematics and science modules building, and decision-making in preservice teachers' choice of teaching strategies. The programs, which are both personalized and individualized, emphasize a) feedback to prospective teachers; b) earlier,  active involvement of teacher candidates, and c) experience for teachers in designing appropriate subject-matter content. The major developmental products of this basic research and experimentation are a diversified, comprehensive teacher education system and instructional guides to assist teacher educators. This report concludes that the center's close relationship with pre- and in-service teachers as well as public schools will ensure that instructional approaches will be responsive to the expanding role of the school in meeting the needs of the students.

Small groups of low-income fifth- and sixth-grade students were videotaped as they discussed solutions to problem-solving stories. Analysis of the tapes shows that trained student-led group members had a higher rate and different type of participation than did the group members operating under different leadership conditions. The study suggests that training student leaders in specific leadership techniques will enable the teacher to provide a classroom setting which is conducive to the active exchange of student ideas.

The results of the study show that because of the training a) teachers registered a more positive attitude toward the use of tests in evaluation; b) teachers could effectively implement mastery teaching strategies in the classroom; and c) pupils show no significant difference  in achievement or attitude measures, although this may be due to the fact that the same teacher instructed both the control and experimental groups using different strategies and may have subtly and unknowingly utilized the experimental strategy while teaching the control group.

The beginning teacher's insecurity about himself and his professional ability serve only to compound the original problems he encounters during his first year. The effects of inadequate introduction to the profession and insufficient support for beginning teachers are that a) 30 percent of personnel trained for teaching never enter the field; b) one out of five beginning teachers reports that he or she does not anticipate teaching five years later; and c) 12 percent of trained teachers leave the profession each year. Suggestions  for improvement of this situation include the following: a) teachers and their organizations should consider the inadequate introduction to teaching a priority problem; b) teachers should study the problem and explore various solutions; c) teachers should establish policies and make them part of contract negotiations; and d) plans for the introduction of new teachers to the profession and continuing support throughout their first years should be developed and implemented at the local level.

To remedy the situation the author suggests two different sets of measurable goals, one for the evaluation of students and one for the evaluation of teachers. Student goals should consist primarily of measures of certain skills and concepts. Teachers should be evaluated with regard to a) knowledge of their specific subject area and b) ability to apply principles of behavior and behavior modification in the classroom setting. (HMD)",

American teacher centers can be categorized according to organizational structure and function. There are seven organizational structures: a) Independent, which has no formal ties to an institution; b) \"Almost\" Independent, which, although linked to an educational  institution, experiences a high degree of autonomy; c) Single-unit Center, which is characterized by its association with an administration by a single educational institution; d) the Professional Organization Teaching Center; e) Free Partnership, which is the result of a collaboration of two institutions; f) Free Consortium, which is a collaborative effort by more than two institutions; and g) Legislative/Political Consortium. A teacher center may serve one or more of the following functions at the same time: a) facilitating the exploration of new ideas by teachers; b) advocating a specific philosophical or programmatic thrust; and c) meeting the specific educational needs of individuals or institutions.

It is based on the Mentor Ohio Exempted Village School District's five years' experience with differentiated staffing in two open-space schools and results directly from a 3-year ESEA Title III project. The Mentor model concentrated on two major goals: a) determining the effect of differentiated staffing upon students, staff, program, and the teaching-learning process and b) the development and implementation of a model program for individualized professional and paraprofessional growth needs, both individual and organizational. Each of the eight guidelines  is presented with a rationale based on the Mentor experience. The overall recommendation of the report is that theoretical rather than empirically tested models of differentiated staffing should be imposed since the benefits of early implementation of such a program will far outweigh the few additional problems resulting from lack of pilot testing the procedures.

Because a bureaucratic structure develops a self-perpetuating institutional ethos, teachers become objects that are fitted into a school program to serve delineated purposes. This diminishes their opportunity to remain vital, compassionate, and professional.

Adopted originally as a tactic to downplay the union's strong commitment to trade unionism, the professionalism of teaching came to be viewed as an end in itself and as the union's major goal. As a result, when the leadership was challenged by a new generation of radical teachers inspired by the union militancy of the day, their defense was to accuse the radicals of unprofessionalism and union busting. To see the conflict as a contest between the old idealists and young Communists is to miss both its subtlety and its message for our times. (Author)",

The answer to each question must be consistent with the trainee's goal, that is, the solution to his problem. After answering the questions, the trainee records the questions and his answers on a computer. The proof of his success is the acceptance of the answers by the computer since they are monitored for consistency. If the proposed solution is accepted by the computer, it is then evaluated according to its  plausibility. If the solution passes this criterion, it can then be put into practice.

        "description":"The Mobile Teacher Program was designed to improve the social studies and science curricula in the Indian River School District, Delaware. The objective of the program for the 1973 fiscal year was to increase the skills of sixth-grade students in social studies and science a) by one grade level on a nationally standardized test compared to previous sixth-grade students who did not have such a program and b) by an average of 20 percent on teacher-made tests, on a pre- and post-test basis. To accomplish these objectives, eight teachers prepared a 9-week instruction program in a specific subject area, which they would teach at each of the four schools in the district. These programs were designed to meet several national objectives that included a) using interdisciplinary approaches  in relation to basic content matter, b) increasing specific skills and concepts essential to social studies and science, c) involving students in related programs outside the school, d) providing more experiences and materials related to the wide ranges in ability and achievement, and e) improving the quality of teacher planning and instruction. The gain in most cases did not meet the expectations, and results were inconclusive. It is recommended that teachers remain stationary during the 1973-74 year and that only the materials and units be rotated since there seems to be difficulty in establishing a strong student-teacher relationship during a 9-week period.

In the Stanford study 80 subjects were divided into three treatment groups and one control group, and each subject was videotaped four times. Students of the subjects completed feedback forms which were transmitted to the subjects in one of three ways: a) teachers were given the forms and told to read them; b) a supervisor summarized the contents of the forms and rendered them as his own opinion; and c) the forms were given to the subjects with the supervisor's comments. The results of the experiment show no significant difference in the behavior of any of the groups and negate the hypothesis that  student feedback is effective in promoting change in the behavior of beginning teachers. The University of Chicago study, while similar to the one conducted at Stanford, was specifically designed to strengthen the treatment and eliminate some of the difficulties of the Stanford study. Sixty-nine subjects were divided into four experimental groups. The results of the second study support the finding of the first, that is, student feedback does not promote positive change in teaching behavior on the part of beginning teachers. (HMD)",

Each of the five subjects was asked to select from his own audio tape recordings one desirable and one undesirable behavior to be self-monitored. The occurence of the first selected behavior was monitored for the next five school days and tallied. After a week's interval, the second behavior was selected for monitoring. The procedure was the same as for monitoring the first behavior. Approximately one month after the conclusion of the second monitoring period, a final recording was made by each subject to sample the occurence of the two behaviors after the lapse of  time. The findings were a) monitoring of a verbal behavior is related to the rate of behavior; b) the rate of behavior that the subject intended to decrease showed a decline during monitoring and continued at rates lower than pretreatment; and c) behaviors that were monitored for increase showed three patterns in rate change: an increase during monitoring with a subsequent decline to a rate only slightly greater than that prior to monitoring, an increase during monitoring and sustained at posttreatment, and an increase in rate at posttreatment time. Findings confirmed that self-monitoring is a supervisory methodology which allows and encourages teachers to set their own goals. (PD)",

The Pupil Perceptions of Origin Influence (PPOI) questionnaire was used to measure pupils' perceptions of classroom influence. Results indicate that a) teachers made &quot;hits&quot; about twice as often as students; b) there was a close relationship among students' perceptions of how much  influence they actually had on classroom activities; c) in the classrooms with high PPOI scores, teachers made fewer rejections, more conditional responses, and fewer attempts to direct students' behavior; d) students in the alternative school tended to respond to teachers'&quot;hits&quot; with refusals and their own &quot;hits&quot; relatively (but not statistically) more than their peers in other schools; and e) the patterns of teacher-student influence differed on factors of school location and the level of PPOI score.

The first is the adaptation of the national Teacher Corps program to the local Teacher Corps program. This requires adapting the national literature to realistically fit local needs, adapting the national interest and interpretation of a given curriculum to the local program clientele, and involving teachers in a community program that integrates the school into the community as a positive social agency. In the second major phase the Teacher Corps program as conceived by the college or university is adapted to the Teacher Corps program as conceived by the local education agency. This requires the two institutions to share responsibilities; for example, the  local school can selected from intern candidates who have passed an in-depth selection process and who have requested to work at that particular school site. In the third major phase the Teacher Corps program is adapted to the institutions of higher education through meeting required standards and striving to ensure that everyone feels involved in the decision-making process. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the change process depends on people, and national programs should consist of broad guidelines within which people can adapt their own programs. (PD)",

First, teaching models are applicable to a variety of educators with varying curriculum concerns. Experience has shown that all educators can use some aspect of teaching models in their work with learners. Second, teaching models are relatively content free so that they may be used in a variety of subject areas. For example, Carl Rogers' Non-Directive Teaching model might be used to help youngsters determine where they feel comfortable in beginning their work in mathematics. Third, teaching models are useful in promoting a variety of environments. Experienced teachers concerned with the kinds of social environments that are possible to radiate through the use of various teaching models can  nurture interpersonal and group skills or focus on individual goals, use tight-structured models or open-structured models. Fourth, teaching models are helpful instructional interventions for developing flexibility in teacher education. Various teaching models can be grouped into four \"families\" that overlap and have foci different enough to give broader views, which tend to extend the possible ways of thinking about teaching. The author concludes that all of us learn in a variety of manners and that instruction in teaching models has the potential for teaching more learners more effectively through a structure that analyzes and describes many ways of teaching.

Teachers  were also asked to estimate the percentage of each of the above categories which were engaged in with students of each sex. Data tabulations show that the subject teachers were unable to estimate accurately the percentage of contacts in each category, nor could they estimate the number of contacts with students of each sex.

        "description":"The initial stages of test development of the Vocational and Occupational Interest Choice Examination (VOICE), developed for Air Force recruiters, are described. Reviewed are a number of relevant occupational interest inventories from which a pool of 400 items was drawn corresponding to eight career fields: general accounting, administration, weather observation, security, radio relay equipment repair, aerospace ground equipment repair, maintenance specialization, and general purpose vehicle repair. Each item presents an activity and asks the examinee to indicate whether he likes, dislikes, or is indifferent to that activity. The instrument was administered in a field test to 4800 airmen. Described are statistical procedures used to identify satisfied personnel, develop two types  of occupational interest scales, and cross-validate the procedures used in those scales. Statistical analyses indicate that the experimental inventory possesses considerable utility for distinguishing among career groups and between satisfied and dissatisfied personnel within career fields and a men-in-general group. Several recommendations are made to eliminate a number of problems prior to operational use of this instrument. Information regarding the VOICE questionnaire may be obtained by writing to the authors at Educational Testing Service, Princeton, N.J. 08540. (RC)",

        "description":"The Guttman model of scale analysis has found continued use in sociological analysis despite criticisms placed against it. An empirical example is provided of the use of factor analysis with Guttman scaling even taking into account the criticisms of both very restricted item number of dichotomous responses. Data came from a questionnaire using three theoretical law scales. Attitudes, values, and aspirations regarding the legal institution were solicited from high school students. Students indicated on the questionnaire if they strongly agreed, agreed, were undecided, disagreed, or strongly disagreed with each item. The responses were coded such that the higher the score, the more favorable the attitude toward the legal institution. Factor analysis of all items using principal  axis with varimax rotation was used. Scale analysis revealed that the scales were not Guttman. Although the scale and item reproducibilities were high, the scale scalabilities were not significantly greater than 0.60. Delineation of the structure of the scale is given as a justification for use of factor analysis with Guttman scales. It appears that the use of factor analysis with Guttman scales is not a desirable technique of scaling. A better approach would be the single use of factor analysis in order to help construct single factor scales of greater length. (Author/RC)",

The intervention variable is a legislative crackdown on speeding offenders in Connecticut, which was claimed to have produced a significant drop in the traffic fatality rate. The analysis using neighboring states as covariates results in a change to nonsignificance for the intervention effect. The seasonal nature of the data also illustrates the applicability of the procedure when seasonality is  present, so that no season adjustments are required. (Author)",

Phase one included the development, field testing and refining of the instruments for each of the goals, the procedures for collecting data about students, school and community conditions, and computer analytic techniques for determining the relationship of school and community conditions which exist with student performance. Phase two concerned itself with the  collection of information stratified from a state representative and phase three is the actual assessment of schools, which is a continuing activity begun in 1970. The assessment findings can be used to provide a focus for examing individual student test results which exist, to measure the effectiveness of curriculum changes and to provide objective data to support request for programs and equipment.

        "description":"A need for measurement exists not only in academic events but also in the affective domain. The author presents a procedure for quantification of affective behavior. The procedure contains three stages. One is the conceptualization stage in which personal meanings of elements in the affective domain are examined. Another is the crucial operationalization stage in which decisions are made regarding what events will be accepted as evidence of desirable affective behavior. The other stage is the placement of numbers on the events. They may be categorized, ranked, or placed at equal intervals. If behavioral objectives are to be more than cognitive, then those responsible for educational measurement in a specific situation must work together in the conceptualization and  operationalization stages. The author concludes that quantification of affective behavior is not a problem of measurement theory, but rather a problem of human negotiation. (Author/BB)",

Most practioners fail to realize the availability or potential of item analysis information or are unable to utilize such information appropriately. Achievement tests have not fully accomplished their purposes if the information derived stops at just test scores without the tests affording the information concerning pupils' responses to the items in the test battery. Such information can then provide a real basis upon which teachers can build an effective instructional program in the areas tested. This paper provides a rationale for an unconventional yet meaningful item analysis and describes the procedures which will lead to greater implementation of item analysis data. (Author)",

The increase is shown to be greater at the lower than at the higher ranges of the score scale, with the first quartile increasing by 13 points, the third quartile by 9. Gain in the median total score is spread unevenly over the six subtest areas, being greatest in Alphabet (recognizing lower-case letters by name) and least in Copying. In 1964 the first quartile on the Alphabet test was 5 letters, in 1972/1973 it was 12 letters. These changes in readiness development would seem to have significant implications for first-grade instruction. (Author)",

First, research and development capability is essential to the fulfillment of the responsiblilities and objectives of any state department of education. Second, state departments of education are uniquely different from other educational institutions and agencies in their purpose and, therefore, in the type of research and development products required. Traditionally, state departments of education have been forced to rely upon professional knowledge and political astuteness for fulfillment of their objectives. This limited management approach is no longer adequate. A commitment must be made to the objective problem solving techniques developed under the broad label of research and development. When a state department of education does discover  the important role of research and development, it then has the problem of determining an appropriate model to carry on these activities. A criteria for developing state education R&D models, or to evaluate their effectiveness is presented along with a discussion of Tennessee's R&D Model including a management chart illustrating administrative implementation.

An analysis of the data revealed: 1) Under incentive conditions, scores on confidence tests are higher, and reliability significantly lower when compared to the relaxed conditions. 2) Females have a greater tendency toward taking extreme positions than males, especially in the incentive condition. 3) Subjects in the incentive group liked the test better, had more of a tendency to take extreme positions, and  made more appropriate estimates of their degree of confidence. 4) Middle socioeconomic subjects, compared to both upper and lower socioeconomic subjects, made higher scores and more appropriate estimates of confidence. 5) High scoring subjects gambled more on difficult items under the relaxed condition, but gambled less on difficult items in the incentive condition. 6) Positive attitudes toward the tests were directly related to degree of confidence.

The study investigated achievement differences between desegregated and not-desegregated pupils and variables affecting their achievement. Several statistical techniques were used to investigate differences and the effects of sex, race and economic indices on achievement and achievement gain. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were done. Race accounted for a greater portion of variance than any other predictor. Economic indices were also of major importance. However, only a small portion of variance was accounted for. Generally, this study supports the literature and implies that affective, psychological and attitudinal variables may be better  predictors of achievement. (Author)",

Despite widespread interest in the impact of various inputs on the amount learned by students, little attention has been devoted to the choice of output measure. This paper argues in favor of the use of a variety of measures in analyzing resource effectiveness. To illustrate the importance of this position, several resource allocation questions are considered: (1) Do experienced teachers do a better job of teaching economics than less experienced ones? (2) Are graduate students as effective at teaching economics as members of the faculty? (3) Does the hour at which an economics course is taught have any effect on student  performance? The data to answer these questions were obtained from pre and post questionnaires administered to successive macroeconomic principles classes at Florida State University. A total of 301 students were included in the sample. (Author)",

The initial efforts of the evaluation team have been directed toward assisting the instructional and management people in the attaching of behavioral  meanings to the goals and objectives of the Project. Doing so facilitated the formulation of a productive evaluation plan in the form of an organizational chart which is included in the document.

This study employed tests of I.Q., personality inventories and classical and operant conditioning of autonomic nervous system controlled variables. Eleven procedures were given to 99 Black inner city high school seniors. Six physiological variables were analyzed directly on a computer using analog-to-digital conversion and programs which identified and summarized all responses and recoveries to the tones and pain stimuli of the classical conditioning and those during the operant conditioning using analog biofeedback of heart rate. Achievement (ACH) was defined as the residuals of average total grade point average (GPA) regressed on I.Q. Both ACH and GPA were examined as to  their components. Results of regression analyses showed that 50.89% of the variance of GPS was accounted for by I.Q. 20.44%, Edwards Personality Inventory 9.08%, operant conditioning 18.70%, and classical conditioning 2.6%. Findings from this study appear to justify the conclusions that for this population of students, the measures of motivation account for 30.45% of the variance whereas I.Q. accounts for only 20.46% of the variance in grades.

        "description":"When analysis of variance is used, statistically significant differences may or may not be of practical significance to educators. A large part of the problem is due to the fact that a \"zero difference\" null hypothesis can always be rejected statistically if the sample size is large enough. If, however, a method based on the noncentral F distribution is used, trivial differences cannot attain statistical significance. The (non-zero) null hypothesis is now rejected at the alpha level when the observed F exceeds the noncentral F cutoff point where the noncentrality parameter delta (sub0) is determined by the minimum practical difference set by the researcher.

Only the individual-study feedback groups in the low class improved on Posttest I. On Posttest II, with harder items and peer interaction, nearly all subjects overvalued information.

Each form of the test presented problem situations through four different modes: verbal stories, picture-book, color slides, three-dimension models. Advantaged and disadvantaged children from grades 2 and 4 were randomly assigned to test modes. Similar arrangements were made for testing concept formation. Stimulus material for the concept formation tests were presented via three modes: paper and pencil, motion picture film and actual objects. The degree of concreteness in the mode of presentation does affect the performance of children on the tasks. For only one of the the  tasks, however, did the socioeconomic factor exhibit systematic relationships with the factor of concreteness. On the problem-solving task, all children performed best on the more concrete forms. Advantaged children out performed disadvantaged on all forms. On the concept formation tasks, however, the disadvantaged children out performed advantaged children on the most concrete test form. Additional factors which may have influenced test performance are discussed. A substantial reference listing, concept learning tests, and problem-solving tests are included. (Author/RC)",

Part II contains a definition of meta-evaluation and a set of premises to undergird a conceptualization of  meta-evaluation. Most of part two is devoted to a logical structure for designing meta-evaluation studies. The third part of the paper is an application of the logical structure presented in Part II. Basically Part III contains 5 meta-evaluation designs. Four of the designs are for use in guiding evaluation work, and the fifth is used in judging completed evaluation work.

The high IQ minority child, therefore, might be better understood than previously. Most data in this area has been collected on black children and youth although other cultural groups in America are now being studied more closely. These include studies of other minorities and analyses of whites according to national origins. High IQ black children and youth are most often found in homes and communities similar to the homes and communities on which IQ tests were standardized. Most are middle and upper class children or their families are upwardly mobile with strong hopes and aspirations for their children. High IQ minority children are to be regarded in the same light as high IQ  majority children. They are bright, quick children who will pick up the curriculum in a shorter period than most. Some are truly gifted children and should be afforded the independent study, career guidance and financial support which will enable society to benefit from the productive minds. Larger numbers of high IQ minority children can be expected to surface as more and more minority families reach middle class status. But the real challenge to parents and teachers and society, perhaps, is the full development of high IQ minority children from poverty families and gifted children from these families who have been identified by other means. The most important element in work with high ability minority children and youth is probably friendly encouragement and support.  (Author/JM)",

        "description":"As is enunciated by its policy guidelines, funds for compensatory education are being used to provide a diversity of intervention experiences for disadvantaged children. Difficulty in recognizing these implementation practices and outcomes has arisen because of a more popular, but narrow, view of compensatory education. Instead of attempting to discover whether intervention patterns have been established to administer to the needs of disadvantaged children, the emphases have been on identifying intrinsic conditions that would preclude the realization of the major goal of compensatory education. In 1972 a study was conducted with the purpose of determining whether the projects of a compensatory program were creating instructional and affective intervention units for meeting the  categorical needs of its target population. It was found that the intervention projects had formed four individually prescribed learning (IPL) conditions. Each IPL condition was well-defined and served a unique subgroup within the target population. In the majority of the cases, the matches between the instructional content of the IPLs and the needs of the target schools were good. Where the matches were less appropriate, the rates of progress were lowest. In the main, the study supported the hypothesis that compensatory programs provide not a single thrust but a number of individually prescribed learning conditions to meet the behavioral needs of the children in the target population. These data suggest that additional monies are needed to assist local educational agencies in bringing  into more proper alignment their current IPL conditions with the schools that they must serve.

The second purpose deals specifically with a recommended evaluational procedure; i.e., the discussion centers around an account of what should be considered for inclusion if we are to adhere to the basic tenets of experimental research, and second, if we are to begin delineating relevant variables which affect the growth and development of impoverished children. On the basis of the discussion, the following factors are considered important in program planning: (1) the specific delimitation and delineation of a target area and sample within a specified geographic region. (2)  After having decided upon the selection criteria, then a random sample would be selected from the population and assigned randomly to experimental and control groups. (3) The specific goals of each center schould be clearly delineated. (4) Evaluation procedures should be standardized and built into the program; that is, each center should employ similar measurement indices and schedules for gathering data. (5) Limit generalizations primarily to the specific geographical region. (6) Admit children in infancy, or a very young age. (7) Follow-up studies should definitely be included as part of the evaluation process. (8) Provide for \"planned variations\" between programs. (9) Provide sufficient time to \"work out\" many of the problems inherent in the program. (1) Utilize two staffs--one for  research and one for every day implementation or treatment. (Author/JM)",

        "author":["Moran, Roberto E."],
        "description":"This essay, an attempt to trace the roots of prejudice, addresses such questions as: What is prejudice? Is it a unitary construct? Are the terms 'prejudice', 'segregation', 'discrimination' synonomous? Is prejudice innate or acquired? Is there a 'prejudiced personality-type', or is anyone capable of becoming prejudiced? Are prejudiced people more, or less, maladjusted than non-prejudiced ones? Why do some men have dark skin, and what natural function can dark skin possibly have, and so on? Seeking answers to these and other questions leads to the primary concern: the source of racial prejudice. In what layer of man's self are to be found the roots of his prejudice toward his fellow men? The approach is essentially inductive, beginning with the particular--man as a biological  unit--and proceeding to the general--man as a societal abstraction. The book--Racial Awareness in Young Children--reports, in non-technical language, a study which was begun in 1943 and concluded in 1948. It may be viewed as an important bridge between those studies which were primarily seeking an understanding of the development of racial prejudice, and those which were concerned with the personality concomitant of racial prejudice. The author's (Dr. Goodman's) focus, though ostensibly eclectic, is basically that of the cultural anthropologist. Through a series of intensive case studies, Dr. Goodman investigates the complex process underlying intergenerational persistence of the culturally predominant pattern of \"White\" over \"Black.\" (Author/JM)",

(2) Explore the role of the school in a viable community and the role of the community in the education of its children for the purpose of recognizing new relationships which might be developed between project schools and the communities they serve. (3)  Identify those areas or aspects of the total school situation, which need to be enhanced or changed in the case of each project school in order that the priority educational needs of students might be met more fully; and reach agreement as to which of these areas or aspects should be given priority status. (4) Identify and implement specific program improvements in each project school which both residents and school personnel believe to be desirable based on their understanding of the educational needs of students, the interdependence of school and community, and existing deficits or needs in project schools. At each school a Task Force comprised of interested school personnel and residents of the school attendance area met on a regular weekly basis to identify educational and program  needs and then to attempt implementation of designated projects.

        "author":["Levine, Daniel U."],
        "description":"In recent years a number of new institutions; i.e., \"street academies\", have been established to educate students who have dropped out or are prone to drop out of inner city secondary schools. There is reason to believe that many of these schools have been successful with youths who had not succeeded before, and therefore that lessons might be derived to help improve regular inner city schools. Some street academies enroll mainly young people who have done very poorly and either have dropped out or are on the verge of dropping out of regular public school programs. Some primarily serve youths who not only are dropouts or prospective dropouts but also have been classified by one or another institution as delinquent or pre-delinquents. Some are limited mostly to educating college  bound students. What exactly has been taking place in street academies which apparently have been functioning with a good deal of success? What follows in this paper is a brief analysis based primarily on several of the (relatively few) written descriptions of street academies which have been published. This analysis is offered in three parts: (1) an enumeration of principles derived from program descriptions and the first-hand accounts of staff, students, and/or visitors to several of the leading academies; (2) identification of several additional possible reasons for success which are less obvious and are seldom if ever cited explicitly in the literature; and (3) speculation on one global, difficult-to-objectify, program characteristic that may be particularly important in accounting  for the success of outstanding examples of the street academy approach.

General objectives are: to facilitate the utilization and evaluation of the LASER School Curriculum component in public schools; to develop specific, structured procedures, based on the inquiry approach, to enable site participants to interact in a  way that will lead to efficiency and self-sufficiency in utilizing the curriculum; and, to reformulate goals and objectives in the light of new results. Specific objectives for teachers are: to develop an understanding of the curriculum's philosophical foundation, objectives, and general teaching approach; to master the inquiry approach in (1) identifying (or defining) the problem, (2) hypothesizing, (3) testing the hypothesis, (4) drawing conclusions, (5) applying the conclusion, and (6) generalizing; to be aware of the purpose of each cognitive task; to create a classroom atmosphere that induces free exchange of ideas; to employ a variety of resources; to incorporate ideas, suggestions or materials of others to advance work; to engage students in the evaluative process, particularly of  materials used; and others.

        "description":"Urban and rural development requires an innovative problem-solving mechanism that would better use the leverage inherent in available resources. There is a model of such an institution now evolving in depressed areas which warrants a substantial investment of Ford Foundation funds: the Community Development Corporation (CDC)--an organization whose raison d'etre is the efficient allocation of resources to improve the conditions of life in minority communities. The CDC is a locally controlled, tax-exempt corporation that operates programs aimed at both immediate relief of severe social and economic disadvantaged and at eventual regeneration of its community. Its programs are usually funded by grants or investments from government and the private sector; and they seek primarily to  increase jobs and income, to improve housing and to secure better services from local government, business, and utilities, and to foster a sense of hope in communities that have been stagnant or deteriorating. Although governed by boards representing coalitions of local interests, the most effective CDCs are run by strongly individualistic executives. The National Affairs Division of the Foundation has embarked on a series of experiments to develop and test this new kind of institution through support of a group of CDCs, which vary by race, region, organizational structure, and program emphasis. The primary goal of these experiments is to strengthen a promising development institution. A directly related purpose is to conduct operational research on the development process; i.e.,  especially minority community development; still another objective is to train leaders and managers.

        "description":"This study of levels of self-esteem in a sample of black disadvantaged children was conducted to investigate factors known from other studies to facilitate the development and maintenance of a favorable self-concept despite adverse environmental conditions and skin color. The child subjects were selected from six classes of fifth grade black children in a de facto segregated section of Harrisburg. Self-concept was assessed by the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, which is a wide-range standardized instrument reflecting feelings about behavior, intellectual status, popularity, physical appearance and attributes, anxiety, and happiness. Teacher ratings were made using Coopersmith's Behavior Rating Form. The &quot;high&quot; group comprised 15 boys whose scores were 64 or above on  the Piers-Harris, and in the highest quartile of their class on the teacher ratings. The &quot;low&quot; group comprised 15 boys whose scores were 48 or below on the Piers-Harris and in the lowest quartile of their class on teacher ratings. The &quot;high&quot; group had better peer relationships, better achievement test scores in some areas, and somewhat better mother-child relationships. Neither the boys nor their mothers in the &quot;high&quot; group displayed better acceptance of black identity. Since the mean self-concept levels of this population were at or above the means for white samples, it appears that the effects on self-esteem or minority race or low socioeconomic level are not inevitably negative, but depend to a considerable degree on aspects of the immediate social environment.

The students were assigned at random to groups in a 2 x 2 x 2 randomized factorial design. The factors were presence vs. absence of positive  teacher expectancy instructions concerning students' academic potential; positive student expectancy instructions concerning each student's academic potential; and positive feedback concerning each student's academic performance. Pre- and post-treatment measures of academic performance were administered. Treatments were carried out in seven half-hour sessions in which subjects watched neutral films. Analysis of variance revealed teacher effects which suggest that teachers differentially changed their subjective ratings of student academic potential, differentially change the grades given to their students, and differentially affected their students' post-treatment test scores all independently of any of the controlled variables in this study.

        "description":"During the 1960's a growing body of experimental evidence suggesting that early malnutrition could affect the development and the functioning of the brain was translated into a concern that nutritional deprivation might be producing permanent mental retardation among \"disadvantaged\" children. The purpose of this paper is to show, through a review of the relevant literature, that such a concern, while humanitarian in its inspiration, is misplaced. The bulk of the available evidence appears to indicate that malnutrition produces what might be called mental retardation only when it occurs in early infancy and is both severe and prolonged. Even under such circumstances, rehabilitation appears to be possible if the children in question are provided with both adequate food and  appropriate intellectual stimulation. In this country, however, such serious malnutrition is highly unusual--American poor children are much less likely to be severely malnourished than they are to be chronically hungry. Though there is little experimental evidence about the effect of children's hunger on their classroom performance, chronic hunger will obviously sap a child's energy and attention. Moreover, since it is a mark of poverty, it will also stigmatize him. Moreover, the kinds of children exposed to chronic hunger in the U.S. are also likely to have experienced other stresses associated with environments which may be both physically and mentally impoverished. Which makes it unlikely that the effect of nutrition alone on mental development will ever be teased out experimentally.  In the richest country in the world no child ought ever to sit hungry in the classeoom. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"To advance towards a science of human behavior there must be well-defined constructs. This aspect of theory building tends to be neglected in the research conducted and services provided with respect to Afro-American and other people of color. Consequently, there has been so little relevant social science. In recent times large numbers of Afro-Americans have engaged in self-directed shifts in personal social behavior. These changes in role behavior have been indicative of the search for an authentic identity. This direction begins with the political choice which supports the psychological freedom of self-determination to define what has been, is and will be for Afro-Americans as a people. Until this approach is embedded in the attitudes and assumptions of scholars no other  scientific evidence will exist to show this denunciation of traditional behavioral sets as a major personality change. Personality differentiation is important along specific anthropomorphic lines that accommodate patterns of growth which develop out of coping and defending. The anthropological boundary of personality development has significance in its stimulation and support of certain self-reliant life styles. Modal activity or role behavior becomes important as self-expressions of social adaptation which transforms perceptions into goal directed behavior. Personality studies on ethnics of color become more than impulse release and affection or the constant reach for refinements in deficity modeling. Instead, assumptions about behavior can be put more neatly in terms of variations  structured by the para-culture and by the entire society. (Author/JM)",

In 1966 a Division of Urban Education was established. One of the major goals was to improve instruction for inner city children. Improvement of communication skills at the elementary level was emphasized, particularly in reading. In implementing this decision, the Sullivan Programmed Reading Program was introduced to the schools in 1968. Reading specialists were assigned to each of the 13 elementary schools participating in the Title I program. Speech improvement/language development teachers were assigned to work with classroom teachers. Paraprofessional aides were recruited and  trained to help classroom teachers. Resource centers were added in some schools, and more audiovisual and instructional materials were provided. An expanded in-service training program for teachers was mounted. An instructional services center to coordinate special services and assist in developing educational materials was established. The basic study of program impact was to be through comparison of scores of long term students in Title I schools, Model Cities schools, and Partial Title I schools, both sixth and third grade students. In addition; third grade data for all students in 1966 would be compared across categories. Within categories, data for 1966 third grade students would be compared with 1972 data for evidence of change. Finally, evidence of trends would be sought in school  average scores for the period, 1966 through 1972. (Author/JM)",

These councils would provide community action, community education and communal poverty programs. At present, 36 organizations, representing a wide  variety of Jewish interests and concerns, serve as members. A response to Jewish poverty must synthesize the dichotomy between personal and community poverty. In the area of personal poverty, recognition must be made of the wealth of existing Jewish resources providing direct aid. The prime concern has been that existing agencies are not sensitive to local needs. Attention has also been called to the diffusion of Jewish resources to non-Jewish segments of the population. An attempt to alleviate Jewish communal poverty should be made through the vehicles of local Jewish community councils. Recognizing this dichotomy of need, it was felt that the Coordinating Council should concentrate upon the problems of communal poverty.

        "description":"Cumulative deficit is an hypothesis concerning the cause of lower mental test scores of groups considered environmentally deprived. It presupposes a progressive decrement in test scores, relative to population norms, as a function of age. Clarification of the theoretical issues and the methodological problems involved in establishing the progressive decrement phenomenon are discussed in relation to the relevant research on disadvantaged groups, especially American Negroes. In this group in particular there is no methodologically adequate evidence in the literature for a progressive decrement in IQ or other mental measurements. The study reported here used differences between younger and older siblings, which satisfies rigorous methodological requirements for the detection of  progressive decrement. The entire Berkeley Unified School District's elementary school population, consisting of some 8,000 children in 17 schools, was given a battery of tests by 20 specially trained testers (12 whites and eight Negroes). From school records and from questionnaires sent to the children's parents, all full sibships within the elementary school population were identified. The only tests considered in this study are the Lorge-Thorndike IQ tests, because they were the only tests in the battery for which published nationwide age norms are available. The results indicated a slight but significant decrement in Verbal but not in Nonverbal IQ among a large sample of Negro elementary school children. The same method detected no progressive decrement in the white school population.  (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Since its creation in 1957, the Commission on Civil Rights has investigated and analyzed the issue of employment discrimination. The employment picture for our society indicates that the groups victimized by discriminatory employment practices still carry the burden of that wrongdoing. The mechanisms created by Title VII alone cannot handle the dimensions of the problem. In FY 1972 the EEOC received 38,840 complaints; it expects 45,000 new complaints during the next fiscal year. The growing backlog of cases is now 53,410, of which 43,101 are pending investigation. Conciliation enforcement and litigation against employment discrimination cannot receive EEOC priority in such a situation. In recent years the Nation has been witness to a shift in policy from the enacting of  legislation to the implementation of nondiscrimination laws. In its wake the move has given rise to a debate concerning the parameters of affirmative action and the possible sanctioning of quota systems and reverse discrimination to achieve nondiscriminatory employment. To offer a Commission view of this issue, the Commissioners have prepared this Position Statement for public discussion and official consideration. Part I is a survey of the present status of the law and the basis for affirmative action. Part II is a review of certain terms relevant to this area. Part III is an effort to respond to certain questions that inevitably evolve out of such discussions. And Part IV discusses the policy considerations invoked by the affirmative action issue and proposes ultimate objectives for  nondiscrimination in employment nationally. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The Elementary Secondary Education Act Title I Elementary Basic Skills program operated in 72 schools during fiscal year 1973. There were approximately 23,443 identified Title I pupils who received the services of the program. The first major program objective pertains directly to reading comprehension and anticipates a gain of ten school months in a ten-month period (April 1972-April 1973) for between 70-80 percent of all Title I participants. E.S.E.A. Title I kindergarten and grade one pupils, for example, received the Promary Mental Abilities Test, a reading readiness test which was reported in a raw score equivalent to mental age. The Spring 1973 data indicated that almost 69 percent of the kindergarten pupils had a mental age of 5.8 in Verbal Meaning. In terms of growth of  the pupils in kindergarten in 1972 and grade one in 1973 who were eligible for Title I based on test scores, almost 48 percent grew ten months and more in mental age in Verbal Meaning. The second primary program objective relates to the ability of the pupils in grades one through four to express themselves in writing. Evaluation of the student's writing was based on pre-established criteria. Data were requested from all Title I elementary schools for Title I pupils by grade. A systematic sampling of students was drawn and their writing was evaluated according to the pre-established criteria. The data examined in relation to specific objectives for the FY 1973 Elementary Basic Skills Program suggest that the program is working toward the total accomplishment of the objectives. Gains were  made at each grade level. (Author/JM)",

Primary emphasis has been given to two major subject areas: materials dealing with the situation of immigrant ethnic groups, their psychological adjustment, and conditions affecting acculturation; and materials dealing with patterns of ethnic behavior, identity, family life, and communication structure. Because the study of ethnic groups encompasses such a large number of topics, any bibliography treating even selected aspects would have to limit scope and coverage. Extensive coverage of American Negroes, American Indians, and Mexican Americans is not attempted in this document. Some of the more recent general studies of these  groups, and general studies on intergroup and ethnic-racial relations, have been included, but it was felt that materials specific to Negroes, Indians, and Mexican Americans were better dealt with in specialized bibliographies. The significance of ethnicity in American life is a major program concern of the Center for Studies of Metropolitan Problems.

The papers by Irwin Garfinkel and by Glen Cain and Harold Watts review large numbers of studies on this question. These authors caution us against having great confidence in the detailed estimates of how workers will respond because limitations exist in all the studies. On the other hand, the reviews do give reliable guidance about the direction and order of magnitude of likely effects. According to most of the studies, one would expect prime age married men not to alter significantly their pattern of work in response to the availability of an expanded income supplement program. There is also general agreement that increasing income guarantees or benefit-loss rates  would cause a moderate reduction in hours of work (in market jobs, not necessarily in the home) among married women, female family heads, and older men. In his paper, Samuel Rea, Jr. compares more than 20 negative income tax, wage subsidy, and earnings subsidy proposals. Rea uses one set of estimated relationships that specify how a beneficiary's hours of work depend on his wage rate, unearned income (pensions, rents, dividends), and those feature of income maintenance programs that influence his net wage rate and unearned income. Given predictions of worker response and data representative of the national population in 1966, Rea is able to examine how specific program changes affect budget costs, hours of work, and the share of benefits going to the lowest income groups.

These special compensatory services (as individual projects) are systematically assigned on a pupil needs basis. Compensatory education programs have made a significant impact on the achievement characteristics of the pupils served. Although the current level of pupil achievement is not as high as would be expected, significant inroads have been made toward arresting their declining achievement trend. Moreover, there is strong evidence which suggests that compensatory education programs have caused the establishment of viable, prescriptive instructional services. When  considered as comprehensive, prescriptive inputs directed toward the needs of the pupils in the eligible schools, these services become systematic efforts made to upgrade the educational program and the level of pupil services of each school. In this behalf, individual compensatory educational projects become the ingredients for augmenting the eligible schools' educational program, as well as special efforts to administer to identified needs. For these reasons, the decision to expand, discontinue, or reduce a single project is not a simple one--the decision has to be made within the context of the total strategy of a school system's program.

This program, launched in 1969, has the goal of improving the nutrition knowledge and diets of poor families. A related objective is to encourage program families to enroll in USDA food assistance programs. Sampled homemakers receiving food stamps had better diets, larger families, and higher incomes than homemakers in the food  distribution program or those eligible for but not participating in a food assistance program. Approximately 37 percent of EFNEP families participated in USDA food assistance programs in 1969. Significant differences in socioeconomic characteristics and food consumption practices existed among EFNEP families according to their food assistance program status. Among participants and those eligible but not participating, food stamp families fared best in both economic and food consumption characteristics.

From 1965 through fiscal year 1973, about 206 million dollars was obligated for grants to and contracts with institutions of higher education and other qualifying public and private  organizations for planning, developing, or carrying out this program. GAO reviewed 15 projects in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont that had obligated 12.1 million dollars through June 30, 1972. Although Upward Bound might be motivating students to enroll in college, OE does not know how effective the program has been in achieving its goals of equipping students with the academic skills and motivation necessary for success in college. Available data indicates that the program apparently has not achieved this goal. In terms of college retention and graduation, Upward Bound has been substantially less effective than indicated by earlier research studies and OE's annual evaluation report to the Congress.

National Leadership Institute/Teacher Education (NLITE) staff estimates that this represents less than one-fifth of the number of effective programs in operation and compilation is therefore an on-going operation with expanded reports issued annually. One of the most heartening developments in school practices in recent years has been the increase in programs which enable disadvantaged children to receive a top-notch education in spite of poverty. Both the children and the nation benefit from the efforts of school teachers and administrators in this respect and a debt of gratitude is owed to a growing number. The National Leadership Institute/Teacher Education is a support  and dissemination center sponsored by the U.S. Office of Education for which the University of Connecticut serves as host. This compilation of program descriptions was made by NLITE staff which gathered data from several sources including the annual Education Fair (Edu Fair) sponsored by the U.S. Office of Education, reports of the Council for Basic Education and the National Education Association, and invitations to school districts to submit reports and data from their programs.

The program is designed to achieve this goal by training, installing, and utilizing parents as linkage agents. Their functions include serving as sources of information about their children, as informants, as participant-observers, as participant-developers/evaluators of educational materials, and engaging in dialogue with teachers of their children. Program work is divided into five different components: Parental-Inclusion; Home-School Similarity; Teacher Training; Program Planning and Direction; and Application and Utilization. The strategy selected by the program includes needs analysis, information collection and organization, problem  clarification, and process-and-product-development in areas where feasibility tests and pilot studies indicate developmental work is justified. The program produces a number of knowledge products and the preliminary form of certain developmental products. Products are used (a) to design and implement the role of the linkage agent, and (b) to assist school personnel in designing and implementing appropriate alternative environments which will help low-income children develop in a manner comparable to their middle-class counterparts. Program work and products are evaluated in terms of their ability to provide needed and valid information in a usable format, and their ability to enable educators to design appropriate learning environments for low-income children.

The Continuing Education Unit (CEU) was defined by the task force: ten contact hours of participation in an organized continuing education experience under responsible sponsorship, capable direction, and qualified instruction. The Southern Association of Schools and Colleges officially adopted the CEU in its revised Standard Nine for continuing education activities. The adoption of the CEU is  becoming increasingly widespread. The National University Extension Association, in addition to being one of the sponsors of the conference cited, is concerned with the issues concerning the CEU: the quality control of noncredit activities and the need for an accrediting association, the institutional arrangement for accrediting, and the financing of CEU-related activities.

A National Occupational Competency Testing Institute (NOCTI) has been established to assure effective continuing service to vocational education; the Educational Testing Service will administer and  score the NOCTI examinations nationally, report the test results, carry on research, and develop additional tests.

At the end of 1973, veterans' unemployment rate had fallen to about four percent, the lowest level in more than three years. The proportion of employed veterans was smaller than that of nonveterans in professional-technical jobs and  larger in craft jobs.

As participants moved to consensus on the third questionnaire, the  significant response differences disappeared. (3) Responses to items stated as process statements generally showed greater variance than did responses to items stated as educational outcome. (4) The higher education representatives were most tenacious in their opinions and students the least.

If career education is to be maximally effective, it must start at the beginning of a child's education, be continuous through his education, and provide opportunity for continuing education to update skills. The levels of career education are viewed as being a pyramid, with students making decisions about careers and needed training based upon  broad exploratory experiences and counseling obtained through the program. As students narrow their choices about career selections, individual career experiences become more sophisticated and intensified.

Today's challenge is that of bringing together concerned citizens, public agencies, and private agencies in an effort to create a correctional system that works. Correctional programs can accomplish nothing if there is no place, no work, and no second chance in the community for the ex-offender. Recognition of this situation is bringing about changes in legislation and attitudes, and, most important, the creation of community-based programs, of which Job Therapy is one of the more effective volunteer programs. The Federal system now operates 15 such facilities and has outside contracts for over 100 others. Both Federal and State  prisons are critically overcrowded, and, in addition, we now recognize that more than mere incarceration is needed to change or deter offenders. We have a desperate need for better facilities and more, better trained, and better paid personnel so that our correctional system can provide for the human needs of privacy and dignity. This must be coupled with community based, publicly supported programs on a person-to-person basis, so that the ex-offender's intentions to make good can be realized. (SA)",

The study resulted in the &quot;Guide&quot; to be used in promoting effective company training programs for disadvantaged people. It outlines ways in which a link may be established bewteen companies needing assistance by a group of volunteer people who have experience in one or more components of the JOBS Program. The volunteers' time devoted to technical assistance ordinarily would be contributed to NAB by their employers. The Metro office would coordinate the activities of volunteers with the needs of requesting companies. The &quot;Guide&quot; explains what technical  assistance is, how it works, what it can and cannot do. Suggestions for determining whether or not a Metro should provide a technical assistance program and for organizing and implementing a program are detailed.

The State of Maryland discovered in 1968 that there was no orderly or systematic provision of career guidance services. The formation of an Interdivisional Task Force on Career Development was approved and a Maryland Career Education Development Project design was funded. The State Board established career education as a major educational thrust. A series of national seminars in career education were held in 1972, followed by a local Governor's Conference and a State Professional Conference. Yet, two studies indicated the students had not experienced any measurable change in provision of services to meet their career development needs. It is apparent that without the help and  involvement of institutions preparing counselors and teachers, State efforts would always be belated. The unique as well as the common competencies needed by counselors and teachers would have to be described and delivered during the preservice years. There has been some movement in this direction.

Information was gathered from apprentices, journeymen, apprentice coordinators, and others by means of personal interviews and/or mail questionnaires. The data were used to estimate the impact of related instruction on individual job performance. The principal hypothesis was that related instruction has multiple roles, varying by trade and the particular objectives of different sponsors. It was possible to identify the independent effect of related instruction on job performance. In all three crafts the primary objective of related instruction was to equip apprentices with the technical knowledge and  manipulative skills to become versatile all round journeymen. Only in the electrical trade did related instruction seem to offer a significant explanation of the variation in individual performance. It was almost impossible to coordinate related instruction with on-the-job training in construction. In the machinist trade, the degree of coordination varied from firm to firm. (Author/SA)",

The guide presents objectives, learning activities, topics, and resources related to specific units and subunits. Basic supportive units cover turfgrass and weed identification, turfgrass mechanics, pest control, soils and fertilizers, and use of a transit. Broad functional units included are the maintenance and establishment of home lawns, golf courses, athletic fields, institutional and industrial grounds, and highway roadsides. The guide is designed as a one-year  course; however, it is adaptable as a two-year course by expanding units. (EA)",

        "description":"The author has reviewed and discussed the separatism existing among vocational, technical, and academic education and between secondary and post-secondary educational institutions. Results are reported of two national surveys to determine the perceptions of key State officials on the status of articulation of secondary and post-secondary occupational education programs in each State. Findings clearly indicated, \"Separatism still exists with the nature and degree of difficulty in articulation directly related to the relationships of the agencies involved.\" It was revealed that State organizational structure had a significant impact on the articulation of secondary and post-secondary occupational education; where structures foster separate jurisdictions, special efforts to form  lines of communication and interworking relationships were necessary for successful articulation. Several national efforts and State activities (North Carolina, Oregon, Florida, Utah, and New York) in secondary and post-secondary articulation have been included as ways to attack the problem. The author has presented the position that mistrust among educators must be eliminated and greater articulation between educational levels and subject matter areas must be established if a true educational continuum is to be realized.

        "description":"Vocational development theories categorized as trait-and-factor approaches, decision-model approaches, sociological approaches, psychological approaches, and developmental approaches are presented to show how they might be applied in elementary, middle, and high school career education programs. The paper describes The Multi-Component Career Education Curriculum Model, developed at Eastern Illinois University, as an example of the current use of vocational development theory, learning theor, child growth and development theory, and curriculum development theory in formulating curricular materials and procedures for career education programs. It is emphasized that in building such programs, the interaction of the various theories is needed, not just the application of vocational  development theories alone. Career development takes place over a number of years; occupational choice is not &quot;a point in time event;&quot; and an individual chooses occupations which will allow him to function in a role consistent with his self-concept. In developing career education materials the occupational, economic, social, family, moral, and leisure being must be considered in order to help students learn how to become the persons they want to be and are capable of becoming.

Ongoing industrial arts programs for gifted children, slow learners, mentally and physically handicapped, disadvantaged and culturally deprived, and dropouts are identified and comprise most of the document. Only materials written during the last decade are covered in the review. It is concluded that industrial arts literature contains very little for the physically handicapped, mentally superior, or emotionally disturbed student. To better serve the needs of special students, it is recommended that industrial arts educators: (1) reconceptualize the rationale for industrial arts study at all grade levels for those students; (2)  restructure instructional objectives in behavioral terms; (3) develop and evaluate instructional units and systems, instructional technology, and instructional software and hardware; (4) modify teacher education; change the teacher's role; (5) expand efforts for therapeutic and remedial contributions for exceptional children; (6) use empirical research and evaluation techniques in materials development; and (7) provide inservice education.

The study collected data through: a questionnaire administered to teachers, administrators, and students; research site visits; interviews of administrators and vocational and career education coordinators; and a review of the guidelines used at each research site for the implementation of the Stull Act. Six public school districts and one county program participated in the study. Study findings revealed that teachers, administrators, and students have different perceptions of teacher competence, and they differ on the stated goals for vocational and career education. The study indicated a  need for greater communication between teachers and administrators in understanding basic goals and concepts of vocational and career education. Teachers and administrators need to become more knowledgeable about the requirements of the Stull Act and its implementation as required by the State of California.

Another purpose was to identify and report the various patterns of organization, characteristics, and distinct features of existing internship programs in business teacher education. A questionnaire was designed and submitted to universities holding membership in the North-central region of the National Business Education Association. Eighteen hypotheses were constructed, and the results reported. An interview outline was designed and personal and telephone interviews were conducted in institutions which offered internship programs for business education students. Conclusions indicated no one  institutional pattern for student teaching, internship, or the administration and supervision of programs. Preteaching experiences were similar for both student teachers and interns, while time allocation was less for student teaching than for internship. There appeared to be a direction toward the development of internship programs for business teacher education students. In some universities, the internship has been offered as an alternative to student teaching. Implications of the study were the need for State departments of certification to provide an official label or certification to assure suitable status and legal protection. (EA)",

Where may the CEU be applied? The judgmental factor serving degree programs can't be  uniformly applied; in the final analysis, the marketplace decides. How is the CEU to be used? The user, alone or in groups, determines where his continuing education program takes him. The sponsor should be concerned only with the merits of the modular product or CEU of the group served.

A broad national approach is being developed to bring to maturity the disorganized elements of continuing education programs. The engineering profession, in coping with the problems of rapid technological change, has made efforts to establish updating programs.

This need not be if records are kept where generated, purged every ten, fifteen, or twenty years, and the user instructed to maintain his own dossier. A national records center is not needed. (3) How can we be sure of the quality of continuing education? The broad spectrum of sponsorship dictates: \"Let the utility rest in the eyes of the beholder.\" Let the user (marketplace) decide which is the appropriate offering and mission for the given sponsor in  the context of his perceived need.

Many professional societies and associations have committees studying requirements and making recommendations to membership for maintaining professional updating. Therefore, we must start now to lay the groundwork for the future situation as we conceive it will probably be. A structural element on which to organize continuing education experience is the Continuing Education Unit (CEU), which will make recordkeeping possible. The history of the CEU development began with a National Planning Conference at which various points of view were presented. The need for a uniform unit of measurement for non-credit continuing  education activities was recognized, as was the role of the consumer of the educational product. A task force was organized to conduct a feasibility study for a uniform measurement unit to be used, and the CEU was the product of the study. Designed to give recognition for organized but non-credit continuing education experiences, the CEU meets the needs of this educational area. (AG)",

The proposal seeks to define the circumstances under which noncredit continuing education might lend itself to measurement and documentation in more or less standard terms. Sponsors of organized learning experiences will be encouraged to refer to their programs as continuing education so they can be considered as part of the area of concern. Sponsors will also be encouraged to use continuing education units (CEUs) in their program descriptions. The CEU has many advantages, and standards in its application should be established. Other  standards to be considered are adequate descriptions of the continuing education experiences, maintaining records, and assessing qualitatively individual performances. This system would offer a broad range of benefits to individuals, instructors, administrators, institutions, employers, organizations, and government agencies. (AG)",

There are two purposes of the CEU: to establish a unit to record the participation of individuals in continuing education to verify their educational experience and to provide uniform data and records. If the entire definition of the CEU is applied to problems in using the unit, most of the problems will be solved. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools adopted Standard Nine which dictates the use of CEU for all continuing education activities of a noncredit nature, and that the units be translated into fulltime equivalent students. Guidelines are being developed for CEU implementation. Many institutions are now using the  CEU; the Univ. of Akron has published a catalog listing CEU values for each course. A computerized system for recording and retrieving information on individuals earning CEU has been developed. How the CEU will relate to the college credit in non-traditional degree programs is a problem for discussion. (AG)",

Adults today need a kind of accreditation that recognizes both their continuing pursuit of competence and their current level of ability. Activities outside of and supplemental to more traditional curriculum programs provide the kind of learning opportunity needed and constitute the present major form of continuing education. The development of the CEU and pilot projects in its use were the result of a task force study of the feasibility of a uniform unit of measurement for continuing education activities. The CEU was formally recognized by the  Southern Association of Colleges and Schools in its revised Standard Nine. In response to confusion over the implications of Standard Nine and the CEU concept, a series of statements clarified the CEU and the implications of Standard Nine on several levels. The use of the unit is expected to spread. (Author/AG)",

The first independent variable, \"self-regulation,\" consisted of three levels: (a) a no self-monitoring condition, (b) a self-monitoring condition, and (c) a self-monitoring with self-evaluation condition. The second independent variable, visual imagery, involved the administration of positive, neutral, or aversive images contingent upon an actual or perceived increase in the target response. The data were analyzed using a 3x3 factorial design in a multivariate analysis of covariance and a repeated measures analysis of covariance. No significant differences were found on the major hypotheses, but a  remarkable trend in the interaction graphs stimulates a number of specific suggestions to further researchers. (Author)",

The research design consisted of process evaluation and product evaluation. The process evaluation involved a two-part questionnaire and self-rating scale designed for use by the project counselors and aides. Statuses 00 (Referral), 10 (Plan Development), and 26 (Closed Rehabilitation) were selected for product evaluation based on the caseloads. Results of the questionnaire show the following: (1) aides are productive and their positions should be legally  established and expanded; (2) aides' roles should be clearly delineated; (3) structured programs should be developed for their training and upgrading; and (4) they should have job security to improve their morale. Product evaluation shows that while aides require specific training in casefinding methods and in developing referral sources, they do render valuable help in many areas. The overall evaluation indicates that the project has succeeded to a degree in demonstrating an effective way of rehabilitating disabled residents of a large metropolitan city. (RWP)",

In the socialization process, all individuals must learn to handle themselves in a variety of situations, i.e., all must learn to be assertive, dependent, compassionate, etc. The exact behavior which emerges may vary depending upon factors such as the current social milieu or the method by which an individual has been taught to express these emotions.

Results indicate that rural and urban classrooms, in general, have measurably different learning climates, with significantly more cohesive structures being prevalent in rural classrooms than in urban classrooms.

The grand mean serves as an overall index of student perception of the entire guidance program. Guidance programs which received a high rating by students tended to be administered by counselors who received high scores on the Time-Competence scale of the POI. A Time-Competent Individual tends to be able to respond to the needs and expectations of the moment while simultaneously placing them into their proper perspective in terms of the past and future.

Eleventh grade males (80) were assigned to an experimental or a control group. The treatments were: (1) structured group interaction; (2) group social modeling; and  (3) group social modeling plus structured interaction. Treatment outcomes were measured by administering to each student an attitude questionnaire, career planning inventory, vocational information survey, and a vocational planning questionnaire. Analysis of results show no significant differences among groups on any of the test scores.

        "description":"This paper explores the relationship between public welfare agencies and juvenile courts in cases involving child abuse. Data was gathered from eight Southeastern States through questionnaires and personal interviews with agency officials. The findings are incorporated into a discussion of agency-court relationships in the areas of adjudication (the function of assessing the facts to determine if the state should intervene on behalf of the child) and disposition (the function of determining the most appropriate action the State should take). The function of adjudication poses two major problem areas in agency-court relationships: (1) welfare agencies, which are responsible for case preparation and presentation, are not equipped with adequate legal resources; and (2) the lack of  well-defined criteria for defining abuse often leads to conflict between the agency and the juvenile court on determination of case status. The disposition of a case is another source of conflict between the agency and court because this is the responsibility of the judge, who often disregards the agency's recommendations although the agency has primary responsibility for followup. The author concludes that a more coordinated agency-court relationship is necessary to deal with the seriousness and legal complexities of child abuse. (RWP)",

It is the purpose of this paper to propose and describe a series of mutual rights and responsibilities of the minority community and the social researcher toward each other, and to discuss various difficulties in fulfilling such rights and responsibilities. Specific suggestions are delineated in charging Federal funding agencies with the responsibility of protecting and promoting the rights of both the minority group and the social researcher. A working model which is  being used successfully in a minority (American Indian) community research and development project is described. Participatory decision-making, from the initial stages of a research project until its completion, is seen as the key to minority group utilization of social science research in society today, with such participation being facilitated by specific styles of research which are discussed.

Section I focuses on studies which use working adults and, to some extent, vocational high school students as subjects. Section II provides a review of sociological viewpoints of the impact which chance factors may make on an individual's vocational decision. In general, the reviewers found mixed results concerning the validity of Holland's theoretical propositions. There is some evidence that person-environment congruence is related to other important vocational variables and much agreement--across theorists and researchers--that workers search for a vocational environment compatible with their vocational personality. Other hypothetical  assumptions made by Holland were less well supported. They include the concept of the consistency of a vocational personality and the interpretation of personality patterns as homogeneous differentiated or heterogeneous. There is much evidence to support Holland's vocational typology. (Author)",

Both of these terms refer to processes for changing behavior through imaginal responses. Two general strategies have been employed. One has been to increase or decrease the power of a particular environmental stimulus to elicit a given response by pairing that stimulus with a pleasant or an aversive word, image, or feeling in imagination. Subjects are asked to vividly imagine the stimulus and to pair it with an aversive covert response if the purpose is to reduce the positive valence of the stimulus or a pleasant covert response if a positive valence is to be established or increased. A  second strategy has been to have a target behavior, a behavior to be increased or decreased, performed in the imagination and followed by an imagined reinforcement or punishment. Thinking about making a response is regarded as an approximation to it (Homme, 1965). The expectation is that if the imagined stimulus and response are similar to the actual stimulus and response there will be a transfer from imagination to the actual situation through the process of stimulus generalization (Cautela, 1972).

The sample consists of 37 elementary school teachers and their students. The teachers were asked to recommend their pupils for placement in high, middle, or low reading groups for the following year and name the criteria on which they based the placement of each child. These ratings were then compared with another rating of the same pupils based on reading comprehension test scores. A comparison of the two ratings shows that teachers placed some pupils in groups other than indicated as appropriately by their reading  test scores. An examination of the rating criteria indicates that teachers rely mainly on perceived ability, achievement, and work habits; however, some students were misplaced on the basis of nonacademic criteria relating to social class. The author concludes that these findings do not fully support the commonly held belief that teachers are furthering socioeconomic segregation in their classrooms by using criteria for grouping which are related to students' socioeconomic status.

The Right to Read program is an effort to insure that by 1980 no student will leave our schools without the skills of reading and writing. It is founded on four principles: most children are educable; people, especially teachers and other educational personnel, can change; there are multiple causes of reading problems and, hence, there must be multiple approaches and multiple solutions; and enough knowledge about reading is available to solve the reading problems in our country. The delivery system is then described. The first part is providing good, sound information and making it  readily accessible and usable. The second part is continuing technical assistance from the Right to Read staff, who give needed help in planning, implementation, and staff development. But the real impact comes from the multiplier effect: the successes of the demonstration schools inspire neighboring schools to develop and implement their own programs, and so on. And finally, part of the Right to Read program's success must be credited to the involvement of the private sector. (TO)",

A new reading program will be needed for the sake of children with parents who are not sufficiently concerned about reading. Although the reading ability of preschool children today has become higher than ever before, we should not overlook the fact that there are still some children who do not read any letters upon entering elementary school. Since ability grouping or the double-promotion system is not accepted in Japanese education, an elementary school teacher necessarily encounters larger individual differences than ever before in his classroom, which in  Japan usually contains an extraordinarily large number of pupils. Coping with the big differences is the main problem in Japanese reading instruction on which further and urgent strategies are essential. (Author)",

        "description":"In an investigation similar to the early Secor (1900) and Pintner (1913) studies, a verbal distractor was used to demonstrate that comprehension of written materials, though reduced, was not completely disrupted when mature readers engaged in an irrelevant articulation exercise. Twelve undergraduate and graduate subjects participated in two conditions, one employing irrelevant articulation during silent reading and the other employing no articulation. A binomial test revealed that the irrelevant articulation subjects could perform significantly better than chance on the questions following each reading. The implications of this finding for the two-stage associative model of reading (Gillooly, 1972) are discussed. (Author)",

The sample was selected from among second, third, and fourth graders in each of two school systems. Within school systems, ten boys and ten girls were randomly selected from each of the three grade levels. Children selected from one school system had learned to read by a program with early, intensive phonics instruction. The children selected from the other school system had learned to read by a program with delayed, less intense phonics instruction. Forty synthetic word test items were  selected or constructed to illustrate ten selected phonic generalizations. The subjects' task was to pronounce each word as if it were a real word. The subjects were also presented with four synthetic words and asked to state the phonic generalization and whether the spelling pattern helped in pronounciation. The study concluded that ability to pronounce synthetic words increases with grade level, and that early intensive phonics instruction equips the child to become an independent reader at an early age.

More than half of the students who read below grade level appeared to lack motivation. A closed circuit television system was combined with other materials--including kits, book, listening centers--and called the Graphics Expression Reading Improvement System (GERIS). The teacher's objective was to help students improve their reading skills and to provide practice in using these skills effectively. Each student's objective was to produce a tape that he could show to classmates or his parents. The GERIS program utilized an eight-step process in which help was given in the reading lab on a one-to-one basis, and students were programed into those  skills and materials they needed most. The program to this point has been successful in motivating students to read. (RB)",

        "description":"This document identifies the methods used in college level, reading oriented, developmental English courses to build the reading-thinking skills needed for broad comprehension of knowledge. Because the cultural and intellectual environment of the educationally disadvantaged college student may be very different from the cultural and intellectual orientation of the reading material assigned in his courses, he needs skills that enable him to understand and synthesize unfamiliar ideas in a logical fashion. Since many disadvantaged youth lack these skills, developmental English courses include reading survey methods that dovetail with writing organization methods and the forms of logical support. Thus, the reading-thinking process becomes a reading-thinking-writing process that  enables the student to succeed in discussion, composition, and essay examinations. Because the acquisition of reading synthesis skills increases the disadvantaged student's survival power, developmental English teachers must increasingly deal with reading as a thinking process.

Four experiments were conducted in which college students read sentences after hearing different types of context about those sentences. The same 48 sentences were used in all experiments. Each sentence was nine to thirteen words long, stated a commonly-known fact, and consisted of subject, verb, direct object, and one or two prepositional phrases. There  were eight context conditions: subject, verb, direct object, object of preposition, cue to subject, cue to direct object, cue to object of preposition, and no information. In the first experiment, all subjects were tested in all eight context conditions. In experiments two, three, and four, subjects were tested under only four of the conditions. The results indicated that none of the context conditions significantly affected the time needed to process the sentences. (WR)",

Objectives specified critical posttest attributes, while the rules were true statements which  specified appropriate terminal responses. Objectives and rules were either placed before the paragraphs or after them. Half of the subjects received the adjunct items all massed together, and half received them distributed before or after each paragraph.

The fifth group was a comparison control in which subjects merely learned and recalled word lists B and D without the aid of the loci mnemonic technique. The object names used to form word lists B and D were high imagery and concreteness nouns. The loci-generated group subjects visualized 12  locations in a setting with which they were highly familiar. This became word list A. The subjects in the AB-CD condition generated word list C in the same manner but in a different setting and with none of the words used in list A. Subjects were shown either list A or list C, and after achieving perfect recall were required to perform an uncued recall pairing those items with list B, followed by cued recall. The findings supported the conclusion that the loci mnemonic technique is of value in aiding recall. (WR)",

Where appropriate, these variables are described in terms of the extent to which each site included them, and an assessment of their contribution to the success of the program is indicated. Data found in each school-based site self-evaluation are used extensively in volume 3. Section J reports information related to major outcomes identified in the self-evaluations. These are objectives and degree of fulfillment, major findings, and  recommendations. Information in this volume is provided in outline form. Program characteristics are accompanied by statistics that reflect total school information. The Right to Read Program at each school receives a description of approximately twenty pages. (WR)",

        "description":"Vocabulary diversity is a measure either of the language spoken within a fixed time period or of the total utterances, sentences, or words. To measure children's language development as revealed by the diversity of their spoken expression, a comparison was made of the vocabulary of 15 first-grade children of average ability, of first-grade primers from one of 15 basal reader series, and of 15 first-grade trade books. Vocabulary diversity was determined by both the type-token ratio--in which the number of different words found in a sample is divided by the total number of words in the sample--and by the number of words used only once within each sample. All samples were approximately 500 words. Oral, primer, and tradebook language samples were computer analyzed for calculating the  type-token ratios. For each sample among the three vocabularies, 15 type-token ratios were calculated and used for analysis of variance. Findings showed greater diversity in children's vocabularies than in the primers' samples, with no significant difference between oral and trade book vocabularies. References, a sample questionnaire, and tables are included. (JM)",

The two schools in the pilot program were located in areas having a high incidence of low-income families. Tutor managers (paraprofessionals) supervised and managed the tutoring program in each school. They trained fifth and sixth graders in the techniques of tutoring basic reading skills, tutored children, gave pretests and posttests, kept records, prepared the student logs, and kept student profile sheets on each child tutored. The structured tutoring involved the diagnosis of the child's reading skills, individual work with the child using prescribed teaching methods, and a  criterion posttest measuring the knowledge of the child at the end of the tutoring. The tutored group outperformed the control group in acquiring basic reading skills, and of the 54 students who were tutored, only one failed to make a significant improvement in reading skills during the relatively short period of six weeks that the tutoring program was in operation. Statistical data, cost analysis information, and implications for further study are included in the report. (TO)",

Two groups of 24 Cornell undergraduates participated in the experiment. Subjects in each group read and recalled three passages. Group one read the Breeder Reactor High, Schizophrenia Low, and Parakeet High passages. Group two read the Breeder Reactor Low, Schizophrenia High, and Parakeet Low passages. The experiment was conducted in two sessions. In the first, subjects read each passage and produced a written free recall of it immediately after reading. In the second session, one week later, subjects were again asked for a free recall of each passage. Then they were given lists of the content words found in the target  paragraphs of each passage and asked to produce a third free recall of each passage, using these words to aid them. The findings indicated that: information is more likely to be recalled from a passage if it is high in the content structure than if it is low; information is more likely to be retained over time from a passage if it is high in the content structure than if it is low; and providing cues for recall one week after reading increases the recall of information high and low in the content structure of the passage.

A total of 284 third and sixth graders served as subjects. All subjects received the same treatment. Three word lists were developed, two  of which were constructed with words whose relationship would reflect one of the memory attributes under investigation. The subjects learned and were tested on each of the three lists according to a standard free recall procedure. The results indicated that the subjects recalled conceptually-related and rhyme-related words significantly better than control words, and that children of elementary school age made use of these attributes in recalling organized verbal materials.

Twenty-three of the subjects were high school advanced placement students. Seven semantic categories were taught to each subject in the experimental group: agent, instrument, location, benetive, factitive, and essive. Subjects then read passages of about 330 words. The results indicated that immediate recall scored for idea units was insignificantly better for the experimental group when  compared with the untutored control group.

CBTE is designed to insure that schools will remain essentially as they are, that is, serving the same politico-economic function as in the past. In this approach there is no consideration as to how teachers should teach. The competencies identified are based on teaching as it is rather than as it might or should be.

In concentrating on using media in the composition class, teachers must overcome their fear of the equipment, learn to rely more on their own ingenuity and ability, and examine the actual cost of equipment and materials on a cost-per-student basis. Nonprint media can be used in the same way that print media might be used--as a way into other ideas, as thought starters, as activities that put everyone at the same beginning point, and as a means of making relationships between ideas more apparent to the students. Nonprint media offer alternative teaching strategies that are especially helpful to the nonverbal, nonprint-oriented, or  even the nonlinear student. (RB)",

In cities, most blacks, Puerto Ricans, and many other non-native speakers speak or can speak a form of BEV. The prevalence of BEV in elementary and secondary schools of the inner city is even greater. BEV is a dialect of English which is infinite in scope and fully capable in principle of expressing anything which can be meant in any dialect in English. However, most English teachers neither speak BEV nor know anything about it. To negatively evaluate a paper written in BEV is to contradict the humanistic view of the value of each individual and the goal of English teaching as maximizing personal human  growth--which is a position we cannot hold either politically or pedagogically. All teachers of reading and writing must make clear to their students the differences between written and spoken language using situations and the concomitant differences between written and spoken language conventions. This can and should be done for all speakers, for written and spoken English are different for all. (LL)",

Of greater impact are those books in which both evil, symbolized by animals, and nature, represented as alien to man, are forces against which a young man must pit himself. In contrast, few books portray the acceptance by a young boy that to become a man, he must face the trouble within himself rather than externalizing it.

The Dutch appear to be the earliest settlers with an interest in ethnic studies. The efforts to resist the dominant English culture began in New York in about 1660. Education became one of the ways non-English settlers could restrain the force of British history and customs and of the English language. In order to combat the nativism of the times, minority immigrants organized \"ethic schools\" and activities that would help to preserve their particular cultures and religious outlooks. Minority groups' use of historical societies for the purpose of providing cultural instruction increased during the early decades of this century. The current  movement to resurrect the sentiment for ethnic education is strongly influenced by the writings of W. E. B. DuBois and Carter G. Woodson, who kept the issue before the public for so long. (RB)",

A corollary, or a result, of this development has been the growing attacks on grades and grading. While evaluation provides effective instruction, grading is of limited relevance and may be misleading and harmful without modification. The first two grading steps, reading a paper and recording reactions, and identifying the inappropriate or incorrect (words, phrases) elements lead to the third step--summarizing the overall strengths and weaknesses of the paper. These steps may be the indirect basis for the final step--grading. But most importantly they furnish the writer with audience reaction and help to further his writing development. Grade symbols'alone' are inadequate for indicating quality of work and reflect only one instructor's opinion.

Good literature promotes self-awareness and the realization that material possessions are inadequate for satisfying the human spirit--truth and beauty are the humanizing factors. Literature study also stimulates the teaching of composition skills by providing  examples of lively, colorful, compassionate, creative writing.

        "description":"This paper presents a commentary on the Report of the Commission on English published in 1965, \"Freedom and Discipline in English.\" In particular, inconsistencies between the Commission's Recommendation 13, calling for a clearly defined sequence of study from grade to grade, and other statements apparently contradicting this sequential structure are indicated. Further, difficulties in the Commission's interpretation of Alfred North Whitehead's concept of three stages of growth (freedom, discipline, freedom) and the attainment of freedom through discipline are discussed. Finally, the author suggests that the teacher's main tasks and functions are best defined when the student is in the second or discipline stage described by Whitehead, that is, the mastering of the tools and  skills appropriate to the realization of the higher level of freedom.

Both the Scholastic Aptitude Test and the American College Test examinations test reading ability well, while the writing tests reflect their authorship by examiners with trivial ideas of grammar who ignore content and the clear distinctions among usage, phraseology, and style. To rectify the problem, college teachers must grade students' papers by content, organization, and expressive language. Ultimately, however, an examination on composition should  require a composition. (JM)",

Grade, type of relationship, and similarity were variables in a 5 x 3 x 2 repeated measures analysis of response to logical and syntactic features of sentences. Significant effects were found for grade, type, similarity, and their interactions. Children increasingly chose conjunctions on the basis of clause similarity or dissimilarity. Older subjects, however, appeared to use this simple rule only if a logical relationship existed between clauses. The resulting U-shaped function for unrelated sentences is discussed as cognitively based rule differentiation.  (Author)",

Some of the problems faced by composition teachers are presented, followed by a literature review of research materials aimed at increasing the teacher's knowledge of the student's writing difficulties. To help students learn to write effectively, emphasis is placed on an understanding of grammar and syntax. The comprehension function of language interrelated with theory is stressed so that students experience building their knowledge in sequential steps. Several examples of the instructional materials used in the program are discussed, and the  efforts to individualize instruction through the use of tutors are explained. (RB)",

        "description":"When studying Afro-American literature, even in an English class rather than Black Studies class, both student interest and the topic tend to lead discussion toward sociological, not literary, aspects. However, the teacher should emphasize repeatedly the aesthetic dimensions of an artistic work as well as the various literary forms in which a social event or problem may be expressed. As an example, this paper discusses three different treatments of lynchings. In one, Leslie Pinckney Hill presents a restrained, quiet attack on the corruption represented by such murder in the form of a traditional Italian sonnet. In another, Claude McKay, also writing in formal sonnet form, and prophesying a bleak future, raises questions of irony and paradox in his poetic creation. Richard Wright  dramatizes the violent act in a short story, allowing the reader to sense the scene by limiting what he reveals. Literary study should never stress subject matter at the expense of literary manner. (JM)",

The support of other children seems to give security in the writing act. In a secure classroom where it is safe to try new things, there is little danger that a child will become dependent on the group situation and be unable to write a story on his own. The interpersonal experience, when children discuss with each other what they are writing, leads to increased maturity in their writing. By sharing ideas children can take the same basic concept and give it different treatments. Even with the interpersonal exchanges the creative writing turns out to be personal and unique. (RB)",

However, the younger reader should be protected more, especially from the violence illustrated in some contemporary picture books. Although texts in these books are often simple and mildly amusing, the drawings too frequently portray the real world out of control--a situation especially threatening to the young child. Since a child is born with potential both for aggression and cruelty and for showing gentleness and compassion, his earliest literary experiences should counter popular glorification of violence with a balancing, humanizing  effect.

Seventy-two middle-class first and second graders of both sexes were given one of three treatments to study the effect of redundant auditory information on nonword discrimination. Half the subjects in each treatment scored high and half low on the Auditory Analysis Test (AAT). In the visual condition subjects saw each member of a nonword pair sequentially on slides. In the auditory condition the subject heard the words pronounced by an experienced linguist who attempted to pronounce the illegal nonwords like foreign words, avoiding the regularization of their pronunciation. In the  combined condition subjects saw the words and heard them pronounced at the same time. The task in all conditions was to say whether the first or the second word of the pair was more like a real word. The results indicated that the main effects of grade, condition, and words were significant. There was no main effect for sex. An additional findings was that children's performance on the task of identifying words when both clusters were illegal was no easier than with either cluster illegal. (WR)",
