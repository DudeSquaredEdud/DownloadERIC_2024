          "And Others"],
        "description":"Earlier research by the Concerns-Based Adoption Model Project at the Austin campus of the University of Texas has identified seven &quot;Stages of Concern&quot; that teachers and other front line users of classroom innovations could have. This study examines, first, whether principals have the same or similar stages of concern about their change facilitator role, and, second, if they have distinguishable concerns, how these concerns shift as the change process unfolds. A brief review of concerns theory is followed by a description of the measurement procedures and a summary of the study design. A series of five short case studies are presented, accompanied by summary charts, to illustrate how change facilitator &quot;Stages of Concern&quot; looked and shifted during the period of the study. The  researchers found that, while change facilitators' concerns are different in content from those of teachers, the overall concerns dynamic seems to be the same. A discussion of implications and of possible next steps for research and practice concludes the paper. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"This paper describes principals' behavior as they facilitate the implementation of an innovation in their schools. The paper uses data from research conducted by the Concerns-Based Adoption Model Project at the Austin campus of the University of Texas. The behaviors of nine principals are associated with three &quot;change facilitator styles&quot; named by the researchers Responder, Manager, and Initiator. The paper first reviews selected literature on the role of leaders, then describes the studies and experiences that have led to the development of the three styles. A framework is outlined that suggests some of the ways that these three change facilitator styles can be related to each other and to the overall picture of change facilitation at the school level. A discussion of research,  practice, and training implications concludes the paper. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"Researchers using a combination of principal logs, on-site observation, face-to-face interviews, and regularly scheduled telephone interviews documented how principals intervene in the management of school change on both a day-to-day and a year-long basis. The data are from the Principal-Teacher Interaction Study conducted at the Austin campus of the University of Texas. Two analytical frameworks, a &quot;taxonomy of interventions&quot; and an &quot;anatomy of interventions,&quot; were used to structure the data collection and to analyze the behavior of the principals. The taxonomy of interventions involves the identification of levels of interventions. This paper focuses on the analysis of &quot;incident&quot; interventions, the smallest intervention unit. The anatomy of interventions involves the  examination of each individual incident-level intervention in terms of its internal parts. Findings reported are from studies of three California school principals in their first year of implementing a writing composition program, and of three Florida principals in their second year of the implementation of a mathematics curriculum. Frequencies of the targets, functions, medium, and flow of the principals' interventions are presented and discussed. One of the important findings of the study is that support and facilitation for teachers continued throughout the second year of implementation with little decrease in activity by the principals.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether collective bargaining significantly affects teacher time, particularly time spent in instruction and preparation. The study was based on recent research indicating that student achievement is affected by the time teachers spend in these areas. Researchers divided the activities performed by elementary teachers into five categories: (1) instruction; (2) preparation; (3) administrative and clerical duties, including meetings; (4) parent conferences; and (5) other noninstructional duties, primarily after-school activities. The central finding of the study, based on a national survey of over 3,000 elementary teachers in nearly 250 districts, was that teachers covered by collective bargaining spend approximately 3 percent less time in  instruction per day (or 1 week less per year) than teachers not covered by collective bargaining. Whether or not this reduction in instruction leads to a decline in the quality of schools cannot be answered on the basis of this study. What can be said based on this study is that collective bargaining may have a tendency to reduce student achievement by reducing time spent in instruction. (Author/LL)",

Project Leadership uses networking and administrator-led workshops to disseminate research results and state-of-the-art information to other school administrators. The material in this document covers teacher evaluation and school effectiveness and includes the script itself (including suggestions for workshop activities), masters for the presentations's 28 transparencies, worksheets and handouts for participants, a bibliography, and suggested further readings. The first of the script's four sections describes evaluation objectives, reviews research findings  about evaluation and about school and teacher effectiveness, and discusses types of evaluation and the inadequacy of evaluations that are only &quot;ceremonial congratulations.&quot; The second section examines the evaluation process, including allocating tasks, setting criteria, sampling, and appraising. Factors affecting evaluation, such as task characteristics and organizational arrangements, are analyzed in section 3, while section 4 considers the nature of effective schools and the characteristics of effective classrooms and effective teachers. The final section briefly suggests a review of the workshop. (Author/RW)",

School bureaucracy and procedures and their relationship to instruction, teachers, and school programs were analyzed. The five schools were drawn from village, suburban, urban, and central-city settings, and data were gathered through site visits, document analysis, and open-ended interviews with 25-30 people (administrators, teachers, counselors, and students) in each school. The researchers examined (1) the control of teacher assignment to particular courses and the role of administrators, teachers, and departments in making the decisions; (2) the factors affecting course options, including the pressures for diversity or  basics; (3) rules and regulations covering teachers' work, such as textbook selection, lesson plans, curriculum guides, and meetings and procedures; and (4) the use to which the schools put teacher evaluations. Among the study's conclusions are that teacher participation in instructional decision-making is widespread in many school departments, that the schools' course options emphasized basics, and that school bureaucracies are sensitive to many pressures.

This report presents a summary of the results of the analysis, illustrated with numerous tables comparing the counties according to such measures as average annual growth and projected school enrollment  for various years in the projection period. Full data on population and enrollment trends in Adams County are included as an example of the full findings of the study, but the individual reports on the rest of Colorado's counties are not included and must be obtained separately.

The literature review revealed that the development of the coordination concept was affected successively by the philosophies of utilitarianism, altruism, administrative rationality, and citizen participation. \"Coordination\" can be defined as a process in which organizations use internally created or externally mandated decision rules to deal collectively with a shared environment. The elements coordinated (at the appropriate level) may include information, clients, program development, and resources. Numerous linkage  mechanisms and models for coordinating exist. Coordination is affected by both subjective and objective facilitators and inhibitors. The consequences of coordination have rarely been assessed. Different audiences have different success criteria, and different models of coordination have different consequences. The research on coordination has been inadequate, dominated by assumptions favoring coordination. Longitudinal studies have been rare and few studies of the private sector have been made. Materials guiding practitioners in coordination are also few and usually inadequate. Research is needed on contextual effects, on structural interests, and on rules for structure formation.

Proposition 2 1/2 not only restricted Massachusetts property taxes but also reduced automobile excise taxes, allowed deductions for rent from taxable income, removed school committees' fiscal autonomy, and altered other government practices. This document presents the survey results in five sections. Section 1 relates voters' knowledge and expectations about Proposition 2 1/2 to their desires for changes in government services in order to explain the vote. Survey results are analyzed by community in section 2 and compared to Boston  residents' views. Section 3 uses multivariate analysis to examine the effects of several public policy issues, such as tax reform and government inefficiency, on voters' expectations and preferences. Section 4 turns to the same methodology to analyze the effects of community fiscal and demographic characteristics and of respondents' attitudes toward government. The final section discusses the way attitudes toward education affected the vote. Three appendices present the questionnaire and further methodological information. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"The career training offered to women in school administration by the American Association of School Administrators (AASA) in 1977 decreased the influence of external barriers on the participants' upward career mobility. Along with 31 non-trainees who served as a comparison group, all 75 AASA trainees responded in 1981 to a questionnaire collecting data on the effectiveness of the training program. Statistical regression methods were used to determine the effects on their careers of factors in women's backgrounds, perceived internal and external barriers to career mobility, strategies used for career enhancement, and the characteristics of the districts where positions were sought. Among the findings were that the clarity of expression and types of job experiences revealed in  women's resumes were strongly related to career growth; women who both rate highly on the basis of letters of reference and encounter fewer internal barriers tend to obtain superintendent positions; and lack of geographical mobility, failure to apply for more jobs, and uncertainty about life goals tend to hold women back. This report analyzes relationships among the variables in tabular form and includes the questionnaire and the job application evaluation procedure used in the study. (Author/PGD)",

Conditions necessary for using the IEP effectively are listed. Implementation of the IEP as placement, instructional, and planning tools is noted to depend on four factors--policy interpretations, structure of the schools, implementation strategies employed, and macro-sociopolitical factors. Two implementation strategies presented in Federal Special Education Regulations are considered, compliance monitoring (a power-coercive strategy) and a comprehensive system of personnel development. Discussed are four principles to guide IEP development: (1) participatory planning, (2) internal consistency, (3)  cooperative use, and (4) mutual supportiveness. It is pointed out that IEP implementation efforts directed toward organizational change should reflect considerations which include existing organizational structures and the application of normative principles within the referral planning and placement process. Four considerations relating to personnel development efforts are also mentioned, such as the avoidance of overreliance on inservice education as the sole procedure for developing personnel. It is concluded that locally orchestrated organizational change and personnel development can increase the utility of IEPs. (SW)",

        "description":"The final report of the first year (1979-1980) of Project First Chance Interactive Outreach Model Program reviews outreach activities and gives detailed information on child progress data from the model demonstration site serving 10 preschool handicapped children. Indicators of project impact are reported in the areas of product development and distribution, awareness, stimulating sites, training, and state involvement. Among indicators reported are visits to the demonstration site by 160 persons, development or revision of five products, training of 270 staff, improved service to 750 handicapped children, and incorporation into coursework of model components by 15 institutions of higher education. Charts detail project objectives, activities, and degree of accomplishment. The  evaluation summary concludes that the objective of stimulating new improved service to young handicapped children was accomplished with great success in Texas and less success in Nebraska and Arizona. The section on evidence of effectiveness presents behavior change data for the 10 children at the demonstration site. It is reported that a total of 344 behaviors were gained by the 10 children during the 9 month program. Data are presented in a summary of behaviors mastered, an individual child summary, and a summary by developmental area. A large appendix includes such items as training schedules for outreach, an overview of the total process and critical components, directions for setting up the monitoring system, work sheets for monitoring individual programs, and suggestions for  monitoring teacher behaviors. Also appended is a guide to determining the relationship between the child's behavior and the teacher's consequences, the &quot;Teaching Behavior Inventory,&quot; and a chart of teaching behavior characteristics.

Curriculum procedures are classified according to domains of intervention and whether the intervention strategies are a primary or secondary source of activities for facilitating a given set of competencies. The paper is divided into four major sections. In the first section, the intervention domains included on a curriculum matrix are operationally described and defined. The second section describes the general procedure that can be followed in using the curriculum matrix. The curriculum matrix itself is  presented in the third section. Matrixes are provided for developmental age ranges of birth to 1 year, 1 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, and 3 to 4 years. Curriculum intervention procedures are categorized according to the following areas: gross motor, personal-social, hearing and speech, eye-hand coordination, manipulation, prequantitative reasoning, object permanence, means-ends abilities, vocal imitation, gestural imitation, causality, spatial relationships, schemes for relating to objects, nonverbal/verbal communication, and preoperational concepts.

Ss were randomly assigned to one of two placements: a traditional resource room or an adaptive educational program. Placement differed in the amount of time students spent in an integrated setting, the instructional practices, and the opportunities for both instructional and social interactions. Observational data on classroom processes were analyzed to document the distinguishing characteristics of the social and academic environments in which the Ss were placed. Differences were then examined in relation to Ss' self repots of competence, friendship patterns, and peer acceptance. Results revealed that social outcomes varied markedly across the two programs. More  positive trends were uncovered in the adaptive program where children were placed in the integrated setting on a full time basis, learning assignments were matched to ability levels, itinerant services were provided as much as possible within the classroom, and opportunities to interact with peers and form personal relationships were frequent. Handicapped Ss in the adaptive education program had higher self ratings of competence and received higher peer acceptance ratings than did handicapped Ss in the resource room program. (Author)",

Following a period of adherence to English-only instruction which resulted in academic failure for minority children, support grew for the concept of bilingual education. The provisions of the 1968 Bilingual Education Act, the revised Act of 1974, the Lau versus Nichols decision, and the Lau regulations are described. The underlying assumptions, goals, and methodologies of transitional and maintenance bilingual education are compared. Transitional bilingual education utilizes native language instruction only as a remedial approach to the learning of English, while maintenance bilingual education recognizes the value of  minority students' cultural and linguistic resources and seeks to develop skills in two languages. Although the transitional and maintenance models are similar in their goals and methodology, their underlying philosophies are mutually exclusive. In conclusion, it is important to determine which aspects of each model are most beneficial to the student and implement the most effective combined approach. A list of references is appended. (RW)",

        "description":"The writing development of 27 first through third graders in an English/Spanish bilingual program was investigated. Samples of the children's writing were collected at four intervals during the school year, coded for computer tallying, and analyzed in terms of code-switching, spelling, punctuation and segmentation, structural features, stylistic devices, and content. In addition, the context in which the writing developed was evaluated by means of classroom observations, teacher interviews, review of the children's family backgrounds, and a survey of the community language situation. The findings provided evidence to counter prevailing myths about the language proficiency of bilinguals, biliteracy, bilingual education, research on writing, literacy and writing instruction, and  learning to write. For example, the subjects, all children of migrant workers or settled migrants, demonstrated varied vocabulary, complex syntax, acknowledgement of the reader, knowledge that context constrains form, and movement toward stylistic sophistication in their writing. In a discussion of implications, the concept of a whole language approach to writing instruction is supported, in which authentic and functional texts are offered to and produced by children. (RW)",

        "description":"An experiment is described that is designed to test for the operation of an input switch mechanism in bilinguals. Their ability to selectively avoid processing words presented in one of their languages while they are attending to words presented in their other language is described. The 20 subjects were all French-English bilinguals. The specific method used was the flanker task, in which three vertically-arranged words are presented, the center word being the target and the two outside the flankers. Four types of flanker-target relationships were included. From the response times, it was concluded that the subjects were obliged to process the flanker words semantically, which suggests that bilinguals do not switch off the processing of words in one language even when they are  engaged in processing words in their other language system.

These three levels are all needed in the interpretation of the message of negation. First of all, a person from another culture must find the appropriate form function relationship. Next, one needs to learn which social parameters enter into the speech act. Finally, it is essential to get a group on the underlying values of the society. Examples of ways of saying no across several cultures are given. The examples illustrate that confusion can easily arise when both participants in the speech act do not  possess communicative competence at all three levels. (EKN)",

        "description":"In the hope of filling in a missing link for experimental psychologists' research on reading, this paper provides a general review of research on the issue of orthography and its relation to reading. The traditional classification of logographic, syllabic, and alphabetic modes are examined to see how much orthographic variations affect the processing strategy of both beginning and fluent readers. The examination leads to the hypothesis that different cognitive strategies are required to achieve reading efficiency in various writing systems. Issues connected with this hypothesis have been examined by cognitive psychologists, anthropologists, and neurolinguists. Those issues having to do particularly with bilingual literacy are reviewed: (1) reading disability incidence in syllabic  and logographic systems compared with alphabetic systems, (2) neuropsychological research, (3) differential processing mechanisms and behavior consequences, (4) the process in reading of recoding the visual input into a speech-like code, and (5) bilingual processing. The research reviewed shows that reading skills acquired in one orthography may not be the same as those acquired in another orthography if these two systems have different script-speech mapping rules. These findings raise questions regarding bilingual reading instruction. (AMH)",

        "description":"An observable feature of learner language, linguistic variability, is described and used as the basis for speculating about an aspect of the process of second language learning. It is hypothesized that variation in correct use of target language forms varies as a function of the demands placed on the learner to produce these forms. Three groups of adult subjects enrolled in community college programs participated in the study. Twenty-six were intermediate English as a second language (ESL) students, 21 were advanced ESL students, and 16 were native speakers of English. Transcripts of planned discussions provided the data of the analysis which examined the use of the Wh-question system and the verb system. The linguistic variability in the data seemed to be systematic. With regard  to dimensions of language proficiency, these appeared to be the extent to which the learner's knowledge of the language is analyzed, and the extent to which the knowledge is automatically accessible. The framework generated by these two dimensions describes the learner's knowledge of the language; it serves to separate formal knowledge from the ability to apply known aspects of the language to various purposes. The model derived from the data is that the process of language learning involves the gradual analysis of the structure of language and the development of more fluent retrieval procedures. (AMH)",

In this study, self direction includes the phenomena represented by the terms \"conscious learning strategies,\" either a focused approach or a general strategy, and \"self directed learning,\" in distinction from collaborative and institutional learning. The data were derived from interviews with 25 adult learners who had lived in the United States for no longer than 2 years. They were asked to fill out a grid of social settings in which they usually found themselves and the language they used in each one. The interview required that they reflect upon language experiences in these social situations. Analysis of the data revealed that these adults  directed their own learning by engaging in the following assessments and action decisions: coping, designating, discriminating, evaluating, planning, self analyzing, and theorizing. Each of these processes is illustrated and defined by referring to the experiences of four of the learners; these definitions are amplified by reference to the self reports of all the interviewees. Interview questions, profiles of the four learners mentioned above, the interview schedule, and tables of processes and outcomes are appended. (AMH)",

        "description":"The administration, purpose, and design of student financial aid programs are examined with emphasis on assuring greater access to higher education, student persistence, and providing students with incentives for performing well academically. After a brief history of financial aid and a review of selected studies on persistence, the sampling and data collection procedures are described. A profile of students 2 years after matriculation in college is provided, including demographic characteristics, enrollment behavior, residence, experience in college, work, and financial aid. The characteristics of students with different patterns of persistence are discussed in terms of religion and political orientation, parental income and education, degree plans, values and attitudes,  financial experience, work experience, and reasons for leaving school. A separate chapter gives an overview of the financial aid environment in American colleges and universities today. The last two chapters, utilizing a multiple regression analysis, assess the impact of personal, environmental, and financial variables on persistence and withdrawal among white and minority students. Implications for future policies are addressed. Among the several suggestions are the following: more sources of information about student financial aid should be made available to students; loans, especially large ones, are the worst possible form of aid to offer low-income and minority students; and the government should consider expanding grant and work-study programs. Appendices include: survey  instruments; creation of financial aid variables; development of persistence categories; a verification study of financial aid data reported by students; and variables used in regression analyses.

        "description":"A study of various forms of credit or non-credit used in Florida colleges and universities examines their relationship to traditional college credit, courses, and programs. An expansion in the kinds of credit and their usage is a focus of concern of Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). The practices of Florida postsecondary institutions as they created all forms of credit are reported, and the results of a search for the formal authority and constraints on the uses of the different kinds of credit are outlined. The creation and maintenance of a reliable statewide inventory of courses at the 37 state-supported two- and four-year colleges has raised a number of large and small issues, including the integrity of data collection, inconsistencies in catalog listings,  general education patterns, authority and potential changes, developmental-remedial courses, and conversion of occupational courses to the SCNS classification system. Appendices contain a variety of documents from the SCNS and its study, and charts of program and award data from Florida's 28 community colleges. (MSE)",

        "description":"The Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS), a program in the Florida Department of Education, is evaluated. The introduction of the study includes analysis of complaints, old and new surveys, and evaluation concepts underlying the study. Chapter 2 describes the operation of SCNS, its organizational characteristics in the educational establishment of the state capital, and its ties to the 37 public postsecondary institutions in Florida. Major challenges to the existence of SCNS over several years as well as state legislature support are reviewed in chapter 3, which also presents a conceptual framework applicable for analyzing some of the variables that keep SCNS in an unstable relationship with portions of the postsecondary community. Chapter 4 is divided into two parts: the  short, medium, and long-range SCNS goals, and outputs of SCNS. The latter are of two types: (1) any statewide three-letter alpha prefix followed by a four-digit number, of which the last three digits are part of a statewide discipline classification system; and (2) products and services provided by SCNS from its statewide course inventory and other information resources. The question about the extent to which SCNS outputs are being utilized within state agencies and institutions is addressed in chapter 5, followed in chapter 6 with the findings from three sets of surveys. Chapter 7 concludes that, among other things: a flat hierarchy should be maintained between the professional staff and the director to encourage communication; the staff of SCNS needs to observe the statutory requirement  that faculty committees are to be used to maintain the System; turnover in the lower clerical positions is a constant drain on potential productivity; and there is an immediate need to revive and revise the SCNS Policy Council. Several appendices are included to provide examples of SCNS policies and products and to explain the procedures of the surveys and other data collection efforts. (Author/LC)",

Problems as seen by professional organizations include: allied health continuing education (AHCE) is provided for membership as a tangible benefit; AHCE is considered an area for financial gain; AHCE approval process and recordkeeping is unique to the organization; and communication and coordination between and among allied health organizations is minimal or nonexistent. Problems as seen by allied health faculty members include: AHCE is an overload activity for faculty members; AHCE is provided by professional clinical sites  and the clinical affiliation agreements may be jeopardized if allied health schools or colleges develop AHCE programs and the faculty compete with affiliated institutions; AHCE is a responsibility of the allied health faculty who should present the program content; and AHCE programs should not mix noncredit and credit students. Problems in AHCE as seen by continuing education (CE) administrative units include the following: revenue generated by AHCE activities must partially support the CE administrative staff; and the health care team is often discussed but few AHCE programs are developed to focus on this concept. Suggestions for solving problems include the following: encourage the establishment of national standards for processing AHCE program proposals and encourage allied health  professional organizations to establish a uniform approval form.

        "description":"The effects of college attendance by working adults on educational motivations of their children were studied. A total of 740 parents in the Detroit area who attended a college program combining in-home televised instruction with weekend decentralized seminars were surveyed along with 211 of their children and 75 respondents from Kansas City. Many of the adults were blue collar workers without previous college experience. Questionnaires and telephone interviews were completed by those who had attended class in union locals and by graduates of the University Studies and Weekend College, Detroit. Parents were asked their opinions about the quality of the education to which they or their children may have access and about the importance of education. They were asked to state the  importance of three factors regarding their children at the time they decided to enter college: a desire to be better equipped to help with schoolwork; the wish to encourage children by setting an example; or a need to keep up with children because school subjects have changed. Adults frequently reported that they enrolled in a college degree program to set an example for their children. Parent-child talk about school was consistently related to children's learning attitude and grade changes. Many parents perceived positive changes in the motivation of their offspring, and extensive verbatim statements from parents and children are included as illustration. Effects that were noticed shortly after parents began their college studies included young children pretending to do homework with  the parent and young adults deciding to attend college. Blacks reported stronger program effects than nonblacks; graduates perceived more change than noncompleters. Children, especially blacks, reported that their attitudes toward learning were positively influenced by their parents' college attendance. (SW)",

        "description":"The public service role of universities and components of a knowledge transfer model are considered, and two case histories of university response to public client systems are presented. In addition, the community services office is described as one strategy for a university desiring to improve its public service role. It is suggested that the transfer of knowledge in various ways to community decision-makers and other users is a major facet of the public service role of universities. Linkages that connect knowledge producers and knowledge users in mutually beneficial ways and the development of continuing interactions between producers and users are seen as important components of a knowledge transfer model. For the first case study, the client system was a state agency that  needed survey research skills and university capabilities including knowledge of basic evaluation research design and methods, design of survey instrumentation, experience in data collection techniques, statistical analysis methods, survey research data processing and computation facilities, technical and policy report writing skills, and a high quality manuscript and printing operation. In the second case study the client system was a small city that needed knowledge and expertise from several disciplines for assistance in problem definition and identification of alternative solutions for community improvement. The two case studies illustrate the ability of a university to respond to different kinds of client system needs. A community service office could serve as a knowledge transfer  and service delivery model with two main functions: an in-house information exchanging process within the university, and a linking function. Institutionalization of partnership arrangements is seen as a very important part of the overall process. (SW)",

        "description":"Results are presented of a General Accounting Office audit of the Student Loan Insurance Fund (SLIF) financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980. SLIF finances the Guaranteed Student Loan Program by reimbursing lenders and state guarantee agencies when students default on their loans. The fund, which is managed by the Department of Education, also pays students' interest until the first loan repayment date plus an interest allowance to lenders. The investigation included interviews with Department of Education officials and a review of written procedures; review of the Fund's fiscal 1980 financial records; evaluation of the fund's compliance with laws and regulations; analysis of data pertaining to the Fund's fiscal 1980 operations; testing of selected  transactions and account balances; and confirming with a sample of lenders and guarantee agencies certain information in the Fund's financial records. GAO maintained that the Fund's financial statements do not fairly present its financial position at September 30, 1980. Among the findings are the following: control account balances, representing 64 percent of the Fund's assets, could not be reconciled with computerized subsidiary records; procedures have not been developed for several accounts, resulting in material misstatements; cash transactions were not recorded in the correct fiscal year; and cancelled checks totaling $14 million were added to the Fund's cash balance without determining whether they had been recorded when initially issued. GAO recommends that the Secretary of  Education improve internal accounting controls over the Fund, centralize all accounting and financial statement responsibilities, and implement improved computer management practices. Among the appendices are information on the Fund's accounting deficiencies in previous fiscal years. (SW)",

        "description":"Hearings are presented of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, on the impact of federal student aid reductions in Vermont and Connecticut. Statements by various college administrators, college students, citizens, and state legislators are provided. More than half the students who attend higher education institutions in Vermont receive federal aid in the form of grants and guaranteed loans, amounting to almost $50 million in the 1981 school year. It is suggested by Senator Robert T. Stafford that cuts in federal student assistance will have a severe impact on the ability of qualified Vermonters to attend schools of higher education, and that cuts have been proposed at a time when college costs are increasing faster than the general rate of inflation. According  to Senator Lowell Weicker, Jr., many of the students who attend colleges and universities in Connecticut receive federal aid in the form of grants and student loans. The aid totals almost $281 million in the 1981 academic year. Comments and panel discussions are presented by presidents of colleges in Vermont and Connecticut and by other concerned officials and people affected by the proposed cuts. The president of Trinity College suggests that adoption of the Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation for the Special Educational Opportunities Program would mean a projected one-third reduction, and the changes in the guaranteed student loan program would affect 70 percent of the students enrolled half time or more. In general, the reductions that have been outlined would result in an  increase of unmet needs from $2,500 in 1981 to $3,300 in 1982. In order to fund students with only $2,500 remaining need, 16 percent of current aid recipients will be unable to attend Trinity College, Vermont. An article on the costs versus benefits of competitive employment for mentally retarded persons by Ken Schneider and others is appended. (SW)",

After a reviewing of characteristics of the black population in the United States in the mid-1970s, the characteristics of black college students and students in noncollegiate postsecondary schools (including adult basic education, Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs, and vocational schools) are discussed, with attention directed to financially dependent and independent students. Postsecondary enrollment is also analyzed in relation to family size and the number of students enrolled per family. Findings include the  following: in spring 1976, 1,233,000 blacks were enrolled in college; for the 18-24-year-old group, black high school graduates had lower college enrollment rates than all high school graduates; about 46 percent of black college students were 25 years old or over; 3.5 times as many black students who were dependent on parental support, and almost twice as many black independent students, lived in households below the poverty level compared to all students; a fifth of black dependent college students lived in families with incomes over $20,000; approximately two-thirds of all black noncollegiate students had not completed high school; a fourth of black dependent postsecondary students came from families whose head had 1 year or more of college; and similar proportions of black independent  and all independent noncollegiate students worked.

Individual respondents provided information for only one 7-day period; however, the survey sample was spread over an entire year. Findings include the following: over the survey period, full-time S/E faculty in universities devoted an average of 48 hours per week to professional activities, while faculty in four-year colleges averaged about 43 hours; university faculty spend about one-third of their professional time (16 hours per week) in research, and federally-sponsored time accounted for about 9 of these hours; four-year college faculty  averaged about 5 hours per week in research, reflecting in part a low level of federal support at this level; overall, about 3 out of 10 research hours were not supported by federal or other sponsors, including the faculty member's own institution; four-year college faculty spent about 22 hours per week in instructional activities, roughly 7 hours more than their university counterparts; authoring publications for compensation consumed one-half of the approximately 4 hours spent per week by university faculty in earning outside income, while consulting accounted for another one-third of such activities; and although the average work week was about 15 hours shorter in the summer months, the average weekly number of hours spent in research varied little by season. Information is also  provided by academic discipline, and comparisons are made regarding sponsored and unsponsored research. Detailed statistical tables, technical notes, and the questionnaire are included. (SW)",

Secondary analyses were conducted on a sample of 2,326 freshman students from 11 diverse institutions participating in project CHOICE (to better inform prospective students). The schools were residential universities, private liberal arts colleges, two-year commuter colleges, and four-year commuter institutions. The various measures of Tinto's concepts of social and academic involvement did explain modest but significant increments in the variance in freshman year voluntary persistence/withdrawal decisions, even when an extensive range of student background characteristics were considered. A  number of measures of institutional involvement such as residence arrangement and participation in career counseling programs had direct positive effects on persistence and are amenable to administrative policies and planning. The relationships among the constructs of social/academic involvement, institutional commitment, and commitment to the goal of graduation and persistence were marked by more consistency with theoretical expectations in the residential and liberal art samples than in the two- or four-year commuter samples. The concept of social involvement had little salience for commuter students. Additional findings suggest that institutional persistence/withdrawal decisions during the freshman year are the result of a complex interaction of different influences. Appended materials  include a bibliography, statistical tables of the findings, and a student involvement questionnaire. (Author/SW)",

To determine variables important to central administration costs, a cross-sectional and intertemporal regression analysis was undertaken with data from the British universities. The fixed-variable cost method was used to estimate cost functions for the Free University of Brussels. For the British universities, 1969-79 through 1976-77 data were used, while 1978 figures were used for the Belgian university. It was found that resources needed for the central administration program in a university were related to student numbers in an indirect way. A  significant part of total costs was fixed and did not depend on any activity parameter. These fixed costs consist mainly of salary expenditures for the leadership function of the different administration programs. Other variables than student number influenced the central administration requirements. This was true for the granted research activities and for the mix of fields of studies in a university. Granted research activities involved higher administration expenditures than teaching and teaching-related research activities. Experimental academic activities (represented by number of students or academic staff) required a more expensive central administration than did nonexperimental activities. Finally, it was found that marginal costs with respect to internal activity parameters were  nonconstant. Results were relevant for universities with a size below 11,000 students. (SW)",

All were directors of administrative offices, and persons with primarily academic or research appointments were excluded from the study. Of the individuals who were contacted, 19 responded, representing private institutions of less than 3,000 enrollment (2), public institutions of 10,000 or more (13), and state or provincial boards of  higher education or consortia (4). Respondents represented 4 Canadian and 15 U.S. institutions or agencies. Many of the respondents spent 9-11 hours in the office and then spent several additional hours reading or doing office-related work in the evening and weekend. Those persons in offices that are responsible for research and planning and that also are involved in the daily operations of the campus tended to work slightly longer hours and spent less time on professional development activities than did those with more traditional institutional research responsibilities. Directors employed various strategies in an attempt to keep informed and to develop new areas of expertise: professional reading, seeking expert opinion/advice from others, attending workshops and conferences, and taking  professional development leave. Attention was also directed to publications and professional contributions, and differences among early-, mid-, and late-career participants.

The efforts to improve instruction in targeted subject areas have been implemented with the assistance of the Southern Regional Education Board. Attention is directed to: modification of curricula and instructional techniques, particularly at the freshman and sophomore levels; learning centers; outreach to high school students and teachers; and institutionwide support services. Curricular modifications in the natural sciences and mathematics are described for the following schools: Xavier University in Louisiana, North Carolina Central University, Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, and Jackson State University in Mississippi. Efforts to improve  communication skills of students undertaken by Florida A&amp;M University and Virginia Union University are described, as are Piagetian-based instructional techniques at Xavier University (Project SOAR in Chemistry) and North Carolina Central University (Physics Projects). In addition to modified offerings, new courses have been developed: Literature of Science Course (Jackson State) and Scientific Instrumentation (North Carolina Central). A number of the colleges have implemented learning centers, which range from those that provide tutorial services to those that utilize sophisticated equipment and techniques. In addition, viable outreach projects implemented by the schools include: campus tours, mathematics/science Olympiad competition, programs for high school teachers, and summer  programs for high school students. It is concluded that programs for improving student competencies and student retention will not be effective without strong support services reflecting institutionwide cooperation. (SW)",

        "description":"Studies on the criterion validity of student evaluation-of-instruction instruments are analyzed, and recommendations are offered for future research into student evaluation of instruction. The main problem, and probably the reason for the lack of validity studies, is that it is difficult to agree on what the criteria of effective teaching should be. One method of dealing with the problems of research in student evaluation-of-instruction instruments is to select a measurable definition of teaching effectiveness. Since the ultimate criterion of teaching effectiveness is student learning, there is general agreement that an appropriate and defensible criterion is the amount that students learn as measured by achievement examinations. Attention is directed to: studies incorporating  achievement scores and random assignment; studies incorporating achievement scores adjusted for ability; studies incorporating achievement scores not adjusted for ability; and a meta-analysis of student ratings and student achievement. Studies using criterion measures in conjunction with achievement and studies using criterion measures other than achievement are also reviewed. Tables are presented to summarize the studies that examined the relationship of student ratings of instruction and criterion measures. Although parallel data were not reported in all the studies, the table shows the largest significant correlation reported in each study. These largest correlations are squared to indicate the proportion of variance shared by the criterion and the student ratings. The majority of the  investigations reported significant positive correlations between student ratings of instruction and criterion measures of effective teaching; however, the correlation between the ratings and criteria were usually modest.

        "description":"The use of explicit, written criteria to evaluate college and university faculty is examined. Four major issues concerning faculty evaluation are as follows: the desired outcomes of faculty evaluation; the functions of faculty activity that are to be evaluated; the criteria that should be used for each area evaluated; and the procedures for implementing the faculty evaluation program. In general, studies identify two major outcomes: personnel decisions made regarding promotion, retention, and tenure; and feedback to faculty leading to faculty improvement. The major areas to be evaluated are teaching, research, and service. For the most part, faculty evaluation programs attempt to increase objectivity through both qualitative and quantitative approaches. To achieve qualitative  objectivity, criteria are developed to improve the quality of data collected from an individual evaluator. To achieve quantitative objectivity, data are collected from multiple data sources. A critical issue in faculty evaluation is determining how data are collected and reviewed. At some institutions, faculty are expected to provide evidence of their teaching, research, and service effectiveness. Since the 1970s, there has been a trend toward systematic, standardized data collection. The role played by administrators in faculty evaluation is addressed. Meta evaluations (i.e., evaluating the methods of evaluation) conducted by Oregon State System of Higher Education, the State University of New York Faculty Council of Community Colleges, and the Southern Regional Education Board are  examined. Appended materials include a form for peer review of undergraduate teaching based on dossier materials, guidelines for use of results of the student instructional report, and a bibliography. (SW)",

        "description":"A system to identify the potential dropout was studied at a two-year urban institution. All entering freshmen participating in a compulsory freshmen orientation course were administered a biographical inventory during the fifth week of enrollment. An academic or scholastic index was derived, based on high school averages and basic skills placement scores in reading, writing, and mathematics. The spring 1981 group included 328 students, while the fall 1981 group involved 704 students. At the beginning of the second semester, all students were classified into one of four groups: dropout, failing index; dropout, passing index; returnee, failing index; or returnee, passing index. In addition, the spring 1981 cohort was reclassified at the beginning of the third semester. Each group  was divided into those who had earned satisfactory academic indices and those who had not. Discriminant analyses were conducted using two, three, and four group criteria. After analyses were carried out on the total cohorts, the data were divided into four major curriculum areas: liberal arts, science and technology, nursing and medical laboratory technology, and business. A separate group of students was evaluated to cross-validate the proportion of correct group placements of known placements against a group of test students for whom placements were unknown. It is concluded that the system should not be implemented as it currently exists, and problems that prevented greater predictive success are briefly considered. Tentative findings suggest that the most important factors involved in  student attrition may be related to ethnicity and language primacy, student commitment to educational goals, college workload, scholastic readiness, and ethnic group and marital status interactions.

Concepts relevant to instructor behavior are synthesized from both cognitive and operant learning theory perspectives, and the roles allocated to instructors by seven large-scale operational CMI systems are examined using a systems engineering analysis approach to identify computer-based functions that directly support student learning in a CMI environment. The report also summarizes the results of a review of the available literature concerning essential CMI instructor activities. A general format for the Theoretical CMI Instructor Role Specification is presented, which allows for a tabular listing of the seven theoretically-based CMI  instructor roles, related instructor behaviors, and spaces for annotating the extent to which actual CMI instructor roles and behaviors deviate from the theoretically based roles in the military CMI environments of interest.

The ITV writer's relationship to other members of a project team is discussed, as well as the role of each team member, including the project leader, instructional designer, academic consultant, researcher, producer/director, utilization person, and writer. Specific suggestions are then made for writing and working with the project team and additional production crew members. A chapter is devoted to such specific ITV writing conventions as script  format, production grammar, camera terminology, and transitions between shots. Understanding production technology is the focus of a chapter which discusses lighting, sound, set design, and special effects. An in-depth look at choice of form--narrative, dramatic, documentary, magazine, or drama--is provided, followed by advice and guidelines for dealing with such factors as the target audience, budget and casting, treatment, visualization, and revisions.

Research reviewed in this report is limited to studies carried out in public school settings or that deal with issues of concern in public education. An introduction discusses the changing definition of instructional technology. More than half of the review is devoted to summarizing conclusions and discussing the history, directions, and limitations of research on educational media. The review emphasizes comparative media studies, focusing on motion pictures, television, still pictures, audio materials, programmed and computer-assisted instruction, multimedia instruction, and problems with comparative media studies. The economic evaluation of  educational media and research on media attributes are also reviewed. Research on school media centers is divided into several topics for discussion: descriptive research, experimental research, media staffing studies, national standards for media programs, planning and evaluation of programs, and needed research. Finally, the paper briefly summarizes conclusions from media research reviews and ends with a 5-page list of references. (LMM)",

        "description":"The purpose of this report is to assess the viability of developing commercial computer communications networks to provide communications services to the deaf community on a nationwide basis. Access to this network is considered for existing Baudot/Weitbrecht Telecommunications Devices for the Deaf (TDDs) and ASCII terminals with Bell modems. The basic communications needs of the deaf and the potential market for a Deaf Network and Associated Services are defined. Examination of key concepts used to determine the commercial feasibility of DNAS, including supply and demand considerations and subsidy mechanisms, is followed by a review of current telecommunications provisions for the deaf, particularly Deafnet, a computer-based communication demonstration system. After discussing  factors involved in a national commercial vendor-based framework for DNAS with special consideration of tariff design, the commericial performance of DNAS as it might be offered to a specific target population is evaluated. Preliminary commercial feasibility estimates are given for three alternative tariff structures and two supplier cost models. The study indicates that DNAS is likely to be commercially viable in the long term, although initial subsidies will be required. An appendix discussing the shift to cost-based pricing in the telephone industry, a glossary, and 26 references are also provided. (ESR)",

        "description":"Examples of three models for individualizing instruction of library students are presented, i.e., Diagnostic Prescriptive Teaching (DPT), Modularized Instruction, and Nonformal Basic Program. The focus of DPT is on general reference tools and subject reference works in science and technology. The model includes four behavioral objectives, a diagnostic test used to determine students' areas of weakness, activities or prescriptions to be assigned to correct the weaknesses identified by diagnosis, and a criterion test to ensure that objectives have been met. A check sheet is included to keep records of each student's progress. Modularized Instruction is designed to introduce the student to medical terminology, including the origins of medical vocabulary, often-used prefixes and  suffixes, and principal medical abbreviations. For each of these three objectives a pretest, enabling activities, and a posttest are given. The Nonformal Basic Program teaches conservation of library materials using an eclectic approach. The model comprises four behavioral and three experience-related objectives: selection of needed materials, teacher-made and student-made assignments, sample form for recording student proposal, follow-up activities, and procedures for the monitoring and self-evaluation of the finished product.

        "description":"This paper is concerned with providing automatically generated online explanations to the user of a user interface or &quot;tool&quot; about what the interface can and cannot do, and what parameters or options are available or required with a given command. The COUSIN interface system, developed at Carnegie-Mellon, supplies a cooperative tool-independent user interface for tools whose objects, operations, input syntax, and display formats are declaratively represented in a &quot;tool description&quot; database. Explanations are produced automatically from this database in a single uniform style, taking the form of a fine-grained, tightly linked network of text frames supported by a ZOG menu-selection system. Exactly what information the net building (NB) program extracts from a tool description and  the format in which this information is presented in the text frames is controlled by a second declarative database called the &quot;aspect description&quot; database. The declarative nature of aspect description makes it easy to adapt NB to changes in and extensions to the tool description formalism, and to experiment with the structure of the explanation network. A description of how the appropriate network frame can be found and displayed in response to specific explanation requests from the user is provided. (Author/ESR)",

Utlization of CIP data by a separate group of large U.S. libraries is also reviewed. Following discussion of the study's scope, objectives, background, and methodology, a summary of 25 findings and 9 recommendations for enhancing the CIP program is presented. It is recorded that a majority of all libraries responding to the survey use CIP data for one or more purposes, and that the majority of respondents express a favorable or very favorable opinion of the CIP program. In addition, high use of CIP for  cataloging purposes, medium use for acquisition activities, and low use for public services are reported. A total of 61 tables throughout the main body of the report present statistical answers to 37 questions on the usage, benefits, and problems of the CIP program and possible changes and/or improvements to it. Appendices comprise a brief description of CIP, a list of members of the CIP Advisory Group, and a sample questionnaire and survey cover letter. (ESR)",

Figures are given for percentages of appropriate respondents with online searching facilities among libraries at public schools (30 percent), private schools (13.7 percent), two-year colleges (11 percent), 4-year colleges (3 percent), universities with graduate programs (57 percent), and graduate or professional schools including theological seminaries (29  percent). Results show that of 32 respondents reporting access to the BRS, DIALOG, or ORBIT systems, 31 access DIALOG, 20 access BRS, and 16 access ORBIT. In addition, 23 of the schools report access to more than 1 system. Finally, the study indicates that DIALOG is searched primarily because searchers are more familiar with its system; BRS is searched primarily because it is the least expensive system to use; and ORBIT is searched primarily because it offers unique databases.

First, initial results of a survey of students in Washington community colleges are outlined, including the findings that 46% of the students attended the colleges straight from high school and that the more liberal arts courses the students had taken, the more confident they were in their abilities. The paper then discusses another project involving six of the largest community college districts in the United States. The project has seven major areas of concern: (1) strengthening the humanities in community services; (2) promoting advisory committees to humanities programs; (3) developing interdisciplinary humanities courses; (4) promoting integrated developmental  education programs; (5) building support services into regular credit courses; (6) strengthening articulation between community colleges and high schools; and (7) developing liberal arts career options. An update on developments in each of these areas is presented, along with observations and recommendations stressing the need to avoid creating separate departments for developmental education; the necessity for humanities faculty to visit local high schools to recruit students; the difficulty of setting up interdisciplinary courses; the need to retain poorly prepared students in humanities courses; and the benefits of integrating support services with classroom assignments as part of regular courses.

        "description":"The present system of testing and placement at Lane Community College (LCC) provides for voluntary assessment in reading, writing, and mathematics during orientation period, followed by recommendations for enrollment in appropriate courses. While only 15% to 20% of the new students at LCC participate in the testing/placement program, it must be remembered that many students are thoroughly tested through some other department or means and many are already aware of their abilities. Although the present voluntary system is not seen by LCC faculty and staff as solving the problem of achieving accurate placement and preparation for advanced courses, neither is mandatory testing and placement seen as a solution. Research indicates that while the vast majority of LCC students have low  reading skills, the majority are succeeding in college-level work; students who took remedial reading courses did not necessarily achieve higher grades than those who did not; and various reading tests and readability scales use different standards making it difficult to match reading test scores with text readability levels. A workable testing program would have instructors testing for the specific prerequisite skills needed to succeed in a given class or program. These prerequisites could be identified by analyzing lectures, instructional materials, and assignments and would include both content and study skills. Though a difficult process to develop and implement, such a testing program would be an improvement over the existing system. (KL)",

First, the paper explains the maturation of community college mission priorities in the post-World War II period. Next, a conceptual framework is presented concerning the changing nature of society and the implications of this change for postsecondary educational planning. This framework takes into account the role of computers and market research in postsecondary education, in terms of the tools that can be utilized and the colleges' options and priorities. A description is then provided of the way in which futurism is incorporated into North Central Technical College's strategic planning and  human resources development model. This description includes a series of assumptions and discusses thier implications for institutional and developmental goals and objectives. Finally, the paper considers the ramifications of the onset of the computer literate, high technology, information society for strategic planning and management in community services and continuing education, covering the areas of human resource development, organizational development, and community development.

        "description":"Because Los Medanos College (LMC) has no entrance tests or academic tracks, instructors are faced with mixed reading and writing levels in the classroom. LMC has elected to address this problem through a college reading and writing center and through the extensive use of peer tutors to upgrade language skills in all subject areas. In 1980, LMC began a 2-year project designed to train full-time faculty to supervise, direct, and support peer tutors. The project consisted of semester-length seminars repeated for four different sets of instructors over the 2-year period. The seminars, taught by language arts faculty, covered topics such as how to select a tutor, how to screen classes for literacy problems, and how to reinforce good reading and writing habits through appropriate  classroom methods. Participating instructors selected their own tutors, who enrolled in tutor-training classes offered by the language arts faculty. Seventy percent of the full-time faculty participated in the seminars, and the number of students being tutored in content areas increased from 308 in 1980-8l to 420 in 1981-82. Students who received tutoring had higher grades and retention rates than students who were selected for tutoring but did not receive it. The project report includes an overview, discusses the purpose and background of the project, and lists outcomes and impacts on faculty, students, and tutors. Extensive appendices include a sample of seminar topics, dissemination materials, and evaluation, budget, and descriptive reports. (KL)",

Thirty survey items indicating social support given to or received by an adolescent and nine items representing feelings of self-esteem were organized into seven separate scales and entered into a multiple regression analysis as independent variables. The six categories of support were infrastructure support (including details of the subject's residential area, birth order, family structure, and so on), and school, home behavior, home attitude, peer, and community supports. The  self-esteem scale consisted of items requiring the subject to evaluate some personal characteristic or to estimate future accomplishments. A measure of health status, similarly constructed from items in the data set, was regarded as the dependent variable. Findings of the analysis are reported for the total survey population, as well as for race categories, gender groups, and race-gender groups. Results are discussed. (RH)",

The analysis takes into account both theory and practice, applying learned concepts to the design and execution of an actual feasibility study at a small, suburban Massachusetts bank. Part 1 sheds light on parent needs, examining the changes in families, in work, and in community support services resulting in the need for employer assistance in child care. Also described are the variety of responses that companies can make given the interface among these changes. Part 2 examines the rationale for a corporate response to these changes, while part 3 presents the findings of the bank case  study and an analysis of the process used to arrive at the most appropriate and cost effective solution to identified management problems. Part 4 offers the author's conclusions and a prognosis for the future feasibility of employer supports to working parents in meeting management objectives. A list of on-site employer supported day care centers from 1960-present is appended, along with information concerning the turnover at the bank and the community it served.

The present study was an attempt to understand the ramifications of the &quot;beauty-is-good&quot; stereotype in young children. Specifically, the present research investigated the relationship between attractiveness and preschool social interaction. Forty-two children (23 boys and 19 girls), ranging in age from 33 to 68 months, were observed during free-play for a 5-minute period on 5 separate days, and behavior initiated by and directed toward each child was recorded. Two major categories of behavior were observed: aggressive and prosocial. After the  behavioral observations were made, facial photographs of the children were taken. Four of these pictures were placed in front of each child, who was asked to choose the most attractive one. That picture was removed, and the child was asked to choose the most attractive one remaining. This procedure was repeated until all the photographs were rated by each child. Results indicated that attractiveness has a different effect on boys than on girls; while attractive girls received the greatest number of prosocial behaviors directed towards them by their peers, no differential treatment of boys related to attractiveness was found.

A nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis suggested that children gradually become sensitive to an expanding set of numerical relationships during this period, although even kindergartners appear to understand the importance of magnitude as a basis for judging similarity between numbers. A second study further probed the basis for kindergartners' number-similarity judgments, using the first 10 letters of the alphabet as stimuli and providing subjects with an explicit criterion for making judgments (distance between letters in the alphabet). These results  suggest that the number-similarity judgments of kindergartners, and to a lesser extent of third-graders, are based upon counting distance. Results implicate the acquisition of numerical skills and operations such as counting, addition, and multiplication in a gradual broadening of the concept of number. (Author)",

The review is organized in three sections, focusing respectively on the definition of cognitive styles, the measurement of cognitive styles, and ethnic/cultural variations in cognitive styles. It is concluded that \"cognitive style\" is a general term referring to a conglomerate classification of many psychosocial behavioral domains in which two polar dimensions, differentiated and integrated styles, can be identified. It is further concluded that there is adequate research to support the notion that different ethnic groups have differing  tendencies in cognitive style, but caution is suggested in applying these general findings in educational contexts.

        "description":"Part of a larger study investigating the longitudinal effects of prematurity, illness, and hospitalization, this study focuses on parent perceptions of their infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, with age being corrected for conceptional age at birth. It was hypothesized that neonatal condition and age of infant at the time of measurement would affect parents' perceptions of their child. Four groups of infants were included in the study: (1) 17 pre-term infants whose gestational ages were less than 36 weeks and who experienced prolonged hospitalization after birth, (2) 12 full-term infants who were diagnosed at birth as having some type of illness and hence also experienced prolonged hospitalization, (3) 8 full-term healthy infants who were hospitalized for up to 8 days as a  result of their mothers having an infection, and (4) 16 full-term healthy control infants. At each age following birth, a questionnaire modeled after a measure employing a 7-point semantic differential scale was completed; parents rated their baby and an average baby of the same age along 10 items, such as calm versus excitable, strong versus weak, happy versus unhappy, and so on. Results are discussed. In general, high-risk infants were perceived as being different from the healthy control infants, and these differences persisted through 6 months of age. (RH)",

The first of six chapters included in the manual defines parent involvement, highlights some of the benefits which occur when parents are involved in day care programs, and discusses some common stumbling blocks encountered, as well as some possible solutions. The second chapter provides information on where to start with parents, including setting realistic goals and assessing parent needs and community  resources. Information about how to set the stage for effective parent involvement--including successful communication and observation techniques--is offered in the third chapter. The fourth chapter provides a conceptual framework for examining the two major categories of parent involvement in day care: programs supporting parents and parents in supporting programs. The fifth chapter describes illustrative models or approaches to involving parents in day care programs. Presentation of each model includes a definition of the model; a description of its functional goals; a list of implementation steps; a discussion of benefits associated with the model, along with an examination of likely problems and their solutions; and suggestions for resources needed to successfully implement the model.

        "description":"As described in this final report, the Immersion Learning Project at Wayne State University investigated the advantages of two alternative approaches to providing long term inservice training in special education to those in urban preschool programs working with high-risk and/or handicapped young children. During the first year of program operation, training sessions held at a central location of the university were conducted by a variety of outside consultants hired to deal with preschool- and elementary-level teachers but not directly with any day care providers. In its second year of operation, the process was altered in two ways. First, one full-time consultant was actually assigned to each participating day-care center. Second, consultants were given a greater degree of  flexibility in fashioning inservice activities to suit specific needs of each site, rather than the composite needs of all the programs. A variety of instruments, measures, and observations were utilized during the project's 2 years of operation to ascertain the effectiveness of the two approaches in increasing the knowledge and expertise of teachers and paraprofessionals. A detailed description of these measures, as well as a summary of activities conducted and effects noted in participant preschool programs during each of the 2 years of operation are included. The report provides recommendations for future implementation of the two inservice delivery systems and a final accounting of project expenses. (MP)",

Five reasons are advanced to support the claim that the object world of the young child is fundamental to creative thinking and imagination. Four ways children may use objects (exploration, repetition, replication, and transformation) are described, and three basic elements of creative thought (internal reality, internal motivation, and internal control) are identified. It is argued that for adults to guide children's creative thought, they must understand and apply the basic elements of  creative thought in the context of exploration, repetition, replication, and transformation. In conclusion, illustrations are provided of ways adults can facilitate children's creativity by encouraging these four uses of objects. (RH)",

The argument is substantiated by analyses of data from a statewide study of the standings of black and white children entering kindergarten and from two large National Health Examination Surveys of, respectively, 6- through 11-year-olds and 12- through 17-year-olds. To make comparisons among different ages and with data from more than one study, the &quot;single standard&quot; concept, a statistical technique used frequently by epidemiologists, was employed. In each of the age groups, the average score of the total group of subjects was established as the single standard. Meeting the average was taken to be the standard for subgroup performance; the  actual average score of any subgroup was divided by the total group average. The resulting value may be regarded as the ratio of that subgroup's performance to the standard for the total population examined. Scores for different groups on the two parts of the Scholastic Achievement Test provide an example of higher ratios for white and lower ratios for black children. Results of applying the procedure to the state and national data are reported, and implications are discussed. (RH)",

Four main elements are highlighted as prerequisites for an effective kindergarten program. First, the program should be based upon a firm understanding of the human growth, development, and learning principles. These principles include the knowledge that a child learns as a total person (emotionally, socially, and physically, as well as intellectually). Second, kindergarten programs need to be thoroughly planned and carefully organized, with flexibility as a deliberate part of the organization. A sufficient degree of flexibility will  enable the day-to-day operations to be altered to allow for special needs and interests. Third, the teacher, as the single most important part of the learning environment, should have an understanding of child development, respect for and trust in children, and a willingness to affirm children's rights as individuals. Fourth, planning a challenging and comprehensive curriculum based on young children's developmental needs should be the most important part of the process in implementing the kindergarten program. Mathematics, science, language arts, and other disciplines should become interwoven so that they can become a natural part of the child and his or her world. Finally, the evaluation of the child's progress must be a daily concern of the teacher in order that appropriate activities  can be provided. Specific guidelines, learning activities, and other supplementary materials are indicated for implementation of each of the above principles. (MP)",

        "description":"The social history of the Free Kindergarten Union of the State of Victoria, Australia, from inception in 1908 to the year 1980 is recorded in this book. Growth of the union is described within the context of the World Wars, the Depression, and urbanization and industrialization. The story begins with volunteerism and philanthropy, and with four kindergartens attempting to meet the needs of impoverished children. By mid-century the union had become an influence on government and throughout society. Some of its ventures (the training of teachers, medical and dental inspection of preschool children, and funding of kindergartens and their staff) have become government functions. Peaking at 89 member kindergartens in 1975 and facing increasingly high costs, overdrafts, and lack of  management experience in local parent committees, the union persisted in pioneering efforts by also venturing into the field of preschool education for migrant children. Within this account other situations unfold, such as the conflict between popular and inexpensive full-day childminding and the more expensive educationally oriented preschools. More than a general survey, this work gives numerous details, providing, for example, particulars indicating the impact on staff of John Bowlby's research and showing the positive influence of the &quot;Kindergarten of the Air&quot; radio program on parents' attitudes toward kindergarten.

Three communities had high growth, three showed moderate growth, and three showed decline between 1960 and 1970. Trained enumerators delivered questionnaires to households; 1,126 responses were obtained. Questionnaires covered several community aspects, evaluated 40 services and facilities, dealt with potential commitment to the community, and sought demographic and background data. Overall,  respondents were fairly satisfied with their communities, found them viable, and were willing to participate in making them better. Residents of high growth rate communities had more negative views of their communities' services and gemeinschaft-like attributes than did residents of lower growth rate communities. The one attribute positively related to growth was the opportunity to earn a liveable income. The economic concept of community viability thus could not be directly related to the more social aspects of the concept. References, a bibliography of research using the same data base, and 48 tables conclude the document. (BRR)",

        "description":"Oversight hearings were conducted on April 23, 1981 in reference to social service block grants for the Community Services Administration, child abuse prevention and treatment and adoption programs, and Native American Programs Act. Testimonies for support of block grants advocated ability of States to decide how program resources can best be distributed to meet needs of the citizens; alleviation of double reimbursement in community action agencies; and flexibility and opportunity to design programs to fit local needs. Testimonies of opposition were concerned that State level priorities for funding would eliminate community action agencies, national programs dealing with national problems (poverty, migrant workers, the handicapped, and the elderly), and adoption centers and child  abuse and prevention. The National Congress of American Indians and Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions urged reauthorization of the Administration for Native Americans and consideration by the Division of Human Services of fiscal flexibility to support innovative programs for senior citizens, Indian welfare, and tribal self-determination and self-sufficiency.

        "description":"The Catalyst Training Package was developed by project On The Other Hand, a 16-month project which used two rural Vermont high school districts to field test materials focused on educating youth to reach their full potential, and the roles of men and women in society. Three basic strategies were used to improve educational equity in rural high schools: community organization, peer leadership development, and networking. Community residents, school staff, and students in the rural school systems were recruited and trained with three separate training groups being organized in each school. Although trained separately, all three groups met together regularly as a large network responsible for the development of action plans, each directed at changing or improving some condition of  the school system which would create or enhance equal opportunities for female and male high school students. The resultant materials are suitable for use by social service agencies, high school personnel, parent-teacher organizations, etc., with project facilitators being crucial to program success. The &quot;Facilitators Guide&quot; focuses on facilitators, students, community members, school staff, networking, and evaluation. The &quot;Curriculum Training Manual&quot; introduces the curriculum and provides materials for 20 sessions over a 15-week period. An appendix provides a glossary, sample forms, etc. (BRR)",

First year of planning evolved from a community assessment strategy integrated within an evaluation of program accessibility catchment area-wide. Strategies ranged from the use of 50 key informants to utilization review of 150 human service and mental health agencies in the San Fernando Valley. Client statistics indicated an increase in utilization by Latinos of mental health services since the clinic's development. Major factors involved in planning and developing a mental health service  program for urban bilingual/bicultural families were structural in nature and related to the availability, accessibility, and acceptability of services in terms of the Latinos' sociocultural needs. Language and communications were the primary barriers to accessibility. Factors influencing utilization patterns included geographic location, availability of bilingual/bicultural professional and paraprofessional staff, cost for services, and understanding of informal and formal Latino helping networks existing within Latino communities. If services were communicated and available in the population's language, then self referral increased from within the community. (NQA)",

Townspeople were predominately middle-aged, had a high prevalence of home-ownership, and had lived in the area for a relatively long time. Blue and white collar occupations were well represented, and a large proportion of employed townspeople worked in some part of the &quot;energy industry.&quot; Quality of life was generally rated high, with respondents often mentioning that they appreciated the rural, peaceful atmosphere; the friendly people; and availability of West Virginia University. Respondents were not happy with roads, employment opportunities, and parking and  traffic congestion. Air and water pollution were cited as problems by a significant percentage of respondents. A slightly higher percentage were dissatisfied with public school facilities than with the curriculum. Reacting to four proposed industrial developments, respondents saw both benefits and liabilities, and many believed planning should precede industrial development. Students appeared to be nearly as approving of proposed industries as townspeople. Development attitudes generally appeared to reflect economic self-interest; nevertheless, other factors also influenced those attitudes, particularly concern with quality of life in the Monongalia area.

The program is based on three assumptions about the teaching and learning of mathematics: (1) Mathematics content and methods should be combined in the training of prospective elementary school teachers; (2) Mathematics should be learned in a laboratory setting; and (3) Teachers should be taught as they should teach. These units were written at the Indiana University Mathematics Education Development Center, and they combine the mathematics content and methods learning of college students who are training to be elementary teachers. The units are flexible and can be used in content courses, methods courses, or courses which combine both. In addition to the  college classroom component, the program has a coordinated elementary school teaching experience component which is not developed through the units. This guide provides a detailed description of all units and some implementation suggestions. The teaching experience component as implemented at Indiana University is also outlined. (MP)",

The first group of studies relates to research on teacher education (priority of perceived needs common to science teachers and how these might be used to develop inservice programs, determining the level of awareness and use of population education materials by teachers, and behaviors of preservice elementary teachers attempting to acquire science process skills). The second group focuses on achievement (teaching-learning model used with culturally deprived students and predicting success of college biology students using the Cloze test). The third grouping focuses on cognitive variables (mathematical model of concept learning applied to science  instruction, cognitive preferences of talented science students, relationship between academic performance and school-related affective characteristics of 12-year-olds, and modification of cognitive style of graduate students). Studies addressing the effect of women students in engineering on their institution's resources (Do women engineering students present different problems for their colleges/universities than do male students?), science interests of junior high school students, and science needs assessment for use with elementary school teachers are analyzed in the final section.

Areas addressed related to national perspectives of R&amp;D resources include the R&amp;D effort and national economy, R&amp;D performance, R&amp;D by national objective, R&amp;D and the gross national product, basic research, applied research, development, and international comparisons. Areas addressed related to science/engineering (S/E) personnel include current employment opportunities, labor market conditions for S/E doctorates, and labor market dynamics. Eighty-seven detailed statistical tables are included,  providing data related to R&amp;D resources (national perspective, federal government, industry, colleges/universities) and S/E personnel (current supply and utilization patterns of S/E population, doctorate scientists/engineers, and dynamics of S/E labor market). Data reported indicate among others that total U.S. spending reached an estimated $61.1 billion in 1980 (13 percent more than the $54.2 billion in 1979 and double the amount spent in the early seventies) and that although employment opportunities in jobs involving S/E activity are weak in some fields of science, almost all scientists/engineers seeking jobs find them.

They focus on specific aspects of three central themes directly related to President Reagan's goal of revitalizing the nation's economy. The themes are: (1) shared responsibility of the public and private sectors for maintaining the strength of U.S. science and technology base; (2) contributions of science and technology to industrial innovation, productivity, and economic growth; and (3) changing international context of U.S. science and technology. The papers do not provide a detailed analysis of all  relevant policy issues nor do they attempt to weigh advantages and disadvantages of possible policy options. Rather, each is intended to identify significant current or future national issues in science and technology. Areas addressed, each preceded by an abstract include: space commercialization; genetic engineering; industrial robotics; industrial research, development, and innovation; obsolescence of scientific instrumentation in research universities; adequacy of U.S. engineering education; advancing U.S. national interests through international cooperation in science and technology.

The first part of the paper reviews the literature on the study of family crises, identifying major research issues: (1) the event (classifying the nature of the event); (2) resources, i.e., individual resources (abilities, personality traits) and family resources (cohesion, adaptability); and (3) definition, i.e., the family definition of the severity of the change. The second section of the paper offers an eclectic model of nonnormative crises which focuses on the context of the crisis, proposing that all crises have both  direct and indirect effects, and all crises have an impact at more than one level. The context model is illustrated through the personal account of a mastectomy, the accounnt of the impact of an extensive flood, and by differing accounts of job layoff. Figures illustrating the contexts of the mastectomy and flood crises are included. (PAS)",

        "description":"The future status of the field of the psychology of women can be examined by looking at the reasons for the existence of the field. Any field of exploration consists of three components, i.e., a set of scholars, a domain of inquiry, and a methodology. The scholars involved in the psychology of women form a group on the basis of both achieved and ascribed attitudes, and relationships built with one another. The domain of inquiry of the psychology of women is all phenomena relevant to women and girls, and a reevaluation of all other research in the framework of its relation to women and girls. Feminist psychologists are critical of psychological research on the issues of bias (it has been demonstrated that misogynist biases were present in supposedly objective measures or designs);  limitation (in the definition of questions and problems); and oppression (much research has served to sustain a sex-stratified society). A field of inquiry reflects not only the social structure but the cognitive style of those who dominate in that social structure. To explore the question of cognitive style differences between men and women, a needed new direction for the psychology of women, requires learning to take risks and be imaginative. A model of research based on a feminine cognitive style represents a new paradigm for research. Encouraging diversity represents the values of the members of this field. By extension it would be valuable not to be limited to one research paradigm. (JAC)",

To test the interaction of race, gender, and social class differences in self-evaluation and integrate it with the literature on sex role socialization, 57 black (29 females and 28 males) and 120 white (93 females and 27 males) college students were interviewed individually and completed a 15-item semantic differential scale for the concept \"I Am.\" Factor analysis yielded five independent self-evaluation factors which were interpreted as dominated by either \"instrumental\" or \"expressive\" characteristics. Effects of gender, race, and social class were tested for all factors. Results showed that blacks had more positive self-evaluations on  both \"instrumental\" and \"expressive\" factors. White females (but not black females) showed more negative, more stereotypic self-evaluations than did males. Black women viewed themselves as instrumentally competent, with a calm, inexpressive stance. These suggestive findings require replication with a more broadly representative sample. (Author/JAC)",

This perspective on relationship development is applied to two of the phases, pair buildup and couple maintenance, including a discussion of several \"filtering\" models of courtship or mate selection.

Cooperative strategies can eliminate the necessity of choosing between strategies which promote either academic achievement or cognitive development and socialization. This paper reviews the research on the relative impact of cooperative, competitive, individualistic, and traditional instructional methods on a wide range of eduational outcomes. Results of meta-analysis of the available research  on two of the most frequent dependent variables in this education research, i.e., achievement and interpersonal relationships, are reported in detail including among others the use of higher quality reasoning strategies, higher level cognitive processing, mastery of social competencies, and development of sex-role identity. Major approaches to the development of cooperative learning strategies are described including:(1) direct application where specific curriculum procedures are used; and (2) conceptual application using general procedures and principles to formulate a unique set of instructional procedures. The immediate future directions of the research efforts on cooperation and schooling are discussed and problems with previous research are outlined. (JAC)",

Possible sources for the factors that generate avoidance of success include the influence of society, peers, and the family. In a search for sources of achieving behavior, 50 pairs of fathers and children, 26 with daughters and 24 with sons, were videotaped as they were engaged in working on three tasks: Raven Progressive Matrices, Blindfold-Building a Tower of Blocks, and Anagrams. Videotape records were subjected to content analysis. Factor analyzed variables successfully differentiated fathers' behavior towards boys and girls, with 6 of 12 variables in a discriminant function analysis being significant. Fathers demonstrated a close  working relationship with boys, but not with girls, as indicated by latencies, kinds of criticism, and emphasis on reasoning. Academic achievement was significantly related to several aspects of fathers' behavior. (Author/JAC)",

A more realistic recognition of the complexities of the change process points to the unique contribution of community psychology as a field of inquiry. A major problem of community psychology has been the conceptual confusion permeating the field, stemming from its use of concepts borrowed from other fields without further specifications. The social support construct is an example of the need for conceptual clarity. Social support research became popular because it fit the increasingly conservative climate of the times. One problem limiting advances in social support research, however, was its reliance on  predictive validity, which was maximized at the expense of construct validity. Research was directed toward demonstrating the relationship of social support to health outcomes, and the relationship between support and non-health outcomes received little attention. To have any kind of useful impact, the basic ingredients in social support must be studied, i.e., how it operates, under what conditions people use it, and how it relates to other modes of coping. For research in social support to provide useful intervention strategies it most provide a clearer understanding of its mode of operation. (JAC)",

An individual's overall theory of reality includes both self-theory and world-theory. One of the basic postulates in an individual's self-theory is an overall assessment of self-esteem, which becomes the most important influence on his/her pleasure/pain balance. As a higher order postulate, self-esteem is resistant to change. Direct self-assessment of self-esteem, using self-report techniques, appears to be of considerable value in allowing the acquisition of considerable information relatively easily. A major disadvantage is that people cannot be expected to be in direct contact with their preconscious level of self-esteem and often become defensive. A major  task, then, is the development of self-esteem scale items that are uninfluenced by defensiveness. Other approaches to measuring self-esteem that are free of the influence of defensiveness include behavioral measures and ratings by others. Self-esteem, when viewed as a basic construct in an individual's implicit conceptual system of self, is of such fundamental importance in understanding human behavior that it warrants a great deal of creative effort in establishing better ways to measure it.

The original DECS (58 self-report items) was administered to a sample of 60 individuals in dual-employed families. In another study, in which 69 dual-employed couples completed the DECS and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales, factor analytic procedures for the DECS yielded 49 items with internal reliability and 4 patterns of coping: (1) maintaining, restructuring, and strengthening the family system; (2) procurement of support to maintain family roles; (3) modifying roles and standards to maintain work/family balance; and (4) maintaining a positive perspective on the lifestyle and reducing tension and strains. Analysis of DECS data suggested gender  role differentiation in dual-employed coping styles. Dual-employed wives used significantly more coping behaviors than their husbands, with much effort focused on accommodating their work to their family. Successful family adaptation also related to the wives' attempts to accommodate work to family, while the husbands' use of time for personal coping behaviors such as exercising appeared to interfere with family adaptation. Results of the study support the DECS as a tool for measuring dual-employed family coping behaviors. (MCF)",

        "description":"The most frequently used mediator techniques in complex negotiations, suggestion of agreement points and reward of concessions, have received some investigation. To further assess the effects of these two techniques, 80 college students participated in simulated union management negotiations. Students were randomly assigned to represent union or management in four negotiations including suggestions of agreement points to the negotiator, suggestions of agreement points to the opponent, and mediator rewards to the negotiator's concessions. After the fourth negotiation, students completed brief questionnaires. Data analyses showed main effects upon the final offer, the total profits, and the number of agreements for the suggestion to the negotiator and the opponent. Mediators'  rewards to the negotiator did not affect total concessions, number of agreements, or joint profits. Suggestions applied to the negotiator and the opponent interacted in an interfering rather than in a complementary manner. Whether or not the simultaneous application of mediator techniques to the negotiator and opponent interacts in a facilitative or interfering way depends upon which techniques produce indirect effects on the opposite negotiator. Facilitative and interfering effects frequently are likely to cancel each other. (JAC)",

        "description":"The assumption that therapeutic or homework directives enhance therapy has received little research attention. To explore compliance with homework directives in a behavioral self-control treatment of weight loss, the comparative importance of social support (S), support plus directives with no rationale (SD), support plus directives with rationale (SDR), and support plus directives with rationale and involving a written contract (SDRC) was investigated using student volunteers (N=42) and a waiting list control group (N=5). Analyses of variance of the weight loss of all groups showed that participants in all conditions except the SD lost more weight than controls. Analyses of compliance with directives to call in, monitor calories and exercise, reduce calories, and increase  exercise for the self control groups showed weight loss was correlated with call-in frequency and calorie reduction. Compliance was improved by providing rationales for directions but not by written contracts. A second study involving insurance company employees (N=22) investigated the potential causes of the failure of contracts to improve compliance by testing the hypothesis that systematic attention to compliance or noncompliance with behavioral homework would increase compliance. Attention to homework was found to effectively increase client compliance with directives. These experiments suggest that the relationship between compliance with directives and positive therapeutic outcome is not simple and deserves increased attention from researchers. (MCF)",

        "description":"Experimental research has firmly established the role of expectancies in determining the behavioral consequences of alcohol consumption. To ascertain whether these alcohol expectancies derive from direct pharmacological experience with alcohol or from nonpharmacological, social-learning factors, an adolescent expectancy questionnaire was constructed for use with adolescents aged 12-19. Adolescents (N=1,580), making the transition from nondrinking to regular alcohol consumption, completed the 139 item true-false questionnaire and survey of the parameters of their drinking behavior. Age-stratified factor analyses showed seven cognitive alcohol expectancies which existed prior to substantial drinking experience but which changed with increases in age and drinking experience. The  findings suggest that the causal relationships between cognitive expectations and drinking behavior are not as simple as cause and effect. Expectancy scales may prove to be a useful assessment technique and aid in the development of early prevention/intervention strategies. (PAS)",

Community mental health centers (N=39) were studied to identify the nature and extent of information use and factors related to information use. Experts visited local community centers, conducted sessions with staff and provided both general and research based information in the area of proposed program change. Trained observers recorded each idea suggested by the experts and provided copies to the consultant staff. Followup interviews with staff at four- and eight-month periods were used to determine the nature and extent of utilization. Approximately 75% of the suggestions provided to local  organizations were used in the process of implementation. Information that was rejected tended to be relatively difficult to implement. Utilization in which information was adapted was the most time consuming and involved only six percent of the ideas suggested. The findings suggest that information utilization takes time, especially implementation of more complex information or adaptation of ideas. Research studies which fail to take into account the time required for utilization to occur may not provide accurate data on the extent of utilization. (MCF)",

Recently gender has also been seen as a cognitive schema. Sex and gender schema processing were examined in 40 male and 40 female college students. After being classified as sex-typed or balanced individuals, students were asked to complete a timed digit symbol task, and to rate the stimulus person from a narrative description of an androgynous college student as a friend, and for psychological health and attractiveness. Lastly, students completed an adjective checklist describing the stimulus person. Students were tested by either a male or female experimenter according to  either male or female stimuli conditions. Results showed no biasing effect for memory of the stimulus person, but significant evaluative effects between sex-typed and balanced individuals in terms of all three ratings. Performance deficits were found with sex-typed persons performing less well than balanced individuals when the constructor of the test was presented as a female. (JAC)",

First the CRSS inventory was evaluated and revised slightly. The language of the statements was made positive and jargon free. The 48 statements were adapted to a five-point frequency-of-use scale ranging from &quot;almost always&quot; to &quot;don't know.&quot; One open-ended question was included for respondents to reveal study skills not listed on the inventory. Subjects were selected according to the following criteria: 3.3 or better grade point average at the end of the fall term, enrollment in the spring term, completion of at least 60 credit hours, and bachelor's degree  candidacy in the College of Business and Public Administration. Results of the validation project indicated that while the group did read textbooks adequately, they considered their thorough and organized class notetaking and follow-up study to be even more significant. Self-control was noted as crucial to their success because it enabled them to manage time, maintain interest in courses, keep up to date, and plan ahead for exams and special projects. These students also indicated that they could select and learn what was important in a course. Besides those skills related to day-to-day course work, the group also professed confidence in their library research and writing skills. Finally, the group proved to be readers. In spite of their schedules, most regularly read newspapers,  magazines, and books. (HOD)",

It was hypothesized that the use of a discrimination index for item selection would tend to favor relatively trivial questions. Half the reading selections from the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test (SDRT), which gives more weight to item discrimination indexes, and the Metropolitan Reading Test (MRT), which does not, were randomly selected. The multiple choice questions that followed each reading selection were transformed into statements by adding the correct answer to the question stem. Thirty faculty and graduate students from a school of education read each of the 10 passages and were asked to rate each statement on a  four-point scale as to whether it was central or peripheral to comprehension of the passage. Thirty-seven percent of the items from the SDRT were rated peripheral, while only 12% of the items from the MRT were so rated. When the mean for all statement ratings was figured, the statements from the SDRT were found to be significantly more peripheral than those from the MRT. Since the Stanford manual clearly states that discrimination indices played a large part in decisions about which items to include, the finding adds some credence to the suggestion that an emphasis on the discrimination index in test item selection will tend to favor more trivial items.

Subjects, 188 students in grades three through six who were reading at third grade level or above, read a 900-word expository article written at a third grade level.

All subjects then completed a 32-item posttest, half of whose questions were identical to the prequestions. Results indicated that  prequestions exercised no significant impact upon the total amount of recall of the children. Gains in cueing from prequestions seemed to be offset by a narrowing in focus of attention. Although predictions did not seem to overcome the narrowing influence of prequestions, prequestions with predictions did seem to increase recall on cued information without any additional narrowing of attention than was already caused by the use of questions. Although further study is needed, prediction seems a better strategy than prequestions for directing children's reading. (JL)",

        "description":"Working on the assumption that an adequate model of comprehension must also deal with its connotative aspect (the aspect that concerns the feeling, mood, or &quot;tone&quot; of the text), this paper examines the concept of contextual tone. After defining tone according to its various senses and synonymous forms (voice, attitude, style, mood, and atmosphere), the paper discusses the relationship of tone to the paradigms of text structure, texture, and text types. This discussion is followed by a presentation of the categories of tone: sound, author relationship, simple and complex, biological and intellectual, and local and global. Arguing that tone is a necessary factor in a model of comprehension, the next section of the paper discusses the various types of meaning and tone as a symbol of  meaning. It then explores levels of awareness and tacit inference, and examines the functions of tone in relation to the text, reader response, and comprehension. Determinants of tone such as adjustment to audience and subject matter, speaker role, point of view, and text type are presented in the next section. This is followed by an examination of the preconditions necessary in readers and texts for apprehending tone. It also discusses the problems and possibilities of measuring tone apprehension. Implications of tone problems for students are then examined, with particular attention to the studies of poor readers, subjectivity and biases, and prior knowledge and developmental problems. The paper concludes with a discussion of issues and implications for education. (HOD)",

        "description":"While listening comprehension is perhaps the most ignored area of the language arts, a review of the literature suggests that it is deserving of more classroom instructional time. Involving the simultaneous orchestration of skills in phonology, syntax, semantics, and knowledge of text structure, listening comprehension seems to be controlled by the same set of cognitive processes as reading comprehension. However, because crossmodal transfer between reading and listening is at best imperfect, teachers cannot expect automatic improvement in listening comprehension through attention to reading comprehension. When instruction occurs in an auditory mode, though, training in many of the same skills generally used in reading comprehension does seem to work. Additionally, since many of  the recent investigations in such areas as schema theory and actively negotiating meaning for a text have actually assessed listening comprehension, their instructional implications may be even more applicable to listening than they are to reading. Activities that use students' listening capabilities seem to have potential for improving reading comprehension. Repeated readings and read-along techniques, for example, rely on listening to help students learn to assign appropriate prosodic patterns to text. (Author/FL)",

The 12 examples presented are (1) vocabulary word recall, (2) provided versus generated pictures, (3) nonkeyword pictures versus keyword pictures, (4) provided versus generated keywords, (5) ideal versus representative materials, (6) modality by materials interactions, (7) keyword method by ability interactions, (8) the keyword method  versus other methods, (9) vocabulary comprehension and usage, (10) strategy maintenance and generalization, (11) group administered keyword instruction, and (12) fictionally versus factually effective mnemonics.

        "description":"Recent research has shown that when individuals hear an impoverished, atypical, or disorganized story and are asked to recall it, they can and do produce a canonical version of it. To determine if this \"strategic\" manipulation of story structure undergoes developmental changes, two experiments were conducted using second and sixth grade children and college students. In the first experiment, 40 subjects at each grade level listened to \"normal\" or \"scrambled\" versions of stories and either recalled them as heard or recalled them as good (organized) stories. Results showed that scrambled stories generally depressed recall and that there was a clear improvement with age/grade in the ability to recognize a scrambled story, with second grade subjects performing especially poorly. The  second experiment examined two alternative explanations for the poor performance of the second grade students: (1) younger children's memory for material they have just heard is \"fragile,\" and any attempt to operate on it or transform it is doomed because the effort detracts from the effort to hold on to the memory itself; and (2) sequencing techniques needed to reorder a scrambled story are not well mastered in young children. Eighteen second grade children were trained to sequence the propositions of a random story into a canonical form, with the propositions continuously available for inspection, while a control group of 18 subjects received no special training. Results confirmed that second grade students could reorganize their recall only if some training in sequencing were offered  them. (FL)",

        "description":"A new method of continuous stroke manuscript print called D'Nealian Manuscript is challenging the traditional circle-stick method of teaching children how to write. The circle-stick uses component or splinter parts to form whole letters. Children are forced to form all writing with verticle lines and to learn a manuscript print that goes nowhere. Moreover, large pencils are usually recommended and the letters are presented in unnecessarily large print. The D'Nealian method, on the other hand, presents letter forms similar to standard print, has carryover skills to cursive writing, and eliminates many of the errors of circle-stick writing. All letters are made with a continuous stroke except to dot the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; and cross the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;t.&quot; Children also begin to write on near  standard-sized paper. They use a pencil size that feels comfortable to their grip and may write letters with a back, vertical, or typical right-hand slant. Letters are presented in groups of similar construction, and as a letter is introduced it is immediately used in a word. Basic vocabulary is thus enhanced, along with left-to-right eye movement and directionality. Because children can write words more easily and sooner with D'Nealian, it is an important aid to reading development. (HOD)",

        "description":"A study and review of the revisions of professional writers reveals 11 functions of revision: (1) altering form, (2) organizing information, (3) creating transitions, (4) deleting information, (5) expanding information, (6) emphasizing information, (7) subordinating information, (8) creating immediacy, (9) improving syntactic structures, (10) improving language usage, and (11) cleaning up. While the revisions of professional writers are encompassed in these categories, students' revisions appear to be concentrated only in the last two categories. Most students spend their time on \"surface\" level revisions--changes in single words, in vocabulary and grammar. One reason students do not engage in \"deeper\" level revisions is the writing instruction they receive. Assignments often  eliminate the need to revise in such categories as altering form and organizing information. Furthermore, many of the writing assignments imply that the audience is the teacher and the purpose is a grade. Students need to be able to write for a variety of audiences and purposes if they are to learn how to manipulate such aspects as voice and person. But changes in assignments need to be accompanied by an expansion in the repertoire of composition skills which an instructor teaches and assesses. Until all 11 categories of revision are emphasized and all other aspects of written discourse (prosody, logical thinking, and the relationship of content to structure) are taught and assessed, students will continue to concentrate only on the \"lower\" levels in revision. Teachers should help  students approach revision with a problem orientation so they can recognize all of the functions that revisions serve. (HOD)",

If these aims are given up, then the noble endeavors in the humanities such as sustained reflection, intensive research, careful scholarship, inspired teaching, deep learning, and serious discussion will all become discredited and eventually disappear. The reason the term \"humanities\" seems meaningless is because the activities undertaken in its name no longer stand for a unified set of principles or a coherent body of knowledge. In the past the aim of humanities education was the cultivation of free men and women--freed from ignorance and callousness. Today, many people interpret cultivation or the aim of cultivation as an imposition of arbitrary standards, an  obstacle to personal expression, or even a limitation on student freedom. In place of cultivation, \"awareness\" is advocated. Humanities education is no longer an introduction to or an immersion in the best thought and knowledge. It is, instead, a collection of disconnected and often eccentric areas of inquiry. It is, therefore, not surprising that the humanities have so much trouble evoking the enthusiasm of scholars and teachers, capturing the allegiance of students, and gaining the financial support of public and private institutions. It is the responsibility of every generation of scholars and teachers not only to maintain the tradition of the humanities, but to extend and refine this tradition through new ideas and works and to see that the humanities are studied in a coherent and  serious way.

The earliest PLATO materials in English were drill and practice programs, an improvement over written texts, but a small one. Unfortunately, game lessons, entertaining drill and practice lessons that take advantage of PLATO's graphics, are mostly intended for young children and have been poorly adapted for deficient college students. Tutorial lessons that attempt to simulate human interaction are much more effective, but also much more rare. An advanced tutorial program (often referred to as a &quot;problem solving design&quot; or dialogue system) already on PLATO indicates just how much PLATO could  do. This program helps students generate and organize ideas and explains mistakes &quot;intelligently.&quot; But since current technology cannot produce a genuinely intelligent computer, another approach using a version of Peter Elbow's heuristics and the strengths of the PLATO system requires the computer to assume a stance as a nonjudgmental medium, a neutral manipulator of information--a tool that students can use to help them learn to use language on their own. The idea of teacher as arbiter is itself probably the source of the emphasis on computer as arbiter; both should be replaced by the idea of teaching as assistance, helping the student write for a real audience, his or her peers.

Chapter three deals specifically with the writing activities found in the textbooks, and chapter four provides a detailed examination of the  students involved in the case studies. Chapters five and six examine the writing of the students closely, focusing on the organizational patterns they are mastering. Chapters seven and eight concentrate on the varying approaches the students took to their writing tasks, as reflected in their conversations with researchers and in their drafts. Chapters nine and ten address both the link between the problems students have in writing and the extent of their knowledge about the topics they deal with and the role of writing as an aid to learning in the content areas.

The first problem was the difficulty posed by the vocabulary and syntax of &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot; The instructor discussed with the class syntactic clues that would allow them to manipulate Milton's poetry into a more conventional syntactic order. They also discussed roots, prefixes, and suffixes to give the class a better understanding of Milton's unfamiliar Latinate vocabulary. The second major problem stemmed from the fact that the students lacked the background needed to give the work a meaningful context. The instructor gave the students a focus they could deal with--the  question of who in fact was the hero of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;--and then supplied the historical background as needed. The third and most difficult problem had to do with aesthetics--what makes Milton worth reading. By having students bring their own values and preconceptions to the hero question, the instructor hoped they would see how a great work makes a coherent statement of depth and complexity, and how Milton's choices in diction and style influenced their expectations and responses. At the end of the semester, the students admitted that it had been difficult, but that they had come a long way in developing a sense of what makes a great work great. (HTH)",

        "description":"The middle school program emerged against a backdrop of criticism, awareness of changing educational necessities and values, and new insights into the needs of the middle range of the student population. The precocity of youth mixed with the pseudo-sophistication of adulthood gives the middle school its reason for existence--the &quot;transescent.&quot; The goal of the middle school is to be child-centered, so that time is allowed for growing up during the students' years of change. Ideally, the English curriculum for the transescent should provide the student with an activity-oriented, skill-developmental course of study. It must allow for diversity of interests and abilities, yet rely on the commonality of the adolescent experience. The middle school curriculum of the Baltimore County  (Maryland) Public Schools reflects this concern for the adolescent. Throughout all of the sixth grade units, for example, students are involved in improvisations, oral composition, and other experiences that provide them with opportunities to generate language purposefully. The seventh grade units stress student involvement in various language and literature related activities, while the eighth grade course of study provides the student with literature experiences. Many factors are involved in an effective middle school program, among them the development of a middle school &quot;task force,&quot; departmental parallel scheduling, team teaching, middle school teacher certification, small classes, interdisciplinary articulation, specialized report cards, and community research.

        "description":"The discourse classification systems used most frequently by reseachers in composition credit A. Bain, J. Moffett, J. Emig, J. Kinneavy, J. Britton, and R. Lloyd-Jones. A majority of the studies that have included discourse types as a major focus of their work were designed to investigate students' syntactic structures. Other studies focused on the composing processes, cognitive patterns, test conditions, cognitive factors, and audience awareness. Unfortunately, little reliable evidence can be gleaned from these studies. Researchers are either inconsistent in their use of the terms \"types\" and \"modes\" or confuse the two. Another problem is that the classification systems used to discuss results are not translatable into terms of other systems. Also, researchers sometimes make  assertions about results based on an inadequate understanding of the discourse type within the system they used. In some reports researchers collapse the data and report on written discourse as a single category. Sometimes the inadequacy in the design is in the writing prompt itself. Some of the deficiencies can be removed by more thoughtful and extensive inquiry designs. A more difficult problem is the diversity of discourse classifications. A possible solution is to define discourse type through discourse-analysis studies that examine discourse by using a bottom-to-top approach, going from the small features in discourse to see which cluster together in a written product. The repeated cooccurrence for such features may provide a taxonomy of discourses and thus define discourse types  that can be accepted as standards for all researchers. (HOD)",

To take advantage of the more advanced tutorial programs that do exist, English teachers need either enough experience with computerized interactive instruction to judge for themselves or a reliable source of software reviews. Until now, developers have been designing lessons that focus on easily computerized topics, without a broad perspective on the instruction needed for a comprehensive teaching unit. Teachers should look closely at what they are teaching and then decide what aspects of that content  can be computerized instead of just looking at what is available from commercial software publishers and then \"fitting it in.\" The first step is defining what aspects of a course's content have specific, identifiable traits that can be modelled on a computer. Lessons that demand genuine open-ended input would be tremendously difficult to write, but similar lessons that offer students a choice among a limited number of answers could be used to teach such things as plot development or skimming.

These articles cover the psychology of thinking, mapping and composing, children's art, drawing as prewriting, prewriting as discovery, turning speech into writing, and the process approach and the elementary school writing curriculum. Part three, dealing with distancing, contains two articles defining &quot;talk-write&quot; as a  behavioral pedagogy for composition and explaining its application in the classroom; and five articles on function categories, the composition course as the pursuit of ideas, a new curriiculum in English, student writing response groups in the classroom, and the All-City High Project of the Oakland, California, school district. The articles on modeling in part four explain a generative rhetoric of the sentence, sentence modeling, &quot;voices&quot; in reading and writing, paraphrases of professionals in writing classes, the importance of reason in writing, and the superiority of showing over telling. The relationship between the teacher and the researcher is examined in the book's final essay. A bibliography is included. (JL)",

Black rhetors contend that even those blacks who speak \"standard English\" are subject to discrimination, and that embarrassment and subjectivity are often given as excuses for discounting the opinions of black researchers regarding black English. They charge that incorrect conclusions have been drawn by language theorists who are familiar only with the surface culture of the black language, implying that African American scholars come closer to correctly interpreting the language and its meaning.  These rhetorical arguments are appropriate in terms of rhetorical effort, in that a strong effort is made in stating their claims and in providing supporting data and examples. The rhetoric is biased, however, from a black perspective. While appropriate for black audiences in agreement, it is inappropriate when dealing with the audience in need of persuasion. At times this rhetoric appears to aim at both black and white audiences. Perhaps the answer is simply to clarify, reinforce ideas, and renew commitments. (HTH)",

The model was tested using data collected in a survey of 800 Mexicans identified as holding &quot;elite&quot; positions in three metropolitan areas. The subjects, business executives (for both Mexican-owned and American-owned companies), government officials, professors, secondary school teachers, mass media executives, university students, and labor leaders, were chosen because they could be expected to be influential in decisions affecting  future relationships between their country and the United States. After having been gathered through personal interviews with the subjects, the data were submitted to LISTREL analysis, a path analysis technique involving multiple indicators of latent variables. The results were supportive of the model with an acceptable goodness of fit and with a high level of variance accounted for in the sole dependent variable. However, the results did indicate that the initial posited relationships among latent variables were more complex than first hypothesized.

The subjects sorted slips of paper containing statements corresponding to interpersonal persuasion tactics into at least 3 and not more than 11 piles based on the similarity of the content of the statements. Cluster analysis produced nine clusters and three centroids from the responses, all significant. Results indicated that there is a logic underlying the content of interpersonal persuasion tactics that is recognizable by those who use them and that tactics to resist persuasion and those to persuade can be differentiated, as can tactical and nontactical messages.

        "description":"Although for the 15 years preceding his election as President of the United States Ronald Reagan muted his anti-Soviet rhetoric in order to achieve political power, since his election he has returned to anti-Sovietism in an effort to redirect American foreign policy against the Soviets. At the same time, however, he employs a rhetorical strategy that stresses the essential rationality, the &quot;common sense,&quot; of his approach. Specifically, his most important image, one of Soviet savagery, extends to three issues: the extent of the Soviet threat, America's proper response, and the possibility of peace in a nuclear world. In addition to explicit use of this metaphor, Reagan regularly reintroduces it through a number of vehicles that place the Soviets in eight general categories as: (1)  inanimate and physical, (2) animals, (3) primitives, (4) machines, (5) criminals, (6) mentally disturbed, (7) fanatics and ideologues, and (8) satanic and profane. Reagan presents these images not as metaphor, but as literal truth. As with other metaphors, this image is a way of seeing the facts that also shapes the facts that are seen. Replacing complexity with simplicity, the metaphor rejects as irrelevant or unimportant information that does not fit within its scheme. Finally, Reagan's relaxed personna reinforces the idea that the imagery of savagery and its corollaries form the only sensible perspective on the Soviet Union. (JL)",

        "description":"Various communication studies have revealed the existence of a &quot;preverbal&quot; stage of communication consisting of centers within the brain that exists in an innate form or a form preprogrammed for future information acquired from the environment through experience (socialization). Such centers serve to prepare the individual for communication at the intrapersonal and interpersonal levels. These ideas about the material within the centers and their &quot;location&quot; are predicated on knowledge gained from contributions made by behaviorial, psychoanalytic, and neurophysiological approaches to communication study. The preverbal model operates on drives associated with both internal and external stimuli. That is, the information stored in the preverbal centers can act in concert with that in  other centers to provide an internal motivation or in concert with that in external centers to produce more or less predictable communication. The level of prediction, however, is mediated by the style or dominance of one hemisphere of the brain over the other and the control of one evolutionary level of the brain over other levels. Whether such centers are scientifically verifiable will be determined in the future. For the present, it is sufficient to suggest that the preverbal stage of communication does exist and that it affects the communication of both intrapersonal and interpersonal communication.

There are really three types of presumption: (1) an identification with the status quo (existing institutions), (2) a psychological state (prevailing opinion), and (3) a decision rule (who must prove). In courts of law and traditional policy debate, these three types wear one face, but in debating propositions of value they sometimes conflict. The view that presumption adheres to the status quo is often inapplicable to value topic debates, either because there is no clear status quo or because the topic is worded so as to place the affirmative in defense of the present system. Although psychological presumption may well be argued in a  value debate, it cannot provide an unambiguous tie breaker. On the other hand, a decision rule that &quot;one who asserts must prove&quot; provides a clear-cut guide to deciding a tied round, regardless of the wording of the resolution or the psychology of the audience. It provides the best form of presumption for the value topic debate. (JL)",

Even in activities having the highest persuasive purposes, such as managing social, economic, and political issues, public relations focusses on two-way communication. Interpersonal communication explains this two-way communication. Public relations functions are also psychological rather than social, and personal rather than impersonal. Public relations practitioners act as \"linking pins,\" individuals occupying positions both in the organization and in some external system.

Following the reading, students responded to 10 multiple choice questions measuring actual comprehension and 8 additional questions measuring comprehension, dynamism, and worthwhileness of material. Results showed that the more contrived the pronoun form, the more likely it was that college-age students would  perceive it as difficult to comprehend. Actual comprehension scores were significantly higher in the exclusive &quot;he&quot; than in the &quot;more contrived&quot; condition, but actual comprehension scores did not differ significantly between the exclusive &quot;he&quot; and the &quot;less contrived&quot; condition. &quot;More contrived&quot; pronoun forms posed more serious comprehension problems for men than for women, but men found the &quot;less contrived&quot; forms easier to comprehend than the women did.

        "description":"Considerations in the design and implementation of the technical assistance (TA) system for supporting Pennsylvania's statewide school improvement initiative are analyzed. After a brief introduction, the authors describe the key features of the initiative, called Long-Range Planning for School Improvement (LRPSI). They briefly review recent research data on TA's importance in school improvement efforts. A lengthy section then recounts the design of Pennsylvania's TA network, highlighting five areas: TA role definition and implementation, TA staff selection and training, TA system organization and maintenance, support systems for TA staff, and evaluation of TA activities. Five long charts are used to relate prescriptive information from TA research to specific design features of  Pennsylvania's TA system. Next a short update is provided on the progress of LRPSI and the TA network. The conclusion briefly reflects on the applicability of recent linking-agent research to the TA system's design. Seven appendixes cover further research findings on school improvement and TA, training related to the TA program, TA system reporting forms, the support roles of state and district agencies, college and university roles, a sample LRPSI guide, and guidelines for LRPSI midpoint progress reports.

        "description":"A questionnaire survey of elementary teachers and principals investigated their attitudes toward parent involvement in schools and sought to find whether barriers to parent involvemnt were related to school policies and procedures, teacher or principal attitudes, lack of resources, or lack of knowledge or skills. Of the random sample of 2,000 teachers and 1,500 principals--located in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas--45 percent responded. Attitudinal data were collected on parent involvement in 20 educational decisions and 7 specific involvement roles and on the extent of current parent involvement in 28 specific school decisions. Data analysis was performed using frequencies, averages, and Likert-scale ratings of items. The results show both  teachers and principals favor parent involvement in helping their children with school work and in playing support roles for school activities, but do not favor involvemnt in curriculum and instruction decisions or school administration and governance. The results suggest school policies and procedures, as well as teacher and principal attitudes, are not barriers for favored types of parent involvement but may be barriers for nonfavored types of involvement.

Four primary norm-setting techniques were identified: the principal can act as a resource provider for teachers; can adopt a &quot;human relations&quot; approach, relating to teachers in ways that make them want to comply; can assert the authority of his or her position, pulling rank to obtain teacher conformity; or can model appropriate behavior consciously or unconsciously. Of these techniques, that of providing resources may have the most potential for principal  effectiveness since it permits establishment of a social exchange system in which teachers can offer their compliance with norms in exchange for the resources provided. An appendix lists the nine secondary norm-setting techniques identified in the study. (PGD)",

The conference brought together participants from two areas of research that usually operate independently--research on collective bargaining and research on school administrative leadership. The conference was divided into three sessions. The first, dealing with the effects of collective bargaining on educational policy, focused on the formal statements on matters of policy being written into teacher contracts. Presentations were made and discussed concerning the increasing inclusion of policy provisions in contracts and the reluctance of administrators to take assertive stances regarding policy interests. The second session, on the effects of  collective bargaining on personnel relations, concentrated on the informal relationships between administrators and teachers through which policy is actually implemented. Special attention was paid to the work relationships of elementary school principals. The final session looked at the effects of collective bargaining on teaching conditions and included presentations on and discussions of three research projects. These projects studied the time allocation patterns of teachers with and without collective bargaining, the sensitivity of teachers to salary benefits, and changes in teachers' work attitudes caused by collective bargaining.

As of January 1982, virtually all provisions of the California Education Code can be waived at the request of local school boards with the approval of the state board of education. Under Article 2 of Assembly Bill 777, Chapter 100, programs that may be waived include state testing requirements, immunization programs, class size, bilingual education, and mandatory attendance age. The local governing board can apply for a waiver on behalf of a single school site, multiple sites, or on a districtwide basis. School boards requesting a waiver must provide an opportunity for community input, including the participation of parents, teachers, staff, administrators, and students. The second law, Article 3 of  Chapter 100, allows schools to coordinate state-funded programs, which means that staff supported from a certain funding source may serve more pupils than those identified for that particular program. The governing board must decide which schools may consider a coordinated program and which funds it will allow to be coordinated. Under Article 3, programs must be recommended for coordination by a school site council. The intent of this article is smoother administration of programs and attention for every student rather than for selected students. (JM)",

To encourage accountability and educational quality, the panel urged giving locally selected authorities primary responsibility for educational administration and funding. The Federal role proposed by the panel would be restricted to funding the programs required by Federal law and would limit both the enforcement of intrusive Federal regulations and the mandating of national educational objectives. The panel also encouraged support of private education as a competivtive alternative to public schooling. The panel's short-term practical recommendations  included consolidating Federal categorical grant programs into less-regulated block grants, establishing educational voucher programs, offering tuition tax credits, and involving the private sector. Longer-term recommendations were to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, turn Federal revenues back to the states originating them, deregulate public schools, encourage school-based management, and structurally reform public education. A minority of the panel disagreed with the majority's recommendations regarding education vouchers and tuition tax credits, submitting a minority report.

No firm data have been obtained to describe the innovative behavior of school systems longitudinally. The extensive literature has reinforced a permutational view of educational change as dependent on the given situation's particular mix of a seemingly infinite number of discrete factors. Using the system dynamics approach, the author of this report constructed a mathematical model representing a dynamic theory of educational innovation and used the model to examine the impact of alternative policies on the effectiveness of innovation efforts. The resulting Public School Change Model aggregated many of the factors identified in the literature into a  relatively small number of variables, including conflict, the level of innovation, external funding, linkage, the educational norms of administrators, teachers, and the community, and, most importantly, leadership effectiveness. The development of the model was guided by the metatheoretical proposition that the behavior of systems over time is determined by the interplay among relevant positive and negative feedback structures, three of which affect this model. This report describes the model, the theory behind it, and the nature and results of simulations testing it. (PGD)",

The respondents were presented with hypothetical moral dilemmas and asked to explain what they believed they should do, what they actually would do, and what thinking lay behind their responses. The study findings supported the hypothesis that the nature of administrators' responses to the hypothetical problems of the MACT would relate to their levels of moral development as revealed by the DIT scores. The data did not indicate that the administrators who internalized social rules exhibited greater discrepancies between their&quot;should&quot; and &quot;would&quot; responses than did either those treating rules as external or those developing rules from self-chosen principles. As expected, no association was found between DIT and MACT scores when critical moral issues were not confronted. The major implication of the study, according to the authors, is that as problems are conceived less abstractly and more concretely the decisions as to what &quot;should&quot; be done become more strongly dependent on the particular social contexts affected.

The next section explains that approximately two-thirds of the States plan either to encourage parent involvement in their local education agencies (LEAs) or to take an active role in ascertaining whether or not the LEAs are consulting with parents. The last section presents examples, selected from those supplied by the States, to address parent  involvement. The examples are divided into two basic categories with several subcategories. The first category, &quot;forms of parent involvement,&quot; includes general tips; ways of involving parents at home, at school, and through councils; and parents' role in the design and implementation of programs. The second category, &quot;methods of providing information to parents and staff on parent involvement,&quot; includes handbooks, newsletters, workshops and meetings, audiovisual materials, resource centers, parent-teacher conferences, home visits, and information notices sent home with children.

The next section on continuation plans presents discussions on audits in two parts: withholding payment, and complaint resolution. The third section of the module reviews States' past practices, particularly as they may be relevant to future audit requirements. According to data collected, almost all States will need to modify their practices to conform to  regulations. The discussion then turns to a review of the compliance areas that were reportedly audited by States. Some form of compliance auditing appears to have been conducted in 43 States, and the majority of States audited only 5 of the 7 requirements covered by auditing regulations. Finally, this section presents 17 exhibits, selected from those supplied by States, of portions from past audit materials using different compliance areas to demonstrate the audit report formats used.

The first consists of three papers that interpret the results of quantitative research on school effectiveness in a manner that highlights the active behaviors of participants and demonstrates that school policies influence school outcomes through the behavioral responses of participants. The second project applies the behavioral response idea in exploring why it has been difficult to build a powerful research program in education, and why seniority rules for teachers are more productive than many analysts have believed. The third project applies the behavioral response idea to the debate over the relative quality  of the education provided by public and private schools. The fourth project consists of an empirical study establishing that there is a selective teacher attrition, during the first years on the job, of those perceived to be unproductive. Pauly's five essays provide the basis for a considerably revised conception of how teaching and learning are embedded in a system of school policies, institutions, and independent behavior. (MLF)",

To achieve the goal of identifying the components of the problem, solutions suggested by the research, and implications for women who aspire to administrative positions in education, the research analyzed in this paper is divided into five sections. The historical facts and figures delineating the trend are presented first. Second, the myths and the realities relating to women in educational administration are examined. Third, the attributed causes of the problem--socialization and sex-role stereotyping, educational background and type of preparation, and discrimination--are discussed. Fourth,  some means by which women are being advanced into and within the educational hierarchy are outlined. Finally, conclusions drawn from an analysis of the research are made. Among these are that personal commitment is the greatest challenge to women aspiring to educational administrative careers. To achieve management success women must overcome both internal and external barriers produced by sex-role stereotyping. (MLF)",

        "description":"There is disagreement about whether education for the future ought to be more general or more specific than is currently the case. Those who believe that the technologically based world of the future will require more job-specific or highly specialized skills advocate more specialized and vocational training in the schools. Those who see future work as becoming \"deskilled\" emphasize the importance of a broad course of studies. Evidence regarding this debate indicates that there is a pressing need to develop the type of curriculum that will best prepare students not for specific jobs but for a range of tasks required in the near future. Adaptability to change is demanded by rapid technological development, but an increasingly specialized curriculum may not produce workers able to  adjust to continuing changes in the tools and conditions of work. Other skills identified as important to modern society--analysis and critical thinking, organizational and reference skills, creativity and ability to communicate--call for both general and specialized training. Thus a general foundation should be emphasized in the formative elementary and secondary years, and at the same time, high schools will need to prepare a sufficient number of highly skilled students in technical fields.

Findings touch on feature theory, which proposes that information is held in the form of \"features,\" and that students for example learn to discriminate letters by marking certain identifiable aspects. Other studies are described which focus on speed of processing visual information, verbal encoding of the symbols, confusion from phonetic characteristics, serial recall, and temporal order recall in nonverbal tasks. Critiques of the studies' assumptions and methodologies are presented. It is concluded that good and poor readers' differences in memory span and sequential ordering can be explained by linguistic terms and traced to dyslexic readers' verbal inadequacies in labeling, rehearsal, or  chunking.

Excerpts from studies are presented to emphasize minimal training of paraprofessionals in relation to the extensive service they provide. A forecast is made indicating that community colleges will no longer play a major role in training due to fiscal pressure. Described are the following parent-initiated programs: Focus on Children, (Jonesboro, Arkansas); the Philadelphia Association for Retarded Children, (Pennsylvania); the North Orange County Regional Occupational Program, (California); and the  Parsons-Labette Program, (Parsons, Kansas). Licensing is said to have variable support from national organizations such as the National Education Association, but strong backing from trainers, post-secondary institutions, and state agencies. The approaches of California and Louisiana in moving toward a statewide model are discussed. New sources of aides such as teachers in training are proposed, and recommendations for their recruitment are given. Among the union issues briefly reviewed are seniority, concern of unions for other groups, training, and unionism versus professionalism. A summary states that budget cuts and reduced federal funding are threats to survival of the field and that training in vocational tracks may aid field retention. (MC)",

Screening was undertaken with 423 handicapped children, of which 88 were identified as having one or more potential talent areas for programming, and 86 received RAPYHT programming. Thirteen replication sites involving 39 classrooms were selected in New Jersey, West Virginia, New Hampshire, and Colorado, and training was provided by RAPYHT staff in procedures for screening, identifying, and assessing talent in young handicapped children.  In addition, presentations and materials disseminated at the replication sites were designed to increase awareness of the RAPYHT Model, and handouts in 20 states and Canada included awareness materials, screening information, talent identification materials, programming manuals, and family involvement materials. Procedures were also developed and tested for dissemination of the RAPYHT Model. Detailed data on program activities and results, including children served by site and workshop. Program evaluation questions and results are presented.

Nineteen children were enrolled in the TRACE Preschool program, and 11 students were enrolled in the Transitional Kindergarten program. Sixteen  preschoolers and five kindergarten children received speech therapy. Monthly parent meetings addressed a variety of topics including children's memory, nutrition, and the family life cycle. Evaluation efforts included administration of the Brigance Inventories to assess children's progress.

Ss completed both the Self-Esteem Inventory for Adults and \"The Way I Feel About Myself\" Self-Concept Scale. Rehabilitation counselors completed behavior rating forms, and Ss were observed during work performance and social interactions. Factor analysis and ethnographic observations identified four groups: elite (who have positive self-concept and maintenance of self-esteem through social conformity); socialites (who frequently use self-aggrandizement to present a highly positive self, which is unstable and vulnerable); loners (who have accurate and balanced self-concept  sustained through self-esteem maintenance strategies based largely on independent judgment); and nonconformers (who are unhappy and lonely, with negative self-concepts and ineffective esteem-building strategies). However, self-report and staff ratings were only weakly related to observed behavior. Results further revealed that the domains represented in self-report and staff rating measures did not reflect Ss' major concerns. (CL)",

The center views career education as a broad developmental process and is responsive to the individual's current developmental stage and experiential background. The development process of the severely physically disabled differs from the person without disabilities. The element of personal responsibility for career choices is an essential ingredient for the disabled person's attainment of personal satisfaction. Three important themes for career education for the severely disabled are self-concept, decision making as it relates to independence, and career awareness needs. It is important to emphasize the strengths of the individual,  although the significant others in the life of the disabled individual may often convey an attitude that the disabled person is sick. The center's kindergarten through eighth grade career education program is infused into the regular school curriculum, while for grades 9 through 12, 10-week group guidance programs are provided. Additional components are a speakers' bureau, business ventures, field trips, work experience, an independent living skills curriculum, and research studies. Various publications and audiovisual materials are also published by the center. (SEW)",

The combination of CBV operation with ongoing academic lessons is noted, and the five steps in the establishment of a CBV are examined: 1) teacher inservice training, 2) interclassroom linkage, 3) CBV planning, 4) sale of products or provision of service, and 5) CBV appraisal. Attention is directed to the following specific aspects of the program: instructing teachers in strategies to  integrate economic, career, and self-awareness activities, as well as skills, within a working experience; developing interrelationships of CBV's within the school; and planning activities (e.g., choosing the business, establishing goals and means to achieve goals, selecting personnel).

        "description":"Sustained attention and inhibitory control of 15 nonhyperactive, learning disabled (LD) boys, 15 hyperactive but not LD boys, and 15 normal boys (11-12 years old) were studied, on teacher ratings of impulse control in the classroom and testing results. Coming to attention, decision making, sustained attention, and attention-concentration were measured by the \"Children's Embedded Figures Test,\"\"Matching Familiar Figures Test,\"\"Children's Checking Task,\" and a subtest of the \"Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised.\" Normal children were found to be superior to both clinical groups in attentional processing, while hyperactive children encountered more errors than their LD peers on those tasks involving sustained attention. The finding that teachers rated hyperactives as  more impulsive than nonhyperactive LD children was interpreted to explain why hyperactives are generally singled out first and identified for specialized treatment. Findings were also interpreted as supporting the \"passive learner\" hypothesis for LD children, which often accounts for their poor academic functioning. (Author/SEW)",

Also examined are programs designed to improve achievement, social-emotional adjustment, and social acceptance of the academically handicapped by their nonhandicapped peers. Studies of placements indicate no consistent benefits of full-time special education on any major outcomes; the research tends to favor full- or part-time regular class placement over full-time special education for the achievement, self-esteem, behavior, and emotional adjustment of the academically handicapped. Differences between full-time regular class placement and part-time regular class placement with  resource help tend to favor well-constructed part-time programs for achievement, but not for social-emotional outcomes.

The ESL curriculum focuses on speaking, listening, reading, and writing; and attempts to integrate ESL English, reading, and speech into comprehensive language development programs. The basic competence program of the ESL curriculum consists of four levels, with three tracks. The levels reflect a progression in language acquisition according to difficulty and complexity. The first track emphasizes an analytical focus on the structure of English. The second track emphasizes listening, speaking, reading, and writing through repetition, dialogues, and other techniques. The third track concentrates on reading. A second program is the bilingual equivalency option, which consists of  English composition, reading, and speech. This option is designed for bilingual students who have basic language competence but require further development in English rhetoric, vocabulary acquisition at the college level, and creative writing. The ESL reading courses were designed to meet the needs of students with limited English ability who were having difficulty in basic reading and study skills courses. For the ESL curriculum, a high priority is placed on scheduling courses that meet student needs. Course descriptions in English and Spanish and a list of tests for each course are appended. (SW)",

It was hypothesized that all students would show progress when pretest and posttest scores were compared and that there would be no significant differences in posttest scores. The groups received either traditional or skills-based reading instruction (Group A, Teacher 1, traditional treatment; Group B, Teacher 1, skills-based treatment; and Group C, Teacher 2, traditional treatment). The hypothesis was partially supported; however, the group that received  skills-based instruction scored significantly higher on the posttest and showed greater progress from pretest to posttest. The results show that a skills-based approach to teaching reading is more effective than a traditional approach.

The effect of test format on vocabulary test scores, and retention of vocabulary words were also explored. In the United States, the two prior knowledge approaches were more effective than the traditional contextual analysis method. In Taiwan, the  traditional method was more effective, a result which may be attributed to the nature of written Chinese. The effects of test format on performance also differed in the two countries, with U.S. children performing better on the contextual analysis assessment format and Taiwanese children not showing differential performance levels. Finally, teaching strategy appeared to influence the degree of word retention in the United States but not in Taiwan. (Author/RW)",

The case for bilingual education rests on the assumption that because children cannot learn in a language they do not understand, they will fall behind academically in programs taught only in that language. Against bilingual education is the argument that, if children are provided less instruction in English, they will achieve less in English academic skills. A large quantity of methodologically sound research on bilingual education refutes both positions. On the one hand, under some conditions both minority and majority students make good progress in programs taught only in the second language, while, on the other hand, the vast majority of bilingual  program evaluations show no relationship between time spent with the majority language and achievement in that language. Research data indicate that first and second language academic skills are interdependent for manifestations of a common underlying proficiency. Poor school performance of minority group children may be linked to ambivalence or hostility toward the majority culture group and negative feelings about the minority language and culture. Effective bilingual programs can validate minority children's language and cultural backgrounds while reducing ambivalence toward the majority language and culture. (SW)",

The six models presented are ESL for survival, literacy, basic skills, general vocational, occupation-specific, and home management.  (RW)",

        "description":"Dialogue journals are discussed as a valuable component in developing writing and reading competence in both first and second language classes. A simple way for students to carry on a private written conversation with their teachers, journals may be written in daily or weekly for the entire year or course. Both student and teacher agree to write back and forth in a bound composition book about topics of interest to each of them. Not only is the teacher no longer responsible for thinking up topics for writing, but it has been found that the topics include a wide range of academic, interpersonal, and personal concerns. Both students and teacher are free to use the full range of language functions characteristic of face-to-face conversation, including questions, complaints,  promises, denials, and apologies. It is suggested that although dialogue journals involve written language, the content and structure of this kind of discourse is more like face-to-face communication than like traditional school essays or reading texts. Examples of journal entries from children and adults studying English as a second language and from deaf students studying English are included. (NCR)",

        "description":"Recent research in adult pronunciation of foreign languages has assigned a significant role to affective variables. It has been shown that certain language functions, including many aspects of pronunciation, are handled by the right brain hemisphere. An experiment was conducted to study the extent to which the right hemisphere might be activated during the task of listening to and pronouncing tone language sounds. The strategy employed was to study the effect of the pronunciation task on reaction time to light in the right or left visual field. The subjects, 12 male and 12 female right-handed university students enrolled in an elementary French course, attended three sessions. During the first two sessions they responded to light stimuli and heard and repeated Thai phrases.  Reaction times to the stimuli, while listening to or repeating phrases, were measured and recorded. During the third session subjects repeated French sentences and had their eye movements assessed. Analysis of the results shows a correlation between the measure of hemisphere efficiency and approximation of native-like pronunciation. The conclusion is drawn that it is possible to associate &quot;affective variables&quot; with a specific neuroanatomical structure, and that right hemispheric activity will predict the quality of pronunciation in a foreign language.

This guide is divided into three components. The first component helps the student to understand the relationship of science to careers in health by (1) discussing the role of chromosomes in our genetic makeup and the professionals who work in the field, (2) contrasting inherited and acquired characteristics, and (3) describing how the scientific principles of inherited characteristics are used by health workers. In the second component, students can examine the effects of soil erosion, weathering,  and flooding through narratives about the activities of workers in agriculture and natural resources. The third component details those professions that are directly related to the environment. The activities in each of the components reinforce the student's skills in processes such as classifying, interpreting data, and controlling variables. Each activity contains an objective, key words, and a listing of materials needed to complete the learning experience. Simple experiments that students can perform have been included when applicable. In addition, the teacher is provided with a step-by-step outline of suggestions on how to implement the activity. An optional section in each component entitled \"Home and Community\" provides projects for extending the skills and knowledge gained to  those areas. (NCR)",

        "description":"This paper examines the referential strategies used by Japanese children and adults in two story telling tasks focusing upon the following discourse contexts: (1) first mentions of story characters, (2) references in subject position to the same character, and (3) references to another character. The subjects, 60 children and 10 adults, were interviewed and asked to tell the story of a set of cartoons and a 7-minute color videotape. The children differentiated the three discourse contexts, although not as strongly as the adults. Both children and adults used nominal reference for first mentions of story characters. Developmental trends showed up especially in the contexts calling for explicit nominal reference, first mentions, and switch subjects. In the children's narratives, a  less frequent use of nominal first references was found in the three younger groups. Examination of the data leads to the conclusion that differences in children's referential choices can be understood by considering the nature of the context and the child's relationship to the referent in each case. It would seem that their referential choices are based on their own relationship to the referent, that they ignore the listener's needs, and that they master the skill of introducing referents recalled from memory during their fourth year.

        "description":"Extensive longitudinal data were gathered on a child's entry into the symbolically mediated modal world by examining changes in the semantics and pragmatics of her uses of modal auxiliary verbs. The data are 53 transcripts of natural conversations between a girl, Nina, and her mother recorded periodically from her 23rd month to her 39th month. The focus is on 1,826 modal expressions she produced. The three major analyses used were a semantic analysis, conversational act analysis to ask what she is doing when she uses a modal, and a third analysis to ascertain what worlds her modal utterances referred to. The modalities fall into three categories: (1) the dynamic, or logic of factual conditions for action; (2) the deontic, or the normative conditions; and (3) the epistemic, or  logic of knowledge or belief claims. Nina's first modals were produced at age 2 years, 2 months. Her overall modal production increased in each of the 4-month periods, along with a steady increase in the number of different forms. The overall analysis shows that Nina used modals more frequently to initiate than to respond to turns of talk. By her use of modals, she formulates and communicates plans, structures and enriches the world of pretend play she creates, and coordinates and shares her meaningful actions with others. (AMH)",

This paper reports part of the study, a comparison of two high school freshman subjects. The task was to insert 10 rods in a board and to determine why some of the rods bent more easily than others. Each subject participated in the task with the experimenter and then was asked to explain the task to a person who had not been present for the task. While both subjects met the non-verbal criteria of the task, major differences appeared in the verbal behavior. The NLD subject used connectives; the LD subject either used no connectives  or used only &quot;and&quot; and &quot;then.&quot; With regard to the choice of content, the NLD subject produced a text consistent with an explanatory format, while the LD subject produced a narrative text. Because the LD subject was able to generalize in the non-verbal situation, it could be concluded that the problem lies in the expression of generalizations and a lack of text-structuring devices, not in the lack of the ability to generalize nor in the lack of formal-operations skills.

The analysis is based on the three issues of adaptation, conflict, and change, and the case study is designed to test how well past social theories fit the reality of a new university in a Melanesian environment, which is characterized by oral transmission of culture, an agricultural economy (until recently), and its history as a colony. The establishment of the University, difficulties with the Australian Department of Territories, early university leaders, and various kinds of struggles are described. Additional considerations include: the contribution of staff to the  educational and political life of the colony and new nation, problems facing new students, social problems arising from bringing together sometimes antagonistic people, and the special problems of the small minority of women on campus. Finally, the complex organization of the university and the external environment are examined, including the challenge of reconciling the problems of local relevance with the demands of international standards of scholarship. The methodological and theoretical frameworks for the analysis are also discussed. (SW)",

In this model, the presence of an audience or coactors is considered to be a source of arousal that can either enhance or impair performance depending on the performer's evaluation apprehension and the task being performed. The hypotheses are as follows: (1) the greater the amount of contact with whites, the greater will be the facilitation effect; (2) social facilitation will enhance performance at higher academic rank and impair performances at lower academic ranks; (3) as academic rank increases, social facilitation effects will increase; and (4) social  facilitation effects will not occur as a function of contact with blacks. It was found that as the amount of contact with whites increased, the productivity of black full and assistant professors (but not associate professors) was affected, but only if the black faculty could be provided a positive or negative outcome. In addition, contact with blacks did not affect productivity, which suggests that the black audience had less evaluative potential. (SW)",

        "description":"A criterion for selecting sources of evidence to evaluate effective teaching is described. It is suggested that teaching effectiveness is not measured solely in terms of cognitive change in students but in the extent to which academics practice teaching in accordance with the moral dictates of the profession. In developing a teacher effectiveness evaluation criterion, it is important that judgments be as objective and fair as possible, even though the selection of attributes of teacher effectiveness necessary reflects the biases of the evaluator. It is argued that there is no rationale for soliciting student responses as a measure of effective teaching, since a person who knows nothing about a specific set of skills and information as well as the larger discipline is in no  position to comment on the academic merit of students' acquired knowledge of such materials from a given teacher. On the other hand, by examining student examinations, discipline specialists are in a position to make an educated guess about the extent of student learning resulting from course participation. Other faculty members are also good sources of judgment about the sufficiency of topics covered in the course. It is unlikely that students can make informed judgments about whether an instructor has effectively taught in a morally responsible way. (SW)",

The initial approach was to use a laboratory simulation of a university classroom to explore the following: (1) whether it is possible to induce feelings of helplessness in a university classroom; (2) effects that feelings of helplessness might have on student achievement and attributions; and (3) effects that teacher's behavior might have on students who are feeling helpless. The experiments revealed that students' perception of control and certain teaching behaviors affected student outcomes. Sometimes teaching behaviors reduced students' bad feelings about perceived lack of control. A second research phase focused on students' perception of control in actual  classroom situations. A questionnaire measured students' responsibility for their academic achievement, their attributions about success and failures, and certain classroom behaviors. Most students felt they had control of their academic performance; however, up to 10 percent had perceptions of little or no control. The latter group spent less time studying, attended fewer classes, and felt it was not important to do well academically. Questionnaire items and response data are included. (SW)",

Borkowski entitled, &quot;A House Divided: Indiana University-Purdue University at Fort Wayne.&quot; According to Borkowski, it seemed logical in the early 1960's to place both regional campuses on one campus to share facilities. Each university remained distinct but the duplication of services and overlapping programs were decreased. Verbatim accounts concerning the perceived role of the regional  campus are presented by five Fort Wayne faculty members and administrators (Frank Kenworthy, Jack Ulmer, Arthur Keller, Jeannette Clausen, and George Dillon), one Indiana Vocational Technical College dean (Merle Donica), and two Ball State University administrators (Joseph Rawlings and John Craddock).

Of 538 graduates mailed a questionnaire, 172 responded. Findings include the following: 65 percent were either working full-time, part-time, or were enrolled full-time in a graduate social work program; 11 percent had not obtained a social work position; most graduates were employed by agencies in urban areas and most worked for public agencies; most worked in Iowa; most were providing direct client services, while 30 percent were supervisors, coordinators,  directors, and in other indirect service positions; males earned $18,032, while females earned $16,842; most were satisfied with their current position, and only 13 percent were dissatisfied; 60 percent believed they were well prepared for entry into social work, and 20 percent thought they were poorly or very poorly prepared; and 22 percent had earned an MSW or were enrolled in graduate studies.

        "description":"The extent to which student financial aid has changed the composition of young people attending and planning to attend college is considered. The income redistribution policies of the 1960s and 1970s included rapid expansion of federal financial aid programs and reflected a shift from the goal of promoting economic efficiency and faster economic growth to the goal of providing greater equity. Data from the annual Current Population Surveys show that little or no change occurred in the ratio of college enrollment rates for youth from families with income below the median relative to youth from families with above-median incomes. Additionally, data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 show no real changes in college attendance plans of high school  seniors, after controlling for socioeconomic status and ability. It is concluded that student financial aid programs substituted public for private funds, thus reducing the burden of educational costs to college students and their parents. They did relatively little, however, to induce more youth from lower income families to attend college and they impeded economic growth by sacrificing economic efficiency. The major student financial aid programs, their rationale, and expected effects are reviewed. (SW)",

In mid-1982, over 40 computer search organizations had been identified. A survey of the organizations found that almost all were private-for-profit firms. Only four of the respondents that offer a direct service to students maintain their own database. Most of the others utilize the database of Academic Guidance Services, an organization that has a database of about 3,800 sources, but which does not offer a service directly to students. Based on a review of the survey findings, the committee made observations regarding the following: advertising, fees and refund policies, quantity and quality of the database, quality of information, and inclusion of federal/state sources.  The committee noted that the following three postsecondary institutions utilize computer searching to provide information about outside resources to their students: The University of California, Los Angeles; The University of Santa Clara; and California Lutheran College. The committee recommended that funds be provided to prepare an annual, updated compendium of private student aid sources that can be distributed to all schools in California.

The college core curriculum at Banning, which serves a predominantly low-income, ethnic minority population, is designed to improve the academic performance and college persistence of graduates. It was found that approximately one-third of the school's students enroll in this curriculum and that, in comparison to their 1976 college-bound counterparts, the first graduating class of the curriculum took considerably more of the courses required for admission to the University of California, particularly in mathematics and English.  Additional findings include: more graduates of the program attended four-year institutions, particularly the State University, compared to the college-going members of the class of 1976; the proportion of the entire graduating class attending college has increased; and 1980 graduates of the program performed better at the University of California during their first year than did 1976 graduates, and considerably better than their 1980 non-college core curriculum counterparts.

It is suggested AAUP would not likely censor an institution that chose to restrain heretical opinions, although this position conflicts with AAUP's strong support for open academic inquiry. The 1965-1967 Kilgore committee members appeared to prefer an option that was not being considered: the elimination of a religious restraint clause. Currently, professors of religion in church-related colleges and universities face the following unresolved questions: (1) should church-related colleges and universities have the right to restrain a professor's challenge to the church's doctrines? (2) If a college announced its  policy of restraint of nonconforming opinions at the time a professor was hired, would the AAUP censor the college administration if it moved through proper channels to terminate a subsequent expression of nonconformity? Since 1950 AAUP has not spoken in support of the restraint clause, but has also failed to repudiate it. (SW)",

The program, an interdisciplinary student-centered introduction to general education, is composed of two parts that the student takes concurrently: (1) a year-long seminar in thought and expression, and (2) a sequence of four (usually 7-week) courses in particular disciplines. Both parts concern the relation of the individual to the community, specifically the city. At the core of the program is the belief that general education leads to interaction with others in a way that is both critical and creative. The program is structured around four modes of inquiry: observing and describing, making or breaking patterns, making judgments, and stating and solving problems. Students select  courses from different disciplines for the first three modes, and participate in a problem-solving seminar for the fourth mode. The program was built through voluntary partnerships between faculty members from different departments who were interested in a common topic. Faculty were provided released time to become students in the partner's course and to jointly prepare syllabi and instructional approaches. (SW)",

The program is designed to orient students to campus life and provide exposure to campus facilities, faculty, administration, and other students. The literature suggests that orientation programs can facilitate student adjustment and may use the following successful techniques: information sessions, open houses, developmental courses, entertainment programming, social activities, slide and videotape presentations, and small-group experiences. A 1982 survey of 588 incoming freshmen following the orientation program revealed the following major concerns: getting involved in campus life, developing effective  study and test-taking techniques, and writing effective term papers. York College faculty, administrators, and student leaders participated in program planning, formal course presentations, and social events. An additional evaluation revealed that new students valued the developmental seminars, social activities, campus service presentations, and meeting students and staff. An orientation program schedule and data on attrition among program participants are included. (SW)",

The strengths and weakness of several approaches to data collection are assessed using the following criteria: institutional burden, taxpayer cost, timeliness of data, and data quality. It is recommended that surveys like the Higher Education General Information Survey of postsecondary education personnel be continued and strengthened, with timely data reporting. A second approach to future data  collection, longitudinal analysis of cohorts of faculty and nonfaculty personnel, is also proposed. These cohorts would be followed up on a 4-year cycle with the thrust of each survey varying somewhat from year to year. A third recommended approach would involve a series of one-time surveys on timely topics with quick turnaround time.

Declining enrollments and financial problems have necessitated determining what courses/programs will be offered at which institutions. At the freshman and sophomore level, states usually require that community colleges and lower-division branch campuses offer curricula articulated with those in the first 2 years of senior colleges and universities. In most states, curriculum proposals are initiated on campus (in a department, division, or college); the proposal then goes to a university coordinating office for review before being sent to a state-level approval body. Degree programs may be identified as appropriate (or inappropriate) for a given institution on  the basis of that institution's mission, history, or special designation. Attempts to control program duplication are even more pronounced at the graduate level. Factors that work against state-level planning include: intrastate regionalism, institutional resistance to change, geographic dispersion of institutions, alumni and legislative political pressure, and faculty resistance.

Government involvement in American higher education is traced historically, showing that until recently the oversight function was limited to institutional licensure and statewide planning and coordination. However, accreditation as an indicator of quality has come under strong criticism, and some states have more actively attempted to determine whether institutions are providing quality education. Increased government involvement in academic affairs has also been controversial. In order for higher education institutions to ensure quality control, an  effective program assessment is needed that includes both a process and an outcome orientation. Broad participation of college staff in the self-study of academic program quality is needed, along with analysis of the following factors: program goals, organization, facilities, faculty, students, academic program issues, research, public service, and future plans.

Four of the 11 projects did not have objectives concerning student retention rates or academic achievement. Although a primary means of assessing project performance is site visits, in  fiscal year 1980, ED visited only 24 of the 557 grantees.

The methodology was based on normalization of the number of credits that a unit is authorized to offer. For a typical degree program structure, the analytical scheme consisted of the following five steps: description of basic data, normalization of credit offerings, reduction of credits and full-time equivalents, verification of teaching resources vs. normalization, and recommendations. Information is provided on teaching resources, degree programs and their structures, and productivity factors related to instructional data. Attention was also directed to how the parameters used in the  reduction formula related to one another and to other variables describing departmental teaching activities and how the level of proposed reduction related to these indicators of activities and resources. A second analysis of the reduction pattern determined whether a substantial reorganization of teaching had been occurring among units and across disciplinary lines. (SW)",

Most of the applications described were focused in rural Vermont, although two involved participants in other states. Discussions of activities in Vermont using audio conferencing, personal computers, and computer conferencing, include a description of Vermont Telecommunications Incorporated, which was created after the completion of  the project to promote telecommunications technology for the developmentally disabled and those with other handicapping conditions. A section on national activities describes an electronic mail network and several telecommunications consultation projects. Overall project conclusions and policy recommendations for human service funding agencies conclude the report. Eight appendices include data collection instruments and specific data collection results. (LMM)",

Results identified 60 subject areas which met operationally defined conditions for overuse, and ranked them in order of need for strengthening with new titles. A high denial-to-booking ratio was found in 74 subjects, in which no more than 75 percent of the requests were filled, and 22 subject areas met conditions for underuse. The intended use of this information was to assist management in deciding in which subject areas to concentrate acquisitions and weeding efforts, in order to  have the greatest impact on overall collection quality.

Subjects were 135 volunteers from College of Education courses at the University of Central Florida, ranging in age from 18-52. Lowenfeld's Table Segment of the Test of Subjective Impressions was administered to identify students as haptic, visual, or indefinite in cognitive style, and the Successive Perception Test I (United States Army Corps, 1944) was administered to test ability to synthesize parts into a whole. Perceptual type was determined by a combination of scores  from the two tests. The screening process, however, did not produce a characteristic spread of perceptual types. Because of an unexpectedly small distribution of visuals (31%) and haptics (5%) in the sample population, there were not enough haptic subjects to assign randomly to each research design cell. Quantitative data were not obtained to permit statistical tests of significance for the hypotheses. An extensive literature review and a 42-item bibliography are included. (LMM)",

Effects of program pacing were also studied. Multiple programs, differing in content, were developed for each of four design cells (high/low pace by high/low continuity). Participants were 160 children divided into two age groups (kindergarten/first and third/fourth grades). Visual fixation of the television monitor was recorded during viewing of two programs in same-sex pairs, and children were then tested individually for comprehension and recall of both programs, using a non-verbal procedure requiring the child to  order five still photographs from the program and five from a single segment. Control scores were obtained by having children order photos from one program which they had not viewed. Results indicated that the integrated stories can be effectively used to promote both attention and comprehension at an early age, because children clearly responded to and used the organizational structure provided by television stories even when the stories were low pace. Twelve references, and tables showing study design and attention and comprehension data are included. (LMM)",

        "description":"This paper described a set of computer programs designed to assist the development of instructional programs utilizing a microcomputer-controlled videodisc player. The hardware and software systems and instructional programs were developed by the staff of the Interactive Videodisc for Special Education Technology Project (IVSET) at Utah State University. The criteria and description of the system design are presented, and the production elements that must occur prior to using the system are briefly described before use of the authoring system is explained. The second part of the paper describes the field test of the system conducted at the Utah State Training School in American Fork to (1) test the utility, effectiveness, and appropriateness of programs on time telling,  identification of coins, and functional words for severely mentally handicapped students; (2) test the reliability of the hardware and computer programs; and (3) collect data for an analysis of the instructional sequencing. Results from a resource room field test conducted to obtain data concerning teacher use of the system are also presented. Specific and general conclusions drawn from both studies indicate that the system is an effective instructional agent for mentally retarded and learning disabled students. (LMM)",

The machine was chosen for its price, availability, and compatibility with machines already in Maine's schools. It is used for mailing list management (with pre-packaged SCRIPSIT and PENCIL/PAL software); serials check-in (with PROFILE); production of printed book catalogs and union lists of serials (with SCRIPSIT); compilation of statistics (with VISICALC); and typing invoices (with an in-house program). Customized software has been written in-house to enhance many of the pre-packaged programs. The report notes that word processing is the single most important library application for  microcomputers. Sample records, forms, and lists generated on the TRS-80 are presented, including for the sake of comparison, serials records produced with both pre-packaged and customized software. Also shown are copies of customized programs which enable the Maine State Library to print serials records, search their large print catalog for new titles, list the holdings of a single library from a union list of serials, and produce invoices covering online searching on the part of member libraries of the Maine Online Consortium.

After emphasizing the magnitude of the education and training industry, the paper explains that in the 1970's, educational institutions began adopting the concept of strategic planning to meet changing external demands. The next section examines the current transformation from a material-producing to an information-producing society, citing the impact of computerization on business and post-secondary education. Next, the components of the R&D dissemination network useful to occupational education is examined.  A model is then presented for utilizing R&D products in strategic planning and human resource development (HRD). Important elements of strategic planning are identified as assessing opportunities and threats in the external environment, auditing the strengths and weaknesses of the organization's internal environment, and matching strengths with opportunities. Finally, the use of R&D products in pursuing the strategic options of improving program quality, meeting the needs of the new student clientele, participating in economic development and technology transfer, and undertaking comprehensive planning is emphasized, and examples are provided.

        "description":"Delaware County College's (DCC's) computer service technology program is described in this paper, along with job market needs for computer personnel in Delaware County and nationwide. First, the type of work performed by computer service technicians and the areas in which they are employed are outlined. Next, the objectives of DCC's program are identified, i.e., enabling students to: (1) diagnose and solve systems problems; (2) diagnose and troubleshoot hardware and software problems; (3) differentiate between hardware and software problems; (4) construct hardware prototype systems; (5) generate software; (6) analyze signal flow on a systems level; (7) perform system calibration and testing; and (8) interface terminals and peripherals with computer systems. Then, a brief analysis  of the national computer service job market projects an increase from 83,000 to 160,000 jobs in the next decade; an overview of local salaries reveals them to range between $13,000 and $17,000; and comments from local employers indicate a substantial and growing demand for computer personnel. Next, lists are provided of potential employers in the Delaware Valley area; the members of the Computer Service Technology Advisory Committee; and the courses offered and credits available in DCC's four-semester program. After the needs addressed by the program, the constraints on its establishment, and program and capital costs are specified, enrollment projections and advertising methods are discussed. (HB)",

        "description":"The founders of General College, at the University of Minnesota, established the school in 1932 out of a belief in democratic access to higher education, the need to simplify the academic bureaucracy, and the desire for a liberalized curriculum. During its first 13 years, the college assumed and maintained three basic priorities: open admissions, research into student characteristics, and a student- and life-centered curriculum, based in part on the Stephens College for Women model and further developed through foundation-sponsored institutional research. Largely attributable to the skill of Deans Horace T. Morse and Alfred L. Vaughan, between 1945 and 1965, the college gained stability and acceptance, as witnessed by rising enrollments, a steadily declining proportion of  borrowed faculty, and administrative independence from the University in 1951. In the 1960s and 1970s, student protests and President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society Program did alter the college's direction, through programs such as Upward Bound and Head Start, though the college had already been tracing the educational path recommended by national studies during this period. Since 1975, in spite of diminished resources, the college has responded to current student needs and maintained its emphasis on educational evaluation. Throughout its 50-year history, policies relating to continuous student research, flexible curricula, individualized degree programs, centralized personnel services, effective teaching, and student-centered programs have helped the college remain faithful to its  founding doctrines.

        "description":"With the military's requirements for high-quality recruits expected to increase over the next decade, a study was conducted to evaluate the recruiting potential of two-year post-secondary institutions. Specifically, the study sought to ascertain the characteristics of two-year colleges, whether sufficient numbers of potential recruits existed in these institutions for fruitful recruitment, the degree to which these students met enlistment standards, the penetrability of the market, the value of previous recruits, and research needed for the development of successful recruitment policies. A review of the literature on higher education and military recruiting from this market, as well as analyses of data from the Defense Manpower Data Center and from three large-scale surveys of  youth, revealed that: (1) over 1 million male two-year college students were estimated to fall within recruitment ages; (2) this market had not been substantially penetrated, as less than 4% of all 1981 recruits without prior military experience had 1 or 2 years of college, and less than 1% of the two-year college class of 1981 were considering a military career option; (3) the instability of two-year college students' educational and career goals indicated that with the right recruitment incentives and strategies the market could be penetrated; and (4) recruits with prior college experience had lower attrition rates than non-college recruits. Recommendations for further study are included. (DAB)",

        "description":"In order to determine which kind of mathematics program would produce the best results for kindergarten children, three programs from different theoretical perspectives were developed. The first program, behavioristic in focus, made use of texts, worksheets, and seatwork. The second, cognitive-developmental in outlook, stressed conceptualization of numbers and number systems through manipulatives, games, puzzles, simulations, field trips, and the frequent use of three-dimensional objects. The third program, labeled &quot;eclectic,&quot; included total group responses, high structure, and much repetition; activities included both textbook seatwork and some worksheets, along with games and simulations. A total of 96 children from six public kindergarten classes in three elementary schools in  Fairbanks, Alaska, participated in the study. Children were pretested with the Metropolitan Readiness Test. The Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, Level A, was administered as a posttest. Results revealed that the cognitive-developmental approach yielded significantly higher achievement in mathematics than either of the other approaches. The mean score for children in the behavioristic group was higher than that of the eclectic group, but the difference was not significant, nor were any sex-by-treatment interactions found. These results are considered remarkable in view of the fact that the children in the behavioristic program scored significantly higher before treatment and that twice as many adult instructors were present in this program as were present in either of the other two  approaches.

        "description":"The major portion of this presentation describes research results and policy implications of the Family Matters Project, a longitudinal study of social contexts as they affect children and families during the period of transition from home to school. Also provided in this portion are highlights of what was learned from delivering to 160 families (varying in ethnicity, income level, and family structure) a parental empowerment program involving home visiting and neighborhood cluster building. The remaining part of the paper describes participating families' feelings about conditions since the 1980 Presidential election and traces present and anticipated developments in the Family Matters Program. Reported results focus on mothers' perceptions of their children, stresses on working  parents, the influence of social networks on the lives of parents and children, the neighborhood as a context for childrearing, and the transition of the child from home to school. Policy recommendations center on changing the workplace to reduce stresses on parents, the importance of opportunities for parents to make friends, and ways of neutralizing constraining forces of neighborhoods while mobilizing their enabling forces. In addition, a new philosophy for the provision of support to families, growing out of the Family Matters Project, is described. Throughout the presentation, effects of income on families are emphasized. (RH)",

A total of 60 two-parent families with communication-handicapped preschoolers composed the experimental group; 60 families without communication-handicapped children participated as the control group. Three classes of assessment instruments were used to collect data from each family: (1) parent questionnaires and interviews, (2) child assessments and screening tests, and (3) observations of parent/child interactions. It was hypothesized that parental practices would be directly  related to parents' beliefs about child development processes and about their own child's cognitive competence.

These questions are (1) What skills do we want to nurture in children? and (2) How do we accomplish these objectives? The text begins with an explanation of a social/cognitive model that puts emphasis on forming ideas, using intuition, and solving problems. This approach is then applied to five general personal/social areas: body and sensory awareness, emotions, friendship and affiliation, conflict and cooperation, and kindness. Suggested classroom activities, ideas for improving relationships, and references are identified for each of these five skill clusters. In  addition, suggestions for learning activities concerning \"self-studies\" and \"child studies\" are distributed throughout the text to encourage readers to relate materials to themselves as well as to the children they work with or observe. All together, more than 150 learning activities are provided, 111 of which are for children. Activities for children state purpose, indicate setting and materials, describe the activity, and provide additional suggestions for effective implementation. (RH)",

While some newsletters were written for teen and low-income parents, most were directed toward middle-class, married, fairly well-educated parents. Those who managed extension programs saw the distribution of newsletters as a cost-effective way to reach otherwise  unreachable families with timely and valuable parenting and child development information. Additional related data were gathered through evaluations of three parent information series produced in Iowa, California, and Arizona.

The breakdown of subject groups was as follows: 23 children of schizophrenics; 43 children of unipolar depressives; 38 children of bipolar disordered; and 53 children of normal parents, who served as controls. Speech samples describing five Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) cards were collected. A cognitive task was then administered; the two conditions of this task included &quot;Type 1&quot; items, which were solvable solely on the basis of associative strength, and &quot;Type 2&quot; items, which were constructed so  that the incorrect alternative response was a higher associate of the referent than the correct alternative. Two-way ANOVA's with Age and Parental Diagnosis were computed for each dependent variable. Newman-Keuls tests indicated that children of schizophrenics produced more unclear and ambiguous references than children of unipolar depressives and bipolar disordered parents. In turn, children in the last two groups produced more unclear and ambiguous references than children of normal parents. Children of schizophrenics also produced fewer explicit verbal references than all other children. Results are perceived as being important in terms of the need to actually assess speech performance before making statements about communication competence from cognitive task performance.  (RH)",

        "description":"In response to the increasing use of computers in school by young children, this paper provides definitions of concepts and discussions of topics related to computers and young children. The first section takes up the issue of computer literacy, describing various uses of the term and discussing the controversy concerning teaching computer literacy in schools. The second section examines two aspects of microcomputer experiences for young children: effects of microcomputers on children and computer applications for young children. Diverse applications briefly discussed include computer literacy, computer assisted instruction, computer programming, computer art, word processing, and administrative uses. Thought to be of particular interest to those involved with young children are  the in-depth discussions of computer assisted instruction, computer programming, and word processing. Specifically, general features of drill and practice, educational games, simulations, and tutorials are pointed out in the subsection on computer assisted instruction. The Logo computer language for young children is described in the subsection on programming, and the use of word processing to promote language development is discussed in the final subsection. In conclusion, two brief discussions are devoted to issues of training educators in the use of computers and to the need for active involvement of early childhood educators in integrating computer use into the curriculum.

Procedures in conducting the study included: identifying 7 to 10 school districts to cooperatively participate; gathering information on enrollment of Indian girls in various mathematics courses offered by districts; acquiring information on the performance of Indian girls in mathematics courses; analyzing existing data, including the Minnesota School Affect Assessment, to determine attitudes of Indian girls towards mathematics; and surveying cooperating school districts and Indian parent groups about  special programs assisting Indian girls with mathematics. Results of data analysis revealed: cooperating school districts lacked complete consistency in determining Indian students; a higher dropout rate among Indian students; a drop in math enrollment at the senior high level (100% for grades 7-9 to 33% for grades 10-12) due to lack of state requirements and school district policies which make mathematics courses elective; a need for special programs designed to encourage more students to enroll in advanced mathematics courses; and Indian females were proportionately underrepresented in math classes.

The first three sections are listed alphabetically by source showing the vast amount of materials being developed by Indian tribal groups and organizations. Each notation includes the title of the resource, author(s), year of publication (1970-1982), brief description, language written in (if applicable), number of pages, and grade level. For easier referencing, the contents of the bibliography are indexed in three ways: regional, audio/visual, and bibliography. The regional index lists printed materials contained in the curriculum, resource and periodical sections alphabetically by  title, noting page number, grade level, and subject area (arts/crafts, bilingual, career education, extra curricular, language arts, math/science, social studies) or resource applicability (curriculum development aid, resource reference, reversing stereotyping/bias in textbooks). The audio/visual index provides a title listing of cassette tapes, records, films, slides and videotapes available and appropriate for classroom use. A list of curriculum resource personnel concludes the document. (ERB)",

        "description":"Exploring the revival of interest in smaller schools, the fastback examines the legacy of the small school, the minimum school size, the advantages and disadvantages of smaller schools, the needs of smaller schools, and some important indicators and trends of what is actually likely to happen in small schools. In discussing the advantages and disadvantages of smaller schools, arguments are grouped into six areas: community relationships and control, finance, administration, teachers, students, and curriculum and instruction. The intent in discussing the disadvantages of smaller schools is to identify ways to alleviate or overcome problems brought about by smallness. In considering what is needed to improve small schools and rural education, the fastback provides suggestions  concerning student needs, finance, community values, curriculum and instruction, personnel, and policy control. Some important social indicators and trends that have implications for smaller schools are examined. Five guidelines, based on both theory and experience, suggest ways that leaders can bring about change to improve the educational program in small or rural schools. (NQA)",

A response and return rate of 79% (642, 132-item questionnaires returned), of which 244 of the rural schools had less than 300 students and 398 had in excess of 300.

Concluding the report is a list of 18 findings that would be of interest to teacher educators in the preparation of teachers for rural America, i.e., teacher preparation programs should provide field experiences in rural schools, the mean beginning salary for teachers was $12,375 and overall average salary was $16,139, during the past year 81.9% hired no new teachers due to an increase in students, and teachers averaged three subject preparations.

Students were asked what types of jobs they saw as desirable, what their occupational and educational aspirations were, and what types of rewards they wanted from work. There were no significant differences between Eskimo and white samples in aspirations for post-secondary education. There were differences between Eskimo and white subjects in patterns they followed in pursuing higher education; nearly 1/3 of the Eskimo sample planned to spend time in their home villages before going to college while white students preferred to go straight to college. Both groups chose  professional occupations as the &quot;best&quot; kinds of jobs and unskilled, blue-collar occupations as the least desirable. Eskimo subjects were just as likely to want permanent, year-round, full-time jobs as were urban whites. The assumption that Eskimo students are less interested in a college education or in preparing for professional, technical, or managerial careers was not supported. While there seemed to be differences in the kinds of rewards rural Eskimo and urban white students seek from jobs, similarities clearly outweighed differences. (BRR)",

        "description":"The Chevak Village Youth Association (CVYA) was developed in a rural Eskimo village (population 520) both to educate youth and to integrate them into functional roles in the community. CVYA is an entirely indigenous youth organization, created and managed by the youth and young adults of the village. It has evolved, in part, as a response to the problems of youth in the village. Until the Hootch Decree in 1976, adolescents left villages during their teenage years to attend boarding schools either in Alaska or in the Lower 48. With the creation of village high schools, communities had to understand and relate to a group of adolescents who had previously gone through adolescence largely at a distance. In addition, the upheavals which have beset Eskimo communities have particularly  affected youth who seem to be lost in both the old world which is passing and the new one just coming into being. Functions of CVYA activities are social and/or recreational, economic, community service, and educational; CVYA also encourages participation in organizing and facilitating activities. Involvement in CVYA builds on traditional Eskimo ways to facilitate skill transmission, express character ideas, and provide role models. Six tables summarize the narrative information. (BRR)",

Eighth grade classes at both schools were targeted for the study. To gauge any shifts in students toward Native Americans after having taken the course, a pre- and post-test instrument was administered to 127 students at the ADHUS and Boca Raton Academy. Questions were formulated and paired to elicit student responses to five major issues in contemporary Native  American life, such as freedom of Native Americans to live where they please, rights and responsibilities of citizenship, stereotypes of Native Americans, etc. Faculty and staff conclusions and recommendations included the following: the data on attitude shifts were inconsistent and not always in the direction expected; the subject matter depicting both historical and contemporary Indian life styles in Florida was of high interest to middle school youth; and the question remained, what is the appropriate position for the Indian cultures course within the social studies curriculum.

        "description":"In designing inservice teacher training activities, it is necessary to apply educational principles and teaching and learning techniques which are suitable for adult education programs. Four models for designing inservice teacher training programs are the Malcom Knowles Model, the Leonard Nadler Model, the Cyril O. Houle Model, and the William R. Tracey Model. Emphasizing a process that takes into account the learner participation in organizing the training activity, the Knowles Model consists of seven steps. Based on the &quot;critical events&quot; of a training process, the Nadler Model focuses on the type of work which should be done by an individual. A fundamental characteristic of this model is that evaluation occurs at each step of the process. Including seven sequential points of  decision-making, the Houle Model involves the first point reacting to the last point. Utilizing the &quot;systems approach,&quot; the Tracey Model consists of 15 steps grouped into 3 categories: system needs, development, and validity. These four models are briefly described and illustrated with a diagram. For a more detailed description of each model, a bibliographic reference is provided. (Author/NQA)",

        "description":"Everyone concerned with educational systems performance agrees that the improvement of teaching qualities is a high priority in any educational effort. Teachers are assigned the role of change agents and are presented with new challenges, e.g., to make education global and permanent, flexible enough to serve in any environment (in or out of the classroom) for life, and reflective of the community. Teachers have to learn to adapt creatively to changes in science and technology and to prepare generations who are universal, critical, and creative and who have firm identities with their sociocultural background. However, a realistic approach to inservice teacher training should consider that teachers are ordinary human beings with their virtues, defects, duties, and rights. Providing  some reflections on inservice teacher training, this paper discusses the rationale for and gives a definition of inservice teacher training. Some characteristics of managers in charge of teacher training programs, the criteria for evaluating the qualities of a training program, and some considerations on suitable methods for teacher training are also provided. A diagram of a learning model based on experience and a chart of 16 steps for learning to learn are included. (NQA)",

        "description":"Textbooks and other printed materials will be ever present, in the foreseeable future, as major aids for teaching and learning processes. New textbooks imply new guidelines for teachers, and the ways to handle such guidelines demand teacher training. This paper explains some links between inservice teacher training programs and the development of textbooks. Some basic points related to the production of textbooks include the following: (1) teachers' opinions (at least a sample of teachers) should be consulted in order to design or develop textbooks; (2) the development of textbooks should be adequate and relevant to the local needs; (3) curriculum innovations may fail if textbooks or their respective guidelines are not fully understood by their users, both teachers and pupils;  and (4) any mistake or misconception in designing a textbook will have a multiplicative effect, which is why those in charge of designing textbooks must act with a high sense of social responsibility. The paper concludes with a discussion of some concepts and methodolgies of program evaluation and curriculum development as they relate to inservice teacher training. (Author/NQA)",

This paper outlines some ideas about the subject of inservice teacher training as a priority of educational systems in Latin American and Caribbean countries. The most frequent educational problems and the linkage that should exist between the educational systems and the national development efforts are briefly discussed. The technical guidelines for projects presented within the context of the Regional Program of Educational Development (PREDE), a program supported and implemented by the Organization of American States, are noted. Among PREDE's objectives are to: improve the quality of education, expand the  educational systems, make basic education universal, revise curriculums, improve the methods of instruction-learning, plan investigations to identify problems, and improve and modernize the efforts of the educational systems. The paper also considers the importance of inservice teacher training; the rationale for and the conceptualization of inservice teacher training are also examined. The author points out the relationship between life-long education and teacher training. The paper concludes with some practical suggestions for organizing inservice teacher training programs.

The three lessons in part I are intended to give students a preliminary conceptual framework for energy conservation and to motivate them to participate in the conservation-action projects which follow. Part II consists of one lesson, an electricity conservation project for the classroom. Students sharpen mathematical skills while learning how much electricity daily classroom lighting consumes and how much could be saved by reducing lighting. The three lessons in part III take the student's lessons in the classroom electricity project and enrich them with experiences in the school building, neighborhood, and home. The  remaining 10 lessons and activities in part IV are meant to directly or indirectly reinforce the attitudes, actions, and concepts developed in the first three parts of the curriculum, but which can stand alone as meaningful educational activities. Topics include electricity, energy forms/conservation, alternative energy models, energy careers, and the history of energy. Although the curriculum is basically geared for grades 4-9, teachers of early childhood and high school grade levels will also find specific lessons or experiences adaptable to their classes. (JN)",

Seven thousand randomly selected teachers and principals were surveyed at the end of the 1981-82 school year (1000 each of elementary teachers, secondary science, social studies, mathematics, and home economics teachers, and elementary/secondary principals). About 20 percent of each sample returned the survey. Survey questions were grouped into 5 categories: extent of energy education; energy education methodology and content; school, district, and state administrative policies and their impact; attitudes (if energy should be part of the curriculum); and incentives  and barriers. Responses from teachers and principals are discussed for each category. Selected results from the survey follow. About half of the teachers are presenting energy topics in their classes. Conservation, conventional/renewable resources and their production, and energy-environment interactions are the topics most often covered. That energy is not specified in a teacher's curricular responsibilities is the biggest barrier to implementation. As an inducement for teaching about energy, teachers ask for definite curricular requirements, more (and better) free and/or inexpensive materials, and encouragement from principals. (JN)",

        "description":"The spontaneous use of analogies in problem-solving occurs when a subject first spontaneously shifts his attention to a situation (B) which differs in some significant way from an original problem situation (A), and then tries to apply findings from B to A. This paper describes research on the process with 10 scientifically trained subjects (advanced doctoral students and professors in technical fields) who were interviewed (most were videotaped) on a variety of problems. Four processes were found to be fundamental in making an inference by analogy, indicating that many successful solutions by analogy are not &quot;instant solutions.&quot; Two major processes involved in confirming analogy relations were identified: matching key features or relationships and forming a bridging analogy.  Analysis of transcripts led to an hypothesis that at least three types of analogy generation mechanisms exist: generation via an abstract principle, generative transformations, and associative leaps, the latter two mechanisms being the primary methods observed so far. Since many solutions by analogy are not &quot;instant solutions,&quot; but a more extended process of conjuncture and testing, it is suggested that some of these processes are learnable and that developing students' abilities to use generative transformations, leaps, and bridges may be possible and desirable.

The first part is theoretical, presenting an argument that there are (at least) three qualitatively different components to competent mathematical performance: (1) possession of the appropriate set of cognitive \"resources,\" (2) the ability to select appropriately from the resources potentially at one's disposal, and use them with some efficiency (i.e., good \"control\" behavior), and (3) possession of a \"mathematical perspective\" that establishes the context within which resources are selected and used. Examples are given to show that the absence of any of these can cause failure in students. The second part is practical, and the focus turns to \"positive\" behavior.  Suggestions are made for (1) solidifying resources including a focus on representations and the use of heuristic strategies, (2) inducing more efficient \"control\" behaviors, and (3) uncovering inappropriate (anti-mathematical) perspectives in students, and working towards replacing them with perspectives that support the development and utilization of mathematical skills.

The results show a leveling off of the performance of American 17-year-olds, who had shown a decline between 1978 and 1982; 9-year-olds' performance has changed little from assessment to assessment. These findings are described and interpreted by a panel of mathematics educators. Besides discussing the overall results, the authors examine findings in the following categories: knowledge, skills and concepts; problem solving, applications and attitudes toward mathematics; computers and technology; minorities and mathematics; and sex differences in achievement. Findings are presented for different  kinds of test items--those assessing knowledge, skills, understanding, and application--and for different subpopulations: Blacks; Hispanics; students in heavily minority schools, students in different achievement categories, males, females and students in advantaged-urban, disadvantaged-urban and rural schools. The report contains an executive summary and, in the appendixes, some discussion of other test results and other information about mathematics education, mathematics course taking, and steps being taken across the country to improve science and mathematics education.

In mathematics, average scores declined during the mid-1970s, especially on problem solving. In science, students generally declined in knowledge, skills, and understanding, especially in physical science. These and other results cited have been interpreted as not boding well for the future eminence of the United States in science and mathematics. Key influences were noted, including the emphasis on back-to-basics and the tendency to short-change problem-solving skills; the emphasis on testing of skills, with attention focused on those easily tested; the shortage of qualified teachers;  lowered levels of support; and the relaxation of college entrance requirements. Necessary steps to be taken are listed, and a brief list of references is included. (MNS)",

It was found that CES scales displayed satisfactory internal consistency and discriminant validity, and that each CES scale differentiated significantly between the perceptions of students in different classrooms. Six different statistical analyses (simple correlation, multiple correlation, and canonical correlation analysis conducted separately for raw posttest scores and residual posttest scores adjusted for corresponding pretest and general ability) were used to investigate environment-outcome relationships. The results of these  different analyses taken together confirmed the existence of sizable and statistically significant associations between student learning outcomes and their classroom environment perceptions as measured by the CES. In particular, greater levels of classroom Order and Organizations were linked with greater student achievement of several outcomes. (Author)",

        "description":"Presented are views of a Canadian science teacher (Mr. Swift) on the nature of his science teaching and a discussion of a conception of influence which aids in understanding his ideas about time. Mr. Smith uses a provincial government syllabus, ignoring locally developed units and recent textbooks emphasizing student inquiry in favor of syllabus content with its stress on terminology and definition (science as &quot;vocabulary&quot;). With such a syllabus of well-defined subject matter to deal with, Mr. Swift is able to exert his influence on the classroom. He sees teacher-controlled activities as having a definite goal and a definite time to achieve the goal. In addition, the syllabus guidelines regulate time for Mr. Swift; squandering time is what the guidelines help him avoid by showing  what material needs to be covered and giving a legitimate reason to stress control of student activity. This emphasis on control of teaching situations (influence) is addressed, considering the relationship between how teachers construe influence and persistence of the syllabus system. How teachers think about influence is illustrated by two approaches to science teaching based on high and low levels of teacher influence. (JN)",

        "description":"Work on the development of the intensive time-series design was initiated because of the dissatisfaction with existing research designs. This dissatisfaction resulted from the paucity of data obtained from designs such as the pre-post and randomized posttest-only designs. All have the common characteristic of yielding data from only one or two points in time. In addition, true experimental designs require random selection of subjects from a population and random assignment of subjects between control and experimental groups. Since such conditions seldom materialize in school situations, a design in which the same group could perform functions of both experimental and control groups would be advantageous for school-based research. The time-series design, with its potential  adaptation of baseline, intervention, and followup states, has such potential. Areas addressed in this handbook include background/rationale for the time-series design, instrument development (developing item pools, generating daily instruments, constructing multiple item instruments), administration and collection of data, and analysis procedures. Example items, sample coding sheet, and Rasch item calibration heuristic are provided in appendices. (JN)",

        "description":"After a generation of unprecedented economic growth, the world economy appears to be losing momentum. Double-digit inflation, high interest rates, and soaring deficits are often cited as causes of the global economic slowdown, but these are more symptom than cause. More fundamental is the depletion of the global resource base that allowed the economy to triple during the century's quarter. This depletion of renewable and nonrenewable resources is undermining the long-term potential for rapid, sustained economic growth. Oil played a central role in the century's third-quarter economic boom. In addition to making overall growth easy, cheap oil revolutionized agriculture by spawning spectacular gains in food output. However, growth in oil production and other basic economic  activities has declined because of rising oil prices, deteriorating biological systems, or both. As the world population moves toward 5 billion, humanity is moving into uncharted territory. The relationship between population size and the sustainable yield of the earth's biological resource systems is uncertain. With the progressive depletion of readily accessible oil and gas reserves and the widespread deterioration of the economy's biological support systems, economic growth has slowed markedly. These economic trends call for dramatic shifts in population policy to avoid declines in consumption levels. (JN)",

Twenty-one organizations were identified and 3,200 individuals were randomly selected for the survey. Valid responses from 794 individuals (25.2 percent) were returned. The survey addressed four areas of concern: Is there a need for NEDRES services? What is the ideal system configuration? What should the data base contain? How willing are potential users to participate in and pay for the service? Findings indicate that NEDRES would be useful, a computer searchable file of environmental data sources would be  the most useful of proposed NEDRES services, and that on-line searching was the preferred method of accessing NEDRES. Additional findings indicate that NEDRES should include descriptions of the measured environmental parameters of each file listed, almost half of the respondents expressing a willingness to provide indexes of their data holdings to NEDRES, acceptability of training-related costs, and that nearly 30 percent were willing to pay for NEDRES services, although most preferred a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; system.

Two studies were conducted in support of this effort: a survey of prospective users confirming the need for and willingness to pay fees for the service and a review of the organizational characteristics of five existing information service networks. This report builds on the two previous studies in the direction of the evaluation of organizational features and the generation of configurational options that might be most suitable for the NEDRES network. Included is a review of some selected theoretical concepts from economics and some models of organizational arrangements prominent in the  information service area. The analysis of reference systems and evaluation of optimal configurations were structured by attending to nine functional areas: structure/governance procedures; communication patterns/methods; legal agreements; policies for financial support; user charges and cost recovery; operating procedures; publicity and user education/training; performance measures; and benefits of network participation. The analysis resulted in recommendation of a hybrid arrangement between centralized and decentralized approaches. Salient features of this hybrid arrangement are discussed. (JN)",

Concepts from economic theory and general models of information service network configurations were used to help define and evaluate the major trade-off factors. Findings resulting from the examination of the five reference systems are reported, including a suggestion that the National Water Data Exchange can and should be emulated by NEDRES, although  serving a more diversified clientele. These and other propositions were used to compare decentralized and centralized options. A hybrid arrangement was found to be favorable and cost effective, permitting users with intermittent needs and limited capabilities to get support from local service outlets, while users with more consistent and intensive needs could be encouraged to mobilize their capabilities toward a more independent and more economical mode of finding and accessing environmental data stores of value to them.

Pretests, posttests, and classroom observation narratives served as student data. Pretests indicate that students held the misconception that sight is possible because light illuminates things, not understanding the role of reflected light in vision. Posttests indicate that five of the six students still did not understand how light enables seeing by the end of the unit. Although good teachers (two were observed) used a popular text, instruction was not successful in that conceptual change did not occur; most students did not forsake their misconception in favor of the scientific  conception. Furthermore, students' belief in the misconception prevented them from fully understanding other topics covered in the unit, such as the functioning of various eye parts. Conceptual change did not occur because the students' misconception was not addressed in either the text or classroom instruction. Instead, students were taught and learned facts about light and facts about seeing. Many of them had difficulty making sense of these facts and seeing how they are connected to each other, as their answers on the posttest show. (Author/JN)",

One of the topics CSMS investigated was ratio and proportion; students appeared to have used the incorrect addition strategy identified by other researchers. SESM probed more deeply into such errors, and the meanings children give to a/b. For the first stage of the project, 23 children were interviewed individually about their reactions to tasks involving fractions. Then teaching modules were developed and evaluated with 59 children aged  13 and 14. Most children avoided using fractions on the pretest: they refused to acknowledge the existence of fractions. After instruction, about one-third of the children still avoided fractions in responding to test questions. Results are given for a variety of items, with the conclusion that the difficulties appeared to be fundamental. (MNS)",

The research occurred on the island of Moloka'i, which depends largely on imports for its energy sources, although it has a number of natural sources (biomass, wind, solar, and water power). Specifically, the study identified values of the community so that alternative energy options could be related to the residents' preferred way of life. The Galileo methodology, which translates differences in values to physical distances on computer-generated maps, was used to compare value structures of 219 residents with those of decision makers (the governor, state legislators, heads of major economic interests, and county officials). Of the 15 value concepts  appearing on the questionnaire, the principal values separating residents and decision makers are &quot;slow pace&quot; and &quot;Hawaiian culture&quot; (crucial for residents) and &quot;education and jobs&quot; (emphasized by decision makers). Generally, residents endorsed electricity self-sufficiency as long as the values they embraced were not endangered. These results give indications of the scale, timing, and types of energy development that residents will find most acceptable. Used with other data, these cross-community differences can provide the context for dialogue among social groups concerning perspectives on possible futures. (KC)",

The purpose of the third paper is to discuss the relationship between models of inservice educational programs and dominant metaphors of educational change within Western society. Political influences which shaped  social studies curriculum development in Alberta (Canada) from 1975 to 1978 are discussed in the fourth paper.

Data on 110 couples were obtained from the Berkeley Study at the Institute of Human Development in California. Annual data were collected from wife, home observer, and child from 1929 to the end of World War II. Husbands were interviewed in 1930 and again in the early 1940s. Differential loss of income during this period formed the focus of this study. Marital tension and temperamental (irritable, emotionally unstable, tense) scales were developed by trained coders who used original qualitative data. Heavy income loss during the 1930s increased financial disputes which substantially raised the level of  tension in marriages and which weakened marital relations by increasing temperamental behavior, particularly of men, who, as major breadwinners, became worrisome, unstable, and explosive. Both effects were most pronounced among families with minimal psychological coping resources, initially weak marriages, and unstable men. Couples of higher socio-economic status were more affected by Depression losses than couples in the working class. (KC)",

        "description":"Intended to promote mutual understanding and communication between Colombia and the United States, this lexicon shows how the two countries differ in their perceptions and evaluations of dominant themes and issues. The associative group analysis method was used in the study. One hundred American and 100 Colombian undergraduate students were instructed to list 15 important domains of life and then to write as many associative responses as possible to each of the items on their list. The high frequency responses from each group served as the basis for selecting the 120 stimulus themes used in the main data collection phase. The students' spontaneous free associations responses to these themes were then analyzed. Comparative findings, with the use of semantographs and text, are  reported for the following areas: international relations and education, family and self, friendship and understanding, community and society, love and sex, religion and morality, health and well-being, education and upbringing, and economy and money. The general findings show that on certain psychocultural variables, such as perceptions, meanings, and value orientations, the intrasocietal/intracultural variations are distinctly smaller than variations between cultures.

Although four strengths were indicated, the author dealt primarily with weaknesses of the text and made many suggestions for improvement. Some of the author's criticisms were that (1) vocabulary was not consistent, i.e., some words were defined, others were not; (2) the grammatical construction of sentences was poor; (3) topic sentences were unclear and paragraphs sometimes contained several topics; and (4) headings, transitions, and connecting words were not used in paragraphs. In addition, students reading this chapter would be required to infer many ideas and to recall information from  previous chapters. It was recommended that more summaries and explicit labeling of topics be used, as well as more examples. Overall, to improve the chapter, the author suggests that it be completely rewritten by a single author with a less authoritarian style, keeping the sixth grade reader in mind. Appended are the original version and the author's improved version of the chapter. (BY)",

One hundred and fifty-six Japanese students (40 modern females, 76 traditional females, and 40 males) and 148 German students (58 modern females, 49 traditional females, and 41 males) answered questionnaires concerning the ideal and real decision-making power of their parents and their sex-role preferences. Results show that modern values, attitudes, and behavior related to family roles need not necessarily occur in equally advanced industrially but culturally different societies. In spite of considerable similarity with respect to equal decision making for mothers and fathers in both cultures, the Japanese, as compared to the German fathers, exert more influence as perceived by their  children. Japanese, as compared to German adolescents, advocate the traditional role differentiation more. However, intra-cultural (modern vs. traditional sub-groups) and gender effects have to be taken into account in each culture. Adolescents in both cultures report a closer relation to their mothers than to their fathers. (Author/RM)",

Graduate enrollments in economics have been stable from 1975 through 1979, but increased by more than 10% between 1979 and 1981. Regarding student financial support, there is a growing reliance on the institution's own and state-provided funds and an increased dependence on self-support, family support, and debt. From 1960 through the early 1970s, there was a rapid rise in the number of M.A. and Ph.D. degrees awarded. Degree  production for both degrees peaked in 1973, with the number of M.A. degrees drifting steadily downward. The pattern of Ph.D. production has been stable since 1970. New Ph.D. economists are finding jobs, but there is a trend toward the pursuit of nonacademic positions. (RM)",

The report discusses the relevance of educational exchanges to the modernization program, educational developments and change since the death of Zhou Enlai (Chou En' Lai), efforts to improve the image and role of intellectuals, the Cultural Revolution, and the administration of foreign exchange programs. The program calls for advancement in agriculture, industry, science and technology, and defense. It also  focuses on development of new sources of energy, computer technology, space science, laser usage, high energy physics, and genetic engineering. To accomplish these goals, Chinese leaders are expanding and modernizing educational facilities and creating an atmosphere conducive to intellectual activity. China has also launched a major effort to send Chinese students abroad for scientific, technological, and language training and to invite foreign specialists to China to lecture, teach, and participate in joint research efforts.

Two aspects of the materials, feasibility and effectiveness, were evaluated in three schools with diverse populations. Methods included direct observation, open-ended interviews with teachers, and student questionnaires. Specific incidents (rather than a synthesis of findings) reveal that although the modules provided adequate information to teachers, they were not used as expected. Classroom questioning techniques were rote and uninspired. Also, the modules did not match the full range of  student ability and interest in the field test classrooms, with higher grades reporting that the work was too easy. In every case teachers failed to provide a rationale for the study of modules and did not attempt to integrate content elements in a coherent pattern. The most positive aspect was that students did learn new concepts and vocabulary. The project emphasis on content rather than methods underestimated the dependence of teachers on textbooks, dittos, and prepared lesson plans. Finally, teachers did not sense any urgency to teach about Native Americans. (KC)",

Data were obtained from long-term intensive fieldwork with 19 Los Angeles nurses and their 18 families and from the researcher's doctoral dissertation. All data on family performance patterns indicate a highly segregated division of labor, with virtually all tasks the responsibility of a single spouse. Of the 98 tasks categorized, 50 were performed primarily by wives, 39 by husbands, and 9 were shared. Task allocation continues to be determined by traditional role designations, i.e., the wife prepares meals; the husband repairs the car. Deviation from traditional roles occurs only when a wife's job commitment constrains her from carrying  out role-designated responsibilities. Thus, the actions of those families who identified themselves as egalitarian do not differ significantly from other families in the study; their self-characterizations only reflect general intentions. Further, wives are reluctant to accept equal responsibility for the provider role, even when their income exceeds that of their spouse. (KC)",

In order to compare intermarriage trends with available census figures (mostly on population size and sex composition), records were reviewed for all census years and the year following. Findings include the following. There is a pattern of increasing levels of Japanese American intermarriage over time. This same pattern was seen in similar studies conducted in Hawaii and California. In all cases, this partly reflects cultural, social, and economic changes occurring within successive Japanese American generations. There was no clear relation between intermarriage rate and  population size. When the Denver intermarriage rate began rapidly increasing, Japanese American females intermarried more frequently than males. The study concludes that Denver, as an &quot;outlying area,&quot; may exhibit similar patterns, but at times, different rates of intermarriage than places with numerically and proportionally larger Japanese American populations.

While this country must continue to ensure the survivability of its strategic triad, it is altogether clear that this objective can be satisfied without moving toward a capacity for expanded counterforce strike, expanded theater nuclear force deployments, and generally expanded preparations for nuclear war fighting. Indeed, such moves would have a deleterious effect on U.S. security since they would actually undermine the system of mutual deterrence. If it is to achieve real power, the United States must first come to grips with a sober awareness of the limits of violence and the requirements  of coexistence. In &quot;The Trojan Women,&quot; Euripides attributes the suffering of one people to the hatred of another. His wisdom suggests that enormous dangers lie latent in the continuing effort by the Reagan administration to cast USSR-U.S. rivalry in the form of a war between the sons of light and the sons of darkness.

Following an introduction in chapter 1, there are 4 major chapters. Chapter 2 discusses how the research terrain has been divided among the disciplines of psychology, sociology, anthropology, economics, political science, geography, history, and statistics. Also examined are specialization within disciplines, the improvement of data, shifts in conceptual and theoretical foci, and interdisciplinary ferment. Chapter 3 illustrates the progress of the behavioral and social sciences as sciences. One striking feature of advances made is that frequently they have been borrowed from or have contributed to other disciplines. For example, the study of human perception has  involved a long-term interaction between psychophysicists describing behavior and sensory physiologists describing the physiological substrate of that behavior. Chapter 4 examines the applications of research findings to public policy formation, social problem solving, and other areas. The concluding chapter sets forth in more general terms the relationship between basic research and its influence and practical application. (RM)",

        "description":"A conflict between the author, engaged in doctoral research in a rural Kenyan community, and an older village woman is narrated. The author suggests that anthropologists must be sensitive to the way in which their own cultural perceptions influence their interpretations of women's behavior in other cultures. The Kenyan village is characterized by two principles of authority: older persons have authority over younger and males have authority over females. However, while men are awarded rightful dominance, women have real power, particularly in the domestic arena. The conflict occurred when the older village woman instructed the other village women not to participate in the research that the narrator was carrying out. When confronted, the older woman asserted that the researcher  should have asked permission to interview &quot;her&quot; women. The offended woman made attempts to have local authorities oust the research team from the village. Although eventually the research was completed, the author realizes that she had unwittingly placed herself in competition with the older woman for power over the other women. Both women, by manifesting values, attitudes, and behaviors expected of women in their own cultures, collectively contributed to the conflict. (KC)",

        "description":"A comparison of multisite educational research projects involving qualitative research methods is reported. In phase 1 of the project, telephone interviews with key staff members of 25 projects determined ways in which each project handled important qualitative design and implementation choices. Phase 2 consisted of a more intensive study of 5 projects: the Rural Experimental Schools Study, Experience-Based Career Education, Career Intern Program, Parental Involvement Study, and Dissemination Efforts Supporting School Improvement. Extensive interviews with key project members determined the project history, the interests of project staff and relevant outsiders, and methodological and administrative dilemmas characteristic of policy research. Telephone interviews were conducted  with federal officials who monitored each project. Differences in the degree to which the methodologies of these projects were formalized were substantial. Formalization entails codification of questions and variables, standardization of data collection methods, and systematic reduction of verbal narrative to codes and categories. The variation results from different adaptations of social science to policy research and is more a function of the professional preferences of the research team than of the technical requirements of policy research or the desires of those who commissioned it. Appendices include profiles of the 25 multisite studies, tables, and an annotated bibliography. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Current trends in ethical/moral instruction are placed in context by tracing educational and social change from the 19th century to the present. The focus on religion for salvation and on good behavior lasted in modified form well into the 19th century. In the late 19th century curriculum in the schools changed due to immigration, industrialism, urbanization, and modernization. In colleges, the moral philosophy course faded as Freudian psychology, behaviorism, and the social sciences replaced ethics courses. The ethical/moral atmosphere in the public school also declined. Both the Depression and World War II shocked educators into a renewed search for curriculum unity and moral uplift. Major curriculum revision in the natural and social sciences occurred after Sputnik in 1957.  The 1960's and early 1970's saw modern anxiety manifested in protests, crime, drug use, and divorce. Resources were limited, inflation soared, the work ethic declined, and the women's movement became strong. These events influenced the focus on humanism, values clarification, moral development, and moral reasoning in education, particularly in higher education, where ethics courses have multiplied since the 1960's. These approaches contrast greatly with Soviet education, for example, which openly indoctrinates its students in loyalty to the mother country. (KC)",

The study was limited in three ways: (1) only primary through eighth-grade materials were reviewed; (2) only the immigration period (1880-1920), the post war period (1950-1972), and the current period (1973-1982) were included; and (3) emphasis was given to Chinese, Japanese, and Jews. An unequal number of textbooks and teaching manuals were evaluated for each time period. Reviewers considered which ethnic groups were named, the tone of the citations (negative, positive, stereotyped), and the accuracy of the content. It was found that between 1880 and 1920, the basic school policy was Americanization  in which ethnic groups were given little consideration. Few changes took place until the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s when ethnic studies were encouraged, but mainly at the secondary level. Since 1973, teachers and textbook publishers have become more cognizant of ethnically balanced materials. Multicultural education is an accepted practice, but teachers need better education and guidelines. (BY)",

A review of literature on the process indicates that a closer collaboration between supervisor and cooperating teacher is needed, cooperating teachers need training in supervision, and supervision requires an ability to adapt to meet the demands of individual situations with flexible techniques which respond to a diagnosis of the maturity level of the student teacher at each stage of development. The model for the process of supervising student teachers presumes that a close relationship exists between the university supervisor and the cooperating teacher. A course or workshop for both the university supervisor and the  cooperating teacher should provide basic tenets of needs assessment, the clinical approach to supervision, and adaptibility of leadership style. A collegial agreement should be reached on expectations and goals, and the roles of each supervisor should be clarified. The cooperating teacher should diagnose the maturity level of the student teacher and an agreement should be reached with the college supervisor on the most effective supervisory style. Preferably, both supervisors would be present at observations. Pre- and post-observation conferences with the student teacher should be held for discussing specific teaching behaviors being observed at each session. (JD)",

Results indicated that teacher preparation programs in this area have not kept pace with the growing numbers of teachers needed, and the predominant emphasis in available programs has been at the undergraduate level. While such programs have become more readily available, the amount of increase is small compared with the growth of middle level schools. A trend was apparent in the growth of programs at the master's level, and in some states requiring middle level certification, teachers were able to combine their graduate work with qualifying for the special certification. The survey also obtained data  regarding the nature of programs offered at all levels. Categories included: major specialization, \"add on\" programs (added to elementary or secondary program), and a series of specialized courses.

A format was designed to determine the breadth and depth of all standards by comparing and contrasting National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) standards with Ohio State Department of Education standards. In general, the plan involved consistent input and communication with key persons within the college structure who have responsibility for various aspects of the entire organization. A documentation timeline was designed, scheduling assigned input from the leadership team, the major documentors, program heads, and faculty members. A system was also developed to document and monitor the status  of the implementation of the plan. In this document, the system is described, and handouts are included to represent several important dimensions of the system, including: (1) comparison of Ohio and NCATE standards relating to teacher education programs; (2) examples of information on each program; (3) documentation timeline; (4) information on program goals, development, evaluation, components, and students; (5) table of contents for initial and advanced preparation program descriptions; and (6) samples of the faculty vita form and syllabus format.

Seventy-seven children and five teachers participated. The American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AAHPERD) Health-Related Fitness Test was given to all subjects in September and May of the school year; and \"Torrance Figural Form A of Creative Thinking\" was given in November and May. During February, March, and April, coding of student teacher interactions was done using a second generation modification of the \"Nonverbal/Verbal Interaction Category  System - Modified.\" Findings indicated that, in comparison with national norms, the children involved in physical education activities taught by physical education specialists made improvements in the fitness parameter, while children in programs taught by classroom teachers maintained or decreased in fitness levels. The average aerobic fitness lesson had a higher number of verbal interactions; however, movement education showed more of a balance of direct/indirect teacher verbal behaviors and a slightly higher percentage of student talk. Little difference was found across the groups in creative thinking. Appended tables provide information on statistical data gathered in the study. (JD)",

The course has three major objectives. In seminar style, the students and teacher together will identify questions worth exploring in the area of classroom communication. Reading the textbooks and additional related readings, the participants will be prepared to contribute to classroom discussion. A second objective of the course is for students to experience classroom management by conducting creative instructional sessions. The third goal of the course is for students to observe classrooms first-hand by either tutoring or researching in them. These objectives are reached  through four assignments: daily class participation, a final take-home essay exam, small group presentations, and an individual project involving observation. Included in this paper, which describes the course, are 10 lesson plans for the semester, based on a 3-hour class period. These lesson plans contain such things as: suggested audiovisual aids (particularly ideotapes, movies, and slide presentations), sample discussion questions, group projects, and a final examination.

A questionnaire, sent to 110 first year physical education teachers in Illinois, achieved a return rate of 30 percent. The questionnaire sought information on perceived difficulties unique to teaching physical education and difficulties associated with general teacher roles--planner, director of learning, counselor, interpreter of culture, link with community, and member of a profession and community. The highest degrees of difficulty appeared to be managing classes with large numbers and being flexible in using instructional facilities. The physical education teachers indicated a wide  range of difficulty with the role of teacher as a link with the community. This was comparable to the role perceptions of teachers in other curricular areas. Recommendations for improving teacher education programs in these areas would involve simulation/experience in large group instruction, information on the role of the community and the schools, and experience with individuals of different cultural/ethnic backgrounds.

All participants were asked the following questions each week: (1) With whom do you interact? (2) What is their affiliation or where are they located? (3) Who initiated the conversation (the center in the study, or the person with whom the contact was made)?

The two groups were of similiar socioeconomic status. Each group had a 30 minute free-play period and a 30 minute structured-play period of motor development activities 5 days a week for 10 weeks. The only difference between the treatment of the two groups was in the playground equipment available. The experimental group had more equipment of the &quot;upper body&quot; movement variety (e.g., horizontal ladders) than did the control group. Subjects were pre- and post-tested  for upper body muscular endurance using the straight-arm hang. Results indicated that specific playground experiences, as provided by a well equipped play environment which had overhead climbers and ladders available, was a contributing factor in the increased muscular endurance performance of the experimental group.

A distinction, based on differing teacher responses in form and content, is drawn between the self-oriented and role-oriented teacher. It was found that role-oriented teachers in this study saw themselves within a larger picture in which colleagues, the curriculum, and accountability figure in some fashion; whereas, self-oriented  teachers are seen as being more concerned with actions, feelings, and current classroom realities.

        "description":"Six experienced teachers of fourth and fifth grades read and made judgments about the appropriateness, attractiveness, usefulness, and effectiveness of each of 32 short descriptions of language-arts activities. The activity descriptions had been edited to vary systematically on five features: amount of student involvement; difficulty for students; integration of multiple skills or subject matters; demand on the teacher; and fit between stated purpose and instructional process. Each teacher thought aloud during the judgment process; these deliberations were audiotaped and transcribed. A policy-capturing analysis indicated that only small proportions of variance in teacher judgments could be explained in terms of the five manipulated cues. A process-tracing analysis of the  protocols of two of the six teachers revealed that they were attending to several activity features in addition to the five mentioned above. The process-tracing analysis also provided a description of how the teachers defined and modified the judgment task and drew upon their own professional experiences to comprehend, edit, and evaluate the activity descriptions. The process-tracing approach appears to be a more promising method of inquiry into complex teacher-judgment tasks than is the policy-capturing approach. (Authors/JD)",

It is noted that, when education and firsthand experience are described as if equivalent, a presumption is made that a commonsense theory of knowledge and mind is valid. Research on the social psychology of judgment is used to identify faulty inferences that frequently result from learning by firsthand experience. These pitfalls are illustrated in a discussion of learning to teach. In considering how firsthand experience can close avenues to conceptual and social change, it is pointed out that firsthand experience often fallaciously confounds whatever happens in life with necessity. The example is given of vocational education, in which  learning by doing is advocated as a means of fitting students into the real world, thereby curbing their aspirations. It is argued that ideas based on secondhand information are more likely than firsthand experience to manifest both the real and the possible, and it is concluded that education gives access to thoughts and theories that are beyond the scope of firsthand experience.

The emergence of the mainstreaming concept as an alternative to special class placement is discussed, and citations are made of court litigation which dealt with nondiscriminatory assessment, right to due process, and right to education. Legislation generated by these and other legal confrontations is outlined with brief interpretations of societal implications. In the second section, the organization of  the mainstreamed classroom is discussed with emphasis on two major areas of concern for teachers: the structure of the physical classroom environment, and the daily and weekly instructional routine.

The first year of the project was devoted to developing and disseminating materials to and planning activities for students in required  education courses. The second year focused on the impact of the materials and activities on the supervisors of practicum student experiences, methods course instructors, and students. The objective of the final year was to familiarize administrators and other educational leaders with the needs, characteristics, and methods of instructing handicapped students. An evaluation is presented of the progress made in each of these 3 years. Appendixes include criterion-referenced tests used in the project, and a form for analyzing the experience of professional education centers with the handicapped. (JD)",

The two-fold purpose of the study was to determine what teaching characteristics were considered most important by students, and whether viewing the videotapes influenced the students' perceptions of selected teaching characteristics. Subjects were 24 agricultural education students divided evenly into experimental and control groups. The Teaching Appraisal Scale (TAS) was administered to the class prior to their division into groups. The TAS is designed to assess a teacher's possession of 20 selected teaching characteristics and their perceived value. The experimental group viewed three videotapes  which had been developed for evaluation. The study found that the most highly valued teaching characteristics were: enthusiasm shown by the teacher for teaching; ability to explain clearly; and giving clear and precise directions. There were few measurable changes in ratings by the experimental group after viewing the tapes. Tables present information on pre- and post-test rankings of the selected teacher characteristics, and a comparison of the responses of the two groups. A list of the 20 characteristics on the TAS is included. (JD)",

Forty subjects (20 male and 20 female) from the ages of 18-30 sustained a single bout of aerobic activity for 30 minutes at 60 percent of their maximum heart rate. Pre-treatment procedures included administration of the STAI and obtaining a finger print for determining enumeration of open sweat pores. Each subject's resting heart rate was then determined so that the treadmill could be adjusted until the target heart rate was reached. After the half-hour exercise period, the STAI was readministered to each subject, and a second fingerprint was taken to measure the number of open sweat pores. Results showed a significant decrease  in both psychological stress as measured by the STAI and in physiological stress as measured by the PSI. (JM)",

        "description":"Survey results have suggested that, while teachers like to have test information available, most do not have great skill or consistency in interpreting test score data. Teachers who consider a certain type of test very valuable or useful are less likely to question the accuracy of the scores than are teachers who consider a test to be of little value. Also, teacher judgments of test score accuracy are apparently tempered on the basis of other information. The overall intent of the project described in this report was to learn more about how teachers perceive test score data; how they use test and nontest data in decision making; factors which might be related to knowledge or perception of test score data; and whether knowledge or perception of test score data can be changed  through brief instruction. Reported are six studies that were conducted, focusing on: (1) teachers' perceptions of test score accuracy; (2) teachers' interpretations of pupil performance record; (3) teachers' interpretations of point and interval score estimates; (4) teachers' estimates of costs and losses in decisions; (5) factors influencing teacher estimation of pupil performance; and (6) changes in teachers' knowledge and perceptions of test score data.

It also examined this relationship for students who entered the class with different initial skill levels, different previous experience with the subject matter, and for students of different gender. The methodology used is discussed under the following headings: subjects, instructors, skill rating, skill testing, instruction, and engagement coding. The original research premise is reported along with the results, which indicate that engaged time overall does not improve residualized achievement (i.e., students' breaststroke mechanics did not improve in correlation with the time they spent in class and practicing). Because the results did not agree  with the hypothesis, four alternate hypotheses are discussed: (1) Engagement does not play a major role in predicting residualized gain; (2) The system for rating the skill was not sophisticated enough to measure relatively subtle aspects of improvement; (3) The method for coding engagement within the categories was not specific enough to detail important qualitative differences in the categories; and (4) Other factors mediate the power of engagement to predict residualized achievement.

        "description":"A study investigated classroom management from the students' perspective. Ninety-seven high school students (primarily ninth graders) were observed in one school for 15 weeks in five different classes. Data were collected from this observation, as well as from student and teacher interviews. The guidelines of the Constant-Comparative Method of Qualitative Analysis were used to generate and analyze theoretical constructs suggesting what classroom goals students sought, what strategies they developed to achieve these goals, when they chose to use these strategies, and what types of students used each strategy. Findings show that students had two major goals to achieve, \"socializing\" and \"passing the course.\" They used six strategies to achieve these goals: (1) \"figuring out the  teacher\"; (2) \"having fun\"; (3) \"giving the teacher what he wants\"; (4) \"minimizing work\"; (5) \"reducing boredom\"; and (6) \"staying out of trouble.\" These strategies fall into the preliminary category, the proactive category, and the reactive category, each category being associated with particular kinds of classroom events. Students can be identified and clustered into four major groups according to the ratio of time spent \"socializing\" or \"passing the course\": play, play/work, work/play, or work. Important for students are the clarity with which teachers communicate their academic and behavioral expectations to students and the degree of cooperation that exists between the students and the teacher.

Six dimensions of reputation selected for the study were: credibility, knowledgeability in their speciality, general knowledgeability, effectiveness as teachers, status, and orientation to knowledge and research (&quot;clinical&quot; or &quot;scientific&quot;). The Teacher Education Survey (Katz et al., 1982), a three part questionnaire, was the source of data. In Part A, respondents reported on the frequency and nature of contacts between teacher educators and other instructors. In Part B, teacher educators are compared by respondents to other university  instructors in terms of the aforementioned six dimensions of reputation. In Part C, participants responded to 10 items representing &quot;clinical&quot; versus &quot;scientific&quot; orientation. Results showed that the reputation of teacher educators in Israel was at least as high as that of other college instructors and that in general this reputation does not depend on any of the following respondent characteristics: sex, subject matter, discipline, position at the university, and role set position. These findings contradict common beliefs about teacher educators as well as preliminary findings from studies conducted in the United States. (JM)",

Two issues are discussed: the sources of variation in learning time (actual days per school year, length of school day, absenteeism), and the effects of learning time on achievement. In the second section, a review is presented of major empirical studies of time and learning, concentrating primarily on more recent studies of the effect of time on task. An analysis is given of the results of the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study, as well as studies of: the effect of pupil attention on achievement; the relationship between concurrent achievement and attention measures; time allocation and achievement; and student response to different  teaching methods. Inconsistent effects of time variables on achievement were found in the reviewed studies, and the conclusion is drawn that the effect of time on task on learning, while important, is not substantial. The final section discusses two elements which have been given scant attention in past studies of time on task: the conditioning effect of classroom/school organizational variables, and the dynamic nature of teaching and learning.

        "description":"This paper discusses the modern American junior high and middle school from the perspectives of an interested observer, the educational researcher, and the students themselves. Discussed briefly are three factors that place junior high/middle school education in a unique context--the developmental stage of the students who are served, the historical rationale for creating such schools, and the current move to establish &quot;middle&quot; rather than &quot;junior high&quot; schools. Next, examples are provided of the ways teachers, students, and subjects are organized in these schools. This is followed by a discussion of the academic and social maturity requirements students must meet in order to perform successfully in junior high/middle schools. Also described are types of teaching practices that  have been observed to be most effective at this educational level. Demands that are placed on students as they move from elementary to junior high/middle schools are summarized, as is a theme that runs throughout the paper, involving three aspects of a student's instructional program: (1) nature of academic tasks; (2) socio-organizational structure of the classroom; and (3) management and accountability systems employed by teachers.

It is pointed out that the majority of research findings came from studies of elementary schools and focused upon the characteristics of effective schools for minority and poor students. Most research reviewed for this analysis was exploratory and descriptive, aiming to find effective schools and then deducing characteristics associated with effectiveness. For most studies reviewed, researchers did not develop comprehensive, systematic, and detailed programs with implementation guides for school improvement. However, in many studies, identification was made of features of effective programs. One example noted is of a school staff committed to  excellence with high expectations for students and strong administrative leadership. It is suggested that the attitudes, processes, and techniques which characterize effective elementary schools have relevance for secondary schools as well, in spite of differences in organizational structure and educational goals. The appendix provides lists of effective school characteristics which were culled from the reviewed research. (JD)",

The feasibility of transferring these programs to high schools is examined. It is pointed out that, since the research base for the programs derives from studies of minority urban elementary schools, the school characteristics identified are not typical of the average high school; also, because the research base emphasizes achievement at the elementary level, many other goals that are typical of high schools are not addressed. A discussion of the differences between high schools and elementary  schools considers: (1) diversity of high school academic and social objectives; (2) large size of high schools; (3) organizational complexity; (4) subject-oriented faculty; (5) frequent movement of students from class to class; (6) tracking of students; (7) complex administrative role of the principal; (8) faculty resistance; (9) student goals and attitudes toward school; and (10) parent and community attitudes toward school responsibilities.

Major findings discussed in this paper include: (1) The average credit value of academic courses in high schools has declined considerably since the late 1960s, indicating that less time is being allocated for them and that students are spending less time in the academic curriculum; (2) High school students on all tracks are spending more time in and receiving more credit for &quot;personal  service and development&quot; courses, a trend which accounts largely for the results in (1); (3) The dominant student track in high school is now the &quot;General Track&quot;--curriculum dominated by survey, remedial, and personal service coures--and many students in this track go on to college; (4) The secondary school curriculum has become diffused and fragmented over the past 15 years, as have college courses and degrees; and (5) Grade inflation, while significant, has not been as pervasive as assumed, and its locations and sources in the curriculum do not fit easy assumptions.

The paper begins with a description, of classroom practices in American schools, based in part upon selected papers that have been presented to the National Commission on Excellence in Education. Findings cited in this paper indicate that teachers vary widely in: (1) use of classroom time; (2) management of classroom activities; (3) selection and design of classroom learning tasks; (4) teaching and communicating with students; and (5) expectations and academic standards held for themselves, peers, classes, and individual students. It  is noted that research also demonstrates that these aspects of classroom life are related to student achievement. This paper describes these research findings, particularly in the areas of: (1) time and learning; (2) classroom management; (3) active teaching; (4) curriculum content and academic work structures; (5) teacher expectations; (6) student influence; and (7) motivation and personal investment. Research findings are used to suggest how particular patterns of classroom behavior hinder or facilitate student achievement. References are included. (CJ)",

The evaluation will also provide formative data, e.g., which components of the present program, if any, should be modified or deleted; and whether any components should be added. The relevant evaluation questions and objectives, the information sources to provide evaluation data, and the program information needs are described.

Based on a one-disk or two-disk configuration of the Apple II with 48k of memory, the DX prepares an interpretive, diagnostic readout for the instructor which includes a record of the performance as well as a short narrative explaining the level at which the respondent comprehends the material tested. The DX package of eight subprograms includes test writing and editing  systems, a test outcome feedback system, and a system for determining how many and which tests will be administered at a given time.

The method of estimation compares two or three items at a time, separating out the ability parameters of the set of persons tested by means of conditional probability, to avoid biasing the difficulty parameters. To describe the difficulty of a set of items, a matrix is constructed in which each element is the number of people who responded correctly to one item and incorrectly to another item. The matrix of observations need not be complete. An analogous matrix is prepared to describe the relative abilities of the persons, by  considering them two at a time and looking only at those items which one got right and the other got wrong.

Through Project PLANE, a comprehensive assessment system and a coordinated referral system was developed in the Adult Basic Education and high school completion programs in the Wayne-Westland (MI) Community Schools. The project was innovative in that it provided a thorough assessment of student academic, vocational, and career abilities and interests, utilizing a variety of evaluation procedures tailored to the individual. For the first time in Michigan a system of vocational evaluation based on work samples (VITAS) was used to  supplement traditional aptitude testing. A coordinated referral and enrollment system was developed to refer students to many program components simultaneously. Thus, students were able to acquire academic and vocational skills and support services in a sequential expedited manner creating a more employable individual. Project PLANE met its overall objectives. Strategies used to reach these objectives and recommendations for the implementation of new procedures are discussed. (Author/CM)",

        "description":"Mounting concern for student achievement in writing has refocused attention on the features of writing assessment necessary to represent a student's skill fairly, usefully and economically. If writing tests are to fulfill their intended function, the writing assignments and evaluative criteria of large scale tests and instruction must interrelate. Current practices are increasingly criticized regarding relevance to realistic writing situations, utility for forming decisions about individual competence or program effectiveness, fairness, and legality for sanctioning exit requirements. State and district writing assessments should re-evaluate their methods considering alternatives proposed by recent writing theory and research. Specifying writing goals which distinguish between  minimum functional goals and desirable goals of competence may improve the logic, utility and fairness of test procedures. Appropriate writing tasks should be designed to provide a full rhetorical context, and time to engage in all parts of the writing process. An integrated instructional system which targets particular writing elements as important basic competencies would involve teachers and evaluators in specification of rating criteria--whether holistic judgments or several separate analytic scores. The technical quality of rating criteria is a problem of scale stability and validity. Cost concerns should not outweigh concerns for fairness and utility. (CM)",

High school and college samples completed tasks in field-dependence-independence, figural creativity, and verbal abilities. Spatial recall ability was assessed through a map reconstruction task in which subjects were required to accurately reproduce the spatial location of features they recalled from a learned map stimulus. Results showed that field-dependence-independence and figural creativity were significant determinants of spatial recall for both samples. Verbal ability was a significant factor only for the less verbal, more heterogeneous high school sample. The data support a model of cognitive processing in which effective recall of spatial attributes is  dictated by subjects' abilities to treat spatial arrays as part-whole relations: Individual entities must be considered as separable from the whole map context. The results are discussed in conjunction with accepted theories of human memory and spatial cognition. (Author)",

        "description":"During the last two decades of work in predicting and explaining school achievement, much research has emphasized the identification and measurement of student cognitive and affective processes which predict and also promise to help explain and facilitate school achievement. This review focuses on modifiable cognitive and affective processes, as different from aptitude and ability. The results summarized represent but do not exhaust the findings of recent research relevant to school achievement. Findings on cognitive processes concern generative comprehension processes, imagery, attention and cognitive style. Affective processes include motivation, self-concept, test anxiety, and attitude. The purpose of this review is not simply to caution or advise test development  institutions, but to communicate ideas to test users as well. The contention is that intelligence measures yield data concerning momentary states of knowledge or ability. These static descriptions are interpreted as descriptions of student potential. Yet the evidence in this review shows that the affective and cognitive processes underlying intelligence scores are dynamic in nature, and they can be taught and improved. To predict potential scholastic success and provide remedial information to increase that potential, an emphasis upon cognitive and affective processes is essential and logical, and has been too long waiting.

It should describe processes, materials, participants and social interactions which produce certain outcomes. Program evaluation should judge the effect of the program and depict effective practices, products and outcomes. To demonstrate program implementation and achievement, thorough documentation is required. Documentation methods should suit the needs of the individual program. These needs are likely to be influenced by audience; credibility; planning needs; decision makers at local, state, or other levels; time factors; and the nature of the program. At a minimum, documentation should provide information on program frame factors such as participants, resources and facilities, and  program events and activities, including materials used and procedures. The principal approaches, used singly or in combination, gather information directly from participants by written descriptions, interviews, or questionnaires; program records; and direct observation of the program setting. Three points of view toward documentation validity are (1) consistency with the program plan; (2) plan-free documentation; and (3) theory-based documentation. These three points of view are illustrated with suggestions for practice and setting up the documentation system. (CM)",

General information is provided on three basic considerations in bilingual program evaluation: assessment, evaluation design, and data analysis. Assessment is the full range of information that might be used to make decisions about a bilingual program, including what it accomplishes for its students as well as the procedures to achieve these goals. Measures of student performance and 100 program processes, such as interviews and observations, are examined. A  brief examination of major designs used in bilingual program evaluation focuses on the designs that seem to be most useful and feasible in a bilingual program setting. The most general-purpose designs for investigating program outcomes are the time-series/longitudinal designs. The exposure-to-treatment design is widely applicable for formative evaluations. Accountability designs, report information about student achievement of local objectives or national norms. Basic issues raised concern the questions an evaluation might try to answer, collection of information, and the appropriate analytic techniques. (CM)",

Test results, largely indicate that MCT requirements impact disproportionately on black students. Black students' scores may reflect a long history of racial discrimination in the schools, as well as bias in the testing process. While MCT programs may beneficially focus on teaching basic skills, there is no evidence that the diploma sanction is necessary to achieve this focus. The MCT movement may have advanced the thinking of judges and legal scholars about standards of good educational practice. These results of the MCT movement are not direct benefits of the programs which have been implemented. The educational  standards articulated for MCT programs and the disproportionate racial impact of MCT require recognition that the problems of racial discrimination still exist in the schools, and the fundamentals of good teaching and testing practices are not always implemented. The promised benefits and goals of MCT are not yet realized. There is no assurance that the programs are effective in increasing educational achievement since it has not been proven that the tests are accurate measures of such achievement. (CM)",

In the light of research on test format and anxiety, this study postulates that, if a matching test could assess knowledge for a given topic as effectively as an analogous multiple-choice test, yet present a less threatening, less anxiety-provoking situation, then the matching format should be utilized for testing. Two experiments measured the comparative effectiveness of each format for assessing student recall capabilities and for reducing test anxiety. Sixty-four students from Los Angeles area high schools were first administered 12 premise/response matching pair items and 12 multiple-choice  items to assess prior knowledge. Test anxiety was measures with an experimental Test Anxiety Inventory, and test preference was measured with a three-item questionnaire. The second experiment determined generalizability, testing recall of novel or recently encoded material. Test subjects consistently favored the matching tests, scored equally high on them, and experienced significantly less debilitating test anxiety. The reduction of anxiety was possibly due to successful test-taking strategies and positive self-evaluations during testing. (CM)",

The process can also be a planning device to create a T/E/I linking system. The workshop allows diverse perspectives from many levels and incorporates procedures which build &quot;ownership&quot; in ideas or policies. A minimum  of 8, and maximum of 16, people participate for several hours in procedures incorporated from Mason and Mitroff's &quot;ill-structured problems&quot; methodology. The group generates and classifies examples of effects of testing and evaluation using a brainstorming nominal group technique. In subgroups the participants determine the importance and certainty of effects, specify acceptable evidence of effects, select those effects to be measured, and develop instrumentation to measure effects.

Major questions are: (1) whether a testing/evaluation/instruction management strategy is worth the effort; (2) what opportunities and constraints are posed by the relevant environments and how will these environments shape the strategy; (3) what ideas related to testing and evaluation run consistently through the district; and (4) what effect would these ideas  have on strategy choice and implementation. Further considerations are the operational elements necessary to implement a management subsystem, the formal and informal structures that will serve as coordinating mechanisms to make testing and evaluation useful to teachers, and the impact of the subsystem on instruction.

It is critical that the utility of programs be documented, economical delivery services be developed, and redundancy of interventions be reduced to optimize the return from public expenditures. It is urgent that a revised federal evaluation agenda be formulated which could be influential in determining future social program policies. During the past decade the strong evaluation capacities developed in domestic social programs were coupled with increasing dissemination and utilization of evaluation results which are now relevant to current White House commitments. In setting evaluation  objectives and priorities for the 1980's, five activities require both short- and long-term investments: (1) estimation of the net impact, in terms of cost savings and consequences for populations, of implemented and projected cutbacks in social programs; (2) implementation of social experiments to provide services at reduced costs by increasing competition, consumer options and volunteerism; (3) examination of the objectives and priorities among current social programs; (4) assessment of established programs in comparison with alternative interventions; and (5) development of accountability procedures to maximize block grant program impacts.

The basic analyses in this study show that for four assessments (equality in a state over time, wealth neutrality in a state over time, equality across states, and wealth neutrality across states), there is far from perfect agreement among the various measures and between units of analysis. But these findings result from a focus on a particular dependent variable, independent variable, pupil measure, two units of analysis, and a specific set of equality and wealth neutrality measures. The level of comparability for the variable limits the conclusions to  measurement methodology and not to specific states. However, the selection of a subset of measures will make comparisons over time and across states more discriminating or less ambiguous. The critical question then becomes whether there is sufficient agreement on the value judgments so that specific measures and units of analysis can be selected. (PN)",

        "description":"This report describes the development and norming of parallel forms of the Air Force Reading Abilities Test (AFRAT) which have been designed for Air Force use as replacements for commercial reading tests. A previous study on service applicants found considerably divergent reading grade levels (RGL's) from different commercial tests for subjects of the same Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery ability level. In addition to varying norms, the use of commercial tests has several other drawbacks, including high testing material costs and RGL norms of unknown appropriateness for military personnel. The goal of this effort was to develop reading tests with appropriate norms. Samples of airmen (n=12,938) were experimentally administered reading tests, including one or two forms of  the AFRAT. After editing, analyses were done to determine the equivalence of the AFRAT forms, their relationships to other tests, AFRAT raw score to RGL equivalents, and training grade validity of AFRAT item types. The two parallel forms of the AFRAT appear to meet administrative and psychometric specifications. AFRAT appears to be a highly reliable instrument and is recommended as a replacement for commercial reading tests. (Author/PN)",

This paper focuses on the development of the AISD Administrator Evaluation System, listing the activities that were conducted from September 1981 to February 1983 to complete the revision of the present evaluation system. Several instruments and evaluation procedures were developed as a result of the revision activities.

Learning to make effective decisions for themselves and for society is an important aspect of competence. They can learn decision making through interacting and solving problems with others. A central ingredient for successful group decision making is constructive controversy. Students should express their opposing views openly, explore other opinions, understand different perspectives, and integrate ideas and information into high quality, accepted solutions. To make controversy constructive, they should realize that they have strongly positive-linked goals; convey acceptance of the other as a person; influence and be open to being influenced rather than  dominate and control each other; and, view the problem as a challenge to solve rather than feel the stress of a crisis or the apathy of underestimation. These results emphasize the importance of having students practice their constructive controversy skills by participating in classroom and school decision making. (Author)",

Two forms were developed--a pictorial test based on color slides of various occupations, as well as a verbal form to be used in comparative studies with samples of persons from different linguistic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Item analyses and factorial studies show that the TTVIT is a reliable nonverbal test (alpha coefficients of .82 to .95) yielding scores on scales corresponding to Holland's interests and personality typology. It is now standardized for the high school and college populations of Quebec and Brazil. Given its 20-minute administration time, the possibility of immediately self-scoring  and interpreting the responses within an empirically based theoretical framework, and the nonverbal nature of the items which facilitate the prompting of an emotional response, the TTVIT is a practical instrument as well as a tool of cross-cultural interest research allowing for direct comparisons from the same stimuli.

The design of this study included four notable features. First, the student outcome domain included a comprehensive range of six affective and three cognitive outcomes. Second, classroom environment was measured with the five scales contained in the Individualized Classroom Environment Questionnaire (ICEQ) and the nine scales which make up an instrument called the Classroom Environment Scale (CES). Third, the sample size of 116 junior high school classes was large and permitted use of the class mean as the unit of statistical analysis where this was considered appropriate. Fourth, it provided a methodological improvement in  that it made use of regression surface analysis to provide a powerful multivariate method of statistical analysis which enabled person-environment interactions to be represented as the products of continuous variables. Results confirmed that students achieved better where there was a greater similarity between the actual classroom environment and that preferred by students. To facilitate future research in the area of classroom environment, attention is given to describing the ICEQ and CES and reporting the impressive validation data obtained with the present sample of 116 classes.

Validity coefficients of the Descriptive Tests of Language Skills (DTLS) subtests, the Academic Tests of the ACT Assessment Program (ACT), and high school percentile rank were calculated with cumulative grade point average (GPA) at the end of each of 4 years of college. The best predictor of cumulative GPA was ACT composite score, although selected ACT subtests and DTLS subtests yielded statistically significant validity coefficients. High school percentile rank, traditionally a significant predictor in other studies, was not predictive of cumulative GPA at any time for this sample. Regression analyses for a subset of 138 of the special admissions  students remaining in college after 4 years showed that, after the first year in college, DTLS subtests did not make a significant contribution to predicting academic success in college over and above the ACT subtests and high school rank. At the end of the first year, three DTLS subtests in combination contributed over and above the ACT subtests and high school rank. DTLS Vocabulary and Logical Relationships separately contributed over and above the ACT subtests, high school rank, and the other two DTLS subtests. (Author)",

The intention is to describe how a multilevel perspective in the specification of substantive questions and, as a consequence, in the analysis strategies employed, can potentially clarify the ways in which instructional practices affect student performance. One multilevel analysis approach examines the interrelations and antecedents of a variety of indices of group-level outcomes. A second approach analyzes multilevel data more formally by modeling the decomposition of data into components suggested by the kinds of educational  processes at work. This second approach incorporates all the features of the previously described analysis within a larger analytical model. In the two-level (classroom, pupil) analysis, multilevel decomposition of the factors influencing cognitive outcomes between and within classrooms addresses four questions, including the relationship between the class composition at pretest and class-level performance at posttest; adjusted between-class effects; pooled within-class analysis; and specific within-class relationships. The function of the specificity of the achievement measures and the general path model for multilevel analysis are examined. (CM)",

When growth on the measure of interest is linear  over time, Blumberg and Porter's methods provide the best estimates. When growth is exponential over time, the results are mixed: under some constraints Olejnik's method is best, but usually Blumberg and Porter's methods provide the best estimates. (Author)",

Reading and mathematics scores of 2944 third-, 2997 fourth- and 2877 fifth-grade students, number of moves, and 13 other variables were collected. These data were examined to determine whether year one and year two test results involve the same populations, whether there are  differences in the California Achievement Reading Test results and Standardized Diagnostic Mathematics Test results of non-mobile students, and whether there is a relationship among other variables contributing to achievement and test results. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyze intra-mobility and outward mobility as independent variables and achievement as the dependent variable. It was found that district schools are not looking at the same population year after year. Therefore the emphasis on test score utilization for instructional planning is invalid. (CM)",

Methodologies for optimizing the match are explored. In each case example, the research focuses on classroom behaviors and related instructional activities. Outcomes of interest include cognitive performance and affective responses from students and teachers. The report considers future directions of research, not only as suggested by the specific  findings of theoretically derived inquiry, but also as such options may be influenced by the reality of political, administrative, and economic constraints.

Fifty-eight special education students were tested. All students had measured reading achievement below the 20th percentile, and were integrated into the regular fifth or sixth grade classrooms for a portion of their academic programs. The appropriate in-level tests and two consecutively lower OLTs of the reading subtest of the California Achievement Test were administered approximately 10 days apart. The results suggest moderate support for the  utility of OLT. It is suggested that the congruence between test content and the instructional programs may have considerably more influence over the reliability and validity of test data than would the use of OLT.

The models used were the three-parameter logistic model and a multidimensional extension of the two-parameter logistic model. The basic design for the analysis of the data was to start with the unidimensional model, evaluate the fit of the model to the data, then increase the dimensionality of the model and perform the same analyses. The dimensionality of the model was to be increased until deviations from fit were acceptably small. Once acceptable fit was obtained, the item parameter estimates were to be analyzed to determine the structure of the ability components required by the test. The  results of the analyses indicated that a two-dimensional solution yielded no better fit than a unidimensional solution, although the test data were selected to be multidimensional. From the results of the analyses it was concluded that the data had a difficulty factor that was sufficiently great as to dominate the other, intended factors. (Author)",

Completeness is the extent to which the known or suspected sources of bias are accounted for by covariates used in an experiment. Causation is the requirement that covariates used in nonrandom research designs are causally related to the dependent variable of a study. Independence is the requirement that there is no treatment/covariate interaction. Fallibility refers to the reliability of the covariate measure. Ways of determining to what degree these criteria are met are suggested. (Author)",

The analysis indicated that the Chinese reported the greatest percentage of health problems in families. Among those who reported having health problems, it was found that: (1) problems frequently cited were minor infectious diseases (such as colds and influenza), heart and circulatory problems, and, as reported by Koreans, pregnancy and childbirth; (2) there was a high rate of utilization of health services; (3) barriers to seeking medical care included lack of information, cost of  services, language problems, and transportation difficulties; (4) about half of the sample sought medical aid from health facilities while half consulted individual medical practitioners more often; (5) most families were covered by health insurance; and (6) major sources of information about medical care were friends, relatives, and doctors. Among those who reported health problems, slightly more had regular medical examinations than among those who reported no health problems. Sex differences and ethnic group differences on health problems and health services usage were also investigated. The report includes 25 statistical tables. (MJL)",

        "description":"While an individual in his own culture is expected to have a stable self concept, one who is placed in a totally different context may experience difficulties because ideas about self in the old society are no longer appropriate in the new one. In order to survive, the individual has to redefine his self concept to make it more functional in the new environment, while retaining the old cultural values. Asians in American society have made such adjustments in self concept. Most previous studies of Asian American self concept, however, have focused on the Westernization of the Asian without considering the influence of traditional culture on self concept development. The few studies that do look at cultural influences tend to generalize observations for all Asians and neglect  ethnic group differences. To a large extent, the tendency to generalize stems from translation difficulties where, for instance, the same English term is used to translate Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino terminologies for value concepts that are similar but have unique connotations within their particular contexts. In view of these cultural differences, it is important that studies of Asian American self concept focus on cultural retention more than on Asian assimilation into American culture. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"Caribbean migration to the United States has largely resulted from capital investment in the region. Such investment attracted labor to areas targeted for high economic development, and when employment opportunities in those areas dwindled, the migrants headed toward the United States, where industries welcomed these sources of cheap labor. While early United States immigration policy favored the entrance of Europeans over other immigrants, changes in policy after 1965 brought in greater numbers of migrants from Third World countries. Caribbean migration to the United States remains economically motivated for the most part. However, recent immigration for political reasons has made it difficult to distinguish between economic and political refugees, and has complicated the  American immigration policy making process. Recent Caribbean immigrants include many women and professional and skilled workers who aspire for upward mobility. It is not clear whether Caribbean countries have lost or gained from their citizens' emigration; what is clear is that the United States has benefited from the influx of both trained and unskilled workers. Among immigrants themselves, entrance into American society may allow some to achieve economic mobility, but may push others into the ranks of the urban underclass. (MJL)",

The West Indians' high degree of literacy, sense of community, and high self esteem have developed black leaders who have earned the respect of enlightened Afro Americans through their achievements in education, politics, and black rights activism. On the other hand, there has been a notable hostility in relations between West Indians and Afro Americans in the 1920s. The tensions seem to stem, on the one hand, from Afro Americans' feelings of superiority over West Indians and the former's resentment of what they perceive to be the latter's air of sophistication; and on the other hand, from the West Indians' own air of superiority because of  their British accents and association with sovereign origins.

        "description":"The School Improvement Program (SIP) is a project which involves over half of California's public elementary and secondary schools and which emphasizes cooperative planning by schools and communities to improve education. The improvement planning process in each school is undertaken by a School Site Council (SCC), composed of the principal, and teacher/staff and parent representatives. In 1980, an independent research group was contracted to conduct a 2-year policy evaluation of SIP. Among the areas covered by the evaluation were: (1) how schools viewed SIP; (2) the district role, school governance styles, parent involvement, and change strategies in SIP implementation; (3) patterns of SIP integration into other school activities; (4) student, organizational, and community  outcomes of the program; (5) factors that influenced outcomes; and (6) specific relationships between program orientation, implementation and staff development, and educational improvement. The findings suggested that SIP best leads to school improvement when it is implemented as the State envisions. In addition, background factors (such as setting, district size, and school and district socioeconomic characteristics) can inhibit school improvement through SIP. Finally, organizational climate, school leadership, and school needs may hamper SIP implementation, but can be manipulated over time to make the program work. (MJL)",

        "description":"This monograph compares foster care systems of New York City and the southern region of New Jersey, focusing on each system's impact on the foster care experiences of Black, Hispanic, and White Children. Recognizing that minority children move through foster care systems at a slower pace than do White children, the report first attempts to determine what factors influence the rate with which children move through the system and either return home or find a permanent adoptive family. Second, an effort is made to identify those factors that are malleable from a policy perspective. Following a general discussion of the history and current magnitude of foster care, the position is advanced that poor overall progress in the goal of permanent homes for foster children and ethnic  differentials affecting that goal result from the disorganized and ad hoc character of foster care in the nation at large. Subsequent chapters describe the system as it operates in New York City and contrasts it with a multilevel reorganized demonstration project in southern New Jersey. Innovations in the New Jersey system are described and their impact on the goal of permanency and on ethnic differentials in outcomes are assessed. In the report's final chapter, structural reasons that account for the poorer outcomes and greater ethnic discrepancies in the New York system are summarized and a number of specific policy changes are recommended.

        "description":"This paper identifies various goals for citizen monitoring groups concerned with the enforcement of rights that accompany racial desegregation, sex equality, and aid for the handicapped in schools, and presents recommendations for successful civil rights group monitoring. It is suggested that successful citizen monitoring requires: (1) establishing the monitoring group as part of the civil rights program; (2) recognizing different viewpoints of group members; (3) clearly specifying the extent of the group's authority; (4) developing appropriate monitoring structures; (5) choosing members carefully; (6) providing appropriate resources; and (7) presenting group reports to the school system. Four types of civil rights monitoring groups are identified according to the type of mandate  imposed on them (statutory, political, educational, or social). The structures, resources, and strategies appropriate for each type, elements that might make for group success or failure, and specific recommendations for group success are discussed. In regard to the problems that monitoring groups may confront, it is held that effective group monitoring depends not only on following general strategies for success, but also on knowing a group's particular mandate and that mandate's implications.

        "description":"A pilot In-School Suspension Program was inaugurated at one junior high and one senior high school in Montgomery County, Maryland, during 1980-81, in order to provide an alternative to out-of-school suspension. To assess the pilot program's effectiveness, an evaluation study examined rates of and reasons for in-school suspension, length of such suspension, race of suspended students, educational disruption, and recidivism. It was found that the pilot schools made extensive use of the in-school suspension alternative, particularly for less serious disciplinary offenses. However, while teachers and students reported feeling that the program was effective, students with more serious suspension records did not agree. Additionally, relatively high recidivism of students whose first  suspension was in-school suggests that negative parental reaction to out-of-school suspension is a major deterrent to student misbehavior. These findings, along with the confirmation for suspended students, indicate that in-school suspension is a viable disciplinary alternative but that several areas require monitoring: (1) students' completion of class assignments while suspended; (2) parental involvement in the in-school suspension process; (3) increases in the overall suspension rate; (4) racial differences; and (5) greater recidivism after in-school suspension.

        "description":"In 1978, the Montgomery County (Maryland) public schools initiated an early admission (EA) pilot program that allowed 5-year olds to enter first grade. Two approaches were utilized: Under Plan I, a small number of 5-year olds entered regular grade 1 classes; under Plan II entire classes of 5-year olds attended school the full day, with the intention that they would cover both kindergarten and first grade curricula by year's end. Initial evaluation showed that only a small percentage of participating students in either group actually went on to be placed in grade 2. Further evaluation collected follow-up information on program graduates in first, second, or third grades. Most of the 21 children placed in grade 2 after the EA program experienced success. The remaining  (approximately 280) children who were placed in grade 1 rated significantly higher than their non-EA classmates in both academic and social development. Difficulties were encountered in predicting achievement on the basis of standardized tests and teachers' ratings. These findings indicate that very few 5-year olds are ready for first grade, but that many children could benefit from a more enriched program than kindergarten presently provides. The evaluation also indicates the need for multiple criteria for identifying children ready for early placement. (Author/GC)",

        "description":"In technologically advanced American society, the black struggle for education is rooted in the historical struggle to overturn racial oppression, economic exploitation, and cultural/ideological domination. In this society, where the state functions to perpetuate existing structures of political, economic, and ideological dominance, education has traditionally operated as an instrument of social control rather than an avenue for social mobility and self-determination. In the face of threats to their survival, black higher education institutions must become active in the overall struggle for black liberation. To serve as a liberating force, black institutions must: (1) stress the study of the African experience and establish linkages with the Pan-African world; (2) emphasize cross  disciplinary studies; (3) seek to understand European philosophy, politics, values, and society; (4) stress research and instruction in technology and science; (5) become future oriented; and (6) provide opportunities for intensive study of policy analysis, planning theory, and organizational principles. Finally, both black institutions and black communities must increasingly interact and become partners in the struggle for black self-determination. (MJL)",

The third section discusses the need to train administrators for school desegregation. It is suggested that the most successful inservice training programs are those that have been planned and implemented by educators themselves;  address specific needs of teachers and administrators in single school settings (including student achievement, improving interpersonal relations, discipline and classroom management techniques, and curriculum innovation); involve participants in program development and implementation; and focus on developing practical skills and responses for the classroom. Models of the components of inservice training programs and the relationship between training areas and outcomes are given. (Author/MJL)",

Part B deals with some of the techniques and methodologies of curriculum construction employed by several countries in the region and attempted elsewhere. This is followed by the discovery procedures engaged in during the Udaipur exercise during which workshop participants went to rural areas and discovered for themselves the procedures for constructing curricula and sample materials. Strategies are suggested for translating the sample curricula into different source materials--motivational, instructional, and followup. A final section covers curriculum evaluation and revision.

Other objectives of the study were to assess the policies and procedures available for employees and to develop guidelines for dealing with the problem. After mailing questionnaires to a 5 percent random sample of American Vocational Association members in the region, researchers obtained usable responses from 443 of the 735 eligible subjects. While only 29 respondents indicated that they had experienced harassment during the past 3 years, 44 teachers reported observing harassment. Comments with sexual meanings were the most commonly mentioned form of harassment, occurring occasionally or as often as 82.6 percent of the time. Because the  victim's most frequent response to the harassment was to ignore it, no change took place in more than one-third of the cases. The major recommended means to stop harassment were to use care in dress, to clarify marital status or commitment to others, and to object openly to the action. In terms of general attitudes toward sex in the workplace, the respondents upheld traditional views. Based on the findings of the study, 10 guidelines were offered for dealing with sexual harassment in vocational education. (MN)",

        "description":"The Job Training Partnership Act requires that private and public sectors work together to create a service delivery system that meets the needs of disadvantaged youth and the needs of a state's work force in its business and industry. This manual, based on a Wisconsin Youth Initiative program at five pilot sites in that state, is intended to provide a better understanding of the role of assessment in the service delivery system in order to assist in local planning activities. The manual is organized into five sections. After the introduction, which describes the Wisconsin project as well as the purposes and use of the manual, the second section describes technical assistance activities initiated by the Wisconsin Governor's Employment and Training Office. This information  provides background on how some of the resources and materials were presented to the local areas. Section 3 describes the steps in planning a coordinated assessment process. These steps are outlined along with specific examples of how local management forums developed in their settings as a means to illustrate how local communities worked to design a coordinated assessment process. Finally, sections 4 and 5 offer additional materials and resources: an annotated bibliography, local management forum membership lists and by-laws, and descriptions of selected vocational assessment instruments.

        "description":"Evaluation, as currently practiced in vocational education, may not contribute to program improvement; in fact, it may be counterproductive. Rather than asking how evaluations can be improved, it might be better to ask if a relationship does, in fact, exist between evaluation and program improvement and, if such a relationship exists, what new assumptions and approaches might improve that relationship. Current activities center around the provisions in the Vocational Education Amendments of 1976 and subsequent guidelines, which provided for the assessment of a sample of the students enrolled in vocational education in quantitative terms related to student achievement measures. Although the conventional notion is that if more resources were available for evaluation, the findings  would be more interpretable for action alternatives, an alternative view suggests that the relationship of social problem solving to evaluation is not clear. Ordinary knowledge, social learning, and interactive problem solving (such as through public hearings) may, in reality, be the basis of social problem solving. Some alternative suggestions for the assumptions that underlie present vocational evaluation practices include (1) abandoning the pursuit of evaluation activities that are purported to contribute to improvement, but do not; and (2) focusing on content and learner decisions at the local level. Further educational research should be conducted apolitically, with the understanding that its findings will take at least a generation to be reflected in changed practices and should  include much social research.

        "description":"This study was conducted to explore the retentive effects of vocational education and the labor market effects of vocational education and dropping out of high school. Data were gathered from the New Youth Cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Force Behavior (NLS Youth) supplemented by high school transcripts. An explanatory model of high school retention and labor market effects was developed that provided the framework for the analyses. The model included five major categories of predictive variables: individual, family, contextual, school characteristics, and high school experiences. Analyses to determine the retentive effects of vocational education focused on the high probability group of students most likely to leave high school without graduating. It was  found that the more vocational education students had taken, the less likely they were to drop out of school. This relationship was significant for grades 10 and 12, but negative and insignificant for grade 11. The size of the effect, however, was small. The study also found that participation in vocational education, when combined with completion of high school, appeared to prevent some unemployment compared to the extent of unemployment experienced by dropouts. This relationship was greater for females than for males. Implications of the study included recommendations concerning possible intervention strategies, the federal leadership role, and areas in need of further research. (KC)",

        "description":"One of the best ways to deal with the conditions that promote stress in the teaching profession would be to include information about stress and ways of coping with it in a teacher preparation program. If prospective teachers have opportunities to examine the nature of stress and of situations that seem to contribute to tension, they would be better prepared to handle some of the special elements in the teaching situation that contribute to stress and eventual burnout. A teacher education program could help students to become more aware of the meaning of teaching and the significant role a teacher plays in childrens' lives. A teacher education program that gives students an increasing degree of responsibility might help prospective teachers to develop a sense of competency and  control. Hope and optimism are fundamental to stability and good mental health and should be encouraged in preservice teachers. Prospective teachers should be taught relaxation techniques and techniques for using time efficiently. They should also be encouraged to form friendships that will allow them to be open about their feelings and concerns. (JD)",

Two questions are addressed: (1) How much do elementary school teachers organize their teaching practice to facilitate parent involvement in home learning activities? and (2) Which factors in the teachers' backgrounds, teaching responsibilities, characteristics of their students, characteristics of the parents they work with, and characteristics of school environment are important determinants of their parent involvement teaching strategies? Results suggest that grade level, student racial composition, parental activity at school, teacher graduate training, and school district policies have strong independent effects on teachers'  practices of parent involvement. In contrast, parent educational level, although an important influence on teachers' attitudes about parent involvement, is not a strong determinant of teachers' actual practices. Teachers who need parents' assistance or who choose to emphasize family-school cooperation have worked out ways to involve parents from all educational levels. (Authors)",

APEP was developed and implemented by 10 member institutions of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. In the Paradigm, institution faculties define generic skill outcomes of their academic programs; select or develop student outcomes and program portrayal measures; identify desired performance standards; and make judgments about discrepancies, defined as &quot;gaps&quot; between the observed and desired levels of performance. Policies and procedures are then formulated to rectify high priority gaps. The generic skills of  communication, analysis, synthesis, quantification and valuing are key components of the Paradigm. Analysis of the two and one-half year project included an institution which completed the Paradigm and six other institutions in which limitations in the implementation of the final stage made results uncertain. Limitations of the Paradigm in its potential goal as a guide for program evaluation include the time factor in completion of all stages, whether population samples are adequate, and the validity of measures of skills.

        "description":"The evaluation strategies and results for Title I programs were compared and contrasted. Two systems of evaluation to examine the nature and effectiveness of Elementary Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title I programs nationwide were implemented. The first involved sponsoring national studies, including the Study of the Sustaining Effects of Compensatory Education and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The other strategy (the Title I Evaluation and Reporting System-TIERS) utilized a system of aggregating locally-implemented evaluations at the state and federal levels. It was implemented nationally in 1979-80. Information was collected through different means for each strategy. TIERS was universally implemented, while national studies sampled only a small  portion of projects. TIERS permitted use of multiple instruments, but national studies generally adopted one specific test. The purpose of the evaluation strategies was to determine what types of compensatory education services were provided and to whom, and how effective services were at improving educational achievement.

A procedure was presented for calculating factor scores when subjects have rated several referents or the researcher wishes to compare factor scores for different subject groups. The procedure was the application of a conventional  factor score coefficient matrix to a doubly-centered matrix of standardized scores.

As a result, most definitions of need can be represented by a mathematical-style change formula. However, most presentations of the concept of change do not completely represent the complexity of the actual needs assessment process. In contrast, field analysis is the process through which changes in a system and its environment are clearly described, so that these changes can be judged to represent either needs, opportunities, or costs. Some of the steps in conducting a field analysis include: defining the field, determining the change to be considered, characterizing the change, and appraising the change. In this view, needs  assessment is a subject of field analysis. (Author/CM)",

This paper outlines the development of the k-sample extension of the two-sample Fligner class of tests, based upon the generalized Puri model.

It was believed that greater time lapses in test administrations would result in greater differences between item parameter estimates obtained from test administration data. The type of test probably influences the stability of item parameter estimates. Parameter stability is affected by the fit of the data to the model. Aptitude test items were a better fit to the three parameter model. Stability of item parameter estimates was influenced more by  differences in group ability than by the length of time between administrations. The item parameter estimates obtained for aptitude test data (SAT-V and SAT-M) had a higher degree of stability than those estimated for achievement tests.

Few response options produced by either approach corresponded with the incorrect student responses. The variation in incorrect student responses illustrated that the use of multiple choice items to test basic mathematics operations would not account for all  student errors.

A multi-dimensional scaling technique is described which derives scores for each item on three dimensions, and allows multiple scores to be derived from the same set of test items. A 35-item English language test was administered to first- and second-grade bilingual students and an inter-item correlation matrix was computed. In an analysis by the INDSCAL program, a three dimensional configuration of pronoun use, object identification and word-endings pronunciation was found. The scale scores, intercorrelations among nine score variables, and degrees of item saliences on  the dimensions were calculated. Five items were classified as multi-dimensional (appearing in all three clusters of items based on dimensions) and seven were identified as uni-dimensional. The possibility of using item dimensionality to reduce the test burden in program evaluation is discussed with suggestions for improving the present procedure regarding scoring algorithms and salience measures.

The Stouffer-Toby (1951) data were reanalyzed using Cloggs' Maximum Likelihood Latent Structure Analysis (MLLSA) and data from Schuman (1970) were reanalyzed using the quasi-independence model. The analysis of data showed that it was possible to extract a two or even higher dimensional solution which can be loosely interpreted. The data failed to produce a coefficient of reproducibility although an alternate goodness of fit measure provided by the model of  quasi-independence show these data to define a Guttman scale tolerably well. Results vary widely regarding the Guttman scale depending on what criterion is used to test the data. Given the resultant data discrepancy, it would be unwise to draw conclusions about the adequacy of a Guttman scale on the basis of a single test. Researchers are encouraged towards sequential testing of unidimensionality and convergence of the three methods if Guttman scaling is to remain a meaningful methodological tool. (Author/PN)",

The model proposed that common forms of student-motivated behavior, such as task engagement, are systematically related to students' cognitive structures and their active inferences and interpretations as they initiate academic tasks. The application was a mechanism for increasing the understanding of a complex set of classroom variables and assessing hypothetical predictions from the model. The results showed that, within a given class, the higher the ability, the more self-esteem students exhibited relative to others in the class; that contextual factors had minimal influence on students'  self-esteem; and, that changes in students' self-esteem did relate to their year-end academic performance. The analyses showed little variation across classes between pre- and post-test self-esteem. Results showed predicted relationships among student verbal ability, internality, self-esteem, and academic performance, as well as evidence that the average ability level of the class may alter such relationships. A more precise specification of cyclical models and an attempt to operationalize variables according to some real-world correspondence should permit more controlled assessments. (Author/PN)",

Tangible cognitive actions are the cross products of beliefs held about a task, the social environment within which the task takes place, and the problem solvers' perceptions of self and their relation to the task and environment. Students' verbal behavior in cognitive performance can be analyzed at three levels: analysis of tactical knowledge of facts, procedures, domain-specific knowledge and local heuristics; analysis of control knowledge, strategic behavior and conscious metacognition knowledge; and analysis of consciously and unconsciously held belief systems that drive problem solving behavior.

These results differed from Pedersen, Faucher and Eaton's (1978) findings. To investigate this anomaly, the primary and multilevel editions of the SRA Achievement Series were administered to a total of 417 students twice a year from first through fifth grade. The results of the analysis, based on the mean levels of achievement in math and reading, showed that students of the identified effective first grade teacher achieved gains in both math and reading and did so repeatedly. However, the students who achieved test score gains over their first grade peers did not achieve gains in  subsequent elementary school grades as fast as students of the other teachers. By fifth grade, the initial gain group of students was over a half of a standard deviation below the mean of other students. It was concluded that early elementary education may be more beneficial if it teaches students how to learn, rather than basic skills. (PN)",

Models suggested by Spearman, Thurstone, Guilford, Vernon, Cattell-Horn and others are reviewed. By combining features of the Vernon and Cattell-Horn models it is possible to construct a more general model, of which most other models are special cases. An empirical study is presented in which a test battery of 16 tests was administered to some 1200 pupils in the sixth grade. The test battery was designed to reflect the Cattell-Horn factors fluid intelligence (Gf), crystallized intelligence (Gc), and general visualization (Gv). A sequence of LISREL-models is presented in which the suggested model for the  organization of abilities is tested. Good support is obtained for the model. In relation to interpretations of G (or Gf), it is proposed that this factor represents the ability to create and execute new assemblies of processes. Gc and Gv are interpreted to reflect the ability to process verbal and figural information, respectively, both as a function of the specific processing requirements posed by these types of information, and as a consequence of previously acquired knowledge.

Self concept, or self perceptions, are viewed as intertwined with an individual's experiences and interpersonal relations in the environment. There seems to be a close relationship between self-perception and motivation shown in research on classroom interactions. A positive classroom climate stimulates the students' emotional responses to the group, their self concepts and motivations toward legitimate educational goals. The study was conducted to test the relationship between different aspects of self perception, as well as between self perception and motives in Norwegian children. The trends were compared to studies done with children in the United  States. Results of the study indicated children high in Motive for Success had high self perceptions. However, children high in Motive to Avoid Failure had low self perceptions. The findings were confirmed, though modified, through a discriminant function analysis. Discriminant function results need further elaboration in future research before generalizations can be attempted. (Author/DWH)",

A sample of second grade children and their families were studied. Family socioeconomic status (SES) information was collected during semi-structured home interviews. Family environment information was collected in the same manner. LISREL was used for covariance structural analysis. Reading and mathematics achievement scores were positively associated with self concept in the sample population. The relationship was stronger for reading, than for mathematics, achievement. Achievement  performance appeared to influence self concept more strongly than self concept affected achievement.

Title I evaluation was used by SEAs to: insure local compliance with state and federal requirements; assist in recognition of problems that required programmatic intervention at the local level; provide a basis for recommending solutions to those problems; and act as input to educational decisions under consideration at the state level. At the LEA level, Title I evaluation data were used by a variety of personnel--including school boards and other external agencies, district  administrative staffs, school principals, and individual school personnel to: modify attitudes; recognize or identify problems; prompt administrative or organizational action; and induce curricular or instructional change. The factors most responsible for the use of evaluation information were: the reputation of the evaluator; the evaluator's commitment to evaluation use; the interest of decisionmakers and the community; the extent to which the evaluation focuses on local needs; the degree to which evaluation is presented in graphic, non-technical form; and the development of procedures that assist decisionmakers to use evaluation information.

Unfamiliar examiners rarely utilized this cue.

As the evaluator role shifts from this pole, the evaluator fulfills the additional functions of interpreting information, describing the social-political context of the evaluation, and identifying and advocating alternative courses of action. At this  opposite pole of the continuum, the evaluator is portrayed as a change agent, actively participating in the planned change process. This role continuum brings together under the unifying theme of power relationships these and other depictions of the evaluator role which have appeared in the evaluation literature. (Author)",

Begun in September, 1966, the program aims to achieve school desegregation objectives by busing Hartford students to schools in the suburbs and by busing students from schools in less economically disadvantaged areas to schools within the Hartford inner-city area. This report synthesizes findings from program evaluation over the period 1976-1980. Evaluation results are presented on: (1) program impact on students' academic achievement in Grades 3, 5, and 7; (2) program impact on students' attitudes toward school and their peers; (3) career choices and career patterns of Project Concern graduates; (4) factors  associated with student attrition in the program; and (5) the attitudes of parents and teachers toward the program. Appropriate comparisons are made between (1) suburban Project Concern participants; (2) in-city program participants; (3) the classroom peers of suburban program participants; and (4) Hartford students who are not participating in the program. The findings provide evidence of gains in student learning, positive student attitudes, higher career aspirations, and more consistent career patterns among program participants. (Author/MJL)",

The report includes an introductory chapter explaining the conditions that led to the adoption of decentralization; analytical case studies of eight New York City decentralized school districts; and two concluding chapters on findings and implications. The case studies describe the context of decentralization in each district; relationships between school boards and superintendents and between district offices and schools, professional staff, and the community; emergent management styles; and the effects of decentralization on student performance, attendance, and later academic attainment. It is suggested that the New York City experience does not provide an extensive test  of decentralization because of legal ambiguities and inadequate implementation. Nevertheless, it is concluded that even with limited decentralization, significant improvements are evident. Among the findings of the study are: 1) student performance improved in many poor, minority districts; 2) the number of curriculum innovations, staff training programs, and programs to link schools and communities increased markedly; 3) more positive changes occurred in districts where superintendents had greater authority and office staffs were more stable; 4) effective superintendents' management styles varied; and 5) decentralization did not enhance parent participation. The report presents a model outlining the elements of district effectiveness, and concludes by identifying some unresolved problems  in decentralizing districts. (Author/MJL)",

Conducted in Syracuse, New York, the research collected demographic data, descriptions of sample families' surrounding contexts (neighborhood, work world, and personal social networks), and parents' perceptions of children and children's activities. The information was expected to provide insights into aspects of the ecology of family life that are likely to affect and be affected by the intervention program. Chapters one and two explain the purpose, theory, and methodology of the study. Chapter three presents findings on  the effects of mothers' work status and education upon their perceptions of their children. Chapter four examines whether families in poor affluent neighborhoods perceive their neighborhoods as supportive systems for child rearing. Chapter five relates parents' social relationship network structures and their perceptions of their children. Chapter six examines how parents' social networks and racial messages influence children's racial preference patterns. Finally, chapter seven discusses implications of the findings for evaluating the the Family Matters Project. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"This document includes a case summary and the Supreme Court Justices' opinions on Crawford vs Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles. The Crawford case concerned the constitutionality of Proposition 1, a State constitutional amendment ratified by California voters to stop mandatory pupil reassignment and busing within the Los Angeles Unified School District unless the reassignment was mandated by a Federal court to remedy a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Federal Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. The Court opinion, delivered by Justice Powell, held that Proposition 1 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment; was merely a repeal of previous desegregation litigation; was not enacted with discriminatory intent; and had legitimate nondiscriminatory  objectives, mainly the educational benefits of neighborhood schooling. Concurring, Justice Blackmun distinguished between the Crawford case and the case of Washington vs Seattle, maintaining that in the latter case, the State electorate reallocated decision-making authority to make it more difficult for minorities to achieve legislation in their interest, while in the former, California voters merely repealed the right to invoke a judicial busing remedy. In dissent, Justice Marshall maintained that Proposition 1 reallocated State power and deprived minorities of the only effective method of redress, namely the full remedial powers of the State judiciary.

        "description":"This monograph reviews research and educational reports to examine the state of the art in preservice and inservice teacher education in the urban community in the United States. A review of urban areas in the last thirty years reveals major social and environmental changes, such as population increases, shifts in racial composition, the introduction of desegregation, and declining resources which have required unique responses to urban educational needs. Examination of how teachers have responded to the changes indicates factors that make for effective teachers and effective schools in urban areas. An exploration of preservice education programs for urban communities emphasizes the importance of urban-based field training and provides descriptions of selected innovations  developed by American higher education institutions to improve their preservice education programs. An investigation of inservice programs for urban education identifies inservice education needs and goals, reviews the history of inservice urban education programs, identifies models and types of inservice programs being carried out by various urban school districts, and identifies problems and needs of inservice educational research and evaluation. Finally, prospects for further improving urban schools through teacher training based on what is known about urban change and effective urban education are considered. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"This paper summarizes several research findings in order to determine the urban high school characteristics that are most likely to decrease alienation among inner city, minority students, and to make their attitudes toward education, themselves, and their futures more positive. First, the paper discusses the phenomenon of alienation in society and in the schools, and considers how attitudinal and behavioral signs of alienation are related to student achievement. The author then examines specific studies done in comprehensive high schools, desegregated schools, alternative schools, and private/Catholic schools to identify school characteristics and other factors that bring about student alienation, disruptive behavior, stress, and poor achievement, and the factors that make for  positive student achievement and behavior in particular settings. A concluding summary of the points made throughout the literature review includes: (1) the suggestion that alienation is a broad category and must be used as a means of understanding otherwise isolated variables like student violence, dropout rates, and low achievement which point to the same underlying condition; (2) identification of organizational elements that foster alienation and those that decrease alienation; (3) identification of administrator, teacher, and student characteristics that contribute to improved schooling; and (4) emphasis on the importance of values in helping to decrease student alienation.

The fourth report focuses on the characteristics of high risk secondary school students, discusses skill areas that they need to develop, and examines instructional methods that have proven effective with such students.

The program strategy involved the use of resource specialists who exposed staff to on-the-job and degree-related training in applying improved techniques for teaching reading in the native language. This report describes the districts which participated in the program; teachers/teacher aides and students  involved in the programs; program organization; and the details and problems of implementing the Greek, Haitian, Italian, and Spanish components respectively, in specific districts. Several advantages of the program are identified, but problems of organization are recognized as well. Recommendations for program improvement are presented. (Author/MJL)",

Evaluation indicates that (1) the program improved participants' attendance and attitudes toward school; (2) participants mastered English syntax objectives at rates that exceeded program goals; and (3) program attendance generally exceeded school-wide attendance.

In addition, the role of the education system in the school-to-work transition was examined. Data for the study were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, integrated with 1970 Census data. Results inferred from this data include the following: (1) the probability of migration is positively influenced by knowledge of labor market factors, lower socioeconomic background, fewer number of years in residence at high school location, verbal and mathematical aptitude, and  marriage for females; (2) migration is not affected by race, sex, or rural residence; (3) migration enhances the employment prospects for persons initially without jobs, especially students; (4) postsecondary education favorably influences employment changes and wages; (5) the graduates used mostly informal methods to seek employment, such as friends and direct application to firms; however, using employment agencies, school placement agencies and union registration is more likely to result in finding a job. The study implies that geographic mobility can be viewed as a productive undertaking for promoting upward mobility once a young person has successfully entered the labor force and gained employment.(KC)",

        "description":"The development of adult education in the Detroit area during the years 1875-1932 was intimately tied to the social, political, and economic events of that time span. Data gleaned from census records, Board of Education minutes, old maps, street guides, labor legislation, educational legislation, church records, advertisements, alien registrations, financial records, and political election results provide insight into the trends of the times that influenced the qrowth of adult education. For example, the tides of immigrants--first German, then Irish, later Polish--that poured into the city in the late 1800s to work in the automobile factories necessitated the formation of &quot;naturalization&quot; and &quot;Americanization&quot; schools. These schools became organized after the turn of the century,  from earlier fragmentary beginnings, with the creation of adult evening schools in Detroit. Especially influential in the growth of these evening schools was Frank Cody, general supervisor of adult education for the Detroit Public School System. Another pervasive influence in adult education in Detroit was the Catholic Church, which operated adult education programs, including colleges, and whose history in the city is entwined with the growth of the adult education movement. (Further research into historical records of the city and the Church is suggested to provide a more complete picture of the history of adult education in Detroit.) (KC)",

An introduction views the relationship of job placement programs to vocational education and the importance of continual research in this area in light of three factors: responsibility for job placement, accountability, and socioeconomic factors. Section 2 explores definitions and models for job placement programs. It looks at career guidance and career education, state models and guidelines for implementing job placement services, and staff development models. These common elements of job placement programs are discussed: program planning and coordination, program operations, career guidance and preemployment preparation, followup  evaluations, and follow-through. Section 3 examines variations in program implementation among states, between secondary and postsecondary programs, and in organization. In the next section, legislation with which program planners and operators should be familiar is summarized, and other components of today's programs are reviewed, such as services for special populations, preemployment skills training, and information systems. Section 5 suggests future directions, including further implementation of effective programs through dissemination of information about effective programs, staff development, and improved program evaluation procedures.

        "author":["Campbell-Thrane, Lucille"],
        "description":"Adults often prefer self-directed learning over teacher-directed, classroom-oriented learning. They feel that their life experiences and self-initiated projects teach them more than they can learn in a formal classroom situation. Persons usually do not pursue such self-directed learning, however, because of conflicting role requirements, a lack of facilities, and a lack of rewards or credentials. The most important obstacle is the lack of credentials for self-directed learning. There are personal, economic, and social constraints on any person's decision and authority to award credentials. A learning contract brokerage model is proposed to help the determined self-directed learner to overcome these constraints to credentialing. The model would set up a brokerage system in which  the learner can do needed work for a teacher--who then becomes a &quot;client&quot;--in exchange for an academic credential, or some similar item, such as a letter of recommendation. A third party serves as the &quot;broker&quot; between the learner and client, and helps to overcome the issue of high-status teacher versus low-status learner. The market dynamic is also accounted for in the model as a means of motivating productivity and rewarding creativity. A model contract is proposed for the brokerage. (KC)",

The specific focus of the hearings was vocational guidance and counseling, as specified in H.R. 4974, the Vocational Guidance Act of 1981. Testimony was given by Jeffrey Drake, coordinator of career development in Flint, Michigan; Norman C. Gysbers, representative of the American Vocational Association; Nancy Pinson, representative of the American Personnel and Guidance Association; James Stevens, West York Area High School, York, Pennsylvania; and Robert W. Stump, educational consultant in Arlington, Virginia. All testified about the efficacy of vocational guidance and the need to implement the provisions of H.R. 4974. The bill proposes first, to clearly identify and define  the vocational guidance component of vocational education; second, to insert a consideration of vocational guidance at appropriate places throughout the Vocational Education Act when reauthorized; and third, to increase the set-aside of federally supplied state monies from 4 to 6 percent to be used for vocational guidance. These guidance personnel also spoke about the need for guidance on the pre-adolescent level rather than only on the senior high school level, and for the need to simplify reporting procedures so that better accountability can be achieved. Cited were successful vocational guidance programs as well as the problems vocational guidance personnel have due to lack of time and financial support. (KC)",

The specific focus of the hearings was vocational education personnel development. The graduate leadership development program provides opportunities for experienced vocational educators to study full-time in an advanced study program for up to 3 years. The teacher certification fellowship program provides opportunities for unemployed, previously certified teachers and persons from business, industry, and agriculture to seek certification in vocational instructional areas in which a need for teachers has been identified. Major testimony was taken from state department personnel development staffs, university vocational teacher education directors,  professors of vocational and technical education, and the assistant secretary for Vocational and Adult Education, U.S. Department of Education. The witnesses testified about the previous uses made of these programs and the need for them to continue under the reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act. Statistics were cited on how many people had become vocational education teachers, how many university vocational teacher educators had been prepared, and how many vocational teachers are still needed. Also examined were other programs under the provisions of this section of the act, including projects of national significance, the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, and vocational education personnel training.

Seven interview instruments were created and administered by members of Delta Pi Epsilon to various types of word processing personnel, secretaries, managers, and equipment vendors. A total of 341 organizations were surveyed with 336 usable responses. Some of the conclusions drawn through analysis of the data collection are the following: employment opportunities for word processing personnel will continue to grow in the next 5 years; competencies needed by  secretaries and word processing personnel include transcription skills, typing with speed and accuracy, listening and following directions, using a filing system, and organizational skills; and on-the-job training usually follows high school business skills training, with 3 months of training on magnetic tape equipment usually satisfactory. The information obtained from this study, literature review, comparison of related research, and analysis of data suggests that business education departments emphasize the following: typing with accuracy of at least 50 words per minute; using English correctly, and learning formatting procedures; exposing students to work measurement practices; stressing English skills; teaching the relationship between word processing and data processing; developing  internship programs; and maintaining close contact with word processing users.

        "description":"The General Accounting Office recently studied automation, especially the advent of microelectronics, and its impact on unemployment. The study included identifying available information sources and obtaining opinions on the impact of automation on employment, federal efforts to predict its impact, the dissemination of information about the job outlook in the United States, and existing mechanisms for getting the displaced worker into gainful employment. The study found that automation (1) reduces the number of people required to perform the same tasks, causing displacement of people; (2) changes the nature of tasks performed by people who retain their positions; and (3) creates new occupations and increases the number of jobs in existing occupations in the same or other  industries. The GAO also found that the Department of Labor forecasts there will be increased jobs despite automation, although it is impossible to measure the overall net impact. Debate arises on these predictions because of uncertainty of the rate at which new technology is going to be implemented, complexities of the issues affecting unemployment, and an absence of comprehensive data on the net change in unemployment that has occurred because of automation. The report also predicted that displacement would affect persons with high-level skills with above-average incomes, as well as those in entry-level, low-income jobs. The study concluded that little information is available about what happens to those who are displaced, and that this area should continue to be monitored.  (KC)",

        "description":"With expiration of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) impending, the United States General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed four types of adult-oriented service: classroom training, on-the-job training, work experience, and public service employment. The GAO researched and synthesized program administrative data and the results of evaluation and research studies, and analyzed employment statistics to determine who enrolled in the programs, what types of services and what benefits were provided them, what were the employment experiences of the enrollees both before and after participating in CETA, and how effective the services were. GAO found the following four outcomes, among others: (1) CETA adult-oriented services were well targeted--the enrollees were  generally disadvantaged economically and educationally, which affected their employment stability; (2) outcomes differed for the four services, but these differences were expected since occupational areas and characteristics of participants also varied; (3) on the average, early participants were better off after CETA than before in terms of increased employment and earnings and reduced reliance on public benefits; and (4) because of limited data, CETA's effectiveness can be addressed only in terms of earnings. No more than a small proportion of the improvement in earnings can be attributed directly to CETA, but women and individuals appear to have profited more than other groups as a result of the program.

Basic findings of the study are that (1) existing relationships between education institutions and the business sector are complex, while relationships with the labor  sector are being built from a very limited base of prior contacts; (2) attention to the needs of collaboration with education is being given by business leaders especially as a focus on the elementary and secondary schools; (3) gradually, more interaction among education, business, and labor is leading to new patterns for education and training; and (4) career education and career development activities have been the focus taken by local collaborative councils. Recommendations are made for improvements in the collection and dissemination of information essential to the creation of effective programs of industry-education-labor collaboration nationwide; for improvements in the leadership of collaborative activities; and for federal and state government actions encouraging such  collaboration.

It is intended for use by a wide variety of organizations whose members may or may not belong to unions. The handbook contains five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the book and provides an overview of Project Opportunity, while chapter 2 explains how to conduct a needs assessment to determine local needs for such a program. Chapter 3 then addresses the development of a program designed to meet the needs identified through the  assessment process; establishing a resource center is the focal point of the program. In chapter 4, techniques which local administrators can use are presented, while the final chapter suggests ways to get organizations to undertake and support an opportunities program, including outreach, orientation, and organization. The appendix contains an annotated bibliography, two case studies from the project, summaries of the training sessions, resource agencies, and a listing of people who participated in the experiment.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) reviewed the Department of Labor's efforts to find permanent unsubsidized jobs or new training opportunities for these individuals with eight prime sponsors through interviews with Department of Labor officials, interviews with the prime sponsors, and a review of 1,040 randomly selected case files of persons terminated from the program. For seven of these sponsors (the other was not considered by GAO to be representative) GAO found that (1) 45 percent of the former public service employment participants were employed, 50 percent were unemployed, and  5 percent were in school or training; (2) almost 24 percent of the employed individuals held temporary jobs and another 21 percent had part time jobs; (3) about 54 percent of the employed were working in the private sector; (4) 55 percent of the unemployed individuals were receiving one or more forms of government assistance--this help averaged $353 per month less than their former public service employment salary; (5) most of the unemployed individuals were looking for work; and (6) participants' perceptions of help in job search and job placement activities received from local agencies varied widely.

        "description":"This document is a transcript of hearings conducted in Hartford, Connecticut, before the United States Senate Subcommittee on the Handicapped on the effects of deinstitutionalization of the mentally retarded. The bulk of the testimony was given by Connecticut officials and leaders in the mental health field. They presented evidence and case histories about the progress that has been made in closing mammoth state hospitals and placing the former residents in apartment and group homes in communities throughout the state. They indicated that many of the former hospital patients had made good adjustments and were being accepted by the community. In opposition to the state's official deinstitutionalization policy, parents of more severely retarded children testified that they want  some larger facilities for the mentally retarded to remain open. They are involved in lawsuits to stop the state from closing some of the intermediate-sized facilities which they feel are the only realistic living arrangements for their children. They fear that deinstitutionalization would lead to ridicule and abandonment in a community setting.

        "author":["Fox, Shirley Robock"],
        "description":"The State of Michigan, through its interagency Collaborative Initiative begun in 1979, has established local Interagency Collaborative Boards (ICBs) similar to work-education councils, in 30 of the 33 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) prime sponsor areas in the state. These boards, unlike mandated councils, are not advisory to any one segment of the community, but provide a neutral forum for all sectors to identify mutual interests and to develop programs for mutual benefit. A review of the Initiative from its beginning in 1979 was made through written documentation provided by the state, interviews with state-level persons involved in the initiative, five case studies in diverse ICB communities, and individual profiles prepared locally by each ICB. The evidence  gathered indicates that, in each community in which an ICB is well established, knowledge is being shared and activities are being collaboratively planned and implemented. These activities are enabling youth and adults to make the transitions between education and employment with employability skills and better knowledge of their options, are reducing duplicative services in the community, and are providing for more efficient delivery of pre-employment and placement services. To enhance the continued growth of local collaboration in Michigan communities, the following recommendations are made: (1) that the state expand its collaborative activities as a model for local collaboration; (2) that the state provide more funding as a replacement for federal funding; (3) that the state provide  other supportive services to the ICBs; and (4) that ongoing assessment of ICB initiative should be conducted.

        "description":"This study was undertaken to identify the reading strategies which facilitated or inhibited the progress of adult beginning readers (ABRs). An ethnographic approach was used so that factors influencing the ABRs' acquisition of these reading strategies could be identified. Using an adapted form of the Goodman and Burke taxonomy of oral reading miscues as initial framework, the investigators described reading behaviors of ABRs who were enrolled in the beginning learning-to-read classes at two adult basic education (ABE) sites in the Richmond, Virginia, metropolitan area. Although the idiosyncratic reading behaviors of ABRs precluded generalization, it was inferred that ABRs who thought of reading as discovering meaning were aware of when they were not gaining meaning; and those who  had been exposed to syllabication and could manipulate vowels and syllables tended to make progress. ABRs who thought of reading as word calling, who did not make successive attempts at words, and who had trouble reorganizing visual input tended to make less progress. Implications for instruction include the observations that (1) ABRs who thought their teachers took into account their learning styles tended to stay in programs; (2) that the way a teacher conducts a lesson provides a model for learning; and (3) that students' beliefs about reading, perhaps guided by prior schooling, also influenced ABRs' reading strategies. Further research was suggested in order to establish guidelines for ABR instruction. (KC)",

Section 1 provides guidelines for content usage by dissemination group and usage of charts, forms, and samples. Section 2, Conceptual Framework, defines dissemination, discusses the dissemination process, and identifies the roles, responsibilities, and benefits of dissemination. Section 3, Dissemination Process, describes the six steps in the dissemination process and provides information on dissemination before, during, and after funding. Section 4, Human Resources, is divided into (1) Quick Reference lists of national and state networks that identify organizations, acronyms/abbreviations, descriptions, pages for more  information, and main contact persons; (2) abstracts and listings of National Networks affiliated with vocational program improvement efforts; and (3) abstracts and listings of State Networks directly affiliated with vocational education in Illinois. Information provided for each group in parts 2 and 3 include name, acronym, description, linkages, materials dissemination, target populations, dissemination services, access, and contract information. Section 5 contains two procedural forms--Dissemination Planning Outline and Primary Product Quality Assurance Rating Form--and 20 samples (aids) for planning, conducting, and assessing dissemination.

        "description":"A study examined the effects of two organizational structural elements--gender appropriateness of job assignment and mix of women and men in a work group--upon the attitudes and behavior of Navy women. Effects of being assigned to a traditionally feminine or masculine job were examined and related to attrition, satisfaction, and reenlistment. Effects of being in a male-dominated, balanced, or female-dominated work group on satisfaction, expectations, and intentions toward remaining in the Navy were investigated. Samples of about 1000 men and 1000 women who joined the Navy in 1975 were followed throughout their first enrollment. Results showed that gender composition of work group was not related to the dependent measures. Being assigned to a job traditional for members of one's  gender or to one that is nontraditional was not related to women's attrition, satisfaction, advancement, or reenlistment. Among men, rates of attrition and advancement were greater and reenlistment rates were lower for those in jobs considered nontraditional for women. Rates of advancement, migration, and completion of the first enlistment showed no gender differences. (Some conclusions are made based on the entire 4 years of the research.) (YLB)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine whether unit level individual skill training is being provided to prepare Army enlisted personnel to perform critical job tasks within their military occupational specialty (MOS). The General Accounting Office reviewed the Army's skill training programs at 10 active units in the continental United States and five active units in Europe and administered questionnaires to more than 6,300 soldiers throughout the Army. Results showed that 54 percent of the noncommissioned officers believed only half or fewer of the soldiers they supervise were adequately trained for combat duty in their MOS. Factors impeding effective training were shortage of experienced trainers, high personnel turnover rates in operational units, and lack of functional training  equipment and ammunition. It was recommended that the Army's management oversight system for training be strengthened by increased monitoring of programs and improved evaluative information. It was found that the Army has recently announced initiatives to improve individual skill training effectiveness, including assignment changes to make more trainers available, rotation policy changes, and an extended basic training program.

The performance of each student was recorded along with other measures such as Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery scores, age, years of education, and primary language spoken. The relationship between RGL and performance was found to be small. In self-paced, but not in group-paced, schools, the relationship between reading skills and school performance was a function of the amount and relative difficulty of the reading required. In  self-paced courses, increasing the difficulty of the text resulted in a decrease in the relationship between student reading skill and school performance. When the text was very difficult, students seemed to turn to other means of learning, and reading skill became less important. When students used a variety of learning materials and strategies to compensate for and augment the text, no specific strategy was found to relate strongly to performance.

Discussion in chapter 2 focuses on development of historical views toward work. Chapter 3 looks at these topics affecting the survival and strengthening of the work ethic: women in the labor force, men's earlier retirement, black unemployment, work motivation amidst poverty and unemployment, and expansion of leisure and nonwork time. Chapter 4 reviews job satisfaction surveys and examines the weaknesses of evidence of discontent. Changes in the nature of work are discussed in  chapter 5, including shifts toward service and white-collar employment, technological innovation, robotics, microprocessors, and automation. Chapter 6 describes the worker of tomorrow, while chapter 7 considers reform from a historical perspective. Obstacles to long-term and widespread change (job redesign and participative management) are examined in chapter 8.

        "description":"In order to satisfy the needs of the many adults without a high school diploma, the New York State External High School Diploma Program was developed in 1972 as an alternative high school credentialing program for adults who have acquired skills through their life experiences and can demonstrate these skills in applied performance tests. The program's objective is to validate these skills by providing an assessment and credentialing process that is an alternative to traditional high school equivalency testing programs. This booklet provides a detailed account of the assessment procedures and materials used in the program. Following a brief description of the program in the Introduction, part 1 describes the diagnostic procedures and contains a synopsis of each of the diagnostic  instruments. Part 2 describes the procedures used to assess the generalized life skills competencies. It also provides a synopsis of the original set of tasks, a brief description of the new set of tasks, and a sample task which illustrates the sorts of activities completed by candidates in the program, as well as the evaluative procedures used to assess candidate performance in each phase of the task. Part 3 describes the procedures used to determine which individualized competency should be used to assess a candidate, and gives a sample performance interview used for assessing security guard skills.

        "description":"The typical approach to studying the cognitive competencies of the elderly involves giving the same task to samples of elderly adults and college students. On such comparisons of performance of cognitive tasks, the elderly have almost always been found to be inferior, which is interpreted as indicating an irreversible age-determined decline in cognitive ability. A recent study was conducted to test the hypothesis that success on experimental tasks depends upon skills and strategies associated with formal schooling and that the elderly, removed in time from the school setting, no longer have ready access to these skills and strategies. The research involved an attempt to determine whether, within an elderly population, academic skills could be reinstituted through brief  intervention and whether the ease of doing so would depend upon level of schooling. The basic technique involved giving a group of 99 white women with 6 to 17 years of schooling and a mean age of 72.6, matrix problems to solve independently. If they were unable to do so, progressively more explicit prompts for solution were provided. Transfer of training was assessed both by the extent to which subjects reduced the number of prompts needed and by their performance on novel problems for which no hints were available. It was found that training elevated the score on transfer across all educational levels and problem types (although college-educated subjects scored higher). An implication from the research is that to test elderly people in the same manner as school children and to assume the  comparability of the results ignores the fact that the elderly are not members of the test-taking society. Such procedures are unfair to them and show a loss of cognitive ability that may not reflect reality. (KC)",

Following an overview, section 1 introduces employability in the 1980s, anticipated outcomes of coordinated services, and a rationale for the &quot;Let's Work Together&quot; models for three eudcational settings. Section 2 offers techniques for coordinating services around the five essential minimum areas of a coordinated program: administration organization, services to youth, educational/employability development services, work experiences, and transition from school to work. Models  of coordinated services that have been used in the state of Washington are described in section 3 according to the essential administrative program areas. These include comprehensive high school (large high school), pre-vocational program (vocational-technical institute), vocational cooperative program (small high school), regional skills center, and juvenile justice programs. Section 4 tells what local and national resources exist and how to find them. Annotations are provided for these types of resources: vocational agencies in the State of Washington, occupational and career information delivery systems, assessment instruments, and helpful resources. Appendixes include an assessment instrument, a glossary, sample interagency agreements, and other sample program forms. (YLB)",

It sought to determine whether individualized, computer-managed instruction (CMI) can be used to avoid some of the administrative difficulties common to more conventional forms of job-specific training, and it sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of this form of instruction. Individualized, job-specific courses were developed for three organizational-level billets in an A-7E squadron--power plant maintenance technician, structures/hydraulics maintenance technician, and plane captain. The courses were supported by the Navy's CMI system. Students, trained in the job-specific courses, tended to do better than conventionally-trained counterparts on a series of written  and performance tests. They were rated about the same by supervisors on the job. Training time for the power plant and structures/hydraulics maintenance technicians were reduced by about one half. For plane captains, the reduction was only about 10 percent. Use of CMI alleviated many administrative difficulties. It was suggested that the initial high cost of material development could be offset in the future by training time reductions. Appendixes include outlines of course content and results of tests and questionnaires. (YLB)",

        "description":"The most common approach to self-management research has been to apply it to a specific target behavior, without attending to the generalizability of changes to other facets of one's life. A procedure for measuring self-management effectiveness under real world conditions was developed which emphasized the successful application of self-change procedures. The Self-Description Form (SDF) was field-tested on a sample of four groups of college students (N=214). Results indicated that normative self-management scores increased as level of education increased. Females had higher self-management scores than males except on the leisure scale. The reliability of the self-description scale was confirmed although validity efforts are still in the preliminary stages of analysis. When fully  developed, the form may be useful in evaluating counseling and educational programs and in predicting an individual's future effectiveness in leisure, health, social and work activities. Several tables and figures are provided to illustrate SDF reliability and validity. (JAC)",

To reduce levels of dogmatism in counselor trainees, a program was developed and tested at Southwest Texas State University. The new course, \"Guidance to Meet the Needs of Multicultural Students,\" gave counseling students the opportunity to learn counseling skills by observing and interacting with students from a local Job Corps Training Center. Tests showed that students who took the experimental course had significantly reduced dogmatism scores compared to the other students. Data confirmed that dogmatism is a mutable characteristic that can be significantly reduced. (JAC)",

        "description":"Women have historically been under-represented in the medical profession in part because the norms of feminine behavior have deviated from behavior expected of physicians. To determine the career and family expectations of current medical students, 320 medical students were surveyed. Results confirmed the hypothesis that even sex-role-modern women perceive family rewards to outweigh the benefits of maximizing career rewards. Abortion attitudes tended to correlate with attitudes about women's rights and sex roles; female medical students held more proabortion attitudes than males. Contrary to prediction, women medical students experienced more role strain than men. Most women students expected equal sharing of child care and household responsibilities while men expected to  contribute less. The findings suggest that recognition of the importance of family relationships may help reduce the emotional and psychological stress of being a physician. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"The current trend toward increased participation of women in the work force has produced an emerging contemporary model of dual career families. Previous research about the dynamics of successful working couples has emphasized the need for an investigation of personality characteristics of such couples. Dual career couples (N=51) were separated into groups in which both partners expressed either high satisfaction or low satisfaction with the marriage. Sharp differences were seen between groups on intragroup correlations and mean differences, with the low satisfaction group partners different from each other and the high satisfaction group partners similar to each other. Females, when compared across groups, were generally similar while males were generally different. Compared to  the general population, subjects were generally stable in the various personality traits regardless of marital satisfaction. The data suggest that partners involved in dual career marriages operate under interesting dynamics, indicating a need for further research. (Author/JAC)",

        "description":"The revelation that three-quarters of a million adolescents leave home without permission each year has received national attention. Yet most lay persons and many professionals know little about the problem. A review of the professional literature on runaways shows an almost equal division between males and females who are more likely to be from low income families. Most runaways do not run far or stay for a long time period. About one in five report unhappy experiences on the road and 3 percent report traumatic experiences. About two-thirds run away because of conflict with parents, while about three-fourths do so because of poor performance in school. Related issues that professionals must be aware of include decriminalization and the need for alternative living arrangements  and expanded opportunities for youth employment. (JAC)",

To investigate interrelationships among selected motivational variables, demographic, motivational and achievement characteristics of 400 elementary school students in Grades 4, 5, and 6 were measured. Results indicated that ability and effort were the dominant causal factors in classroom motivational processes, although incentive value was also important. Classroom motivational processes were rooted, in part, in the degree to which an individual's self-concept of ability was realistic. The findings suggest that motivation is a dynamic process in which perceived outcomes are evaluated and then incorporated  into one's self-concept of ability. (JAC)",

Results showed, contrary to expectations, that amount of self-disclosure increased with age across all situations. The youngest two groups chose their mothers; the oldest group most often chose a friend as target for self-disclosure. Females chose to self-disclose more than males.

        "description":"Peer influence on students has been of interest to sociologists for some time. But most studies of elementary classroom interaction have focused primarily on teacher-student interaction. A study of peer influence on other group members was designed to explain why students assigned to low ability groups became inattentive more frequently than students assigned to high ability groups. Sixteen videotapes of reading classes in a first grade classroom with 23 students were analyzed. The students were assigned to four ability groups: high, medium-high, medium-low, and low. Results indicated that peer influence was one process by which ability group assignment influenced student attentiveness. Often one student's behavior affected several peers simultaneously. Verbal behavior was more  distracting than nonverbal behavior. Most cases of peer influence on attentiveness occurred in the medium-low reading group, indicating that boredom may have been an influencing factor. The finding that students influenced peers so frequently during the teacher-directed lessons suggests that peers are likely to be important influences on students' behavior during most classroom lessons.

However there is little information available concerning the expectations of middle class parents. Middle class nonparent teenagers (N=50) and two parental groups (participants in Lamaze prenatal development classes (N=19) vs. those who had not participated in Lamaze classes (N=26) were assessed on their beliefs concerning developmental milestones in early childhood. Results indicated that the teenagers' mean scores were more realistic than the parental groups in several areas (e.g., motor development). However, a closer examination of error scores (absolute deviation from norm) revealed that the teenagers made  statistically significantly greater errors while the parental groups (especially the Lamaze subjects) were closer to the norms, but still precocious in their expectations. The results may be a result of the &quot;Proud Parent Syndrome,&quot; a phenomenon identified in previous research that finds parents, after their child's birth, concluding that their child is developmentally advanced compared to a normal child.

Data analyses revealed that perceived role characteristics and personality variables differed across educational levels, while factors considered when taking another job differed based on the administrator's work experience. Administrators who began their career in mental health and had held two or more direct service positions engaged  in more diversified and general activities than less educated or experienced administrators.

To investigate the potential interaction of applicant sex and attractiveness on hiring decisions, the type of job, applicant sex, and applicant physical attractiveness were manipulated to determine the effect of attractiveness on job performance. Resumes with unattractive or attractive photographs were shown to 105 interviewers who rated applicants on several dimensions. Results showed that physical attractiveness influenced employment decisions. More attractive individuals were thought to have better personalities. Employment interviewers were also influenced by the applicant's sex, so that males were generally offered higher starting  salaries than females even when the two were equally rated on the decision of whether to hire. The findings, which differed from earlier research using the same materials with college students acting as interviewers, suggest that actual interviewers may have different biases than college students.

A review of the literature confirms that adolescent pregnancy is far from a random event. Research indicates differences, often substantial, among those who have sex or abstain and their responses to pregnancy. There is strong evidence that those who avoid pregnancy during adolescence will acquire more of the education needed to realize full potential as a self-sufficient adult. Adolescents need support in combatting the effects of peer influence and in defining career goals which might motivate them to avoid pregnancy. Provision of services by the school or community might also help reduce the negative aspects of  adolescent parenthood. (JAC)",

Counseling psychologists have attempted to address these concerns through assertiveness and aspects of parenting training. In a previous study, a three-component confrontation model--specified behavior, emotional reaction, consequence of behavior--was examined for use with female confrontees. In a replication of that analogue study of angry confrontation between friends, subjects were 56 male college students who completed the Expressed Attitude Toward Confrontation Questionnaire (EATCQ). Results indicated that the complete model (all three components present) had as great or significantly greater impact both statistically and practically than any  other combination of components or the &quot;no component present&quot; condition on every one of the nine outcome measures employed. Findings were consistent over both male and female confronters. The results suggest that direct, concise criticism, while potentially threatening, may provide a basis for negotiating changes with male friends whether done by males or females. (Author/JAC)",

Traditionally women have been the informants in family research. To examine the coparental relationship between divorced spouses, data were collected from both former spouses (N=98 couples). The results supported the importance of using multiple informants in family research. However, conceptualizing the couple as the unit of quantitative analysis poses problems. Couple sum or mean scores may result in the loss of data and are most appropriate under the same conditions when responses from a sole respondent would suffice. For some analyses, separate reports of men's and women's responses are needed. Discrepancies in couples'  responses provide useful information and may enhance an understanding of family dynamics.

A pilot project was undertaken to identify the existing support networks for aging urban and rural widows and the details of the operation of those systems in order to relate the findings to social and educational policy. Preliminary findings from a sample of 49 widows who were neither disadvantaged nor in a low-income group showed a frequent response of \"no one\" as an emotional resource. Children and friends were listed next most frequently. These data reveal unmet emotional needs which could be met through educational experiences. The fact that this sample of \"above average\" widows met most needs through family and friends as resources suggests that  educational planners must recognize widows as independent self-regulating individuals.

To determine if self-reported personality characteristics, when studied in conjunction with tested characteristics, increased the ability to discriminate between academic populations, 50 university sophomores who had declared a major were compared with 50 undecided sophomores. The declared sophomore was identified as more venturesome, conservative, self-assured and intelligent; their self-ratings indicated more sober, self-sufficient, intelligent, venturesome and practical tendencies. Undeclared students appeared to be more timid, experimenting, and less intelligent; their self-ratings yielded responses of being  happy-go-lucky, less intelligent, timid, imaginative, and tense.

The essence of the organic method of teaching is that it touches those things very deep and very real within the child. Teachers who can remain comfortable while taking the risk can use the same organic principles found in the infant room where Ashton Warner first unfolded her theory: of listening for the key to unlock the unconscious; of patient, caring, careful listening; of using the basic instincts of the teacher to flow with, not against, the children; of using the power of destruction and turning it to creativity; of using nature, song, music, and dance; of using touch and taste and sound and every natural element  available to open doors and broaden experience to allow one experience to move and flow into another.

Part one presents the \"Early Studies: Pre-1950\" and contains the studies that were published before 1950. Part two presents \"More Recent Studies: Post-1950\" and contains the studies published since 1950. No attempt is made to classify the studies except in historical sequence. Basically the studies are concerned with the reading, writing, and spoken vocabulary of young children, in grades one, two, and three. Also, \"original\" and  primary sources are used, not secondary. The paper concludes with a summation of the studies, noting that while the earlier studies were mainly concerned with an analysis of vocabulary through frequency word counts and comparison of previously published lists, the last three decades from the 1950s to the present give evidence of a shift in emphasis to a linguistic analysis of the language.

The program was held in 20 sites throughout the city and was scheduled for 4 hours a day. The program was organized around two major instructional components, individual and small group reading sessions and reading-oriented art workshops. At all sites, students attended two 90-minute art workshops per day and were offered a variety of visual, plastic, and performing art experiences. In addition, students were pulled out of the art workshops on a rotating basis for 45 minutes of daily, direct reading instruction. Results of a quantitative and  qualitative assessment of the program indicated that the program was highly effective in meeting its proposed goals. Nearly all of the program participants mastered at least one new skill in reading and many mastered two or more. Despite some start-up difficulties and significant problems with transportation, attendance was excellent, and students were cooperative and eager to learn. Both reading and art teachers were enthusiastic about the program and cited gains made by students in self-confidence, socialization, and creative expression, as well as their measured improvement in reading skills.

Children's reading attempts for these stories were used to evaluate their emergent reading ability in order to test whether there was a relationship between emergent reading ability and the structural &quot;well-formedness&quot; of the stories. Three language productions were obtained: a told story, a dictated story, and a handwritten story. The transcriptions were scored according to (1) the completeness of context (degree of specificity), (2) adapted production story grammar (structural complexity), and (3) emergent  reading ability. The contextual analysis gave support to the claim that children will produce real stories that are more scriptlike and predictable, whereas they will elaborate more upon make-believe stories. There was also some indication that the make-believe stories contained more of the elements of a well-formed story. Furthermore, these elements were more highly specified, or more understandable to a nonpresent audience. When overall structural complexity was judged, however, there were no differences for topic (real versus make-believe) or for mode (told versus dictated), nor was there a regression of emergent reading abilities upon structure.

In each experiment, randomly selected fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students read along with investigators and then indicated the sex of the first person protagonist. Next they ranked the stories in order of preference from one to eight. The first experiment, conducted with 176 subjects, tested the students twice over a 5-week period to  determine the reliability of their responses. The coefficient of stability was moderate. The second experiment tested the hypothesis that students are better able to determine the gender of a character as they age from fourth to sixth grade. However, results with 736 subjects revealed no significant difference for sex, state, or grade. In the last experiment, designed to determine the relationship of sex to preference, 866 subjects recognized sex stereotyped behavior, but their preferences showed high variability.

These data are interpreted as evidence of a &quot;Natural Partitions Theory,&quot; one that holds that the concepts referred to by nouns are conceptually more basic than those referred to by verbs or prepositions. Analysis of data from cross-linguistic studies designed to eliminate nonconceptual differences between words in a language that might account for the earlier acquisition of nouns--such as the position of a word in the sentence, morphological transparency (the ease with which the root can be heard in various uses of the word), and patterns of language teaching strategies--leaves some version of the Natural Partitions hypothesis as the most reasonable view of early vocabulary  acquisition. A cross-linguistic examination of a single sentence suggests that if objecthood is created by spatial relations among perceptual elements, then good concrete objects are particularly cohesive collections of percepts. These highly cohesive collections of perceptual information tend to be lexicalized as nouns by almost every language. Object concepts are given to language users by the world and can be learned one at a time, while predicate concepts form a system in each language, that, from a child's point of view, must be discovered.

Reading instruction was observed on three occasions for each of 10 third and 10 fourth grade classrooms. Observers recorded what was taught, how it was taught, what materials were used, how many students were being instructed together, and how much time was spent on each student. Two instructional patterns were identified. Fifteen teachers divided the students by ability into two or three groups and  worked with them on different materials for about 15 or 20 minutes. Five teachers worked alternately with the whole class and with individuals on the same texts. From the student's point of view, both patterns produced the same, surprisingly low, number of text-related events. Sequence data revealed that most classroom sessions do not contain complete text-related sequences, perhaps because 75% to 80% of instructional events involved text-unrelated exercises from workbooks or skill sheets that take students' time away from reading and learning to comprehend text materials. Every group of students must have time every day to have introduced, to read, and to discuss a text with a teacher's help. (JL)",

        "description":"An exploratory study was carried out in four Los Angeles Title I elementary schools to determine what accounted for the comparatively high reading scores made by these schools' students on the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills; determine whether the schools were engaged in demonstrably effective educational practices that other Title I and similar schools could employ; and determine what those practices were and how they functioned to make a difference in students' reading. Using the framework of ethnographic studies, staff members and students were observed and listened to in a variety of settings: classrooms, labs and offices, the playground and the hallways, faculty meetings, libraries, and lounges. In particular, 24 different classrooms were observed for a total of 10-12  school days. Analysis was aimed at identifying activities, environmental circumstances, beliefs and attitudes, materials, and organizational arrangements common to the four schools and functionally related to teaching/learning and/or test-taking in reading. Findings revealed seven conditions to be common to the four schools: (1) close attention to a continuum of reading skills, joined with a marked emphasis on reading for comprehension, (2) specialization of instruction in reading, (3) \"strong\" experienced teachers with high standards and expectations for student performance, (4) stability of the reading program and key staff members, (5) an emphasis on writing, (6) teacher participation in decision making, and (7) a high degree of both rapport and mutual respect among staff members.

        "description":"A study tested the theory that an item that stands out from its background is better remembered than one that is similar to the background (the isolation effect). Specifically, the study examined whether the isolation effect would be greater when there was a larger and more confusing mass of background items, whether position of the isolated item would enhance memory for it and its surrounding items, and whether varying its position in a list would affect memory. Subjects, 44 college students, were presented with 12 lists of consonants on an overhead projector. Isolation of items was achieved by printing them slightly larger than other items on the lists. ANOVA was used to assess the number of list items and the number of isolated items each subject recalled. The factors analyzed  were (1) type of isolate; (2) scoring (letters correct only if in correct position--strict scoring--and letters correct if recalled in any position--lenient scoring); (3) list length (9, 11, and 13 items); and (4) isolation (isolated and unisolated trigrams). Results showed that the isolation effect was in evidence and, at least for lenient scoring procedures, support the theory that the effect increased with increases in list length. This theory was not supported with strict scoring procedures, however. The findings suggest that isolation of an item improves item memory in proportion to its list length or weakness, but not position. (FL)",

        "author":["Layton, Kent"],
        "description":"Non-English speaking students of average intelligence experience extreme frustration when learning to read. The frustration is partly a result of simultaneous requirements to speak, read, listen, and write in the new language. It also is possible that the teaching methods and strategies employed by the teachers could be harmful to non-English speaking students' academic success and self-concept development. If teachers are to work effectively with non-English speaking students, they must begin with an English-based, cognitively oriented program of some type. By developing cognitively oriented programs, teachers can be assured that students can understand concepts in English prior to being directed to read and understand those concepts. Weikart's cognitive curriculum may be useful  for developing such a program. Content areas focus on classification, seriation, spatial relationships, and temporal relationships that are taught through providing motor and verbal experiences. Three levels of representation (index, symbol, and sign) are then integrated into the curriculum. For example, Weikart's model can be used to teach students about the four main food groups. For the classification index level, the teacher would exhibit many different real foods from the food groups; for the spatial relationships index level, the students would discuss size relationships of the foods, and so on. By using the model, a teacher can take advantage of a non-English speaking students' nonverbal abilities, learning styles, and verbal concepts in their native languages to move them  progressively toward the language-related skills in English.

        "description":"The efficient reader constructs tentative hypotheses about the meaning of the text that has been read and about the content yet to come. The hypotheses remain tentative until all related information has been accounted for. The reader then constructs a model that considers all of the details in a text. If a promising interpretation fails to account for some aspect of the text, the reader can accept the interpretation in spite of its flaws or reject it and search for other interpretations. Research in schema theory as a framework for recall of information in text has lead to two views of text comprehension, one holding that it is a top-down or conceptually driven process, another proposing that reading is a bottom-up or data driven process. Experiments indicate that there are  differences in cognitive style among children, based on how impulsively or reflectively they process information and on how much they rely on either top-down or bottom-up processing. It is important that a reader develop the ability to differentiate important from unimportant information in text. Use of appropriate schemata becomes the basis for recalling information that is most relevant to the central idea in a text. (Author/FL)",

The subjects, 71 college students, read eight short stories and rated their quality and the effectiveness of the writing. Approximately half of the subjects received stories that contained metaphors, while half received the same stories in which the metaphors had been replaced with literally equivalent statements. After reading the stories, subjects were given either a delayed or an immediate cued recall test. Analysis of recall protocols indicated an increased memorability for passages with metaphors. Not only were the metaphors themselves recalled better than the equivalent literal statements, but there was also an increase in memory for the context preceding the metaphors. (FL)",

        "description":"Teaching college writing students to edit the autobiographical writing of others has many advantages. Autobiographical materials, such as diaries, letters, or journals, are physically and psychologically accessible for students, and as editors they would be obliged to keep in mind appropriateness of language, tone, and simplicity or complexity of ideas for a particular audience. Once students have located them, the worth of the raw materials may be determined by the subject's prominence, personality, point of view, or historical time frame. The materials for a college-level paper need not be extensive, but should be sufficient to comprise a reasonably self-contained unit. If the emphasis is on the person, there should be enough diary entries, letters, or narratives to reveal  typical or fascinating dimensions of the subject's personality, feelings, roles, and relationships. If the emphasis is on events or information content, the materials should constitute a relatively complete narrative sequence that describes a phenomenon, occurrence, encounter, or process. A student editor must also determine whether the material is written well enough to warrant editing, and if it is self-contained, that is, understandable without added background information or identification of places, people, or relationships. The most worthwhile aspect of editing autobiographical materials is that the student editors will have done original work with primary materials of potential interest to others, which, if done well, may be publishable in local or regional newspapers and journals.

        "description":"A study of the lyrics of popular music was conducted to test the hypothesis that from the 1950s through the 1970s such songs placed a progressively greater emphasis upon physical as opposed to emotional love. Researchers analyzed the lyrics of the five most popular songs listed in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine during every year from 1950 to 1980. The 112 songs with romantic lyrics were rated on a five-point scale. Of the songs released during the 1950s, 89.2% were rated &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;very&quot; emotional, while 71.4% of the songs from the 1960s, and only 42.5% of the songs from the 1970s were rated in these two categories. Conversely, only 2.7% of the songs released during the 1950s were rated &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;very&quot; physical, while 11.4% of those from the 1960s and 40% of those songs released  during the 1970s were so rated. Love songs published during the 1950s and early 1960s often described persons yearning for their first love or the rapture of a couple's first encounter. Their romantic love was associated with dreams, hearts, and sacrifice, and portrayed as exclusive, true, and eternal. During the 1960s, lyrics became more ambiguous, and sexual desire became a more dominant theme. By the 1970s, the traditional values were broadened: persons described in modern love songs often met, spent a single night together, then parted without any emotional bond or commitment. Today even songs with the most explicit lyrics become number one hits. (HTH)",

Questionnaires were administered to 556 adolescents in a number of schools in a southern state; a second wave of questionnaires was administered to a subsample of 230 of these students approximately 14 months later. The items on the questionnaires elicited information concerning the respondents' (1) consumer role perceptions, (2) consumer activity, (3) materialism, (4) sex role conceptions, (5) and television advertising viewing. The resulting data suggested that television advertising had both short and long term effects on consumer socialization. Some negative effects appeared to occur directly, especially  among families in which communication about consumption was low. The data also showed that interpersonal processes might condition an adolescent's attention to and learning from television, causing both negative and positive effects on socialization. Finally, the results suggested that the long term effects of television differ from those in the short run, indicating that researchers should separate the two variables in future studies. (FL)",

An examination of one of these constraints, the lack of an equitable system for delivering knowledge and skills to rural populations, reveals the erroneous assumptions and methodological mistakes of diffusion researchers, including (1) preoccupation with already diffused innovations; (2) unrealistic proliteracy bias; (3) focus on the individual as locus of change; (4) media effects approach; (5) propersuasion bias; (6) proinnovation bias; (7) favoring of in-the-head variables of receivers over manipulable ones; (8) prosource bias; (9) inadequate researcher  self-examination; (10) one way message flow bias from top to bottom; and (11) a lack of interest in field experimentation. Given these inadequacies, one can predict that a diffusion campaign would result in few peasants gaining systematic knowledge about innovations and their applications, even fewer with sufficient knowledge to act effectively, and some whose knowledge was distorted. And the communication constraint is only one of many constraints that need to be overcome before successful implementation of rural development projects will be possible. (JL)",

Although no one adviser posseses expertise in all fields, such as marketing, drama, or English, the adviser must be a generalist who can effectively manipulate the activities that take place within these fields while preparing for competition. As a promotor, the adviser must conduct in-house &quot;pitches&quot; to encourage first rate students to apply, and conduct outside promotions that will cultivate connections with news sources and printers or other businesses that work in advertising. Effective promotion is contingent upon the adviser's skill at  organization. Though organizational structures vary depending on the case type, the number of team members, and their respective abilities, the adviser should conceptualize a schematic portraying the selected structure. He or she must also establish the boundaries of responsibilities and behavior. The final test of competition preparation is how well teams perform in the competition. The adviser should take into consideration all variables distinguishing the classroom from the real competition and conceive of a pre-competition evaluation system that is fair and allows students the educational benefits of such a learning experience.

Membership lists of the Public Relations Society of America, the International Association of Business Communicators, the Public Relations Club of San Diego, and Women in Communications were used to survey public relations practitioners in the San Diego, California, area by mail. From the 172 respondents, 28 subjects were selected for intensive study. Analysis of the findings identified four public relations practitioner types: the upwardly mobile practitioner, the creative artistic practitioner, the committed  proactive practitioner, and the literary scientific practitioner. Individuals of the upwardly mobile type expressed positive opinions about their profession and fellow practitioners. They viewed themselves as sensitive supervisors who practiced good public relations and moved up the organizational ladder. The creative artistic type wanted more say in decisions, but not at the expense of the spontaneity and emotional involvement in the public relations process. The committed proactive practitioner felt that public relations was more than just a technique and saw a need for improvement in the profession. Finally, the literary scientific type also felt that the profession should be evaluated, but held no special regard for the organization nor saw ethics as particularly relevant to the  practice of public relations. They regarded public relations as an applied social science. (HOD)",

A personal interview readership survey of Nigerian elites who read two high quality magazines distributed by the United States International Communication Agency provided the data. &quot;Topic,&quot; a general interest magazine circulated throughout Africa, was read by 242 of the primarily older, educated, male elites, while &quot;Interlink,&quot; a magazine that focuses on United States-Nigerian relations and circulates only in Nigeria, was read by 237 similar subjects. Computer analysis of the data indicated that the model provided an acceptable fit for the data of both magazines;  however, effects for the three dimensions were sometimes negative, although only positive effects had been predicted. The fact that &quot;Topic&quot; faces direct competition from other magazines may explain some of these anomalies. Results imply that future research needs to differentiate explicitly even somewhat similar magazines, and should also take into account the importance of situational factors in constraining readers' predispositions. Still, the model does provide a general framework for the analysis of magazine exposure and appraisal. (JL)",

The outstanding quality of perceiving types is their flexibility, and for judging types it is a sense of responsibility and order. The highest school drop-out rate can be found among sensing perceiving (SP) learners. This type of personality, driven by a need to be totally free and to live for the moment, is relatively unmotivated by long term goals. Lock such a freedom-oriented being into a super structure such as a school and the result is a natural resistance and resentment so powerful as often to prevent  any learning. The SP is labeled dumb, stubborn, lazy, hyperactive, or withdrawn. One such SP student, when interviewed about her English class, stated that she hated having to write rambling essays and looking for the hidden meanings in literature and poetry. She wanted unscheduled, nonintuitive, relevant, specific here-and-now learning. She also enjoyed just listening to discussions. Schools must accommodate this learning style with instructional techniques that appeal to the sense by varying routines, by allowing physical movement, and by acknowledging that students can and do learn by listening, not just participating, in discussions.

Demographic data were also gathered. Subjects were then asked whether they would watch network news programs more often if they were expanded to an hour, when they would prefer to watch them, and what kind of news they would like to see on such programs. The results indicated that just over  half of the respondents said they would be likely to watch network news programs more often if they were expanded to an hour, 35% indicated they would not increase their news viewing, and the remainder were uncertain. Most respondents (75%) preferred the programs expanded in their present early evening time slot, while only 10% preferred a 10 to 11 p.m. news program. The strongest preferences for news content were investigative reporting and higher quality, in-depth reporting of news events.

Poetry in composition classes can keep students aware of the music of the English language. There is no guarantee that students will respond to poetry with the same enthusiasm that Orwell showed for it, nor that they will magically produce beautifully written essays like Orwell, but if reading poetry can lead students to listen more attentively to the sound of their own sentences, then a poetry section will have been worth the effort. One composition class covers 25 to 30 poems in 3 or 4 weeks, and once a week, students write a short essay in response to a poem, eventually trying their own poetry. Discussions focus  on diction and arrangement of phrases and classes. An exercise in translating poetry into poor prose gives students a much better understanding of what separates good writing from bad. Unfortunately, composition researchers are discouraging this kind of method in favor of the &quot;writing process&quot; paradigm, but teachers and researchers must guard against the temptation to make composition instruction a pseudoscientific practice that overlooks the importance of writing as an art.

Recently, however, attention has been given to the right side of the brain, whose functions include unifying features into patterns and discerning meaning. Creative dramatics can provide this right brain learning; it also has an impact on a large variety of left-brain activities. The use of literature in creative dramatics helps to motivate students. Story dramatization, the heart of creative dramatics, leads children to read a story several times, and sharing a story in dramatic play develops vocabulary,  sequencing, and comprehension skills.

        "description":"This report presents the results of a national survey of a selected group of college and university teachers of writing considered to be the best by the directors of their writing programs. The first chapter explains how the sample of teachers was selected, examines the distribution of the sample across types and sizes of institutions, summarizes the teachers' workload with reference to teaching and other duties, reports on the respondents' preparation as composition teachers, and speculates on the relation of the sample to the national population of college and university writing teachers. The second chapter examines some of the conditions under which writing is taught in American colleges and universities and treats such matters as the types and curricular levels of the writing  courses taught, the sizes of the writing classes, and the use of required syllabi. Chapter III examines curricular and instructional practices in college composition classrooms and reports on such things as the amount of actual writing done in different writing courses, how writing is used in those courses, and some specific curricular and instructional activities in different kinds of courses and different types of institutions. The fourth chapter looks at the way teachers evaluate students' performance, focusing primarily on the particular characteristics of students' texts that teachers say most influence their evaluation of them. The fifth chapter quotes teachers about the most successful aspects of their composition teaching, and the final chapter provides an overview of the results  of the survey. Appended is a listing of participating institutions. (HOD)",

        "description":"Inexperienced writers can become inspired researchers when they are allowed and encouraged to write about what matters to them. The traditional research paper assignment inflicts torture on students in two ways: (1) by the process it demands--basically a frenzied series of new learning tasks; and (2) by the mystery surrounding its codes--rarely do students know why certain procedures and conventions are important or even who their real audience is. Work with two sets of students in university level Educational Opportunities Program (EOP) rhetoric classes bears out these observations. One set of students worked on research topics triggered by personal experience, most often problems related to their minority backgrounds. The other set worked on topics developed through a more  traditional, impersonal approach to the research paper, but even some of these students managed to create more interesting papers by injecting some elements of their personalities into the process. The experience of these students seems to indicate that inexperienced writers can discover for themselves the true process of academic research if they are allowed to bring personal commitment--and therefore a true purpose and sense of audience--to their work.

Following the introduction, the first section discusses the implications of language research, including phonics and spelling rules. The second section surveys research on instructional methods, particularly the integration of spelling with other language arts. This section also discusses the role of games and the use of typewriters, computers, and other aids in spelling instruction. The third section cites  studies outlining those practices that research has shown to be useless or minimally useful. This is followed by a section examining the divergence between research and practice in spelling instruction. The last section contains a summary of effective spelling instruction strategies.

A questionnaire containing a series of open- and close-ended questions and a demographic survey was completed by 199 faculty who teach advertising-related courses in colleges and universities. Analysis of the data allowed six conclusions: (1) these professors are fully cognizant of the concept of subliminal advertising, and they teach it in their classes; (2) although it is discussed in a wide variety of classes, little class time is devoted to subliminal advertising; (3) subliminal advertising is also  discussed in a variety of other departments; (4) educators in advertising or marketing departments teach that subliminal advertising is seldom or never used, and when they do offer opinions, they say it is unethical, unacceptable, or harmless; (5) Wilson Bryan Key is the source commonly associated with the topic by professors when they name individuals or sources; and (6) there are no correlations between what professors say about subliminal advertising and their ages, teaching or professional experience, or whether they teach in an advertising or marketing context.

Each product was developed to improve the management, the teaching, or the learning of reading, writing, listening, speaking, and mathematics. Each product meets four criteria: It was developed within the past 5 years, unless it was an earlier product that had been consistently in demand; it is an original work; it makes a contribution to the field; and it is available to educators throughout the country. The descriptions are listed alphabetically by states. They include a one or two word  summary of the major focus of the product, its title, the audience for whom it was intended, a description of how it has been used in the state, a 150-to-200 word abstract on it, a list of key word descriptors, and information on how to obtain a copy of the product. Following the product descriptions are three indexes. The state index is an alphabetical list of the states and the titles of their products.

        "author":["Dunlap, Louise"],
        "description":"A city planner's writing is usually not \"technical\" in the sense that the writing of engineers is technical. In each planning genre, extremely complex information, some of it \"technical\"--numbers, projections, and so forth--must be communicated clearly. For the professional planner, there are often severe time constraints and the need to proceed quickly while one's mastery of the subject is still incomplete. At the same time, working planners can count on a multiple audience of which at least one faction may be skeptical or even hostile. The writing program for master's degree candidates in city planning at M.I.T., 2 years of core and specialized courses ending in a thesis or client report, attempts to foster quality writing. Every course requires writing. The first semester core  course, the Planning Process, requires 8 to 10 pages every 2 or 3 weeks. An illustration of the objectives of the course and the program as a whole is a single writing assignment, which aims to have students take and articulate a strategic stand in a highly uncertain and complex situation. This collaborative writing program has proven to be successful for a number of reasons, among them the course's high visibility among students, its faculty support, the vitality of the students themselves, and shared assumptions between the writing and planning disciplines about the theories of process. Finally, the cooperative writing program is successful through the process of continuing development. Because the program was developed in conjunction with the master's program in city planning, the core  course changes radically every few years. (HOD)",

Wiemann's definitions of communicative competence by stressing the importance of the communicator's ability to perceive contextual constraints and to adapt his or her interaction goals and behavior accordingly. Communicative adaptability produces more satisfactory answers to the questions, Competent to whom? and Competent at what? than other views because it considers the qualitative nature of the interaction and the importance of communicator goals. To make the conception of communicative adaptability useful, it has been necessary to specify some of the salient aspects of a communication context and to explore its dimensional structure. Studies to create a Communicative Adaptability Scale (CAS) have led to the  four most common dimensions: social experience, adaptability, emphatic ability, and rewarding impressions. Two criterion variables, self-esteem and communication apprehension were measured. Tests of CAS on both adults and students have produced generally consistent results. Current research is being conducted to extend and further verify the CAS, and future research should focus on the behaviors perceived as competent. (JL)",

The first chapter provides an overview of the study. The examination of theatre activity in chapter II shows interdependence between the activities of the profit and nonprofit sectors. Theatre finances are detailed in the third chapter and reveal a cost-revenue squeeze. An investigation of theatre audiences and the attitudes of Americans toward the theatre arts in the fourth chapter shows that approximately 20 million Americans attended at least one live  professional theatre performance during the 1976-77 season, and that the individuals' propensities to attend performances depends strongly upon the experience of having done so and the opportunity to do so. The fifth chapter examines some data that describe the people who are employed or seek employment in the theatre and shows that the jobs performed by these people encompass a wide variety of tasks. The final chapter examines some of the innovations taking place in theatre operations that are contributing to financial stability, with particular attention to ticket sales, technological advances, and management and financial considerations.

        "description":"Despite the increase in the number of women entering the work force, the organizational setting is not typically conducive to upward mobility for most women. According to a variety of research studies, the impact of sex role stereotyping clearly suggests a set of communication behaviors appropriate for male managers and a different set appropriate for female managers. Assertive communication is a style that permits honest expression of feelings and needs in a nonthreatening way, in contrast to passive or aggressive communication styles. While increased assertiveness leads to increased self-esteem in women, and most proponents of assertive behavior consider this style essential to upward mobility for women, some research suggests that assertive behavior may be received more  positively when exhibited by males. When determining a communication style strategy, a woman might first consider the communication style of the supervisor and of the other men and women working in the organization. She might also consider the support system within the organization, because it is difficult to break norms in a work setting until approximately 30% of the work force has made the behavioral change. While assertive behavior may be a long range goal, it may be counter-productive at the outset of a job. (HTH)",

        "description":"Seven countries--Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Hungary, Italy, and Japan--participated in a comparative study of television programing and audiences. Four statistical indicators--structure of programs broadcast, availability of programing, potential viewing and actual viewing--were used to analyze over 25 categories of programing, which for the sake of clarity were reduced to three: information, culture and education, and entertainment. Results, including data from the United States, indicated that information programs accounted for 30% of all programing, cultural and education programing for about 18%, and entertainment for approximately 52%. Considering both offerings and availability revealed that the greater the number of networks the more competition there is for most  types of programing. Entertainment programs dominated \"prime time\" offerings in every country, yet actual viewing demand for them still exceeded their supply. At the same time, the supply of culture and education programs exceeded the demand for them. The findings suggest that in spite of differences in countries and cultures, audience behaviors are generally similar. (JL)",

        "description":"Traditionally the unit of analysis in marital research has been the individual spouse. More recently the marital relationship has often been defined as a process of interaction and dynamic exchanges such that spouses have autonomous needs as well as corporate needs for interdependence. Thus modern systems theory heightens the importance of both individuals. A structural analysis of the marital dyad consists of two types in which the aim is to determine whether relationships found at the group level are the same or different from relationships within separate group components. The problem in the analysis is the treatment of the couple's score so that the couple's score is not merely a high/low spouse score in which sex effects are unaccounted for. Scores may te summed for the  husband and wife and divided by two (summation score), or scores may be calculated to take into account the differences between each spouse's individual scores (dispersion scores). Using both these scores as the unit of analysis in a study of marital happiness and communicator images among 40 married couples, it is evident that the dispersion score can reveal an effect for the degree of a couple's agreement on marital happiness and not the level of happiness. In short, a reliance solely on individual or couples' analyses excluded some information. Therefore, the reporting of individual and couples' scores when a couple's analysis is used is often needed in order to give a full picture of the couple's agreement on the criterion variable and their rank on the criterion. However, in some  situations depending on the exact research question, a summation score or dispersion score may solely be used. (HOD)",

        "description":"Current issues being addressed by argumentation theorists can be identified by examining their writings in The Journal of the American Forensic Association (JAFA). Traditionally, argument has been seen as an utterance or act, from a philosophy based logical &quot;product&quot; perspective. Many current theorists, however, see argument as a process or communication transaction, and it is this perspective that is most useful for the speech communication teacher. The modern theorists' acceptance that argument is not logic leads to disputes concerning the nature of the standards to be applied in evaluating arguments. For the teacher, procedural standards provide the best assurance of validity. The role of nonverbal communication is also a growing concern of current theorists. A survey of seven  recent undergraduate texts--by H. Kahane, K. Lambert and E. Ulrich, J. V. Jensen, A. M. Eisenberg and J. A. Ilardo, A. Freeley, J. E. Sayer, and J. M. Sproule--reveals that only the last three depart from traditional views and define argument as a process or procedure. Of these three, only Sproule's &quot;Argument: Language and Its Influence&quot; retains that perspective in discussing argumentative validity. His is the first choice, and Sayer's the second, for a teacher desiring to put argumentation more fully into a transactional perspective. (JL)",

        "description":"Recent research in agenda setting, dealing with the ways people perceive campaign issues dependent upon their coverage by the media has left unanswered the question of how context variables such as political framing--the context within which the media present a particular issue-affect the agenda setting process. A study was conducted to test the hypothesis that voters have agendas similar to media agendas of issues that receive a campaign frame or context when compared to agendas not receiving such a frame. Two sets of data were collected during the 1980 United States presidential campaign: media data from television newscasts and the local daily newspaper were analyzed and reduced to 12 categories, and audience agendas were solicited from 356 residents of central Illinois  through telephone interviews. Demographic and interest variables included age, sex, and education. Results did show a strong correlation between audience and media agendas for issues receiving a campaign frame. In all conditions, television was most successful in setting audience agendas. Predictions for newspaper campaign agendas were supported for education, but not age. Women were more affected than men both by television and by newspapers. Post hoc analyses also produced correlations between media use and agenda setting, with television strongest late in the campaign. (JL)",

Fianlly, it is argued that the practice of a critical and reflexive educational administration is necessarily located within a critique of domination and a commitment to struggle in the interest of a better world.

        "description":"The results of a survey, comments on the results, and an annotated bibliography are presented in this preliminary study of the impact of federal programs, mandates, and regulations on school principals. The survey involved interviewing 20 principals in urban, suburban, and small-town elementary and secondary schools in the Chicago area about federal programs' impact on their jobs and their reactions to this impact. The results indicated federal programs increased the principalship's complexity, by increasing the responsibility and pressure to conform to others' priorities without increasing power, authority, or staff resources; by decreasing autonomy; and by giving principals a sense of surveillance by a distant national government. Principals became in response either&quot;affirmers&quot; of the programs' worth, &quot;ventilators&quot; who expressed distress, &quot;irritated&quot; principals who were far more negative, or &quot;presumably unaffected&quot; principals who experienced less impact. The survey report includes a copy of the interview schedule. Comments on the survey and the research problem are by Dan C. Lortie, Van Cleve Morris, Hannah Meara, and Bruce R. Thomas. The annotated bibliography covers seven topics, including principal response to federal regulations, program implementation, legal issues, and principal job satisfaction. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"To help make school districts more accountable without resorting to minimum competency testing, the Minnesota legislature in 1976 passed a law requiring the state's 434 districts to prepare annual planning and evaluation reports (PERs). The PER law obliges districts to develop educational policies and review them annually; create an instructional plan; encourage community participation in policy-making, instructional planning, and evaluation; use tests and other means to evaluate progress; develop school improvement plans where needed; and report annually to the public and the state department of education. Data from the state's summary of the local district reports indicate increasing compliance with the PER law and greater use of improvement plans in most curriculum areas, but  relatively low public availability of PER documents and a decline in the number of districts reporting community advisory committees. However, more districts are participating in the state's &quot;piggyback&quot; testing program, using test items developed by the state as well as locally-created items. Comparison of Minnesota's PER law with other states' competency laws shows that while PER is not rigorously enforceable, it does require local participation but without state expenditures.

Presented are 28 programs in grades 4-12 initiated by school systems in large cities and operating during the 1980-81 school year. Information about the programs was gathered through telephone conversations and through visits to seven programs. School systems were asked to provide information on programs that might help parents act in educational capacities, such as home tutors, monitors of homework and attendance, or guides for their children in the use of community educational resources. A general discussion section highlights salient features from all programs, promising practices, components of a  comprehensive program, and strategies for program development. The 28 program profiles include program objectives, major activities, staffing, target populations, funding, evaluations, materials available, and the name of a contact person. The seven in-depth reports resulting from site visits cover each program's objectives, rationale, development, operation, cost and personnel information, supporting and inhibiting factors, evidence of success, and other areas.

Section 1 of the document gives an overview of the planning process, defines comprehensive planning, and answers general questions about the PERM model and its phases, about who should have responsibility for planning, and about the necessity of continuous planning. The PERM model itself, presented in section 2, may extend over two cycles, covering 11 years, and includes four phases: (1) definition of district goals and student objectives, with community participation; (2) assessment of district needs, assignment of priorities to goals, analysis of existing  instructional programs, generation of solutions to problems, and planning of program implementation; (3) evaluation of the programs to judge whether their goals are being met; and (4) reallocation of district resources based on the evaluations. A glossary of 94 planning terms is provided in the document's final section. (Author/RW)",

An introduction notes the state's educational goals, outlines the PERM model, and describes the role of goals in comprehensive planning. Section 1 of the document examines goal development, types of goals (institutional, performance, process, and product), the processes involved, the importance of community participation, and the results of goal-setting. The second section presents eight models for involving communities in goal-setting, lists steps and tips for implementing each model, and compares the models in terms of costs, time requirements, and  other criteria. The eight models include town forums, interviews, surveys, advisory committees, Delphi techniques, the Phi Delta Kappa &quot;game&quot; method, the Fresno Town Meeting approach, and the New Jersey &quot;Our Schools&quot; model. Sample goal statements are also given. Section 3 discusses how to manage the goal-setting process and provides a checklist of activities. The handbook's nine appendices cover state educational objectives, leadership identification processes, sample letters and news releases, guides for group recorders and discussion leaders, and a brief glossary and bibliography.

        "description":"Two strategies employed by school administrators to obtain compliance in public schools are examined in terms of their concrete expression in school rules regarding student behavior. Two kinds of rules are specified: comparative rules, which juxtapose some student behavior with an organizational response in an exchange relationship; and definitive rules, which are based on a well-defined image of the school as an institution that has a special social meaning and members with special identities. To investigate the use of definitive rules in public school settings, data from two originally separate studies--of an inner-city, predominantly black middle school and of a suburban upper-middle-class senior high school--were reanalyzed. In addition, interview and observation data from a  teacher at another high school were reanalyzed to provide a close-up look at the use of definitive rules in a single classroom. The study concludes that, if comparative rules function to conserve commitment and definitive rules function to enhance commitment, both may be necessary for managing compliance in school organizations.

Variables covered in the document's 10 tables include race or ethnic group, age, geographic region, metropolitan or nonmetropolitan location, family income, educational attainment of the household head and the mother, sex and occupation of the household head, mother's marital and labor force status, number of other children under 14 in the household, the school's educational level and public or private status, and the child's full- or part-time enrollment.  Also noted is the impact of the federal Head Start program. Among the findings of the survey are that overall preprimary enrollment rates were roughly the same for whites and blacks but were lower for children of Spanish origin, and that blacks were far more likely than whites to be enrolled in full-day programs and in public schools.

Survey samples included 94 to 600 principals and 1,413 of 24,000 teachers in the school system and 12,882 of the 240,000 students in grades 7-12; 600 of the students were also interviewed. Data were gathered on assaults, thefts, and robberies; problems involving street gangs; attitudes and perceptions about school crime; and recommended solutions. Variables covered included age, sex, race, grade level, victim or nonvictim status, location and other characteristics of crime, reporting of crimes, feelings of safety, expectations of criminal incidents at school, unsafe areas, weapons in school, and school or district attended within  the school system. Volume I of this two-volume report describes the survey and presents data, conclusions, comparisons with the National Safe School Study, and recommendations. Among its findings are that thefts hit one-quarter of the students and teachers and that assaults victimize 3 percent of students and 2 percent of teachers. Respondents' recommendations center on a firm and consistent disciplinary policy. Volume II of the document discusses the methodology and provides copies of the questionnaires and data from pretest, absentee, and interviewee samples. (Author/RW)",

Concepts which form the basis of the model include that there is no way of determining the extent to which a student will progress (therefore, no ceiling is placed on the curriculum) and that because of the range of individual abilities among the handicapped all materials must be individually sequenced. The basic learning approach is behavior modification involving cues, the student's behavior, and consequences or reinforcers. A special \"Game, Exercise, and Leisure Sport Curriculum\" developed to meet the physical  education needs of the severely handicapped has sections on the following skill areas: movement concepts, skills found in popular elementary games, physical fitness skills, and popular lifetime leisure skills. The curriculum consists of a series of behavior analyses (task analyses) of basic physical education skills. The instructional team includes a physical or special educator (familiar with the student's movement needs, the student's reinforcement schedule, and language capabilities) and parents (who serve to maintan skills learned in the curriculum through home instruction). A clipboard is established for each student which contains the weekly cover sheet (specifying all programs in which the student is engaged), the consequence list of things that are reinforcing to the student, a  language sheet on the level of the student's language complexity, a behavioral sequence sheet, a program cover sheet, and a data sheet. Inservice training to implement the data based system covers specific objectives such as ability to conduct prescriptive physical education programs and knowledge of behavior management and behavioral terminology. An example of one skill (the underhand roll) from the curriculum is outlined. (SW)",

Some generalizations which apply to preschool assessment are: (1) the necessity of using both multiple measures and multiple opportunities for observation, (2) the distinction between capacity and performance and the relevance of applying dynamic assessment strategies, (3) the attention which needs to be paid to adequate sensory functioning, and (4) the positive aspects of assessing the preschool child (such as the child's eagerness for attention). The issue of  nondiscriminatory assessment and assessment of minority children is considered in terms of attempts to devise culture free measures. Among the findings relevant to preschool minority groups are that in assessing children from nonEnglish speaking groups, the language dominance within the child and the primary language of the home needs to be known; in assessing the Hispanic child, rapport should be established with the family before attempting work with the child; and in assessing the Native American child, nonverbal measures seem to be the least biases in evaluating ability to learn. It is concluded that nondiscriminatory assessment involves the use of a variety of measures and strategies with the measures suiting the issues to be assessed and with direct learning or dynamic strategies  included.

Following an introductory chapter, chapter 2 surveys the linguistic and tutorial featurs of the ILIAD system with an overview of the philosophy and design underlying the tutorials and capsule summaries of various components of the ILIAD system. Chapter 3 describes the syntactic and semantic capabilities and the structure of the  dictionary in the ILIAD system. A fourth chapter details several types of language tutorials, including those on sentence judgment, questions, subject-verb agreement, sentence patterns, politeness, and the &quot;please&quot; request. Various system development tools, such as the constraint mechanism, are reviewed in chapter 5. Microcomputer implementation of ILIAD is described in chapter 6 in terms of two subsystems--the utility section (which provides definitions and processing procedures for a variety of data structures used by the generation section) and the generation section (which corresponds to the generation part of ILIAD). Chapter 7 reviews dissemination of ILIAD, while the final chapter briefly considers the future of ILIAD. A list of sentences generated by ILIAD completes the report.  (SW)",

        "description":"A teacher training program was implemented over a 2-year period in cooperation with the Tucson Unified School District, where over 28% of the students have been identified as having a primary language other than English. The goal of the training was to provide a forum wherein teachers and administrators would explore the application of ethnographic/sociolinguistic theories and methodologies as these can be applied to language proficiency assessment practices. The training was implemented in three phases. Phase I was a graduate level course for participating teachers which focused on models of language proficiency, and language proficiency in the bilingual classroom and community. Phase II consisted of the development of field techniques and a teacher observation instrument (TOS).  Central to this instrument is a consideration of the social contexts used to describe students' language behavior. Phase III consisted of several stages: identification of issues for field testing of the TOS, more formal training for teachers in microethnographic/sociolinguistic field methods, and development of criteria for analyzing TOS field test results. Finally, the limitations and significance of the teacher training program are described in order to provide evaluative information regarding the ethnographic/sociolinguistic approach to language proficiency assessment.

        "description":"The relation between reading and writing is important because tacit and possibly unwarranted assumptions underlie the theories and pedagogies which govern these processes. These assumptions are challenged by the claims that: (1) reading and writing are related in neurolinguistically specifiable ways; (2) they do not seem to be simple inverses of each other; and (3) they do not seem clearly hierarchically dependent on one another. Some evidence for the claims is seen in the fact that reading and writing are not always equally impaired after damage to the left or dominant hemisphere. Also, people are considered good readers if they can read and understand sentences they have not seen before, even if it is impossible for them to write such sentences. The syndrome called alexia  without agraphia is taken to indicate that reading and writing as neuropsychological processes are partially separated. Pedagogy, while admittedly different from pathology, can learn from the neurolinguistic evidence. This evidence seems to challenge the assumption that reading instruction must precede writing. Approaches in first and foreign language instruction are cited as evidence that writing can be taught first as a road to reading. Although closely related processes, the decoding and encoding involved are not symmetrical. Neurolinguistic evidence does not support the assumption that reading depends on the prior acquisition of writing. (AMH)",

        "description":"The problems encountered by English as second language (ESL) students in selecting verb tenses for their written discourse were investigated. Tape recorded interviews with four freshman composition students who had been referred for intensive work on verb errors were analyzed for students' explanations of their errors and the contexts in which they appeared. The data revealed that ESL students had difficulty understanding how tense use was influenced by context and rhetorical or temporal stance. Second, the comprehensibility of tense choice was examined in the writing of native English speaking graduate students. Sixty native English speakers rated the texts in terms of clarity. Results showed a correlation between readers' judgments of clarity and writers' adherence to discourse  level tense constraints described by Chafe (1972). These studies demonstrate that teachers should avoid contextless explanations or exercises on verb tense, and that the students' own writing provides the best basis for working on verb tense problems. Students should be taught how to manage the composing process and how good writers work. Guidelines for materials development are offered, and samples of the texts used in the second study and eight references are appended. (RW)",

Language skills assessment in both English and the native language is a crucial step in the provision of equal educational opportunity to language minority students. Language assessment for Asian Americans, the fastest growing group of language minority students in the United States, should evaluate language preference, proficiency, and dominance. A severe lack of language assessment instruments dealing with Asian language was revealed by a review of the available language tests for bilingual students. The few tests available have not been systematically evaluated or disseminated. Among the many controversies surrounding language testing is the increasing emphasis  on communicative competence as opposed to linguistic skills. Despite the new emphasis on communicative competence, most tests consist of discrete items that evaluate subskills and skill components. Suggested future directions for research and test development include the distinction between discrete point and integrative tests, a theoretical framework for communicative competence, and a more systematic evaluation of existing tests. The cultural and linguistic diversity of Asian American students complicates the task of meeting their educational needs. A glossary and references are appended. (RW)",

The permanent, noncurrent records document the various goals, programs, and accomplishments of the Council.

Because of the ACE's central role in directing American higher education over the last 60 years, a brief historical sketch of significant events documented in the archives is presented. The archives are arranged as they were created and maintained by the various parts of the Council. Because of a small staff during its early existence, only one central organizational file was  created and maintained. This alphabetically arranged file was under the direct control of the chief executive officer of the Council. Because the Council operated on a fiscal year of July 1 to June 30, the files were cut at that time period. In order to assist the researcher, subject folder titles have been added and these are listed in the guide under the appropriate entry and box number. It was not until 1951 that the Council adopted a calendar year basis for its filing system. The records of the various presidents, with one exception, are divided into two series, general records and records of ACE commissions and committees. In order to assist the user, descriptive paragraphs have been added where organizations are concerned.

The demographic variables included race, sex, marital status, and family contribution, and policy variables included the discounted present value of income in each life-cycle period. Attention is directed to implications of the results for current and future anticipated changes in AFHPSP participation, given no program changes, and cost effective program changes to attain a goal of about 1,200 physicians per year. The results suggest that the DOD will fall short of its requirements for medical AFHPSP accessions by about 400 per year after 1978 if there were full NHSC funding for all its qualified applicants. The analysis suggests that increasing service compensation by about $7,500 (1978 dollars) would eliminate the shortfall and will probably be more cost  effective than offering a stipend beyond that offered by NHSC. Adjustment strategies for the AFHPSP program benefits are outlined, and a sample questionnaire and description of the survey procedures are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"Issues and problems associated with university involvement in public sector activities and the knowledge transfer process are examined. After a brief statement of the state-of-the-art in knowledge transfer, attention is directed to one of the basic issues presented in the literature: the appropriateness and inappropriateness of university involvement in public service. An opinion favoring a more responsive stance on the part of universities was interpreted from the literature. The academic community and nonacademicians have suggested that the university is a source of knowledge needed for decision-making in various kinds of action programs. Consideration is given to types of knowledge, since there are conceptual variations regarding the product(s) that universities have to offer  to the public. Various knowledge transfer models are compared, and a composite knowledge transfer model that utilizes concepts from these models is examined. The basic thrust of the composite model is the concept of university-user partnership as proposed by Moe (1977). Two basic functions of the model are a clearinghouse function within the university and a linking function. Both of the basic functions of the model can be made operational through a relatively small organizational structure (e.g., the community services office). To facilitate the operation of this office, a needs assessment methodology is offered--the Social Mapping Matrix Assessment (SMMA), which can be used for inventory purposes to identify on-campus resources, such as institutes, and the types of services they can  provide. A second use is a type of catalog for use by university sub-units and clients. Steps that would bring this model to an action stage are briefly considered. (SW)",

A survey instrument also sought to identify: the effectiveness of current practices in the teaching of management skills; current credit and advising policies related to taking management courses; and a rating of a variety of possible academic programs that address the need for management skills training. Of the 197 deans of engineering at U.S. universities offering graduate engineering programs who were mailed the questionnaire in March 1982, responses were received from 67 institutions. Results indicate that the provision of management skills to foreign engineering students needs to be addressed. Managerial functions are viewed as an important part of the work  of the successful practicing engineers. Deans saw little evidence that universities are currently effective in teaching managerial skills to their foreign engineering students. Deans' responses indicated that they felt generally that graduate schools of engineering are not currently providing managerial training in their master's degree in engineering program. Most engineering schools did not give credit for general management courses, and most schools of management/business courses appear to be oversubscribed and therefore closed to nonmajors. Programs, information, and individuals who could serve as resources to the development/implementation of teaching management skills to foreign engineering students are identified. Additional contents include a literature review and discussion of  the issues, a list of participating institutions, a questionnaire, and a bibliography. (SW)",

        "description":"The technical, social, and procedural phenomena that facilitate the effective utilization of analytic models in decision-making are examined. Attention is focused on the theoretical issues associated with: (1) selection and fit of the model to the needs of the decision setting; (2) human factors such as cognitive style and the political climate surrounding the decision participants; and (3) the role of the model on the decision process. Theoretical concepts are illustrated by examples from three applications of a single health science curriculum cost construction model. A central thesis is that models must be adapted to the conditions of the decision setting and the characteristics of the problem to ensure utilization. Model technology must be appropriate to the decision,  feasible in terms of practicalities, and of demonstrated validity. Issues relating to individual attitudes and organizational norms are best addressed through building the client/consultant relationship and through the careful early diagnosis of the setting. Since a model can assume a variety of roles in the decision process, client/consultant expectations must be clarified on the stage at which the model will be used, how it will be used, and by whom. The development in the late 1970s of a curriculum cost construction model is described. It was developed by consultants for the University of Michigan School of Pharmacy, and then university staff developed similar models for the School of Nursing and the Program in Physical Therapy. Attention is directed to factors in the utilization of  mathematical models and model characteristics required by various decision types. (Author/SW)",

        "description":"The impact of discontinuing an academic program at St. Edward's University, Texas, was assessed by measurement on three levels: first-level effects on students and faculty; second-level effects on auxiliary offices and related courses and majors; and third-level effects on productivity and a profile of majors. Majors with a higher than average cost per student credit hour were studied. Brief summaries of three majors (unidentified) chosen for review are presented. One major had only one faculty member and nine student majors, and the program had a relatively high cost per student credit hour. The second program accounted for 2 percent of the undergraduate population; the third accounted for 5 percent of the undergraduate population. In making the decisions, the educational needs  of students, including the potential student pool, and the problem of faculty tenure were considered important. For example, many nonmajors are taking courses in the program; the university may want to retain some faculty members to teach courses in this area although retaining no formal major. If only majors take courses in the program, all courses in the major may be eliminated and all faculty members let go or given alternate teaching assignments. In addition, if the students in a certain program are all from out of state and that program is discontinued, recruitment may be channeled into other areas. The study methodology will enable the administration to identify the amount of money saved or reallocated by program discontinuance. Faculty salaries, room and board costs, and financial  aid awarded are examples of resources that can be saved or reallocated. (SW)",

        "description":"The perceived benefits of college as reported by alumni from 55 postsecondary institutions in the United States were surveyed during 1980-1982 using the Alumni Survey of the American College Testing (ACT) Program. Findings were analyzed for the total group of 12,682 and for subgroups based on college size, student sex, student major area, number of years since graduation, and college affiliation. Each of the institutions mailed survey instruments to a sample of recent alumni and later returned the forms to ACT. The median age of the respondents was 27.2 years, with a range of 20 years through over 65 years; 72.3% were from public colleges, while 27.7% were from private institutions. Data were analyzed for 24 areas of personal growth that are often claimed to be outcomes of  postsecondary education. The alumni were asked to indicate the degree to which their college educations contributed to their personal growth in each of the 24 areas, which are listed. The data from the study suggest that alumni feel that their college educations have contributed to their personal growth most extensively in such areas as learning on your own, working independently, persisting at difficult tasks, and organizing your time effectively. It is suggested that these outcome areas appear to be related to general learning skills, rather than to specific academic skills or subjects. This finding tends to support the contention that a college education offers more than job training or specific occupational skills. The largest differences between respondent subgroups occurred with  regard to college major (e.g., business, education, physical sciences). Six factors that were identified by factor analysis as underlying the 24 outcome variables are compared with the outcome structure recently developed at the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems. The alumni survey and a list of college majors are appended. (SW)",

        "description":"The impact of media marketing strategies on continuing education enrollment at the State University of New York College at Brockport (SUNY-CB), was evaluated. The evaluation of advertising impacts used advertising records of SUNY-CB and other area colleges and a telephone questionnaire instrument. A stratified, random countywide sample, in addition to the college continuing education students, was surveyed to determine the differential impact of media types and the media impact on the college's new and returning continuing education students as well as on the general population sample. Of the 400 continuing education students enrolled in the fall 1981 semester in credit courses, 215 participated in the telephone survey, in addition to 290 countywide respondents. The Statistical  Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used in the analysis of responses. The primary way in which the respondents heard about the college's continuing education offerings was determined. Respondents were asked whether they saw or heard any advertisements for the continuing education program, and whether the marketing strategies encouraged previous students to continue, or attracted new students. Another aspect of the research was to identify advertising conducted through the local media by other area colleges. It was found that: (1) respondents were not very aware of the college's advertisements; (2) the electronic media appeared to have had little or no impact on either respondent group; (3) newspapers seemed to be the most effective media; and (4) direct mail was an effective  approach. These findings provide the basis for four recommendations regarding the school's marketing approaches, including centralizing marketing efforts and enhancing program reputation among faculty and students.

        "author":["Sanford, Timothy R."],
        "description":"The way that the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, has tried to depoliticize minority admissions through the use of predicted graduation equations that are race specific is examined. Multiple regression and discriminant analyses were used with nine independent variables (primarily academic) to predict graduation status of 1974 entering freshmen, and 64.8 percent of the students were correctly classified. For blacks the most important predictor variable that enters the regression first is high school rank in class; for whites, residence status for tuition purposes is most important although high school rank is second. Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores are not particularly important in any of the regressions, and this parallels the school's experience in that  admissions tends to place much more emphasis on class rank than on SAT scores. While the results of the research were not adopted by the university, they did show that: (1) admissions' criteria are related to actual graduation from college; (2) minority student admissions could be linked to a definite educational outcome; and (3) subjectivity in admission could be lessened somewhat although it can and should never be removed completely. It is claimed that the research supports minority admissions because it shows that black and white students, measured on the same scales, can perform and achieve on a reasonably equal basis in college despite noticeable differences in entering academic credentials. Tabular data are presented to provide background on minority admissions, achievement,  retention, and graduation at the university. Issues that tend to make minority admission politically sensitive are also reviewed. (SW)",

        "description":"A method of adjusting for bias due to nonresponse to an alumni survey is demonstrated, based upon analysis of data from both on-time and late respondents. The responses are opinions of 254 alumni regarding how they rate their recently completed program of study within a college of an urban university. As part of the university's curriculum review process, a questionnaire was developed to obtain alumni ratings of their degree program. Twenty-two questionnaire items were selected from the University of Illinois' Program Evaluation Survey (Smock and Hake, 1977), and five demographic questions and a final &quot;would you recommend the program?&quot; question were added. Subjects had received an undergraduate or graduate degree during the last 5 years. It was found that on-time and late  respondents differed significantly in their attitudes toward specific aspects of the academic program. Adjustments were made in the average ratings to correct for these differences. In addition, after allowing for random sampling errors, the unadjusted results were contrasted with the adjusted ones. The findings demonstrate that for certain responses, the adjustments were relatively minor, while for other questions the changes were quite significant. In eight cases, the adjusted ratings were significantly less critical of the program than were the unadjusted ratings, based only on the responses of on-time respondents. It is suggested that the increasing reliance on alumni responses to mail questionnaires and their use in the internal review and decision-making process of universities make  proper analysis of the data crucial to institutional researchers. The literature on survey nonresponse is also reviewed. (SW)",

        "description":"The use of marketing concepts to maintain and enhance the image of a university is considered. Over all, what is needed is a system for image assessment to provide a basis for image development. Without this system and its information outputs, misconceptions can enter the policy-making process at critical junctures, and the life of the institution can be adversely affected. Developing the necessary information requires data on outsiders' views of faculty, curriculum, teaching quality, and the cost of attending college. Much of these data can be derived from current students, alumni, and those in the surrounding local community. With these data, a marketing action program can be developed. From these programs, top academic administrators can take the necessary steps to maintain  and enhance the institution's image. A number of issues center on the faculty's image. It needs to be determined if the faculty, as a whole, is perceived as current by the institution's publics. A second potential key issue is the nature of the faculty's professional activities. Curriculum needs to be perceived as being reasonably modern in order to support a desirable image for any vital institution. The quality of teaching is another important area of concern. It is concluded that since faculty activity appears to be a critical area, research programs need to determine the extent to which faculty achievements and activities are being highlighted. It is also important to monitor the attitude of current student attitudes about the institution. In a similar manner, alumni need to be  questioned about their image perceptions. Target groups within the community include parents and employers. (SW)",

Formally recognized guidelines for varying instructional methodologies are also applied to actual instructional experiences of academic units to determine credit hour expectations for these units. The proposed procedure is based on the assumption that instructional method and number of students are two of the most crucial elements in the internal allocation process. It is also assumed that any targets for credit hour per full-time equivalent (FTE) teachers represents a compromise between the total resources available to the institution and the instructional methodologies  preferred by the disciplines. Four types of instruction and examples of each type are identified: individual instruction; small laboratory, seminar, field work; skill and upper division classes; and regular classes. The appropriate instructional mode for each course was classified, and the number of FTE budgeted faculty and the number of instructional hours taught by graduate teaching assistants and part-time faculty was gathered for each department. For each department and for each mode of instruction, information was gathered on the number of class sections taught, faculty credit hours or total course credit hours taught, number of student enrollments in all class sections, and total student credit hours generated by all class sections. A formula for computing expected student credit  hours and entitled FTE faculty for each department is presented. Uses and abuses of the procedure are noted. (SW)",

        "description":"A set of weighting factors on student credit hour production by discipline was developed so that instructional productivity could be equitably compared across disparate disciplines and within disciplines. The new statistical methodology was applied to 3 years of teaching load data from 21 major public universities (the Southern University Group Teaching Load Data Exchange) and has yielded an objective, broadly applicable set of student credit hours (SCH) weight factors. For each fall term from 1978 through 1980, participants reported on the instructional productivity of each of their academic departments. Data included: the standard federal code associated with the department's dominant instructional program; the number of filled instructional full-time-equivalent (FTE)  positions, reported as ranked faculty and other faculty (primarily graduate assistants); and student credit hours produced by the faculty, reported by three levels of instruction (lower and upper division undergraduate, and graduate levels). A table of optimum weighting factors for upper division and graduate SCH (relative to lower division) is presented by the code discipline division of the National Center for Education Statistics. The weights derived from the analysis are compared with those developed by more traditional means. An explanation and example of the method are provided, and it is concluded that the number of discipline areas that responded well to the optimum weight model lends support for its acceptance. There was less confidence in the optimum weights for those discipline  areas in which only ranked faculty FTE were included in the instructional productivity ratios, since they differ consistently from other reported values.

        "description":"Pennsylvania State University's early response to declining resources and its current planning and budget process are described. Attention is also directed to the fiscal outcomes of the process over the past 5 years and several of the strategies devised to promote qualitative concerns and respond to variable growth-decline situations. From 1971 to 1976 budget gaps were closed by imposing across-the-board position freezes followed by collapsing vacant positions or reducing their level of funding. Support expenditures also were reduced substantially in such areas as travel, telephones, equipment, and wages. It was determined that future budget reductions must result from careful long-range planning, focusing on the central needs of the university's academic and administrative  units. The planning and budget process that was initiated in 1977 used selective reductions and reallocations and evolved into a rolling 5-year process. The key elements of the process include financial projections, recycling assessments, planning questions and data support, responses by individual units, planning and budget hearings, advisory committee deliberations and recommendations to senior officers, and operating budget development. For the program of internal recycling and reallocation (1971-1976), a total of $11.1 million was pulled back and reallocated primarily for increased costs of operation. Since the rolling 5-year planning and budget process was initiated in 1977, an additional $14.6 million has been reallocated through 1981. Recommendations and the following funding  mechanisms to support quality are considered: the Provost's Revolving Fund, matching concepts for general funds and extramural funds, and private funds.

In order to characterize the practice of institutional research in various institutional settings, a taxonomy of institutional research activity areas was developed. A 114-item taxonomy was developed that was divided into 13 categories. The taxonomy was incorporated into the Professional Development Needs Assessment Survey (PDNAS). For each item, respondents were asked to indicate whether the activity was one in which they or their office had performed in the past 2 years. In the spring of 1981, the PDNAS was mailed to all members of the Association of Institutional Research. Approximately 40 percent of the members (701 persons) completed  the survey, and the database for this survey consisted of 295 responses. Factor analysis was used to validate a 92-item taxonomy of institutional research activities. Through discriminant analyses, the study provides an operational definition of institutional research as it is practiced in institutional and organizational settings that vary according to institutional type, offices to whom institutional research offices report, time period in which institutional research offices were established, and full-time-equivalent size of institutional research staff. The results further suggest that the activities may be a function of the diversity and level of sophistication of the research staff. Possible future directions for institutional research are noted.

        "author":["Hackman, Judith Dozier"],
        "description":"Seven potentially useful maxims from the field of human information processing are proposed that may help institutional researchers prepare and present information for higher education decision-makers. The maxims, which are based on research and theory about how people cognitively process information, are as follows: (1) more may not be better; (2) augment humans with models; (3) chunk data wisely; (4) know decision makers; (5) heuristics are not always helpful; (6) arrange tables by patterns; and (7) negative evidence and new hypotheses are okay. Cognitive findings underlying each maxim are given, with concrete examples of how institutional researchers can apply the maxims to improve the collection, analysis, and especially the presentation of information for academic  decision-makers. In regard to maxim 1, it is suggested that researchers should remember that people have difficulty combining more than six or seven bits of information at a time, without some kind of decision aid. The use of computer models for a limited range of structurable and semi-structurable academic decisions is probably the major application of maxim 2 currently found in universities. Three of the most frequently used heuristics are examined: availability, representativeness, and anchoring and adjustment. Four guidelines for arranging tables are as follows: round to four significant digits, use row and column averages or totals, present the main pattern of data in columns, and order the rows and columns by some measure of their size. It is suggested that when decision-makers  remain open to alternative solutions and disconfirming evidence, their decisions may be more effective. (SW)",

All universities were asked to track three cohorts of entering freshmen (1975, 1976, and 1977) through the fall of 1981 with regard to student progression and withdrawal. In addition, black and white students were also tracked separately. The Institutional Data Questionnaire was used in the analysis. Bivariate findings show that race has a strong relationship to students' performance in college, with white students consistently outperforming black students in  terms of their attrition rates, tendency to follow the prescribed progression pattern, and mean length of time to graduate. However, racial differences in performance disappear when other student and institutional characteristics are introduced into the prediction models via multiple regression techniques. Four variables repeatedly appear as significant predictors: students' mean Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, students' mean family income, type of institution (predominantly white vs. predominantly black), and proportion of students receiving financial aid. High SAT scores, high family income, and attendance at a predominantly black university are generally associated with better performance in college when the effects of other variables are removed.

Attention was focused on showing how consumer attitude concepts and methodologies can be used in developing a strategic marketing plan. Six populations were identified as groups important to the university and its future: general population from a six-county area, undergraduate students at the university, those accepted for graduate school, parents of undergraduates, college bound high school seniors, and high school teachers and counselors. All data were gathered via telephone surveys conducted by a marketing research firm. Based on responses from 1,850 individuals, the university was generally perceived as being  geographically and economically convenient, offering an adequate education, but lacking in safety, academic stature, and the social benefits of living away from home. The expectancy-value model was found to be a useful method. Its use identified discrepancies between perceptions of those closest to the university and those least familiar with it that have relevance to the university's overall marketing effort. Application and enrollment gains can possibly result from a better understanding in the community at large as to the high quality of the university's underrated faculty and programs. Graphs illustrate the attitudes of the respondent groups regarding: the need for high quality professors, academic reputation, numerous course offerings, the range of degrees offered, personal safety on  campus, and the availability of a university close to home.

The following variables were investigated: number of weighted student credit hours, number of sections taught, number of different courses taught, and didactic hours by level of course. Because the faculty members varied in their full-time-equivalent instructional effort, it was necessary to normalize the data. Fall 1979 data were considered for full-time assistant professors in the academic colleges. Weighted student credit hours, derived in part from a state budget formula, were applied to credit hour production by student level. Didactic hours, which were an estimate of the amount of effort required for an instructional activity, were based on the type of  course taught. For classroom only, the course credits were considered. For nonclassroom instruction, the number of didactic hours taught were considered in terms of student credit hours. When male and female faculty were compared for equity of instructional activity taking their college into consideration, there was no significant difference by sex or from the interaction of college with sex. When a balancing technique was used to review male and female faculty by departments, no significant differences were found in the pattern of instructional activity within the group of departments being compared. Based on the variables considered using multiple regression, an equity of treatment for men and women on teaching assignments was found. (SW)",

Implications of the projections for competition among institutions and postbaccalaureate enrollments are also addressed. The projections show little overall decline in total undergraduate headcount enrollment to 1985. If students of the same age and from the same residence areas were to continue to attend the same types of institutions at the same rates as they did in fall 1980, full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment would fall about 3 percent by 1985. By 1990, the headcount decline would be 6 percent, with an FTE decline of about 11 percent. In addition to headcount and FTE enrollment projections,  separate estimates were calculated for full-time and part-time students. No specific projections were made for postbaccalaureate education; however, changes in enrollment at this level will modify overall enrollment levels in institutions offering graduate education. In 1980, 31 percent of all undergraduates in Connecticut institutions were over 24 years old. It appears that adult learners are currently participating at rates that can be expected to compensate substantially for the declining numbers of younger students. The 25- to 34-year-old age group will increase numerically during the 1980s as the population peak moves along, and by 1990, 40 percent of undergraduate students in Connecticut institutions of higher education could be over 24. Additional factors that are likely to  influence higher education enrollment are identified, although they are not part of the projection methodology. Assumptions underlying the methodology and the procedures of the methodology are described. (SW)",

        "description":"Types of initiatives that colleges have implemented to foster continuing faculty career growth and the major attributes essential to success of the efforts are considered. The role of administrators in supporting faculty growth and vitality is also addressed. Several colleges and universities encourage career planning activities in which faculty members analyze their own interests, talents, and life goals. Some colleges have developed career planning workshops for their academic personnel; others have adopted elaborate growth-contract systems. Some colleges take a less structured approach. Faculty evaluations, tenure, and promotion deliberations, and annual academic planning discussions all provide opportunities for focusing attention on institutional needs and a professor's  growth objectives. In addition, temporary opportunities for new learning and changes in work environment, such as off-campus internships and faculty exchanges, can be revitalizing experiences. Faculty retraining and respecialization are an increasingly common response to individual and institutional needs for adaptation and growth. The more comprehensive programs assume that optimum development begins with a process of career assessment and planning followed by experimentation with new roles, additional training when necessary, and finally transition to a new professional opportunity. Some colleges also have begun to revise personnel policies in an effort to promote faculty growth and flexibility. Administrators regulate the resources needed to facilitate faculty career growth and they  are in a position to promote faculty efforts to branch out professionally. Nine guidelines for promoting faculty growth and vitality are presented, such as including faculty in planning programs. (SW)",

        "description":"The integration of culturally relevant concepts into nursing education is essential for the effective delivery of health care in a modern, multi-ethnic, multi-racial, mobile society. Several key concepts from anthropology and specific areas of individual interpersonal behavior have particular relevance to nursing education. It is important, for instance, that nurses understand the culture of the hospital, clinic, or other health service setting in which they work. They need to recognize structures of power and authority and be able to function with skill and flexibility within complex hierarchical organizations. Nursing students themselves become involved in the processes of acculturation and resocialization once they finish their training, and an anthropological perspective may  ease the transition. The effectiveness of the nurse as a practitioner is increased by awareness and understanding of cross-cultural differences in, for example, religion, territoriality, and attitudes toward family. Even within the same society, cultural components of wellness and illness, such as tolerance for pain, may vary greatly. Additionally, nurses must have an awareness of language differences and communication skills and the importance of understanding patients and being understood by them. Comprehension of these culturally relevant concepts and issues can be facilitated through the integration of learning experiences with obvious applicability into existing courses. Samples of such learning experiences are appended, including definitions of concepts, suggested readings, learning  activities, and discussion topics. (KL)",

First, a background is provided on the origins and history of community colleges in California; their original role in preparing students for transfer to 4-year institutions; and the shift in the colleges' emphasis from transfer to occupational programs. Next, the report examines SLS data that have relevance to the transfer program. These data indicate that the community college has maintained its collegiate-transfer function, though in a somewhat different fashion than a generation  ago, with fewer students attending in a linear manner and most being more concerned with the course than the program. Then, 13 inferences drawn from the data are outlined and their implications discussed. The report concludes with general recommendations, including: (1) a realignment of the categories of vocational and transfer students to better fit students' course-taking behaviors and intentions; (2) a strengthening of academic standards and a closer articulation between community colleges and secondary schools; (3) the creation of a liberal arts career option program; (4) greater integration of support services with the instructional program; and (5) a continued commitment to the transfer function.

Chapter I provides a historical overview of the public service mission of higher education in the United States. Then, Chapter II examines community services in relation to other college missions and argues for a clear definition of community services, a reexamination of its mission, and the development of a consensus and commitment to its continuation by the college community and policy makers. After Chapter III discusses the development of community service programs,  ways of bringing them into the mainstream of the college, and the advantages of developing a central theme for community services and the college, Chapter IV outlines the funding practices of various states and suggests alternative sources of funding for community service programs. Chapter V identifies the role of institutional, local, and state leaders in gaining widespread commitment to the community service function. Finally, Chapter VI offers recommendations for the establishment of priorities, an operational definition of community services, and a uniform system of data collection; for the development of a curriculum-based program of services and activities; and for the adoption of a more active stance on the question of community services.

After a discussion of the philosophical basis of community college education, the booklet considers the origins of the community college movement, tracing its history from the Morrill Act of 1862 which led to the creation of land grant colleges; discussing legislation passed in California in the early 20th Century to develop and fund junior colleges in the state; and reviewing the development of the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges from its creation in 1920. Next, the significance of the 1944 GI Bill and the 1947 Truman Commission on Higher Education are discussed in relation to the mission of community colleges in the post World War II  period. The boom years of community college growth from 1960 are then discussed with reference to key events and figures; the rise of statewide systems and state support; the growth of the open door concept and the increases in student financial aid during this period; the role of leadership in the era of growth and in the future; the position of student services and the increase in part-time students; and the changing mission of community colleges. Finally, an outline of the community college today discusses changes in college governance, methods of maintaining leadership, the changing political context, and the development of a body of literature on the community college.

First, common, but less effective, memory methods are presented, including reading and re-reading materials, recitation, intensive studying, and detailed organization and classification of new material. Next, encoding memory methods are reviewed, whereby words or concepts are translated into other, more easily remembered, forms. Methods are discussed for encoding concrete words; encoding abstract words phonetically or semantically; and encoding numbers through imagery. Then, organizational memory methods, which require the creation of an  artificial method of organizing material, are outlined. Three of these methods provide pegs on which to hang concepts: the \"method of loci\" links items to be memorized to a previously prepared set of locations; the \"peg-word method\" involves taking the material, encoding it into images, and making a vivid picture linking the peg word to the item to be remembered; and the \"first letter recording method.\" The next three methods, story mnemonics, link mnemonics, and the use of rhymes and songs, involve chain processes for aiding the memory. Finally, brief tips are provided for helping students to use memory techniques. (HB)",

        "description":"These three papers represent the results of the third phase of Florida's Impact of Testing Project. After reviewing the background to the project, the first paper discusses third-phase findings in terms of project objectives, i.e.: to determine entry-level assessment procedures and their uses in student placement; to determine the impact that entry-level testing has had on instructional strategies and personnel; and to project changes for Florida's community colleges. After noting that non-traditional students may react negatively to mandatory assessment testing and that some legislators are opposed to funding postsecondary remedial education, the paper concludes that faculty are willing to adjust course content, grading policies, and assignments based on college-level testing,  but have concerns about accountability, supervisors' qualifications for judging basic skills instructors, and variations in assessment tests and procedures. The second paper provides a summary of faculty, counselor, and manager perceptions of the impact of entry-level assessment and placement, while the third paper provides greater detail on the spring 1982 survey upon which the perception summary was based and reviews findings in terms of faculty involvement in entry-level assessment and attitudes toward assessment procedures, the open door policy, developmental education, counseling, and highly advanced or esoteric courses. The survey instrument and responses are also included. (KL)",

The study revealed that: (1) the spring 1980 term was completed by 83% of the Associate in Arts/Associate in Science (AA/AS) students, 73% of the Associate in Applied Science (AAS) graduates, and 77% of the students without a degree; (2) the overall attrition rate after 1 year was 21%; (3) AA/AS degree students earned an average of 62.9 credits at the 2-year college and had an average of 61.4 credits accepted by the senior college, while for AAS students these figures were 68.6 and 56.0, respectively, and for students  without a degree, the figures were 38.3 and 43.2, respectively, indicating that non-degreed students attended more than one institution before transferring; (4) AA/AS students earned slightly more credits than non-degreed students at the senior college, with AAS graduates earning the lowest average credits; (5) for all three groups, grade point averages (GPAs) declined in the first term after transfer and rose in the second term, though not to pre-transfer levels; and (7) a higher proportion of students with low grades appeared to discontinue enrollment. The study report compares findings with previous studies conducted in 1967 and 1974 and discusses the study's implications for 2-year college education in Illinois. (HB)",

        "description":"During the 1960s and 1970s an enormous amount of research was conducted to better understand children's social and intellectual development, and hundreds of educational programs for children and parents were initiated in hopes of improving conditions surrounding many of America's young children. By the middle 1970s, however, it became apparent that competence in the young child held different meanings for different professionals. Although attempts to arrive at a single definition have been only partially successful, references to competency in young children have become widespread in recent psychological and educational literature. Thus, it is the purpose of this paper to discuss the nature and development of competent behavior in young children as it appears in the literature  and to suggest some approaches to the measurement and evaluation of competence in children. The first section of the paper stresses the importance of competent development in young children prior to formal schooling, the second deals with the question, What is a competent young child? and the third discusses the research on parenting and peer relations, focusing on the importance of these two factors in fostering the development of competence in young children. Finally, the fourth section suggests ways teachers can evaluate competence in young children. (MP)",

        "description":"People working in the area of early childhood, either as practitioners or as advocates, are often faced with the task of trying to make sense of federal and state policies. Adopting the approach that an historical perspective is necessary in order to understand the social context in which change or attempted change occurs, this paper presents a history of Australian events to illustrate variations in policies for young children and to sort out some of the factors that lie behind these variations. It is proposed that two factors contribute to such variations: one such factor has been termed &quot;ideologies,&quot; describing the values people adopt, the categories within which they think, and the kinds of evidence or argument they find convincing. The second factor has been termed &quot;the  resources of interested parties,&quot; referring to the facilities available to the people seeking change or to the people who need to be persuaded. Four specific historical events which occurred in Australia during the 1970s illustrate these two factors; further conditions affecting the making and unmaking of policy are discussed. (MP)",

        "description":"The issue of negative bias against men in the female-dominated field of early childhood education is explored in three field studies focusing on the opinions of university students in education about male and female early childhood teachers and about selected teaching behaviors of men and women in this specialty. The first study investigated rapport between teachers and young children, comparing the rapport attributed to male teachers with that attributed to female teachers. A modified form of the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI) was administered to 105 undergraduates enrolled in an educational psychology course at the University of Manitoba. The second study, involving further modification of the MTAI and 35 additional undergraduates, focused on opinions about male  teachers only. Taken together, the first two studies suggested that future teachers attribute less rapport with children to male teachers of young children than to female teachers and that this effect is especially noticeable when respondents compare male and female teachers. A third study compared the teaching skill attributed to male and female teachers of young children in three different classroom situations. Results suggested that while male teachers are not expected to establish rapport as well as female teachers, this bias does not extend to evaluations of specific behaviors. (RH)",

Selected major assumptions about the ways in which programs attempt to influence parents are discussed, and three dimensions of parent programs are examined in order to identify the relationship between prevailing assumptions and program practices: the expertise and role of the professional in working with parents, the development of program standards of good parenting, and conceptions of how parents change. As a preface to the analysis of these areas, current trends and developments in the parent education  field are considered. (MP)",

In the first brief section, research findings concerning American youth's current smoking patterns and beliefs are described. The second section considers four conceptual models in developmental and social psychology which appear potentially useful in generating hypotheses to account for the initiation of smoking among the young and in providing conceptual bases for prevention programs. The third section reports findings of studies focusing on several psychosocial factors influencing the decision to smoke: changing sex roles, parental smoking habits, parental acceptance of children's smoking,  siblings who smoke, rebellion against family authority, peer pressures, the school environment, mass media influence, individual characteristics, and perceptions of the dangers of smoking. The fourth section reports critical evaluations of some current prevention programs, such as public information campaigns and school programs. In conclusion, recommendations for future research and prevention programs are offered. (RH)",

Chapter I reviews specific growth characteristics of children in three domains of development (psychomotor, affective, and cognitive) and suggests specific activities for promoting the child's growth in these areas. To further personalize the educational program, chapter II outlines a variety of alternatives for setting up schedules and organizing classroom activities. In chapters III, IV, and V, ideas are presented for integrating subject area  objectives and objectives from the psychomotor and affective domains with objectives related to the development of thinking abilities. Chapters VI and VII present additional suggestions for personalizing instruction by describing practical means of involving parents in the educational process and by suggesting a variety of alternatives for assisting teachers in their professional growth. A list of resources teachers can use for promoting personalized instruction, a list of objectives for each of the three domains, and sample units of activities are included in the appendices. (MP)",

        "description":"Discussed are results of studies of the cognitive development of 2- and 3-year-old children which suggest that the mind makes gains in the ability to think as gains in language development are made. &quot;Thinking&quot; in this context refers to the judgments children made as they selected objects and maneuvered them into one arrangement or another. A study of forty 1- to 3-year-old children's spontaneous manipulations of a series of object sets (divisible into two classes of four objects each) indicated two major shifts in the children's conceptual structuring. The first shift in structuring, which was found to occur during the second year, involved the construction of explicit similarity or equivalence relations between discrete objects. Beginning at 12 months, children selecting  same-class objects tended to manipulate one type of object throughout a task. Between 12 and 24 months children produced two-class groupings only by arranging one class at a time. The second shift in structuring, which occurred in the third year, involved a change in the procedure children used to construct two-class groupings. Half the 30- and 36-month-old children shifted between classes as they grouped items. It is concluded that age difference in manipulative procedure suggests a difference in conceptual strategy. Implications of the findings for Piagetian theory are discussed. (RH)",

During the first of two individual test sessions, children were given six subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Revised). In the second session, conducted about 10 days later, the three self-monitoring tasks were administered: A self-paced serial recall task assessed the child's tendency to evaluate his or her state of recall readiness during study; information was presented orally to the child and questions were asked to see whether the  child could identify inconsistencies or omissions; and the Missing Elements subtest of the KeyMath test, requiring the child to identify information omitted from an orally presented arithmetic problem, was administered. Reading and math achievement scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills and IQ scores from the Short Form Test of Academic Aptitude were obtained from school records. Results are discussed, and it is concluded that despite apparent commonalities in requirements for adequate performance, the three tasks appear to reflect separate, unrelated skills. (RH)",

In a standard Piagetian task, children were presented with two blocks of wood and asked whether they were &quot;near together&quot; or &quot;far apart.&quot; A screen was placed over part of the distance between the blocks, and children were asked whether the blocks were &quot;nearer together,&quot;&quot;farther apart,&quot; or &quot;still the same distance.&quot; Three distances were used (12, 18, 24, and 36 inches); six trials were presented at each distance with screens varying in height, width, and orientation. A second task required the child to choose a stick that would exactly fit between two blocks placed at three of the  distances used in the Piagetian task. Results indicate that some understanding of the relationship between distance and length exists approximately 2 years earlier than indicated by performance on the Piagetian task. It is suggested that Gibson's ecological view--that organisms are primarily attuned to determining what the environment affords them--could provide the basis for a theory of transition into successful performance on Piagetian concrete-operational tasks.

The first section provides an introduction, organizational history of the National Indian Council on Aging, an overview of the elderly Indian and background information on the Access Project. The second section describes the Access Project, its purpose, program variables, program implementation, and method used in selecting the four project sites. The four reservations (Jicarilla, Pine Ridge, Papago, and Siletz) are described in terms of their history, culture, government, tribal economy, climate, transportation,  community facilities, population, and socioeconomic characteristics. Findings indicate: Access identified 1,386 Indian elderly age 55+ during the 12-month project (1980-81); a significant level of involvement of elders in some programs and a need for improvement in others; and in the development of the model, some long held beliefs were proven erroneous, while others surfaced which ran counter to popularly-held ideas with the Indian community. Eight recommendations provide suggestions which deal with the enhancement of services to Indian elderly. Appendices include the site selection rating scale, a contract form, and 22 statistical tables. (AH)",

The New Mexico Court of Appeals held that the gross receipts tax imposed by the State of New Mexico was permissible based on White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker (1980). The Supreme Court reaches a different conclusion because it finds that the tax imposes an economic burden on the tribe's effort to build a school with federal funds. The dissenting opinion argued that the Court accords an Indian tribe, whose sovereignty &quot;exists only at the  sufferance of Congress and is subject to complete defeasance,&quot; greater immunity from state taxes than is enjoyed by the sovereignty of the United States on whom it is dependent.

For the first years of school parents should keep up with the child's progress in school, contact the child's teacher, help your child with homework whenever possible, set aside a place for your child's work, and have the child read books to you. During the upper grades children may need extra encouragement and  help to do their studies. Parents can give their child the best opportunity for learning by keeping a dictionary in the home, not letting the child watch TV all evening, putting aside 1 1/2 hours each night for study time, playing games to help the child learn skills, showing a good attitude towards school, praising the child when he/she does something well, and showing the child everyday you are interested in him.

Divided in three geographic, cultural areas (Northwest Coast region, Puget Sound Lowlands region, and Plateau region), information includes environmental and climatic conditions that have influenced tribal culture, livelihood (i.e. food, shelter, transportation, and clothing), and spiritual and social life. Traditions of the Native American people in the state of Washington are reinforced through activities dealing directly with the environment, use of maps, legends and cultural activities. Student objectives include: understanding environmental  characteristics of the three cultural regions through the eyes of the first people; understanding the ways of the people in each cultural region adapted to their environment; understanding how the family plays an important role in the lives of children and how family relationships affect a sense of community; understanding different art forms and how environmental materials are utilized in the art; and understanding the importance of games in teaching children their roles as adult members of the community.

        "description":"Sixty New Mexico school district superintendents responded to a survey regarding reduction of personnel and educational programs, impacts of decline on quality of education, and desirability of alteration of the funding formula to recognize impacts of declining enrollments. Three groups of districts emerged: those where reduction had occurred (32); those expecting reduction in the next several years (15); and those not expecting reduction (13). Not only were small districts affected by decline, but some larger ones as well. While teacher reduction was most likely at the secondary level, reduction in instructional aides was more likely at the elementary level. Sixteen superintendents felt that reduction should be addressed in the funding formula, 13 said it should not, and 27  favored continued study of the situation (4 did not respond to the question). Superintendents did not target any particular program for real or anticipated reduction, rather they chose several areas, particularly fine arts, enrichment courses, extracurricular activities, and interscholastic sports. Since some superintendents felt their districts' quality of education had improved in the past few years, program modification and reduction forced by decline can bring opportunities to school districts.

A return rate of 60% from 1890 schools and 74% from 1862 schools provided a sample of 3,178 students, of whom 27.2% were female, 5.3% were black, 13.7% were married, 58% were juniors and seniors, 44.1% were oldest-youngest-only child, 62.8% grew up on a farm or in a rural area smaller than 10,000 population, and 14.1% came from a city 500,000 or larger. Almost  all the students had been employed in a part-time or full-time job which was agricultural but nonfarm in nature. Sixty-five percent of the students were influenced in their choice of an agricultural major by family members. The virtually universal reason for choosing an agricultural major was to prepare for a career. That agricultural students are considerably different from their predecessors of a generation ago was vividly portrayed by the sizeable proportions of women and urban students, and the increased number of black students.

Both groups responded to scales of receptivity to change, power, and personality, as well as to demographic items. Discriminant analysis showed innovators were more receptive, experimenting, professionally active, and had a higher sense of power. Multiple regression identified variables predictive of receptivity. Female or male teachers with high receptivity were experimenting, group-identified, relaxed, and trusting. They differed from innovators in their uncertainties about principal  support and their power to influence school decision-making. Results suggested that it may be possible to manipulate personal and contextual variables associated with receptivity in order to encourage teachers to assume the risks of change. (Author/BRR)",

A mail contact procedure (supplemented by telephone and personal interviews) was conducted in 1979 and produced 964 completed questionnaires from a group previously studied in 1972. Of the respondents, 35.3% were black and 45.5% were female. Educational attainment was associated with occupational status within all race-sex groups. The largest percentage gain in occupational status for both race categories was at the  bachelor's level; however, the gain for blacks relative to whites was much greater. Supervisory responsibility was associated with educational level among white males and females but not for blacks. White men and women were more likely to attain better job quality than black men and women at the lowest educational levels, but this difference diminished at the bachelor's level and favored blacks with a post college education. In general, whites achieved more job quality returns to education than blacks, and males accrued more returns to education than females. (BRR)",

They are viewed as having problems related to self-esteem, level of aspiration, and frustration with an instructional program which often fails to provide for learning relevant to the students' interests and environment. On the plus side, these same youngsters have identified strengths in logical thinking, problem-solving, sensitivity to injustice, and interest in people and their activities. Instructional strategies involving decision making skills are viewed as a viable approach to addressing both the needs and abilities of rural gifted youth. Specific guidelines in decision making training which teachers can use are to: provide a means  for student responses, oral or written, which establishes the individual student's decision and the basis for the decision; prepare exercises which are real-life situations that assist students in defining their own sense of purpose and identity; and choose incidents or issues that will engage the students' interests and emotions. Such strategies can provide students with opportunities to practice skills in areas of their strengths and in the context of a curriculum focusing on relevant, real-life situations of interest to a particular group of students.

First, characteristics of a model of student performance for solving linear equations is discussed. It is noted that there is a need for some theoretical structure to support and organize the bits and pieces of information provided by available research. Next, known research on student performance for solving linear equations is surveyed. The material goes on to discuss modeling performance. A student performance model is presented, and research questions are suggested. The suggested questions are viewed to be ones that need to be addressed in order to elucidate the relevance of the model presented. A hope is expressed that future research will be part of a deeper study  and analysis of student performance in solving linear equations. A thorough understanding of performance is seen as a possible aid to pupil improvement in algebra competencies. (MP)",

        "description":"This investigation focused on teachers' questioning skills and the use of wait time (length of pauses after questions). A sample of 40 experienced middle school science teachers from 5 suburban school districts in 1 central New York State county was divided into 4 treatment groups of 10 teachers each. One group received instruction in wait time using a newly-developed electronic feedback device that monitors the duration of teacher and student pauses. (A green light glows when the criterion of a 3 second pause is met.) A second group received instruction in general questioning skills. A third group received both instruction and the use of the feedback device, while the fourth group served as a comparison and received neither instruction nor the electronic device. Tape recordings  of class discussions were coded and analyzed for classroom interaction data. Comparisons were made using discriminant analysis, analyses of variance, and correlational relationships. The two groups using the electronic feedback device increased their wait time (although not to the 3 second criterion), used greater numbers of high level questions, and received more contributions from students as measured by length of answers, frequency of volunteered contributions, numbers of relevant student words, and percentages of student talk.

The project was conceived, reviewed, and funded on the premise that improving research and writing skills would increase the professional status of women faculty at minority institutions of higher education. Additional chapters focus on women in science and science education (chapter 2), considering training/retention of women scientists, women in science in academe, and minority women; minority science education (chapter 3), examining minority institutions of higher  education and minority science education in secondary schools and colleges; a profile of southern minority undergraduates (chapter 5); and recommendations, participants, participating institutions/students in chapter 6. Six research studies completed by project participants are presented in chapter 4. Issues examined in the studies include: ability/aptitude and characteristics of black college students; effects of instructional methods on achievement; factors affecting biology achievement; efficacy of spatial ability and other measures in predicting mathematics of minority students; urban minority characteristics related to biology achievement; and classroom verbal behavior patterns as indicators of locus of control orientation.

The principal categories of effective teacher behavior included planned concrete learning experiences, creative use of learning materials, and detailed descriptions/instructions. Principal consequences of effective teacher behaviors included cognitive learning and emotional satisfaction with the learning process. Reasons for positive perception of the learning process included being provided with access to information, enhanced motivation/interest, social interaction, and flexible time allotments. Ineffective teacher behaviors included absense of detailed directions/explanations, lack of  planned concrete learning experiences, and inappropriate materials, resulting in reduced learning and dissatisfaction with the learning process due to lack of access to information and reduced interest/motivation. Students indicated that although they believe the teacher is the key factor in instruction, they themselves must accept responsibility for improving their own learning. Demographic analysis revealed the existence of a pool of blind students who might pursue studies in science, but who avoid mathematics. These critical incidents may be used to improve instructional practices to help blind students progress in science and mathematics courses at the post-secondary level. (Author/JN)",

To gather data relevant to those processes, 168 in-depth interviews were conducted with male and female students majoring in mathematics and with faculty at three Chicago area universities. The strength of the study rests in (1) the focus on females who have &quot;survived&quot; the high school attrition process and who are able mathematicians upon entry into college, (2) the pervasive focus on social processes in which educational experiences are embedded, and (3) the systematic sex-comparative research design. Data analysis was qualitative in nature, and the data are presented in the form of (1)  simple distributions of responses suitable for determining overall patterns and (2) an analysis of direct quotes to determine personal meanings. An explanatory schema is presented regarding sex-differentiation which was induced from the data. That schema hinges on processes of self-selection, differential association, sex variation in the specificity of support networks, narrow versus diffuse perceptions of the world, and differences in opportunism and instrumentality. Little evidence of systematic or overt sex discrimination was found in the universities. (Author)",

The sample (N=80), drawn from five urban schools, was evenly divided by race (black and white). Instruction in class was based on laboratory work or other activities requiring active pupil participation. Systematic observations made by trained observers over a 3-month period yielded frequencies of 14 behaviors that were combined to form 3 broad behavior categories: (1) active learning; (2) passive learning; and (3) non-attending. No systematic race or sex differences were found in behavior. Entering math and reading scores were the best predictors of final grade but active learning behavior was also a significant contributor to final grade. Pupils tended to  interact most frequently with members of the same race. The most significant finding is that, for the junior high school pupils in this sample, obstacles to achievement in science were not related to race and sex, but rather to poor math and reading skills and failure to participate in the learning activities of the classroom.

A comprehensive literature search revealed 83 &quot;articles&quot; (journal publications, books, unpublished reports, dissertations), standardized tests, and large-scale national/international studies providing data on sex differences and reporting either statistics from which &quot;Effect Size&quot; could be derived or information which could be tallied into &quot;Vote Scores.&quot; (Vote scores contain less information than Effect Sizes, but their use permitted inclusion of all studies in which sex comparisons were made, even though detailed statistics were lacking.) Data  from 298 independent samples provided 613 Effect Sizes and 132 Vote Scores which were analyzed using a general linear model approach to analysis of variance, controlling for intercorrelations among variables. Results indicated that sex differences in attitude/achievement were smaller than generally assumed, but when they did occur, with few exceptions, tended to favor males. Data on sex differences in attitude are discussed within the context of a large number of school, individual, and methodological variables including academic discipline, age, instrument reliability, country of sample, socioeconomic status, geographic region, age, and dimension of attitude.

This document reports results of a study which involved about 2700 students in 13 high schools, selected to provide broad representation of community socio-economics in the United States. The investigation looked at: (1) How are entering geometry students distributed with respect to the levels in the Van Hiele scheme; (2) What changes in Van Hiele levels take place after a year's study of geometry; (3) To what extent are levels related to concurrent geometry achievement; (4) To what extent do levels predict geometry achievement after a year's study; (5) What generalizations can be made concerning the entering  Van Hiele level and geometry knowledge of students who are later found to be unsuccessful in their study of geometry; (6) To what extent is geometry being taught to students appropriate to their level; and (7) To what extent do geometry classes in different schools and socio-economic settings differ in content appropriateness to student level.

A Design Lab is not a customary &quot;shop&quot; where students receive training in woodworking, metalworking, and other crafts. Instead, when a construction need arises during USMES units, a Design Lab becomes the central location for tools, materials, and working space for students to plan and build according to their theories, make and benefit from mistakes, and develop improved designs. Section I provides general information, focusing on the USMES Design Lab concept, tone of student activities, safety considerations, and what students have made in Design Labs. Section II, focusing on setting up Design Labs, discusses planning a Lab, forms of Design Labs  (in-class Labs, portable Labs, separate-room Labs), and Design Lab tools and materials. Section III addresses staffing and training, including an overview of staffing/training considerations, Design Lab orientation methods, staffing, and teacher training. Appendices include a bibliography, list of Design Lab &quot;How To&quot; cards, nature of USMES and its resources, tri-wall (three-layered cardboard) ordering information, and Design Lab inventory lists.

Since children often design and build things in USMES, 26 &quot;Design Lab&quot; cards provide information on the safe use and simple maintenance of tools. Each card has a large photograph of the tool or tools on the top. The first frame on most cards is a photograph of a child holding the tool, providing the user with an understanding of how the tool is held. Remaining frames describe important skills in using the tool. Primary grade students or older students with reading problems should find the large photographs/illustrations useful in understanding the material presented with little reliance on accompanying word descriptions.  Tools described include: electric tools (saber saw, electric drill, glue gun, soldering gun); handsaws (crosscut, coping, keyhole saws and hacksaw); other hand tools that cut (files, circle cutter, wood chisel, block plane, hand drill); holding tools (pliers, &quot;C&quot; clamp, screwdriver, hammer, size of nails); and measuring tools (combination square, rafter square, level). Additional cards provide instructions for maintaining a saber saw and electric drill and for making a sawhorse, tri-wall slot, and bend in a tri-wall. (Author/JN)",

Section I focuses on techniques for conducting USMES informational meetings to introduce administrators/teachers/parents to USMES. It is designed to provide them with information they need to decide whether they want to involve themselves and their students in the program. Section II describes in detail strategies for conducting USMES workshops for teachers. These workshops provide teachers with experiences they need to successfully work on USMES units with their students. Section III deals with methods of training Design Lab managers. The training session gives  paraprofessionals, parent volunteers, and high school or college students the background they need to work in Design Labs with students and teachers as they design and construct the things they need to carry out work on USMES challenges. The first section is preceeded by a short discussion of ways USMES differs from other curricula, emphasizing what is unique about the program and providing a focus for the sections that follow.

This study evaluated programmed instruction in mathematics using a system designed to solve these problems by having students work in heterogeneous teams and do all scoring themselves. This cooperative-individualized program, called Team-Assisted Individualization, or TAI, was assessed in two field experiments in elementary schools. Students in the TAI classes in both experiments scored higher than control students (controlling for pretest and grade) on a standardized mathematics test, but not higher than a group that used the materials and student  management but not teams. Attitude and behavioral rating results followed the same general pattern. (Author)",

        "description":"The development of selected science process skills in required and elective science classes in three high schools of a suburban Oregon school district was investigated. Science process skill knowledge in the areas of classifying, observing, interpreting data, identifying variables, modeling, and measuring was assessed by administration of an investigator-developed Science Process Competency Test (SPCT), a 24-item, multiple-choice test consisting of six subtests, one for each of the science process skill areas being assessed. In addition, other program and learner variables important in accounting for variance on the SPCT were identified. Subjects (N=900 grade 9-12 students) completed the SPCT, questionnaires, and California Achievements Tests (reading, language, mathematics) as a  measure of academic achievement. The most important variable in accounting for SPCT variance was the level of academic achievement, with mathematics and reading achievement the strongest predictors. Other significant predictor variables included SPCT pretest score, sex, completing elective science, amount of elective science, elective physical science, type of required science, and school. Additional results are reported and implications/recommendations discussed. Supporting documentation (school district information, course statements, teacher materials/questionnaires, validation panel, SPCT, student materials/questionnaires, variable list, and a short essay on unified science education) are included in appendices.

There are three major sections. Section I examines the special needs and characteristics of youth in the 10 to 14 age group. Discussed is how youth participation programs can offer almost endless possibilities for meeting the specific needs of early adolescence. The role of the adult leader in facilitating programs is also examined. To provide ideas and examples for those wanting to start their own youth participation programs, section II presents five case studies: a Community Service and Career Exploration Program in Shoreham, New York; a Peer Tutoring Program in  Indianapolis, Indiana; a GUTS (Government Understanding for Today's Students) program in Bronx, New York; a Cooperative Science Education Program in New York City; and a Junior Historian Club in Ahoskie, North Carolina. Implementation is the focus of section III. Discussed are program components, practical guidelines for starting a program, the role of the adult facilitator, and tips for working with community resource people. Recommendations from a practitioner are also presented. Appendices contain brief sketches of additional programs, the addresses and contact people for the programs described in section II, a bibliography of resources, and a listing of the publications of the National Commission on Resources for Youth.

        "description":"The role that public schools should play in citizenship education is addressed. Two questions are: (1) Should public schools provide citizenship education in the early years for all age groups? and (2) Should schools teach citizenship as an integrated set of values, not as an isolated affect toward country? The task of citizenship education as defined in the study is to teach favorable attitudes toward eight societal components: country, state, neighborhood, voluntary membership organizations, religious organizations, school, home, and self. The sample for the study was 469 randomly selected students from Southeast Texas. A questionnaire was administered to 169 5th graders, 159 8th graders, and 141 11th graders. It sought to measure their values toward the eight societal  components. Results showed that, quantitatively speaking, values to societal components were as high, or higher, at the 5th grade, as they were at the 8th or 11th grade. The fact that students' values appear to have been assimilated by the 5th grade makes a strong case for teaching citizenship education in the early grades. From a statistical standpoint, a values \"slump\" did exist at the 8th grade in reference to five of the components. Not only does citizenship education need to be taught at an early age, it needs to be maintained at a consistently high level throughout public school. The results also showed a high degree of interrelatedness for most of the components. (RM)",

        "description":"This research project analyzed the manifest and hidden curriculum of a sixth-grade writing project to determine how it transmitted societal values. Entitled &quot;Right is Write&quot;, the writing project was a simulation game in which students played roles of writers, agents, editors, and publishers interacting to produce, evaluate, buy, and sell compositions intended for a predetermined audience. Sources of data included field notes, videotapes, teacher interviews, and a student questionnaire. The results indicated that socioeconomic and political values were transmitted through the game. Socioeconomic values manifested by students included those of earning money, becoming an effective salesperson, and producing both quality and quantities of products. Students were drawn into the web of  capitalism by incentives of profit and domination. Political values were manifested both in the game itself and through interventions or constraints to its enactment. For example, predetermined content, fragmentation of time blocks, and emphasis on skills indicated traditional or conservative influences. The game illustrated many ideas of Dewey and liberalism. For example, students enacted occupational roles that integrated skills of communication, economics, and mathematics in a game of interest to them. Another political value illustrated through the game was radicalism. Students questioned unequal assets, disproportionate allocation of roles, differences in privileges, and unequal opportunities to obtain rewards. They proposed and discussed modification but did not explicitly challenge  the legitimacy of the game itself and its economic and political presuppositions. (RM)",

Questions were addressed concerning the desired outcome of the mandate, the actual outcomes, and potential alternatives for bringing about the desired outcome. The history of the mandate for bilingual education and current issues related to the mandate were reviewed. Information was obtained through study of reports and statutes and interviews of teachers, administrators, and legislators. Among the issues reviewed were the purposes of bilingual education and the most effective ways to provide services to limited English speaking students. It was concluded that (1) the state has a compelling interest in mandating the provision of transitional bilingual  education services to all limited English speaking students, (2) there is no need to mandate a particular instructional methodology for these services, and (3) the teaching of ethnic history and culture should not be required by law.

First, three points are noted that affect the way materials are conceived: the type of user and the way of giving choices regarding exercises, the fact that the computer is primarily a medium adapted to the written word, and the adaptability of the equipment to be used. Secondly, vital ingredients in the design of a CAL lesson are presented: the questions to be answered, the format that is most adaptable to the point in question, the desirability of contextualization, user-aid features to be included, and provision for error analysis and feedback. A third section deals with examples of CAL materials created at the University of Western Ontario. These  range from a translation-based drill and practice review of vocabulary to a contextualized drill. Both of these were designed for teletype terminals. A second example of CAL lessons is one on numbers and dates that was designed for use with color microcomputers. The final section of the paper deals with the place such a system should be given in the curriculum, that is, whether it should be responsible for instruction in certain aspects of the course or whether it should have a solely adjunctive role. Finally, human factors such as faculty attitudes and the part they play are discussed. (AMH)",

Originally it was described as a way of providing a means for abundant practice of audiolingual drills. Currently, it is described as a learning center with multiple resources and functions. It might be characterized as a facilitative system whose purpose is to help learners cultivate and fulfill their own expectations. Two case studies illustrate its form and function. First, beginning language classes might have three features; large group, small group, and independent study sessions. The small group conversation sessions would be held near the laboratory and would use its materials. All the independent study and practice would be done in the laboratory or at  home. In this framework, instructors are freed from more mechanical aspects of teaching, and so have the time and energy to facilitate learning. Different approaches and time-divisions can be adapted to students' personalities and learning styles. For intermediate, advanced, and literature classes, the laboratory functions as a resource center, providing materials and a multi-dimensional context for learning. A sizable bibliography, a glossary of terms, and examples of integrative techniques are appended. (AMH)",

        "description":"An experiment was carried out at the University of Edinburgh to discover ways in which students might be helped to understand spoken language and to become more confident in their interactions in the language. As a result of the experiment findings, materials were designed to train students to perceive stress patterns, to internalize stress-timing at both word and sentence levels, and to develop an accurate awareness of the perceptual structure of the message. The materials and methods of the course that was developed were designed to exploit the advantages of the tapes in use in the language laboratory, and the possibilities offered by the laboratory for active student use of the language and for self-assessment. The materials prepared for the course were chosen according to  linguistic, functional, and stylistic criteria. The stress and rhythm patterns were simplified for perceptual training through regularization of the patterns, while maintaining the stress location of the authentic discourse. It is claimed that such training in stress perception allows the understanding process to operate more efficiently and accurately, and that its most important feature is the active and critical matching of the main stress pattern as this is perceived by the student with the \"objective\" stress pattern of the master.

Secondary level bilingual students' needs differ from those of elementary school bilingual students because of the diversity of student backgrounds, variety of curricular demands, and diversity of future language skill needs among secondary students. Two studies of the language skills of Spanish speaking high school students are summarized. These studies show that linguistic competence can be differentiated from communicative competence, both theoretically and in terms of other criterion variables describing actual language use and school achievement. The findings suggest a need for further research into the nature of skills  transfer across languages, effective teaching strategies, and relationships between language skills and achievement.

English verbs can be assigned to one of six categories: pure intransitives, causative-inchoative verbs, psych-movement verbs, cross-classification verbs, direct object deletions, and pure transitives. Both syntacticians and English as a second language teachers face theoretical problems in determing the boundaries between these categories and defining membership in each category. Given the difficulty of categorization, the theorist is unable to state a rule for the teacher to use in the classroom, and the behavior of verbs with respect to transitivity must be viewed as unpredictable. The properties of each of the six categories are described,  demonstrating that transitivity/intransitivity is a continuum rather than a dichotomy. However, enough is known about this continuum to permit both theorists and teachers to determine how aspects of verb behavior can be introduced in the classroom. (RW)",

In examining the roles of speech and grammar in the early stages of ESL acquisition in an English speaking elementary school environment, six types of expressive language were observed in children acquiring ESL in a natural environment: silence, immediate imitation without context, immediate imitation with context, delayed imitation with transferred context, syntactically broken independent speech, and syntactically unbroken independent speech. It is suggested that beginning levels of ESL instruction should involve comprehensible input and sequenced unanalyzed wholes appropriate for each student's acquisition  level, and should teach expressive English for interaction with native speakers of English.

Taylor calls for an approach to English as second language composition in which students are taught how to write with an emphasis on revision. Most authorities agree that revision entails a complex set of behaviors that occur throughout the writing process. Studies of revision content indicate that some revision processes, even the more complex ones, can be taught to younger learners. The research also shows that relatively complex revision skills have been less effectively taught than the simpler skills involving spelling or punctuation. It is argued that revision is one of the least taught writing skills and that most composition students are allowed to  submit rough-draft copy. Teachers must learn to view early drafts as unfinished rather than wrong. (RW)",

A short survey form consisting of three open-ended questions was sent to 153 of the dropouts, while a long form with about 30 objective questions was sent to 1,498 dropouts. Thirty-two responses to the short form and 250 responses to the long form revealed that financial pressures and personal, health, and family-related problems constituted a large majority of the reasons given by students for not returning to BCC. One-third of all responses related to the cost of college, the need for money, or a job; 26.9 percent of the students gave personal, family, health, marriage, and maternity reasons. About 17-20 percent of the remaining students cited academic difficulties, the  need for tutoring and counseling, and unavailability of needed courses and schedules as reasons for withdrawing. About 22 percent of the dropouts intended to transfer to another school, and 15.3 percent actually enrolled in other schools (39 percent at private or public trade or career schools, 36 percent at four-year City University of New York colleges, and 23 percent at other community colleges). The 215 responses to a question about future plans indicated that almost 75 percent intended to re-enroll at BCC during the next 1 to 2 years. Students requested assistance with finances, financial aid counseling, fee payment flexibility, and more opportunities for employment. Course scheduling was a second major need area identified by students. (SW)",

Among the findings are these: record numbers of degrees were awarded in the South at all but  the master's level; the South accounts for one in four of all degrees awarded in the nation; women increased their share of degrees; women earn less than one-third of all doctorates, with most concentrated in traditionally female-dominated fields (e.g., home economics, foreign languages, library science, and nursing); women earn a higher proportion of degrees at all levels except first-professional in the South than nationally; and women doubled their share of first-professional degrees in the last 5 years but account for only one in four degrees nationally and one in five in the South.

Women represented 20 percent of the sample; minorities, 8 percent. Women and minorities were largely registrars, librarians, and financial aid directors; men were largely presidents, chief business officers, and registrars. Of the 653 deans, 90 (13.8 percent) were women, and over half of the women deans were in the fields of nursing, home economics, arts and sciences, and continuing education. In addition, 5.5 percent of the deans were minorities. Men were more likely to hold new positions than women, and higher percentages of men held academic rank compared to women; 87.8 percent of  male administrators were currently married, and 43.7 percent of the women were. Career mobility issues did not differ significantly for men and women, but slightly higher percentages of minorities and women were seeking a job change in comparison to whites and men. Minority respondents felt that major increases had taken place in their opportunities for professional advancement and personal autonomy. The greatest future concerns for both whites and minorities were student recruitment and retention. Minorities were more concerned about affirmative action than were whites, and both minorities and whites agreed that if fiscal matters deteriorated, athletics should be cut first. (SW)",

While education may be viewed as instrumental to the development of the individual and the overall society, some believe education should provide specific job training. In the first view, the needs of future generations are considered in terms of human competence, civic responsibility, professional ability, and individual fulfillment. In the second case, education is valued as leading to a particular opportunity for a given kind of work and life. Views of the liberal arts have varied from ancient times and the Renaissance to the 1980s. In the 1980s, there is a return to the view that education has become too fragmented and that in the  late 1960s curricula lost their coherence and teachers their convictions. The character of education within the university requires educators who demand breadth in the approach to their subjects, self-conscious reflectiveness, thoughtfulness, and a respect for rigorous intellectual activity. Although a \"core\" curriculum may be a good approach to general or liberal education, liberal education is a particular approach toward education rather than a specified syllabus or curriculum.

The program, initiated through the interdisciplinary gerontology program, entailed group discussions and individual followup and counseling when appropriate. Discussion topics were housing, legal matters, leisure and volunteer work, health, and finances, including budgeting on a fixed income. Forty-one participants, or 5 percent of the college's faculty, attended either on-campus sessions for 6 weeks or two off-campus sessions. Most participants were involved in social networks, organizations, and leisure activities, and many were looking forward to having more time to spend in these activities during retirement. Most had done some planning for retirement, mainly financial,  and they were primarily interested in discussing financial topics such as investments, budgeting, and pensions. A university-based preretirement program has advantages other programs may not have: university consultants are knowledgeable in specific subject matters, instructional techniques, and adult development; the university consultants are available for further counseling or followup; information and material can be easily revised as new data are obtained; and sessions can also be offered in community locales. The university can also benefit from a retirement preparation program through training corporation personnel and students in industrial gerontology or preretirement planning. (SW)",

Interracial teams first undertook field work at 13 colleges and universities that experienced a substantial increase in black enrollments between 1968 and 1972, and students, faculty, and administrators at 4 of the 13 institutions were then surveyed. The sample included: four small, private colleges (Lewis University and Bradley University in Illinois, Carleton College and Macalester College in Minnesota); two large, private universities (Northwestern University in Illinois and a school that wished to remain anonymous); four small, public institutions (Clarion State College and California State College in Pennsylvania, the University of Missouri, Kansas City, and  State University of New York, Brockport); and three large public universities (Bowling Green State University, Ohio, and two colleges that wished to remain anonymous). Attention is directed to: predisposing internal and external forces; active recruitment of blacks; conflict during the transition; active accommodation for black students through development of programs and support; and reassessment. None of the 13 institutions had full institutionalization (i.e., legitimated review procedures and high institutional priority on black programs), although more than half seemed to be approaching partial institutionalization (i.e., no legitimated procedures but high priority on black programs).

At Creighton, new psychology majors receive brochures covering the program, future study, and employment. A source of information for the brochures was a survey of psychology graduates,  which found that about 41 percent of the psychology department's graduates entered the job market immediately following graduation. In addition, Creighton's formal advising system, counseling center, and career development course offered within the psychology department provide career information. In this course, students complete the Self-Directed Search (Holland, 1974) and the System for Career Decision-Making (Harrington and O'Shea, 1980) and conduct an in-depth investigation of a career.

The major change models for higher education institutions are: research, development, and diffusion (rational planning); problem solving; social interaction; political (conflict); linkage; and adaptive development. Structural features of the institution that may affect receptivity to change include school size and decentralized/centralized decision-making procedures. Characteristics that indicate openness to change include lateral rather than vertical communications, a consensus on operating  goals, a spirit of self-examination, provision of resources for change, and widespread influence on decision-making. Ongoing planning processes that rely on institutional research data to plan long-range goals and to revise the plans periodically may allow the institution to respond to the need for change. Use of an internal versus an external change agent are compared. Steps in instituting change may involve trying to create a receptive climate, diagnosing the problem that led to a need for change, developing a proposal for implementing the change, campaigning to gain approval, and implementation.

Dimensions of teaching that students evaluate may include: skill, rapport, assignments, breadth of coverage, tests and grading, group interaction, enthusiasm, and organization. The extent to which students' evaluations of faculty correlate with variables thought to reflect effective teaching may be  addressed by considering the following criteria: student achievement, instructor self-evaluations, and improved student attitudes toward the subject. A number of studies have examined the \"Doctor Fox\" effect: the possibility that student assessments of teacher effectiveness are more a function of an instructor's wit and personality than of the educational content of the lecture. It is concluded that the research indicates that (1) evaluations are not significantly influenced by background variables, and are valid, reliable, stable, generalizable, and useful, and (2) properly constructed evaluation questionnaires assess multiple dimensions of the instructional process.

Retention of nontraditional  freshmen was slightly over 50 percent after 1 year and 35 percent after 2 years. Retention rates were slightly higher for sophomores and juniors. The graduation rate in 4 years was low for nontraditional students; however, it appears that about 50-76 percent of sophomores, juniors, and seniors graduate by 5-6 years after entry.

Both of these factors are combined in the Significant Change Model to produce the behavioral relationship between the organization and its members. A matrix of the model illustrates the interactions between the perceptions of magnitude and value of institutional change. For example, in the first section of the matrix, there is a perception of no change in the organization and an attachment of no positive value to this: the status quo prevails. Nine sections of the  matrix are explained with reference to higher education institutions. A further graphic representation of the Significant Change Model occurs by applying the components to the cusp catastrophe model, which provides an additional qualitative dimension toward the development of the model.

First, the ability to produce considerable data is often followed by requests to produce even more data, and the researcher may become more a data supplier than an information supplier or data analyst. A second danger is conflicting or overlapping demands for data from the institutional research office.  Finally, computers threaten institutional research by promising practitioners the esteem and gratitude of the campus community via administrative status as computer-output experts. It is suggested that the primary function in which institutional research should be involved is policy analysis. That is, the value of institutional research resides in its ability to provide meaningful analyses of institutional data on important issues, and computers only partially assist in this process.

        "description":"A model for predicting student credit hours (SCH) over a 2-year period was developed at the University of South Florida. A major application of the model would be to estimate the expected loss of upper-level SCH that would occur as a result of reduced lower-level enrollment. Attention was focused on the long-range effect of lower-level enrollment caps. The model may also be useful for estimating SCH reductions due to increased admission standards or more restrictive changes in the eligibility requirements for federal student aid programs. Components of the model include: mean SCH by course level; student type; and retention rate by student type over time. The predicted SCH means and retention rates were developed from a 50 percent random cohort sample of the 4,696 new University  of South Florida student population from 1976 to 1980. The cohort groups were based on entering term. The remaining half of the student population was used to validate the model. For all student types combined, the predicted SCH was approximately two percent greater than the actual SCH generated. Statistical tables provide the SCH means and retention rates for each cohort group (fall, winter, spring, summer) by student type for eight terms, along with validation results. (SW)",

The papers of 253 students taking family medicine were evaluated for spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. Four types of grammar errors and seven punctuation errors were analyzed, and each word misspelled was counted only once, even if it appeared several times. Spelling errors were found in 184 papers (73 percent), averaging 3.68 misspellings per paper, while grammar errors occurred in 75 papers (30 percent), averaging 2.16 per paper. Punctuation errors were discovered in 153 papers (60 percent), with 3.5 errors on average. Only 14 percent of the papers had no errors. Fifty-five percent had errors in more than one category, and 23  percent had errors in all three categories. It is concluded that more than half of the medical students had problems with written English, and nearly one quarter committed simple errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation. Of the nine words most commonly misspelled, only one was a technical medical word. It is recommended that serious consideration be given by medical faculties to reintroducing formal written papers in the medical school curriculum. (SW)",

An information processing view that focuses on the internal activities of thinking and the relationship to external stimuli is considered. Information processing studies indicate that: (1) a person applies one's own rules and strategies in problem-solving, and (2) a comprehensive test is a general test that does not consider the fact that some individuals may require more information or time to sufficiently answer the question. Attention is directed to &quot;executive control processes,&quot; or mechanisms that vary among individuals and that determine the learner's information processing approaches for  different learning tasks. The functioning of the executive control process in a problem-solving activity is related to progressive deepening and reaction time. Progressive deepening is a process that humans go through as problem-solvers in a hypothetical action. It is proposed that the evaluation of individuals exposed to performance-oriented instruction should include attributes of the performance orientation, flexible time constraints, and freedom to use one's own strategies.

        "description":"New users learning to use text-processing systems, especially those who are using self-study materials without expert supervision, must often make sense of actions and events in situations where they have little basis, in prior knowledge or current information, for inferring what is happening or why. Many cases have been observed where learners were able to generate an explanation to account for some particular fact or event, despite this limited knowledge. This process of explanation generation resembles abductive reasoning, as C. S. Peirce describes it: adopting a hypothesis when it, along with other assumptions, allows one to account for some fact or observation. This paper presents examples of how new users try to account for their experiences and the resemblance of these  processes to abductive reasoning. Observations are also made about the possible role and implications of abductive reasoning for complex learning situations, such as learning to use a text-processor. Twelve references are listed.

Preliminary sections describe the nature of the technology events during this decade, discuss the implications of the environmental technological events for changing the nature of educational needs and the types of educational services demanded by the public, examine the impact of technology events on the  evolution of technological opportunity, and discuss the implications for developing new forms of delivery systems. Impediments to increased use of technology in education are examined, and a theory of the consequences of inadequate public school response to technological needs is presented. The final sections discuss federal policy and research issues and present a summary. A six-page bibliography and a cost estimate for a computer-rich classroom in 1985 are included. (Author/LMM)",

Schools were encouraged to make long-range improvement plans by focusing on acquisition of Title IV-B supplementary instructional materials and library resources for students and curriculum areas showing the greatest need, and each program contains a rationale for needing the supplementary materials, an objective to be achieved, a plan for using the materials in the instructional program, and a plan for evaluating the degree to which the objective was reached. This booklet was designed to encourage schools to contact each other for additional information, as the programs described  suggest models for other schools desiring to write instructional improvement programs. Part I provides brief descriptions of the 1981-82 projects in 12 categories: reading, science, math, social studies, language, study skills, library, art/music, map skills, computer, health, and other topics. Each project is explained with a 1-page format, showing target topic, grade level, target site, type of school, school name, contact person(s), school data, target group objectives, methods and materials used, and results. The second section presents statistical data on the growth of the project and its status through the 1981-82 school year, some data on 1982-83, and a map of service regions. (LMM)",

In each area, attempts are being made to bring together curricular analysis, analysis of microcomputer capabilities, measurement of individual differences, the psychology of a responsive environment, criterion referenced evaluation, and cognitive psychology. This joint analysis leads to the project's guiding question: For what concepts or processes within a given curriculum area do the unique capabilities of the computer allow us to apply sound educational principles in new ways? The real promise  of computer software in instruction lies in the capability for providing learners with new types of interactive experiences. Six levels of possible interaction have been identified: watching, finding, doing, using, constructing, and creating. To make the best use of the technologies available, we must analyze the instructional task and apply appropriate computer tools to it. (LMM)",

The performance of each representation is analyzed, as is overlap among the representations, i.e., the extent to which the same documents are retrieved when searching with different vocabulary configurations. The study's use of a DIALOG simulator known as DIATOM, the participation of 7 trained searching intermediaries, and the soliciting of search questions from 114 online users are described. Major differences between the two databases in terms of which representations perform most effectively, and consistently low overlaps among representations  are reported. Results are also discussed in terms of the cumulative improvement on retrieval performance as representations are added sequentially. A probabilistic model of overlap is developed based on the assumption of random retrieval, and this model is fitted against the obtained asymmetric overlaps and the incremental improvements obtained by different overlaps. A total of 20 tables and 15 references are provided. Appendices comprise intermediary training materials, instructions to study participants regarding citation relevance judgements, directions to online users, and sample forms for searchers, as well as the study's Latin square and factorial design, analysis of variance summary results, and theoretical model proofs.

The essay is divided into four sections dealing with: (1) works which present the origin and development of the undergraduate library as a concept and provide definitions of the term; (2) literature which reflects the philosophy and rationale for establishing undergraduate libraries; (3) publications which describe currently and formerly existing undergraduate libraries at 27 institutions, arranged in  chronological order by library founding date; and (4) studies which evaluate and compare undergraduate libraries.

Bound volume usage was measured by affixing self-adhesive markers to volume spines when reshelving, and later counting these markers. A total of 1,151 of the 7,281 bound volumes were marked. Considering the years 1950 to 1979, volumes from 1961 to 1979 satisfied 90.2 percent of user needs. Only 15 of the 45 titles held before 1950 were used. Current periodical usage was evaluated using a survey attached to all journal issues arriving in the library during the study period. A total of 517 surveys were retrieved from the 604 currrent issues received; 73  issues were lost. Undergraduate use of the periodicals was 75.2 percent; graduate use was 15.2 percent; and use by others was 9.6 percent. There were 3,187 uses by patrons, indicating an average of 6 uses per surveyed issue. The cost of conducting this survey was minimal. Appended to the survey report are a list of UGL journal holdings by title, and statistics of both bound volume and current issue usage for each title.

After looking at the characteristics of junior/community college faculty handbooks in the 1960s, the paper discusses the effects of collective bargaining on the current use of handbooks as in-house communication organs and notes that they are frequently being replaced by policy manuals covering areas not yet encompassed by collective bargaining agreements. The paper's next sections offer suggestions for employing and improving college handbooks, citing exemplary practices from the handbooks reviewed. These suggestions include: (1)  clarify relationships between handbooks and collective bargaining contracts or other regulatory sources to avoid confusion and legal complications; (2) offer expanded information on curriculum development, instructional improvement, institutional purpose, and staff development opportunities as part of the handbooks or as separate documents; (3) develop specialized handbooks for particular groups, such as counselors, instructional and service specialists, and administrators; (4) provide information on policies and regulations related to the often neglected topics of institutional research and articulation and transfer; and (5) maintain an informal and straightforward style.

The study indicated that: (1) within the past 5 years, the number of adjunct faculty had increased 69% at JCCC (to 59% of the total faculty), 31% at KCKCC (to 58% of the total), and 30% at PVCC (to 39% of the total); (2) adjunct faculty had served an average of 6 semesters at JCCC, 2 semesters at KCKCC, and 4.5 semesters at PVCC;  (3) compensation for full-time faculty members was two to three times higher than for part-time faculty; and (4) staff development provisions for part-time faculty at the colleges were limited, with only KCKCC having a well-defined and ongoing program. The study confirmed the conclusions drawn from the literature that part-time faculty are underpaid and neglected in terms of staff development.

Faculty members were asked to assess their morale in relation to their college position; to evaluate campus conditions related to remuneration and benefits, teaching and research, relations with the central OSU campus, facilities and services, and miscellaneous factors; and to identify the most and least important contributors to faculty morale. Based on responses from 35 of 41 faculty members surveyed, the 1981 study revealed that: (1) 97% of the respondents indicated that their general morale was average, high, or very high; (2) salary was considered the major fiscal consideration related to morale and was viewed as \"somewhat favorable\" by 54% of the respondents;  (3) campus setting, colleagues' competence, and instructional independence were viewed most favorably by the respondents, while opportunities for outside employment, cultural opportunities, and climate and location were viewed least favorably; (4) the factors identified as being most important in relation to morale were salary, instructional independence, and student motivation, while the least important factors were viewed as opportunities for outside employment and student assistance; and (5) 70% of the respondents were optimistic or very optimistic about their future at OSU Lima. The study report includes comparisons with the earlier studies and the 1981 survey instrument. (HB)",

        "description":"In 1975 and 1981, surveys were conducted at the Lima regional campus of Ohio State University (OSU) to determine the perceptions of tenured and nontenured faculty with regard to the articulated faculty concept, whereby regional campus instructors are fully affiliated with academic departments at the OSU central campus. Faculty were asked to indicate: (1) the level of their understanding of the concept; (2) the extent to which certain benefits were associated with the articulated faculty concept (i.e., prestige; salary benefits; professional interaction with central campus staff; professional contacts at state and national levels; encouragement and support in teaching, research/creative work, and professional service; assistance in securing materials; and future professional  mobility); (3) the importance of each benefit; and (4) the ideal and existing weights given to teaching, research, and service in the promotion and tenure process. Responses from 22 tenured and 15 nontenured faculty to the 1981 survey revealed a high degree of understanding of the articulated faculty concept. Prestige, encouragement and support in research and creative work, professional interaction with departmental colleagues, and national-level professional contacts were strongly associated with the concept. Tenured and nontenured groups felt that the relative weights of teaching, research, and service should be altered in the promotion and tenure process. Comparisons with 1975 findings and the questionnaire are included. (AYC)",

        "description":"At Kirkwood Community College (KCC), student paraprofessionals are used in a variety of ways. They are employed in the Learning Resources Center; in the production of graphic materials; in microwave, instructional fixed service, and cable broadcasting; in dial-access videotape distribution; and in television control rooms. In addition, KCC engages students in clerical and secretarial positions; in laboratory settings and hands-on technical courses; in direction instruction, as well as tutorial and peer counseling roles; and in instructional support capacities. While student help provides a viable alternative to the use of full-time professional staff in many academic situations, several problems exist. First, most student employment is financed by federal work study programs.  While costing the institution less, this arrangement does not guarantee the availability of the best qualified students. Second, an economic disincentive is built into the use of student help, often resulting in long-term budget cuts that cannot be easily restored. Third, student roles must often be absorbed by full-time staff in times of economic stress. A final problem is the expense involved in training and supervising students in short-term positions. Some of these problems can be alleviated by including funds for training in budgets, allocating monies to hire students who are ineligible for work study, and increasing the availability of training and information for student employees.

        "description":"While there is general support for international and intercultural education, a number of obstacles inhibit student participation in study abroad programs, especially those in Israel. These disincentives include the following: (1) U.S. colleges are reluctant to accept credits from institutions over which there is no American academic supervision; (2) students have limited access to information about study opportunities in Israel, and they are hesitant to engage in study without prior assurance that credits earned abroad will be accepted in the U.S.; (3) students perceive study abroad as disruptive of their academic progress and irrelevant to their career goals; and (4) it is increasingly difficult for students to finance a year of study in Israel. Rockland Community College's  (RCC's) Israel program was designed specifically to overcome these disincentives. Its model has two unique elements. First, students enroll in a U.S. institution, which issues credits and transcripts, actively recruits participants, provides financial assistance, and monitors academic standards. Second, through a process of academic brokering, the student is helped to find a university, college, or one of several other learning environments appropriate to his/her talents and interests. The success of the model is evidenced in the consistently high level of student enrollment in the program, the participation of students from over 30 colleges, and increased community consciousness of Israel and support of the program.

Next, a chronology is presented of developments in internationalizing the community college, and changes in college curricula in the areas of foreign language and international studies are reviewed. The following sections highlight faculty development efforts utilizing study abroad programs and international seminars; point  to the increased availability of student study abroad programs; and consider the growing number of foreign students and their impact on the community college. Then, the value of consortial arrangements and the sharing of experience with foreign colleagues through joint programs and seminars is discussed, and future prospects for internationalizing the community college are outlined.

Subsequent examination is directed toward strategies for expanding child care through employer involvement as well as toward obstacles to employer-supported care. The consequences of early childhood educators' reluctance to acknowledge that they serve parents' needs as well as children's are discussed, and erroneous assumptions and dangers of corporate child care consultants who focus exclusively  on on-site care centers are pointed out. Reasons are offered for anticipating continuing growth of employer-supported child care in the future and, in conclusion, the issue of the potentially negative consequences of employer involvement is addressed. Throughout the paper the thesis is advanced that, to solve problems of child care provision, the contributions of both early childhood educators and corporate managers must be fashioned by parent needs and preferences.

One hundred and sixty first through fourth grade children, equally distributed by grade and sex, were randomly selected from three midwestern schools. Pairs of same-sex children viewed a prosocial cartoon in one of five viewing conditions. In the four treatment conditions, the type of preplay varied by visual-nonvisual and concrete/inferential narration. The fifth condition was a control with no preplays. After each subject's visual attention to the television screen was scored, they were asked to order four picture sets taken from the television  program to assess temporal integration of the story. In addition, children were asked to answer 42 multiple-choice items intended to assess their recognition of inferential, central-concrete, and incidental content. As predicted, children attended longer to visual than nonvisual preplays. Boys and younger children were especially attentive to visual and concrete preplays, while girls and older children were more attentive to inferential preplays. Also, as predicted, children who saw visual preplays correctly sequenced more pictures than children who saw nonvisual preplays and they recognized more incidental content. (MP)",

        "description":"The potential of using the Apple II+ microcomputer with an ALF products music software system (nine voice) for computer-assisted instruction in composition was examined. Two boys, 8 and 10 years of age, served as subjects. Naturalistic observations were made as the children participated in a 10-session program that consisted of composition activities, such as adding harmony and writing rounds, and related activities, including listening tasks. Most of the composition activities, particularly the round or canon, were found to be useful vehicles for teaching both composition and other topics, such as music fundamentals. There were some differences in the nature of the subjects' compositions and in their approaches to the tasks. Although one subject preferred a traditional  orientation to the ALF program and the other had less conservative musical preferences, the program accommodated these individual differences. Moreover, the interest displayed by both subjects extended beyond the instructional sessions. Teacher characteristics, such as teaching skills and musical background, were found to be of critical importance for the success or failure of the microcomputer-based approach to music instruction. It was concluded that the ALF music system could be used to advantage on an individual basis in initiating interest in composition. Limitations of the program and the system are pointed out.

A brief summary of the CFRP evaluation design and preliminary findings presented in previous evaluation reports is given in chapter 1. Chapter 2 provides a description of the infant/toddler component of the 11 CFRP's in terms of center-based activities, frequency and level of participation, and approaches used in both parent education and infant/toddler sessions. Chapter 3 examines CFRP impact on the development of the infants and toddlers involved; differences in means between CFRP children and those in the control/comparison group on the Bayley  Scales of Infant Development (BSID) are reported in the attempt to identify major program impact. An executive summary of the study's findings is presented in chapter 4. Four appendices, accounting for approximately one half of the report, are also included: the first reviews issues related to the quality of the child assessment data reported, and the second discusses the rationale for the statistical tests chosen. A step-by-step description of the analysis of program impact reported in chapter 3 is presented in the third appendix, while the fourth describes analysis of the relationship between program participation and BSID scores.

The purpose of this component is to develop the most comprehensive picture possible of the operation of the 11 CFRP's located across the country, in order to provide a backdrop against which the provision and impact of CFRP services to individual families can be more clearly understood. Relying heavily on impressionistic reports arising out of interviews with program staff and observations during site visits to 6 of the 11 CFRP's, the report revolves around the following topics: the nature of the community and institutional contexts within which the programs operate; the way in which each program is organized; the  processes by which client families are recruited, assessed, enrolled, and terminated; opportunities for parent involvement in operations; the nature and extent of services received and referrals made; and the ongoing functioning of the other three major program components of CFRP evaluation (infant/toddler, Head Start, and preschool/school linkage).

The analyses described in this report are intended to provide answers to four major questions: (1) What is the nature of the CFRP and how do programs vary from site to site? (2) To what extent have the CFRP components (infant/toddler, Head Start, and preschool/school linkage) been implemented to date? (3) What is the process of individualizing services to meet family needs and developing action plans for services to be obtained through CFRP? and (4) Is there evidence that CFRP's have had an impact on families after 6 months of participation in comparison to a group of families not enrolled in CFRP? Following the first  chapter's introductory overview of the CFRP objectives and evaluation, chapter 2 addresses the first two questions, while chapter 3 offers comment on the remaining two questions. The fourth and concluding chapter provides a discussion of future study issues and preliminary plans for the CFRP evaluation's third phase. (MP)",

Chapter 2 provides information about CFRP as a family-oriented child development program, examining staff views about family development, goals CFRP's attempt to accomplish with families, and reasons programs are  successful with some families and not others. This chapter also describes the processes by which the needs of the individual family are assessed, family action is established, and family goals are ordered concluding with discussion of CFRP endeavors to deal with special problems and needs of various kinds of families. A descriptive profile of the three major components of CFRP (infant/toddler, Head Start, and preschool/school linkage) is presented in chapter 3, and anecdotal &quot;success stories&quot; concerning the impact CFRP has had on six families and their children are recorded in chapter 4.

Chapter 1 provides an overview of the CFRP evaluation design, including a description of research questions, study components, and data collection procedures. Also presented is a brief profile of the characteristics of families participating in the study and a discussion of sample attrition. Chapter 2 defines CFRP treatment and describes factors concerned with service delivery, including assessment of families' needs and strengths, individualization of program emphasis, referrals, and goals.  This chapter also examines the amount of contact families have had with the program and its various activities, reporting on ways in which families are benefited from their involvement. Chapter 3 assesses program impact by comparing CFRP families with a group of families not enrolled with regard to several outcome domains likely to be affected by program participation (use of community services and support, family circumstances, health, and parent/child interaction). Finally, chapter 4 summarizes evaluation results presented in chapters 2 and 3, discussing implications of these findings.

        "description":"Focusing on infants' physical attractiveness and behavior, this study explores reasons some infants receive greater amounts and different types of attention from adults than do others. Subjects were observed in 21 groups of three, consisting of one adult and two same-sex infants. Adult subjects were unmarried, childless undergraduate women interested in child care careers. Infant pairs brought to and left in a laboratory playroom were joined by an adult subject instructed to sit on the floor and play with the infants as she might if they were under her care. Recorded on videotape, the first 9 minutes of each play session were coded and analyzed for infant vocalization, infant activity, and adult touching and holding of the infants. Additionally, three assistants recorded the  looking and smiling behaviors of each subject. Adult subjects completed a questionnaire concerning their perceptions of each infant, mothers completed a demographic questionnaire, and infants were photographed. Photographs were rated by two groups of college students, one group selecting which of two infants was &quot;cuter,&quot; another rating each photograph separately on a nine-point scale of cuteness. In general, results indicate that infant behaviors (i.e., fussing, crying, smiling) are more salient than cuteness in eliciting adults' attention, although it is likely that adults' perceptions of cuteness influence their perceptions of behaviors.

The evaluation was undertaken to provide information on issues of feasibility, installation, and implementation of CAI. Project data were obtained from two sources: the first was a review and analysis of CAI literature, the second was a field administration of CAI lessons, followed by an evaluative questionnaire given to 29 workers from preselected child placement agencies in southwest and southcentral Michigan. The literature and field findings support the proposition that CAI is effective in teaching about licensing and regulation. Literature findings suggest that content allowing for narrow user discretion is more  applicable to CAI than is content allowing for broad user discretion. Over three-fourths of the sample said the CAI lessons increased their knowledge base in the area of licensing and that CAI is a workable and practical way to teach some aspects of licensing and certification. The remaining one-fourth of the sample said they were not sure about the effectiveness of CAI, but no one indicated negative feelings regarding its use. These positive findings resulted in a call for further research on and development of the CAI system to include more areas of licensing training. Related materials, including organizational charts of the Michigan Department of Social Services, forms of the questionnaires used, and data tables are appended. (MP)",

Twenty-two white, middle class mothers and fathers were videotaped interacting with their infants (11 male, 11 female) on 10 tasks. Trained observers coded the parents' interaction with their infants on the following variables: physical contact, social/verbal stimulation, object/material play, effectiveness, responsiveness, and teaching behavior. Results indicated that both mothers and fathers used more physical contact with their male infants and more object/material play with their female infants. While mothers exhibited more social/verbal behaviors with their infants than fathers did, fathers had more effect on female infants than on male infants.

        "description":"Results are reported from a 2-year study designed to explore how the nature of women's jobs, as viewed by women and their husbands, influences the system of nuclear family relationships and affects parents' involvement with their children's schools. The research has evolved into a comparative exploratory study of the responses of 30 families to wives' employment in jobs requiring no more than a high school education. All of the participating families, representing Anglo, Black, and Mexican-American ethnic groups, were generally at the same stage of family cycle. Specifically, wives' employment took place within two types of businesses: (1) a large telephone company where working women experienced little autonomy in organizing their work, close supervision and high pressure, and  almost no flexibility in taking short-term emergency leave to deal with family/children's needs; and (2) three large banks in which women experienced a greater range of autonomy, a much more relaxed relationship with their supervisors, and relatively flexible policies for short-term emergency leave. Evidence was presented which suggests a link between low autonomy/rigid short-term leave policies and the following effects: greater stress and strain on the system of relationships within the nuclear family, mothers' feelings of parental inadequacy, and lower levels of parent involvement in the schools. Interview schedules used for the first and second phases of the study, descriptions of work and family environment scales, tabular data, and other related materials are appended.  (MP)",

Several topics are discussed in the 15 brief chapters of the handbook. Chapters 1 through 3 focus on the formation of a mutual parenting network. Chapters 4 through 7 discuss the need for common guidelines among parents and suggest ways of making discipline in the home more businesslike, additionally offering 10 guidelines for establishing a set of family rules. Chapter 6 provides three home management worksheets related to topics presented in the previous chapter. Chapter 8 very briefly discusses special issues of dual-career or single-parent families. Chapters 9 through 10  focus on the definition and selection of consequences for children's responsible and irresponsible behavior; management worksheets related to these topics are offered. Ways parents can be do-it-yourself psychologists in their own homes are described in Chapter 11. Chapters 12 through 14 suggest a way to reduce disagreement about mutual expectations among family members, list four steps to good employee/management relationships, and touch on the importance of volunteer work and community service for young persons. A sequence of parent activities for implementing the ideas suggested is provided in the concluding chapter. Appended are proposed guidelines for parental decision making regarding communitywide conduct standards for youth. (RH)",

        "description":"The rural Northeast Alabama Consortium for Professional Development is composed of five local school systems and an institution of higher learning that have joined together to share resources and enhance educational opportunities for teachers and students. The Consortium was formed as a result of the impact of three major factors: the Alabama State Board of Education's resolutions requiring formal inservice programs forced local school districts to seek alternatives for providing quality staff development opportunities for teachers; factors related to geographic location and diverse needs forced some local school districts and institutions of higher learning to explore creative options for establishing good staff development programs at extended locations; and lack of funding for  the statewide inservice plan required local school districts to seek ways to fund the mandated staff development programs. In three years of operation, nearly 3,000 persons have attended inservice sessions offered through the Consortium. The document provides general information on the purpose of the Consortium, design of workshops and delivery of instruction, services provided, and financing the Consortium. In addition, the Consortium is viewed from the perspective of a local education agency (LEA), the College of Education, and the Division of Continuing Education. Seven attachments provide additional information and program forms. (BRR)",

        "description":"Self-esteem is cumulative and proactive. Events and people surrounding an individual have a direct relationship with the development of self-esteem. Factors influencing a child's self-esteem begin from the time the infant is in the mother's womb. A unique self-esteem develops for each child whether from a cohesive family, from a foundling home, or from a single parent. The migrant child's experiences parallel the same experiences of other children, but with the added dimension of cultural adjustment. Studies on self-esteem provide some implications for understanding and explaining the migrant child's needs. This paper formulates a theoretical framework for self-esteem and child development. The characteristics of the following levels of self-esteem are examined as are the  implications for the cultural adjustment of migrant children: high-high, low-low, high-low, low-high, low-medium, high-medium, medium-low, medium-medium, and medium-high. A grid is formulated which classifies the levels of self-esteem to levels of cultural adjustment. The need for experimentally controlled studies comparing the self-esteem of migrants and the process of cultural adjustment is cited. (Author/NQA)",

        "description":"The various art forms among Chicanos have served as basic forms of total expression for the people. Until recently the Chicano aesthetic has not received the attention or financial support needed to flourish beyond the survival level and become an institutionalized form. Philanthropic institutions have ignored and, in many cases, eliminated the expression of any value aesthetic not representing traditional and explored mainstream. A recent report to the National Endowment for the Arts shows the lack of support for Chicano art. Several myths have prevailed regarding the Chicano art form, i.e., it is confined to mere political expression, is regional and provincial, and is a fad of the sixties, and Chicanos only create for their own communities. These are poor excuses to limit the  resources. Because of the value of the expression of the Chicano aesthetic and its lack of support, the Chicano Humanities and Arts Council (CHAC) was created. CHAC, an organization of individual Chicano artists and Chicano organizations, has proposed to increase communication and understanding. Through the support of the nation's philanthropic institutions, the financial support necessary to do this work and provide Chicano artists with opportunities toward their enhanced individual achievements can be attained.

The treatment group then participated in a 6-week Hispanic Ethnic Dance Curriculum, which emphasized Hispanic dance and ethnology. Clinical observations were made of the students' in-class attitudes and cooperation, and their verbal statements and responses. During the same 6-week  period, the control group participated in a modern creative dance course. At the end of the 6 weeks, both groups were administered the same pre-tests. Analysis of variance via regression established the importance of the relationships between: profile and self-concept, profile and the cognitive measure, ethnic group and self-concept, and ethnic group and cognitive measure. Variables analyzed were profile, ethnic group membership, total self-concept score, and Folklorico Culture Quiz scores. Enhancement of the self-concept, positive observable behavior, and cognitive growth occurred in the treatment group at significant levels. (NQA)",

A simple questionnaire, administered by classroom teachers and filled out by all Year 9 and 10 students, yielded 1,018 usable questionnaires in the initial survey, and second questionnaires, sent to 430 actual school leavers, yielded 302 usable responses. Finally, interviews of those replying to the second questionnaire were selected via a random sample of unemployed and of females whose school potential appeared greater than their  employment status (n=37). Findings included: a strikingly low retention rate beyond Year 10 of the rural Tasmanian students when compared to urban students or rural students from other states; rural school leavers had a need to and a great desire to work; female leavers made up nearly two-thirds of the unemployed; and the &quot;disadvantaged&quot; rural (the Huon) did not present more problems than other areas.

Each state used its  own data to write an individual report and these formed the basis of the national analysis and comparisons.

Part I, &quot;Growth Impacts Assessment,&quot; provides an overview of rapid growth impacts, and introduces an impact assessment and management model. Part II, &quot;Community Growth Management,&quot; identifies several alternatives for coping with rapid growth, and examines processes and prospects for influencing growth management decisions. Part III, &quot;Coping with Rapid Community Growth,&quot; outlines several opportunities for citizens living in impacted communities to obtain more effective leverage in the public  decision-making process. The section also suggests an important role for public agency professionals and appointive officials in growth impacts assessment and in the analysis of growth management options. (AH)",

        "description":"Growth or development affects a rural community in three separate but interrelated areas: private, social, and public sectors. Private impacts are economic shocks to businesses and citizens of the community. Social impacts affect the community structure as well as individuals within the community, i.e., increased property tax costs may create hardships for young residents who wish to purchase housing, as well as for older residents on fixed incomes. Public sector is impacted by growth because elected officials are ultimately responsible for coping with changes in the community. Officials must deal with increased demands for public services and rising property tax rates, planning, and zoning decisions. Because of the importance of public sector decisions, it is essential that  officials carefully analyze the potential impacts of growth. This publication attempts to provide a simple framework that can be used by officials and citizens to assess the effect of a specific development on public sector costs and revenues over time. (AH)",

Four topics addressed by the participants were chosen because of their importance to the rural health systems of western communities and because coordination of efforts in these areas would be beneficial. Topics included: the role of the rural hospital; health personnel in rural areas; rural health education; and special impacts affecting care. Research or position papers were presented on each topic, followed by group discussion and descriptions of instances where health planners and rural development specialists have been working together. Participants then formulated recommendations which were  categorized according to policy development, coordination, and research activities. These proceedings present a brief summary of each of the four topic sessions and the recommendations developed at the conference. Appended is a list of conference participants. (AH)",

        "description":"The Hispanic folkloric tradition of Colorado and New Mexico had its beginning in the 1500's and 1600's when the area was colonized by the Spaniards. The &quot;manito&quot; (used by Hispanics in the Southwest to refer to descendants of the area's Spanish colonials) culture has maintained a strong sense of ethnic identity because of geographic isolation in rural and urban areas, close family ties, close relationship to the land, and definite patterns emphasizing culture and language maintenance. The &quot;Valse de los Panos&quot; (waltz of the scarves) is a unique example of how the Hispanic tradition still survives. This dance and music originated in the court dance of 16th century Spain. During that period, it was forbidden for physical contact to occur between a man and a woman. An acceptable way  to dance without touching was to have a material scarf bind the dancers together. The woman's scarf was symbolic of her honor, which has always been the highest of values for the Hispanic caballero. Therefore, the dance's historical and cultural value assumes a greater significance when the psychological and cultural values that have given rise to this kinesthetic statement are considered. The dance has traditionally been performed at the initiation of a ball. The paper describes the dance and music. (NQA)",

Highlights from the executive summary include: approximately one-third of the nation's elementary and secondary public school students attend schools in small towns and rural areas; two-thirds of the nation's school districts enroll fewer than 2,500 students; 17 states are predominantly rural; rural school districts average about 20% less spending per pupil than metropolitan districts and have fewer extended services, such as vocational education and preschool programs; and polls show that rural  people are generally pleased with their schools. The most important characteristic noted for rural schools, however, is their differences from each other. While there are many strengths stressed for rural education, priorities proposed for rural schools would include: adequately trained teachers and administrators; opportunities to develop rurally relevant curricula; assessment of instructional needs of rural students; long-range planning; sensitivity to the &quot;rural situation&quot; in financing and mandates by state and national officials; and careful examination of the impact of decreased federal funding in rural areas.

A section on evaluating and monitoring the program recognizes the difficulty of using standardized or norm referenced techniques to evaluate a Weekend Recreation Program, but notes that programs must be sure to meet guidelines of funding sources. Migrant and grower involvement in planning the program is stressed as is the need for staff orientation and communication. Job descriptions for all program positions are included.

        "description":"Development of geometric congruence and motion was studied through tasks that tapped transformational imagery, correspondence matching, measurement operations, and transformation combinations. Results showed even the youngest children studied could generate strategies for verifying congruence. The dominant strategy in younger children was edge matching. Findings are seen to support the view that young children are guided by rules that reflect knowledge of component parts of geometric figures. The dominant congruence-verifying strategy of 7- and 8-year-olds was superposition of one figure on another, indicating operation of a new rule set. Such results indicated development from knowledge of component parts to unified wholes and contradict theories which assume development of  mathematical knowledge proceeds from wholes to parts. Data are noted to show the ability of young children to generate highly inventive measurement strategies when offered the opportunity for conventional and non-conventional means of measurement. Further inconsistent performance is thought to reinforce evidence that young children use less efficient sets of strategies than older children. The study demonstrates that an adequate account of the development of mathematical cognition requires both functional and structural analysis of performance and interrelation between structural and procedural knowledge.

Serial FF.",
        "description":"The House Committee on Science and Technology, Subcommittee on Science, Research and Technology, sponsored an American Association for the Advancement of Science seminar (July 28, 1981) and 6 days of hearings (September 9-17, 1981) on &quot;The Human Factor in Innovation and Productivity.&quot; These hearings were designed to increase knowledge about the role of human factors in technological growth so that innovation and productivity in United States industries can be increased. Presented are findings and recommendations of the Subcommittee and an analysis of the hearings. Findings/recommendations focus on the importance of the human factor, labor-management cooperation, human factor and new technology, human resources for technology, Federal focus on productivity, and the need for  research. The analysis includes an overview (summarizing major views expressed by seminar and hearings participants) and more detailed discussions of these views. These discussions address issues related to: (1) the importance of the human factor; (2) the American work force (focusing on worker attitudes/values, participation in decision-making, and management/labor issues); (3) efforts to improve productivity (focusing on approaches, introduction of new technology, and need for more research); and (4) role of the Federal Government, indicating lack of a central focus within the Government for innovation and productivity issues.

        "description":"This volume was conceived as a review of basic research in science education and as a discussion of what the research findings mean for K-12 science teachers. The eight reports presented represent different dimensions of science education. Each provides a review of a given dimension and/or a goal of science teaching and suggests ways that current knowledge might affect practice. Reports focus on: (1) a review of some major studies in instruction, with suggestions for applications to science/mathematics curricula (J. Stallings); (2) information-processing psychology and a brief description of a science project using its methodology (J. Larkin); (3) role of instruction in the development of problem-solving skills in science (R. Ronning and D. McCurdy); (4) developing creativity as  a result of science instruction (J. Penick); (5) deriving classroom applications from Piaget's model of intellectual development (D. Phillips); (6) the development of an attentive public for science: implications for science teaching (A. Voelker); (7) factors affecting minority participation and success in science (J. Kahle); and (8) status of graduate science education: implications for science teachers (J. Gallagher and R. Yager). Brief summaries of each report and background information are provided in an introduction. A list of six actions by educators that would serve to implement the research findings and set new directions for science education is presented in an epilogue. (Author/JN)",

Its major purpose is the development of curriculum materials for grades kindergarten through 6. In the spring of 1980, a series of mathematics tests was administered to fifth-grade classes. Thirty-one CSMP groups and 25 non-CSMP classes were chosen. The main finding is that CSMP classes demonstrated clear superiority over non-CSMP classes in many mathematical thinking areas as assessed by specific tests. Particular examples included calculation in mental arithmetic and estimation, elucidation, and number relationships, as well as in fractions, decimals, and negative numbers. Gains are seen as  made without corresponding score decreases in more traditional instruction areas. Teachers' approval of CSMP and reasonably faithful implementation appeared to result in improvement in some areas, with a possible cost in computation that is often made up with teacher supplementation.

Among the results, it is noted that pupils in CSMP classes liked mathematics less, when compared with other subjects, than non-CSMP classes did, but saw mathematics as more open. Further, CSMP classes liked mathematics more when: 1) teachers gave a  higher overall evaluation to the curriculum; 2) supplementing occurred more often; 3) fewer tests were reported by students; and 4) fewer games were reported by students. The non-CSMP classes tended to like mathematics less under these conditions. (MP)",

Two schools began using CSMP in fall 1978, with the curriculum begun with all students through fourth grade, rather than the more common grade-by-grade approach that begins with only first-grade classes. A series of tests administered in 1978, 1979, and 1980 were designed to compare the performance of students before the introduction of CSMP, after one year's experience and after two years' experience. Results indicated: 1) On MANS tests, significant improvement was found from 1978 to 1980, which was  consistent with previous CSMP and non-CSMP comparisons made with the same tests; 2) The kinds of tests which the 1980 group did relatively better on were also ones on which CSMP superiority had been demonstrated in previous studies; and 3) On second-grade standardized tests, virtually no change at either school in mathematics scores related to reading scores. However, there was usually a small decrease in the first year of CSMP for third- and fourth-grade pupils, followed by a &quot;more-than-compensating&quot; gain the second year. (MP)",

        "description":"This study examined the school arithmetic development of three groups of students from an urban school district who differed in performance on precisely described number tasks on entry into first grade. The investigation followed pupils' arithmetic development to the completion of third grade, for those normally promoted each year. The two major questions examined were: (1) Are there quantitative and/or qualitative differences in the school arithmetic development of students with differing number abilities on entry to first grade as they proceed through the primary grades? and (2) Are there differences in the school arithmetic programs provided for students with differing number abilities on entry into first grade? Teachers' perceptions of pupil arithmetic, intellectual,  socio-emotional, and psycho-motor maturity were found to correspond closely with student number ability on entering first grade across the three years of investigation. Student performance on simple number tasks on first-grade entry appeared quite a valid predictor of pupil performance two and three years later. Arithmetic development appeared closely related to general psychological development. It is suggested that dramatic program adaptations should be considered for students who enter first grade with immature arithmetic development. (MP)",

The major problem is to decide what are some possible uses of a three-mile (1,250 acre) Marsh Beach which the city recently purchased. Members assume the roles of decision-makers in the simulated environment and compete for certain objectives according to specified procedures and rules. In parts one through five, small groups study background information, list suggested land uses, plan a strategy, prepare a 3-minute presentation, and present group reports. In the final part, learners determine if the game met three basic characteristics of simulation games: (1) clearly defined problem; (2) identifiable factors affecting decisions; and (3) identification of  individuals/groups with different interests who will be affected by the decisions. A separate &quot;Agent's Supplement&quot; is also included in which strategies (corresponding to the six parts in the member's guide) for conducting the simulation are outlined. (Author/JN)",

        "description":"Issues and factors related to the continuation of state energy education programs are discussed. The turmoil over energy's changing position among public priorities, limited federal and state budgets available for meeting energy education needs, substantive changes in both federally-sponsored and state-supported programs, and concomitant changes in personnel have affected virtually every state education agency and energy office. Because of the declining federal role in energy education matters, the disappearance of a national consensus that energy and energy education are among the highest public priorities, and interstate fiscal disparities, a great variation in energy education programs exists among and within states. However, four trends in state energy agencies and four  patterns in their handling of energy education have been identified. Although the reaction in some states has been to relinquish leadership in energy education, states maintaining their programs are faced with the challenge of doing as much as possible with fewer resources. The ECS Energy and Education Project is one resource available to assist state officials in fulfilling their energy and education responsibilities. The project collects, analyzes, and disseminates information about changed federal and state policies, programs, budgets and personnel, and provides referrals to other sources of expertise.

        "description":"One of the most striking developments in understanding science learning has been the discovery of the extent and persistence of the naive conceptions about the natural world students bring with them to the classroom. In physics and other sciences, students (even those who do well on textbook problems) often do not apply principles they have learned to predicting and describing actual physical events. Investigations have revealed that these students' failures were not due to an absence of theories, but to the persistence of naive theories brought with them to science classes, theories that stand in marked contrast to what they are expected to learn. Evidence is accumulating that these naive theories and the distortions they engender in students' comprehension of instruction are  among the principal causes of their failure to achieve understanding in science. Discussed in this paper are: (1) the characteristics of naive conceptions; (2) the influence of naive conceptions on students' interpretations of instructional events; and (3) the implications of this research for designed instruction to facilitate the reconciliation of naive conceptions with scientific theories.

        "description":"This paper provides a framework for analyzing teachers' content decisions and for determining the extent to which they are influenced by state/district policies. Examples of research based on this framework are presented in the area of elementary school mathematics. Content decisions are defined as decisions of how much time will be devoted to a subject, what topics will be taught, to whom they will be taught, and how well topics are to be learned. To understand more precisely the effect of external policies on teachers, a bottom-up approach is advocated. This approach starts with an analysis of what teachers do and treats external policies as but one of many factors influencing them. In one study, selected teachers from three districts were chosen for variation in centralization  of curriculum policy. Selected findings from this study are presented, including, for example, the response of teachers to a new district textbook, district testing programs, and a district management-by-objectives system. These case studies indicate that external policies, even when weak, do influence teachers' content decisions. In effect, the teachers studied acted as political brokers, arbitrating between their own priorities and the implied priorities of external policies. (Author/JN)",

Its major purpose is the development of curriculum materials for kindergarten through grade 6. This document describes non-test data collected from classes tested in spring 1982. Information regarding program implementation, teacher experiences and training, and teacher attitudes is presented. Questions on surveys were responded to and returned by 22 CSMP teachers and 26 non-CSMP teachers. It was found that both groups supplemented instruction, but with differences in what was supplemented. More CSMP instructors included basic operations or computation exercises, using whole numbers, fractions,  decimals, geometry, metrics, and percent. Non-CSMP teachers supplemented over a broader array of topics, including &quot;enrichment&quot; material. Analysis also indicated that CSMP teachers tended to follow lesson plans in great detail, view the lessons as challenging for most pupils, view mathematics class as having a more enjoyable atmosphere, view instruction as creative activity-oriented, and regard mathematics as one of the easier subjects to teach.

The Federal budget for 1982 was unusual in the extent to which it was subjected to change, reflecting the new administration's philosophy to reduce Federal spending. R&amp;D funding data reflect the first series of 1981 and 1982 program reductions made by the new administration. Further reductions were proposed later in the budget cycle; these changes are shown by agency and discussed in the text of the report. The analysis also provides data on R&amp;D program changes, 1981 to 1982, as indicated in the 1983 budget. The report is divided into four sections: (1) the 1982 budget; (2) Federal R&amp;D funding by budget function; (3) the Department of Defense (DOD) share in  Federal R&amp;D funding; and (4) geographic distribution of funds, 1980. A feature of this report (section 3) is a special analysis of R&amp;D funding trends for the DOD. The analysis extends back to the late fifties, but places particular emphasis on programs of the seventies and the strong defense buildup in the 1980-82 period. Impacts of the recent upsurge in defense R&amp;D support are discussed in broad terms. (Author/JN)",

In the tables, data for 1981 are considered to be accurate since they represent virtually completed transactions. Data for 1982 and 1983 are estimated since they do not represent final actions. The timing of the Federal Funds survey coincided with the third quarter FY 1982; therefore, the amounts reported for 1982 reflect congressional appropriation actions as of that period, as well as apportionment and reprogramming decisions as of that time. Data for 1982 represent administration budget proposals that had not been acted on. (Author/JN)",

The third describes the shortage of engineering and computer science faculty nationally and in California, with particular emphasis on the California State  University and the University of California. The fourth identifies pressing problems of equipment and facilities, including not merely deferred maintenance and replacements but also the lack of technologically-advanced equipment already used in industry. The fifth points to sources of inadequate preparation of students, both nationally and in California. The sixth notes incentives that industry are providing universities and that states are providing to their public universities to develop technological expertise.

Achievement and attitudes of over 80,000 students were assessed at grades 4, 8, and 12, and included a sample of approximately 2,000 grade 10 students. In general, attitudes of students toward various aspects of science were quite positive. However, achievement, as judged by informed members of various panels,  was rated low. Achievement measured including science processes, knowledge (recall and understanding), and higher level thinking. Sex-related and language background differences are also considered. Approximately 2,000 elementary and secondary science teachers responded to questionnaires (modified by a 1978 survey). Findings summarized focus on teacher characteristics, science background, science curriculum/programs, pre-/in-service teacher education, classroom activities, and impact of the 1978 survey on science education. Eleven major recommendations are provided in the final section, with pre-/in-service teacher education singled out for special consideration and priority recommendations. (Author/JN)",

The assessment was the second in science, the first occurring in 1978. This general report is divided into eight sections. Following an introduction (chapter 1), the development, piloting, and selection of items for the final achievement and attitude/opinion measures used in the assessment are discussed in chapter 2. Chapters 3-5 contain interpretations of the grade 4, grade 8, and grade 10-12 results, focusing on: (1) student characteristics; (2) achievement in science processes, knowledge (recall and  understanding), and higher level thinking; (3) overall achievement results; (4) comparisons with other grade levels and 1978 survey; (5) achievement of specific sub-groups (including sex and language background); and (6) science interests/attitudes. Chapters 6 and 7 discuss development of elementary/secondary science teacher questionnaires, results, interpretations, and comparisons. Areas addressed include teacher characteristics, training, instruction, materials/equipment, and science programs. The final chapter presents recommendations and conclusions based on total assessment results. Appendices include copies of survey instruments and the provincial results of all questions.

        "description":"The Moral Majority has been more successful in mobilizing conservative Christians than three other evangelical groups--Third Century Publishers, Christian Voice, and the Religious Roundtable. According to the literature on social movements, four possible explanations for the success of such groups are that they have access to financial resources, can maintain an extensive network of communications between organizers and constituents, can draw upon the expertise and skills of social movement entrepreneurs, and can mobilize during a period in time in which there is a favorable conjunction of issues. None of these factors proves wholly satisfactory in accounting for differences among the four organizations in their mobilization of supporters. The Moral Majority was more successful  because its leadership provided it with access to pre-existing networks which were unavailable to other Christian groups. For example, Jerry Falwell's &quot;Old Time Gospel Hour&quot; provided a communications link via television to a large national audience. The Moral Majority's genius lay in linking with a national network of conservative clergymen and in championing issues of major concern to this group. While taking advantage of these pre-existing associations, the Moral Majority did have to accommodate their previously organized constituencies. (RM)",

Data were obtained from research literature searches and from over 600 questionnaire responses from museums, performing arts institutions, arts councils, and other organizations; directors of 86 recent audience studies; and interviews with directors and users of 25 audience studies. Findings concerning the nature of the arts public were that median educational attainment of arts audiences was very high. Also, professionals constituted 56 percent of employed persons in the average audience, median incomes were $19,000, and minorities were underrepresented. In regard to determinants of the quality of research methodology and its utility to  managers, both level of funding and profession of investigator were related to high quality research. Experienced in-house researchers produced more useful research than outsiders or inexperienced in-house investigators. Pertaining to the impact of organizational factors on research usefulness, audience studies had powerful effects when their findings confirmed the theories of arts managers, when an influential person within the institution actively sought implementation, and when researchers were involved in staff deliberations.

Major recipients of project expenditures were performing arts organizations. As of the end of fiscal year 1974, 42 state arts agencies were  autonomous. All agencies had a governing council or commission headed by a chairperson. The structure closely resembled that of a private nonprofit corporation. Councils and commissions were composed largely of persons from fields other than the arts; most members were men and a large majority were white. Three out of every five staff members were women. Finally, most agencies anticipated increases in funding over the next 3 to 5 years. (KC)",

Data were collected from interviews with agency directors and agency reports as of fiscal year 1974. The report is organized into eight chapters. Chapter 1 examines budget and finances at state and federal levels, private funds, expenditures, and types and methods of budget presentations. Chapter 2 describes mandated purposes, functions, practices, and trends of the agencies. Chapter 3 focuses on program emphases, restrictions, mandates, criteria of funding decisions, matching funds, and associated foundations. Chapter 4 details the distribution of project funds in terms of primary and secondary recipients,  distribution by art form in each state, types of activity assisted, initiation and location of projects, audiences, and matching funds. Chapter 5 discusses arts agencies' relationships with departments of education, other state agencies, and local government. Chapter 6 outlines management practices and organizational structure. Chapter 7 describes characteristics, number, salaries, organization, and adequacy of state paid staff. The final chapter analyzes past developments and the future financial outlook. (KC)",

        "description":"An individual's socialization to occupational roles is reviewed in terms of the concepts and of the link between childhood socialization, social class, and occupation. The educational system and peer group influences are briefly reviewed. Occupational socialization is a general progression in which specific job training occurs only near the end of the process. Although several studies suggest the importance of seemingly indirect influences of cultural values, economic values, and the economic system, the relative neglect of occupational socialization in research suggests that it is considered in narrow terms. However, researchers have found numerous links between socialization practices and social class and between social class and occupation. Parental values that are passed on  to children are the values that parents need to function in the workplace. Kohn (1969) suggested that occupation reflects all three of the major dimensions of stratification: economic (privilege); honorific (status); and political (power). Other research indicates that occupational socialization occurs as a result of the emphasis on discipline, subordinancy, external reward systems, and a bureaucratic rationale in the educational system. Further research should focus on historical experiences and links between socialization practices and models of social change. (KC)",

Eight chapters examine dominant views of education and work, the consequences of overeducation in society, the movement toward workplace democracy, specific reforms, educational reforms, and consequences for educational planning. The focus is on the divergence between the dynamics of the workplace and that of the schools which will create a disintegration of the old relationships and a new synthesis between the two institutions. The workplace change toward group and individual decision making, minimal competencies for all, collegial training, and cooperative skills will thus lead to greater democracy in  school organization; emphasis on group projects; greater integration by race, ability, and social class; team teaching; greater emphasis on problem solving; mastery learning; criterion-based tests; peer teaching; and cooperative problem solving. The educational planner will be a technician assisting the process and will attend to the details of implementation. (KC)",

The role that government plays in the inflation problem is the focus of the third chapter, which discusses how elected officials often promise more than the electorate is willing to pay for. Chapter four examines the trade-off between inflation and recession. Discussed in chapter five are ways to stop the wage-price spiral which occurs with every price increase, when millions of people scramble to raise their incomes to protect  themselves. Chapter six deals with growth, suggesting that if we could return to the days of sustained growth, it would be easier to achieve stable prices. Four options for dealing with inflation are provided in the concluding chapter. Further reading materials are also listed. (RM)",

Introducing the unit are a knowledge quiz, which helps students analyze their attitudes about work, family, and sex stereotyping, and a work force quiz, which helps them increase their awareness of the importance of women in the work force. In another activity, in which female students respond to a \"Cinderella\" story and male students to a \"Prince Charming\" story, their awareness of stereotyped role expectations is enhanced. In determining household responsibilities in the fourth activity, students assign bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, and living room chores to either one or both sexes. An \"I Can Do Anything\" worksheet lists occupations for  students to label as appropriate for either male or female. Students also analyze a typical lifetime in terms of time devoted to education and work. An analysis of alternative lifestyles features scenarios in which divorced working parents contemplate joint custody, a long-married couple considers having children, and a spouse's elderly mother can no longer care for herself. The final activity is a teacher checklist to determine the extent of sex equity in the classroom and in textbooks. (KC)",

        "description":"A discrepancy exists between what public school personnel and student teachers perceive as ideal academic freedom and their perceptions of the reality of school life. Interview responses from faculty and administration of a school district and from student teachers reveal that both groups practice the social control mechanism of political restraint and self-censorship within the school environment. School district personnel perceived that they had considerable academic freedom and that political restraint and censorship does not exist. They noted, however, that they would not use their freedom because to do so would be inappropriate and unprofessional since both sides of an issue should be presented. In contrast, student teachers reported substantial restraint or censorship  during their experience in the schools, particularly in the areas of sex, religion, race, drugs, and politics. Although these data suggest that student teachers and practicing school personnel perceive school climates differently, student teachers also recognize the legitimacy of imposing these restraints. Therefore, both groups operate within an ideology of restraint in school affairs which is the complex product of school purposes, traditions, personnel, and cultural hegemony. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"Noting a current trend to remove social studies education from the first through third grades, the author's review of literature reveals that early learning lays the foundation for political socialization. Weissburg (1974) suggests that three models account for different types of socialization at different stages of life. Early political learning (primacy) establishes an individual's broad but basic political identity, loyalties, and ideologies. Later learning in the intermediate (later childhood and adolescence) and recency (experiences close in time to adulthood) stages consist of specific learnings of political information and attitudes, partisan preferences, and political participation. Learning during the latter stages tends to fit into the relatively stable core established  during primacy. In the social studies curriculum, young children receive systematic &quot;unhidden&quot; political socialization; it is the part of the curriculum where the basics of political identity are shaped directly and overtly in the direction of democratic citizenship. Thus, the removal of social studies from the early grades would have an effect on how children are inducted into the political culture of this nation. (Author/KC)",

Data were obtained from U.S. Bureau of Census reports and from relevant government agencies. The report focuses on trends in federal expenditures for youth, public expenditures for youth in Houston and New York City, equity in the distribution of federal funds for youth, and efficiency of delivery systems. Since the mid-1960's, the share of federal spending on youth has risen while their share of the population has fallen. Funding for income, education, nutrition, health, housing, child care, employment, recreation, and justice reaches youth through direct services, services to families, and services to the larger population. An examination of ESEA-Title I, medicaid, Aid to  Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, Headstart, vocational education, school lunch, and social security programs reveals inequities in services to poor children, however. Further, findings from an analysis of all public expenditures for youth in Houston and New York City indicate that the role of each level of government and the level of expenditures for youth services vary dramatically between cities, New York spending two times more per youth than Houston. Reasons for the wide variation center on lower expenditures per recipient and lower rates of participation. (KC)",

The factors were evenly divided between non-teacher-controlled and teacher-controlled. Teachers of both sexes agreed that skill in human relations was the most important factor affecting teaching success. An analysis of responses to non-teacher-controlled factors indicated that male teachers perceived the socioeconomic level of the students' families to be more important than did female teachers. Male teachers appeared to perceive success as resulting more from student performance, while female teachers perceived success as resulting more from teacher activity. Males also put a higher priority on being  assigned more academically talented students. An examination of teacher-controlled factors indicated that female teachers put high emphasis upon possessing substantial knowledge of subjects taught, while males considered this moderately important. Female teachers also rated possessing an understanding of self and personal motives extremely high, while males rated the factor only moderately high. Findings revealed that females teachers place a high degree of importance on teacher-controlled factors in teaching success and have confidence in their ability to control their professional destiny.

Seventh and eighth grade students with average abilities but with failing marks in mathematics, social studies and science, and reading were participants. These students were not receiving special assistance through other remedial programs. Teacher Corps interns worked under the guidance of supervisory team leaders, and were responsible for creating an attractive learning environment, acting as liaison between the lab and the students' teachers, and writing individual objectives for students. Students were assigned to a 4-hour block in the laboratory, which was headed by a school faculty member,  and time was provided for teachers to meet with students to reinforce personal relationships and review student progress. Descriptions are given of specific responsibilities of the interns and supervisors and of special events carried out in the lab. Tables present data on: (1) student schedules; (2) student absences by grading period; (3) student assignments; (4) pre- and post-test grade level scores on reading, spelling, and mathematics; (5) final grades by subject; (6) intern supervisory feedback; (7) general staff feedback; and (8) students' academic and attitudinal changes perceived by teachers.

        "description":"In fall 1981, three Teacher Corps interns worked with high school students to improve their abilities in content area reading. The interns worked directly with content area teachers and their students on a tutorial basis, each intern assuming responsibility for an identified content area--social studies, mathematics, and English. The interns made bulletin boards, participated in meetings with school staff, prepared news releases, made a presentation to the School Board, and conducted research. They also constructed instructional materials (learning center and skill development guides), participated in district and county school inservice programs, and worked with parents/citizen volunteer groups. They participated in school activities, acted as resource guests in some classrooms,  and conducted some classes on their own. Interns submitted brief essays identifying their principal contributions to the high school, the most important &quot;lesson&quot; learned from the intervention experience, and some modifications which might be made if the intervention were repeated. Review of the intervention and assessment findings indicate that the high school reading teacher might work directly with content area teachers to model teaching behaviors, provide consultant assistance, and develop and disseminate instructional materials. It was also indicated that establishing a system of peer tutoring could be valuable. Attachments present information on a summary of student and teacher feedback, and comments from the interns.

        "description":"Three case studies were made of collaborative networks involving one university and surrounding school districts. One involved a well established network developed by a private university, while two others were associated with state universities. Of these two, one involved bilateral relations between the college of education and each of five counties to establish a teacher center for which there would be shared governance and financial support; the other involved the creation of a federation of teacher centers, many associated with small state colleges, and loosely coordinated by an office at the state university. This report presents a comparison and synthesis of these three cases. Part one describes the design and functions of school-university collaboratives. The background  and scope of the present study are described in part two, and the methodology of the study is explained in part three. In part four, a history of the development of the collaboratives is traced. Part five describes the initial operations of the collaboratives and notes their present configurations. Organizational relationships are presented in the sixth part. An analysis and summary of their outcomes is offered in part seven. A causal analysis of the work of the collaboratives is presented in part eight. The ninth part examines the conclusions reached in the study on the nature of interorganizational arrangements, and the tenth part lists implications from the study. It is concluded that productive school-university collaboratives can be established economically, yielding substantial  benefits to both participants. (JD)",

These relationships were determined by using muliple regression, contingency table analysis, and cluster analysis methods with data from the 1979-80 Sample Survey of Teacher Demand and Shortages, the 1970 Census School District Fifth Count File, and other instruments. Findings revealed that teachers of cultural subjects and of gifted pupils were in greatest demand in affluent, highly educated communities composed of professional people with small families. These communities also demanded more science and mathematics teachers. Vocational education teachers were in demand in communities where poverty was  relatively great, the district small and rural, education low, and government funding high. Tables present information on teacher demand based on teaching specialities variables: (1) culture and enrichment; (2) home economics, industrial arts, and business; (3) mathematics and science; (4) English language arts and social studies; (5) special education for handicapped; (6) health and physical education; (7) the nonspecial education problem learner; and (8) vocational education.

        "author":["Cadwallader, Lynn J."],
        "description":"This biography of an influential nineteenth century New England educator, Nathaniel T. Allen (1823-1903), provides a profile of teaching and teacher education at a time when non-clerics emerged as teachers and educational leaders, and is based on a vast new collection of primary source materials in educational history. Allen's career, as it paralleled and manifested the early professionalization of teaching in this country, is studied in four major phases: (1) 1823-1844, covering family background and economic factors that led to his career choice; (2) 1845-1847, describing early training at the Bridgewater Normal School and the subsequent teaching experiences of Bridgewater students; (3) 1848-1853, highlighting Allen's work at the Model School of the West Newton Normal School  and his political development; and (4) 1854-1872, following Allen's further professional development in the West Newton English and Classical School. Throughout the biography, Allen's educational theories, philosophies, and practices are described. Materials available in the Allen manuscript collection reveal how one group of teachers, like Allen, from Massachusetts, viewed their work as they moved from unpredictable positions in district schools through normal school training to an increased professional commitment to education. Also noted is the fact that, during the mid-19th century, the occupation of teaching gradually shows growth toward becoming a profession; society's belief develops, too, in the importance of schooling.

In this model, classroom observations and specific recommendations for teaching behaviors are made for each teacher, and a series of teacher training sessions helps them to change their behaviors. Classroom observation data are collected at the conclusion of the training sessions, and teachers receive profiles showing results of their efforts at changing. This model uses the Secondary Observation Instrument (SOI), which collects information on the teacher and other classroom data, records information about the classroom environment and participants as in a photo &quot;snapshot,&quot; and records the interactions and  activities taking place each 5 minutes. In this report, an in-depth overview of the implementation of this model is presented. Included is information on: (1) the data collection process; (2) data analysis and interpretation; (3) teacher training processes; (4) project objectives, rationale, and history; (5) characteristics of the schools involved in the project; (6) demonstration project methods and procedures; and (7) project evaluation.

One objective of the evaluation was to utilize techniques and to administer a set of instruments to assess their utility for future evaluations. Process evaluation methods focused on teachers' feelings about the demonstration project, their concerns about the innovations, and evaluative comments made by involved teachers at the project's conclusion. Product evaluation focused on the pre-/post-test changes in teachers' perceived responsibility for student achievement, ratings on the teachers' levels of  use of the innovation, and the teachers' pre-/post-test intervention changes in &quot;correct implementation&quot; of specific classroom teaching behaviors. Following an executive summary of the project, chapter 2 of this report outlines the purpose and objectives of the staff development program. Chapter 3 describes the evaluation design, the data collection instruments, and the data collection and analysis procedures of the evaluation. Process and product evaluation results are presented in the fourth and fifth chapters. Data displays and narrative copy are used to clarify evaluation results. The sixth chapter presents conclusions and recommendations based on the evaluation study. (JD)",

It is pointed out that Americans value equality, practicality, and utility and that they are both individualistic and suspicious of government authority. Contrasts between these values and those implicit in the societies in Western Europe, Russia, and Japan are explored. The structure and organization of educational systems is also discussed. Judgments are offered concerning the effective locus of power in such matters as school organization, curriculum, and personnel policies. The Soviet Union, France, and Japan are identified as highly centralized systems and comparison is made between the structure of these sytems and  those of Western Europe (mixed local, regional, and central control), and America and Canada, where local control is usually decisive. The selectivity of these systems is discussed as they reflect cultural attitudes toward the upward mobility of citizens. Differences and similarities in educational outcomes and policy implications between the systems are are also pointed out, and special consideration is given to changes in attitudes toward schooling over the past few decades. Appendix I contains an analysis of science and mathematics education in the Soviet Union and Japan. Appendix II discusses equivalencies in secondary schooling in the United States, Canada, Japan, the Soviet Union, Japan, and West Germany.

The American system is viewed as a vehicle for upward social mobility and as a means of solving or ameliorating social problems. In the second section, the theoretical framework and research strategy of the IEA are described, as well as the difficulties encountered in comparing systems of education that are widely different in function and philosophy. The way individual differences are perceived and taken into account  in organizing formal education in various national systems is considered in the third section. Comparisons are made of the American model of comprehensive education for all students, the Western European model, with early transfer of selected elite students to academic secondary schools, and the Soviet unitary school that integrates all types of schools. The fourth section elaborates on comparisons between comprehensive and selective systems of education. An analysis is made of performance differences in mathematics and science students in divergent systems. An overall conclusion is reached that the American comprehensive system more effectively serves all of the talent of a nation. (JD)",

        "description":"For the first 200 years of American higher education, the baccalaureate program was shaped by the authority of tradition, seldom challenged, and easily accommodating new learning and changing social conditions. After the Civil War, the authority of tradition was undermined by emerging professional academicians, trained in particular bodies of knowledge, and dedicated to a style of &quot;scientific&quot; learning. By World War II, tradition, professional academicians, and society shared authority over what went on in higher education. Since World War II, the accelerating democratization of higher education has created in students a new authority over their course of study. The evolution of the American college through these phases is traced in this paper. An analysis is presented of periods  of American education, such as the beginnings of small provincial colleges in the eastern United States in the early 1800s, the growth of private and public universities in the late nineteenth century, and the development toward providing mass education immediately after World War II. Complex social changes that transformed secondary schools, colleges, and universities from their inception to the present are discussed in light of their influence on the thinking, attitudes, and aspirations of communities, students, teachers, and the government.

Hersh examines the social organization of the school and the school's instruction and curriculum in \"What Makes Some Schools and Teachers More Effective.\" In \"Teacher Education: Needed Research and Practice for the Preparation of Teaching Professionals,\" Judith E. Lanier outlines paradigms for effective teachers. Two critical issues are discussed by Dean C. Corrigan in \"Curriculum Issues in the Preparation of Teachers\": (1) identifying, accepting, and teaching a common body of knowledge, skills, and professional values; and (2) establishing and enforcing quality controls. In \"The Content in Teacher Education Programs,\" David C. Smith describes two PROTEACH conferences which  reconceptualized content and components of an effective teacher education program. An overview is presented by Richard Wisniewski of Oklahoma legislation to improve the quality of teacher education in \"The Law: A Step Forward in Oklahoma.\" Martin Haberman traces the history of student teaching and cites the need for further research in \"Research Needed on Direct Experience.\" George Denemark presents \"Closing Remarks: An Attempt at Synthesis.\" (JD)",

The information received indicated that certification fees are common and are rising. Most of the states offering certificates at no cost are in the eastern half of the nation, and are rather evenly divided between the northeastern quadrant and the southeastern quadrant. The three states that have begun charging fees in the last four or five years are located in the northeast. Fees  range from 1 to 50 dollars. From the 39 states that provided information about the size of their fees, the median fee was in the neighborhood of 15 dollars, which is lower than fees generally charged for other state licensing services. The response of each state to the questionnaire is listed and the questionnaire is appended. (JD)",

        "description":"An analysis of issues concerning the certification of teachers and the accreditation and approval of teacher education institutions is presented. In the first part, generally accepted definitions of certification, licensure, program review, and accreditation are clarified. A brief historical overview is presented of the state's role in controlling licensure, and the growth of the National Education Association (NEA) and the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) is described. Key issues regarding certification and accreditation guide the discussion of major strategies for improvement in the second part: (1) certification based on approved programs or qualifying examinations; (2) specific rules governing college programs and general certification; (3)  renewal of teaching licenses; (4) incompetent teachers or low-quality programs; (5) rule-making process; (6) attraction of more academically able students; (7) social needs to recruit people from protected groups; (8) five year or longer teacher education programs; (9) teacher supply and demand; and (10) duplicate and redundant program review standards or procedures. The paper's third part offers recommendations and conclusions concerning general teacher education standards, identification of teacher competence, examination of entry-level teachers, teacher internships, certificate renewal, redundancy of NCATE and state agency program-approval, restructuring of NCATE process, and elimination of substandard teacher education programs.

        "author":["Howey, Kenneth R."],
        "description":"This paper on the future of preservice teacher education examines the question of whether a crisis exists today in schools and in teacher education. It is noted that judgments vary, given different perspectives and vantage points for observation, and that a reliable assessment of the current health of schooling and teacher education is difficult. Possible future directions for teacher education are suggested, and discernable conditions and events on the horizon are examined. A major conclusion is that the only way heightened or extended expectations can reasonably be accommodated are through more formalized and shared responsibilities by schools with other socially responsible parties. No major reform is envisioned in initial teacher education. Emphasis in this paper is placed on  a multi-faceted approach to incremental improvements in the quality of teachers and teaching. Strategies for improving the quality of teaching are identified: (1) improve methods and procedures for recruiting and selecting teachers; (2) upgrade the quality of and/or extend, programs for preparing teachers; (3) improve evaluation of teachers and teacher education programs; and (4) critically reexamine teachers' role expectations and school conditions.

The five major recommendations arrived at appear, respectively, under the headings: content, standards and expectations, time, teaching, leadership and fiscal support. Recommendations pertaining to content include the strengthening of high school graduation requirements by establishing minimum requirements for each student of: (a) 4 years of English; (b) 3 years of mathematics; (c) 3 years of science; (d) 3 years of social studies; and (e) one-half year of computer science. With regard to standards and  expectations, schools, colleges, and universities are encouraged to adopt more rigorous and measurable standards and higher expectations for academic performance and student conduct. Four-year colleges and universities, in particular, are advised to raise their admission requirements. In order to improve time usage, the report advises that more time should be devoted to students learning the &quot;New Basics,&quot; which may, in turn, require a longer school day, or a lengthened school year. Seven ways to improve teacher preparation and to make teaching a more rewarding and respected profession are listed. Six implementation guidelines are suggested for improving educational leadership and fiscal support. Appendices contain: (a) charter of the National Commission on Excellence in Education; (b)  schedule of the Commission's public events; (c) list of commissioned papers; (d) list of individuals who testified at Commission hearings; (e) list of other presentations to the Commission; and (f) notable programs.

Estimated true formula score equating was used. Only the mathematical sections of the PSAT/NMSQT and SAT were used because the discrepancy in level of difficulty is greater than in the verbal sections and is most representative of a vertical equating situation. The equating used an internal anchor test design. The results of the IRT equating method were compared to those obtained from the conventional linear and curvilinear equating methods. The use of a goodness of fit statistic leading to a chi-square-like test in conjunction with item ability regression plots is  examined. The lack of a criterion for judging the equatings and the subjective nature of the goodness of fit assessment are discussed. (CM)",

The method provides a system by which the NBME examinations can be used each year to compare the content of an external licensing test with the content of the curriculum at the Wright State University School of Medicine (WSUSOM). The NBME test items were classified by faculty content experts on four dimensions: school-wide topics, discipline topics, cognitive levels, and item types. Then, the percent of WSUSOM students and percent of national sample answering the item correctly were recorded. The analysis allows comparison of the performance of WSUSOM student and the national sample on each school-wide or discipline topic. The Faculty Curriculum  Committee is the most interested user of data related to school-wide topics, while the individual department is the most appropriate audience for the discipline topic information. Curriculum decision-makers should take special caution in examining the results for a single year's administration, since test content varies from year to year. (Author/BW)",

A combination of strategies from the evaluation specialist and public relations specialists first requires an analysis of the perceptions of people with whom the evaluators wish to communicate. This analysis must determine what the public already knows, their misconceptions, their information sources, and which groups should receive the highest priority. Strategies for communication are determined in the planning phase, which considers the various publics concerned, the message, the presentation source, the information channel, reaction monitoring, and feedback used in the next cycle of planning. The actual communication of information should be very  broad at the onset with progressively greater specificity to provide basic information, persuade or clarify. The final task is to evaluate the effectiveness of the communication, including listening to criticisms and being ready to make indicated changes. (CM)",

The sample involved 407 University of Kansas education and computer science students. Information on GRE verbal (GRE-V), GRE quantitative (GRE-Q), GRE verbal and quantitative, undergraduate grade point average (UGPA), graduate grade point average (GGPA), major field of study, sex, and year of enrollment were recorded. GGPA was selected as a criterion variable. The remaining variables were treated as predictors. Stepwise multiple regression was applied as a statistical tool to analyze the data. Data analysis revealed that the verbal  score on GRE was the best single predictor of GGPA for education students. Based on zero-order correlations, computer science students' UGPA was a better predictor than GRE scores. The findings agree with previous studies that the GRE-V is the best single predictor of GGPA for majors that are descriptive in nature and GRE-Q is the best predictor for symbol-oriented disciplines. Tests for the equality of regression equations developed for the two student groups found significant differences, suggesting separate selection procedures in the two departments. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"The California Assessment Program (CAP) is meant to be an efficient testing program limited to furnishing program-diagnostic information to state-level policymakers. During 1981-82 all 3rd-, 6th-, and 12th-grade students in the state's public schools were tested in reading, written language, and mathematics basic skills. Summary findings were that grades 3 and 6 test scores improved. Grade 12 scores improved in written language and spelling and decreased slightly in reading and mathematics. Elementary grade scores are reported in scaled units from 100 to 400, with a statewide average of 250 in base-year 1980. Grade 12 scores continue to represent the percentage of test questions answered correctly. Test results are comparable on a common scale to those of previous years; they  show how the performance of California students compares with national scores. Scholastic Aptitude Test scores for college-bound seniors; third grade students' attitudes toward the basic skills; the issue of time for learning in different learning areas in elementary and secondary schools; and the availability and use of computers in state elementary schools are examined. An appendix lists the assessment advisory committees. (CM)",

To demonstrate substantive and procedural compliance with this law, measurement and evaluation procedures must be incorporated into the instructional program. This monograph presents a decision matrix that provides a model for developing an adequate and useful measurement and evaluation system. Available empirical work supporting the use of specific procedures for curriculum-based evaluation of student performance in reading, spelling, and written expression is discussed within the decision matrix framework. Technical, effectiveness, and logistical  considerations are discussed, and data related to &quot;what to measure&quot; and &quot;how to measure&quot; decisions are provided. Alternate procedures are described for data summarization and interpretation. Technical, instructional, and logistical advantages and disadvantages of data utilization procedures are reviewed. A case study demonstrates the implementation of the recommended procedures. In this study, a teacher measured and evaluated the reading progress of a mildly-handicapped fourth grader who was reading at a second grade level. Tables and figures are appended. (Author/PN)",

Eighteen experimental group teachers employed specific continuous evaluation procedures while 21 contrast group teachers employed conventional special education measurement and evaluation procedures. During the 18-week treatment, the teachers' structure of instruction was measured three times, and the teachers' educational decisions and their assessment procedures were surveyed at the middle and end of the treatment. Additionally, at the termination of the study, teachers' descriptions and ratings of the experimental procedures were assessed. Analyses revealed that using  systematic, ongoing measurement and evaluation procedures increased the degree of structure in the instruction teachers provide, and resulted in more specific and realistic judgments about student programs and progress and more responsive pedagogical decisions. Experimental teachers also reported that, although time-consuming, their procedures were feasible and useful.

Thirty third- and fourth-grade students were observed over two entire school days to examine the educational environment and students' responding times as a function of whether the students had been ranked by their teachers as high, middle, or low in academic competence. Only one statistically significant difference was found among groups: high academic group students engaged in academic talk for a greater amount of time than did  low academic group students. In contrast to previous studies, no differences were found in the amounts of teacher praise and criticism or in student time engaged in academic versus inappropriate behaviors.

The test modifications included alterations in line length, groupings of items, answer formats, administration procedures, as well as changes in graphic representations within the test, and the test's general physical layout. Test content (i.e., state standards assessed) was not altered. No differences were indicated in scores obtained on the large-print versions of a physically modified test when compared to performance on a regular-print version of the same test. Learning disabled students did perform better on the modified tests compared to the unmodified tests. Test  modifications that facilitate performance of LD students are: (1) completion of subsections of the test that include 30-40 items at a time; (2) adding at least one example for each different set of items within any section of the test; (3) grouping items that measure similar skills together in progressive order of difficulty from easiest to most difficult; and, (4) placing answer options in a vertical format with flattened, horizontal elliptical ovals for answer bubbles placed on the right; (5) using unjustified formats for reading comprehension passages and placing them in separate boxes set off from the sentendes testing comprehension; and (6) using continuation arrows and stop signs to organize the flow of items within the tests.

Stimulus materials were presented in the following order for each student: (1) three isolated word lists, (2) three oral passages, (3) two dictated spelling lists, and (4) two story starters.

The monitoring system employed was initially designed to evaluate students receiving special services and their progress toward individual education plan reading goals. The model emphasized direct assessment in the students' grade level basal reader (Ginn Reading Series) and repeated measurement of the number of words read correctly in students' 1-minute readings for 16 weeks. The number of words read correctly by the student was tabulated and the information entered into a microcomputer program. A computer printout displayed a graph of each student's performance and a summary of descriptive statistics (baseline level, current level,  average weekly gain or loss, and amount of variability in reading scores). Actual time for administration and scoring was approximately 3 minutes per student. Teachers generally felt that the information collected was instructionally relevant. The extent to which student performance data were valid indices of student achievement, were sensitive to pupil growth, and could be used to judge the efficacy of program placement and student progress in the program also were examined. Results suggest that the system can be implemented successfully on a wide-scale basis in schools. (Author/PN)",

In light of this demand, National Assessment re-examined its role with respect to raising educational quality in this country. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) asked seven educators to answer questions about NAEP's appropirate role regarding standards. (1) To what extent is there a desire to establish and raise standards in the United States? (2) What is the nature of the desire? (3) How are standards of educational achievement raised beyond that of minimum proficiency? (4) What roles should NAEP play in developing or setting educational standards at the national, state, and local levels? (5) What process  should NAEP use to assure that elements important to particular learning areas be included? (6) What ways of organizing/structuring objectives would help facilitate raising educational standards? Their responses, synthesized in this paper, shed light on the nature of the public's desire for standards and on steps various communities are taking and provide recommendations on the part that the National Assessment should play.

        "description":"Social programs are often based on unclearly articulated theoretical rationales. The evaluations of these programs are also often relatively theory free, and therefore make limited contributions to theory. A Program Development Evaluation (PDE) approach, intended to integrate theory testing with the development and evaluation of action programs, is described and illustrated. This approach has been applied for over 2 years in the national evaluation of locally developed delinquency programs in 69 schools, and has resulted in (a) the implementation of several true experiments conducted in collaboration with project implementers, (b) an increase in the clarity of projects' theoretical rationales, and (c) the identification and measurement of theoretical intermediary variables as  well as outcome variables. Based on the action research paradigm, the PDE approach appears to increase the theoretical and practical relevance of evaluation research. (Author/PN)",

In cooperation with colleges having resident HEOP programs, New York State prisons implement (1) in-prison programs under which instructors teach courses at the prisons and (2) educational release programs under which inmates attend classes at college campuses but return to the correctional facility every day. To evaluate the program, data were collected on 277 male former inmates who participated in the program and had since been released from prison. Information collected included the subjects' individual and demographic characteristics; criminal  experiences; time spent, credits earned, courses taken, services received, and academic achievement in the program; and subsequent crime record, employment, income, and educational status after release. The data indicated positive program results despite short periods of participation; over half of the subjects attended college and 75 percent had been employed after release, and the group's recidivism rate was comparatively low. The report presents several tables of data and extensive descriptions of instruments used, data collection, data processing, and the variables examined in the study. (MJL)",

        "description":"This book is about the Portuguese who immigrated from the Azores Islands to the United States during the years 1800-1870, 1870-1920, and 1957-1982. The earliest Portuguese immigrants were employed in the whaling industry, and settled in New England and California. Another major concentration can be found in the Hawaiian Islands, where they were originally employed as contract agricultural workers. The first chapter of the book describes how whaling helped the Portuguese to reach America. Chapters 2 and 3 compare and contrast the immigrants' occupational experiences in the face of discrimination. Chapter 4 analyzes economic conditions that prompted the Portuguese to leave the Azores and come to America. The fifth chapter examines how these immigrants tried to become assimilated  into American culture while retaining their own cultural values. Finally, the last three chapters of the book discuss contemporary economic and political life in the Azores Islands, and explain why Azorean Portuguese continue to immigrate to the United States in search of better economic opportunities.

It was found that there is little evidence to support the contention that blacks who attend white schools will internalize negative self images and accept white standards of beauty. Most blacks were found to have genuine ethnic pride and  still interact well with whites and other ethnic groups. Further, young blacks were found to be likely to identify with global issues.

The report describes the outcomes of project graduates, dropouts, and nonparticipants from 1977 to 1979, focusing on two areas: (1) their sustained occupational outcomes; and (2) cognitive and affective impact of the program. Student achievement in reading, language and mathematics is described, as are findings on participants' career aspirations, educational training, work history, and transition from school to work. Data indicate that suburban and inner city Project Concern participants were positively affected by the  program in terms of career development and basic skills growth, although suburban students did not show positive relative growth. The reader is cautioned, however, that findings are tentative, due to low survey returns by some schools. (WAM)",

An introduction describes the study that examined the generalizability of three propositions derived from the studies of successful utilization experiences to this case in which utilization was more limited. (The three propositions are that successful utilization follows the development of an informal social network, linking knowledge producers and knowledge users; interventions designed to boost utilization must occur throughout the life of a research project; and utilization  depends on vigorous dissemination of project materials, not necessarily of its final report.) The second section summarizes the history and utilization experience of the comparison case, the Program Development Handbook Project. In the third section the fit between the propositions and the evidence from the comparison case are examined. These findings are discussed: no evidence was found that interventions differed appreciably from handbook to handbook, and the ombudsman services handbook had some advantages in regard to both networking and dissemination.

(Both used literature reviews, surveys, and analysis of existing case records to arrive at tentative conclusions about the dimensions of the elder abuse problem.) Section 2 describes the ways in which the new information produced by the studies has been used by federal policymakers, state planners and policymakers, service providers, and the media. Section 3 examines the importance of four  propositions about the conditions for research utilization in the case of the elder abuse projects: (1) extensive networking, (2) vigorous dissemination, (3) existence of a large audience of policymakers and practitioners with interest in the topic and a desire to do something about it, and (4) confirmation of study findings by other researchers.

        "description":"The Patterns of Linkage project investigated the assumption that linkages between training institutions and employers can reduce discrepancies between training programs and employer demands, and hence increase the employability of youth. The purpose of the study was to examine and describe patterns of linkage between training institutions and private sector employers. Data were collected from 48 training programs, both Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) and non-CETA, and from 40 employers selected through an extensive process. The study concluded that linkage occurs at two levels: the institution level and the program or classroom level. Indicators of linkage at the institutional level include the background of the executive directors, the time they spend talking  with local employers, and the involvement of the advisory committee in the organization. Indicators of training program linkages include the background of the classroom teachers and the time they spend talking to employers. Other findings were that CETA organizations that have strong linkages with employers tend to fund training programs at institutions with strong linkages, and that institutional-level linkages were associated with a greater tendency to please local employers in creating or deleting training programs. Institutional linkages had little effect on how the training was provided, however. Further research into linkages was recommended. (KC)",

The survey was conducted to gather information that would permit designing a cost-effective and representative sample survey of individual crafts-artists belonging to organizations and to provide a descriptive picture of the full range of crafts membership organizations and their role in the crafts world. A questionnaire was designed and sent to a preliminary list of 2,400 supposed crafts membership organizations. After elimination of respondents who were not from crafts membership groups, about 1,200 authentic organizations were identified. From these, 947 completed the questionnaires.  As a result of the survey, it was estimated that about 375,000 craftspersons live in the United States, with a large proportion located in the East-North-Central region and a smaller proportion in the Pacific region. Findings show that more than 60 percent of the organizations are general crafts organizations, while of those whose members work in the same medium, nearly two-thirds are organizations of fiber artists. Fiber is the primary medium of 38 to 48 percent of the groups. Other media vary by geographical areas of members. Crafts membership organizations are small, averaging about 90 members with only 3 percent of the organizations having 2,000 or more members. Based on the information gained in this survey, recommendations were made to conduct a national survey of individual  craftspersons; factors to be considered include geographic area, media in which persons work, organization membership size, sample size, and sample selection.

Three different methods of assessment were used in the study. The primary instrument was a 25-item apprenticeship survey that was completed by 628 first-year apprentices--320 carpenters, 265 machinists, and 43 auto mechanics. It contained questions regarding the apprentices' personal and educational background, trade-related experiences, and sources of information on apprenticeship. In addition, telephone interviews were conducted with 49 of the original 628 respondents and personal interviews were conducted with 21 employers who  employed one of the apprentices interviewed by phone. Topics covered in the phone interviews included respondents' motivations for becoming apprentices as well as their evaluations of their high school experiences. While the employer interview focused mainly on ratings of individual apprentices, it also included questions concerning apprentices in general. Based on data from the three instruments, researchers made 17 recommendations pertaining to topics such as steps students can take to gain entrance into apprenticeship programs and the educational needs of students planning to become apprentices.

The first step involves formal and informal activities to appropriately identify learning disabled students. Formal assessments should be conducted by qualified personnel, informal assessments by vocational teachers in the classroom and shop. Vocational teachers need to be involved in the development of an Individualized Education Program and an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Program. Finally, before instruction begins, students need an orientation to the school, teachers, and instructional environment. Ten main tasks to be accomplished in the vocational education of learning-disabled  students are finding a bridge builder to provide a link between vocational education, special education, and other school and community agencies; teaching skills that are in demand; teaching survival skills; teaching how to compensate for reading and writing skill deficiencies; teaching how to solve problems through learning strategies; teaching the error and correction strategy; teaching in visual, auditory, and tactile modes; teaching skill transfer; and helping to develop self esteem. A final step in the vocational education of learning-disabled students is successful job placement. (Informal assessment instruments are appended.) (YLB)",

To compare the entrepreneurs' concepts of life and job satisfaction to those of women in more traditional occupations, researchers also studied a sample of 32 female nursing supervisors from three hospitals in New Jersey and Maryland. The researchers administered the work, people, and pay scales of the Job Description Index (JDI) to both groups. While the entrepreneurs scored higher than the nursing supervisors on the work and people scales of the JDI, they scored lower on the pay scale. In addition, the entrepreneurs scored higher than the nursing supervisors on the global measures of job and life  satisfaction, although the mean differences on these items were not significant. Based on their findings, researchers called for additional research to arrive at more definitive statements concerning the nature of relationships between job satisfaction and life satisfaction among entrepreneurs. More specifically, they suggested that future research efforts use a larger sample of female entrepreneurs, employ a measure to screen for success, and utilize a longitudinal approach. (MN)",

Each of five format models shows the kind of information to present for a specific class of tasks, how to format the information, and how to sequence it. The model serves as a specification for creating the types of pages required for efficient training. For each format model, there are sample learning objectives, a description of the learning strategy incorporated in the model, and one or more sample instructional modules based on  the page specifications. An appendix to the document contains a sample instructional package developed by a field activity based on two of the format models. This package demonstrates that field activities can successfully use the format models and illustrates how the format models can be customized to meet special requirements in a training program. (This handbook was specifically prepared for use in developing instructional material according to the Navy's &quot;Procedures for Instructional Systems Development.&quot; Therefore, it will be of major interest to subject matter specialists in Navy schools who create instructional materials, as well as to a wider audience of designers of materials for technical instruction.)

        "description":"Personnel officers and first-line supervisors in eight Bay Area corporations were interviewed in fall and winter 1981 to study the range and diversity of employer experience in dealing with young workers. Respondents indicated various primary sources of applicants for entry-level jobs. Approximately two applicants out of every three were eliminated from consideration on the basis of their written job applications, sometimes accompanied by very brief interviews with personnel specialists. A final selection was made based upon separate, lengthier interviews by personnel officers and the first-line supervisors. The first-line supervisors made the final decisions. Respondents identified as characteristics that affected employee selection or performance (1) the ability to communicate,  (2) appearance/presentability, (3) stable work experience, (4) self confidence, (5) interviewing skills, (6) desire to learn, (7) completion of an accurate application, (8) grammar, and (9) the desire to advance. The preferred source of entry-level applicants were community-based organizations (CBOs) operating general work-readiness and specific vocational training programs, such as Comprehensive Employment and Training Act programs. Some corporations invested considerable staff time in developing and maintaining relationships with CBOs. Specific behaviors identified as needed for advancement were the proper work attitude, organizational skills, initiative, interpersonal skills, and flexibility. (YLB)",

        "description":"Because of the increased need for a trained labor force to work in growing industries and because the public schools had failed to provide such workers, many corporations conducted their own training programs during the period 1900-1930. Departing from the older methods of training foremen and having them train the workers, these schools provided both general education and job training. Corporate schools especially stressed educating the workers to the &quot;proper&quot; values that would promote corporate efficiency (thus corporate profits), and, according to the prevailing social theory, the good of society would be enhanced. In addition to training workers in specific jobs and molding industrial values, the corporate schools also sought to prepare white, native-born men for promotion to  the executive ranks. The corporate schools were so good at their tasks that public schools began to copy some of their methods. By 1930, however, corporate financial troubles caused by the Great Depression as well as union troubles and growing public intolerance of the class-hardening promoted by the corporate schools had caused their demise. Their tasks were taken over by public schools and vocational education programs. (KC)",

Using a task analysis of a hunter's job, a set of procedures was developed that can improve the curriculum development process and, to some extent, overcome the difficulties associated with it. The study used a collection of task statements generated in a workshop setting, distributed them to the field for responses, and then clustered these task statements on the basis of field responses. The clusters were then examined according to a behavioral taxonomy. This process allows for the identification of the physical and psychological requirements associated with a cluster. In addition, the process provided information on the relative  importance of tasks associated with the job situation. Finally, the process allowed for the field validation of existing DACUM charts and the identification of core competencies and modules for multi-level occupations. Using hunter training task statements, the study identified those tasks that cluster together by using a factor analytic approach. The clusters identified on the basis of field responses were the following: (1) identification and knowledge of species and their habitats; (2) survival; (3) knowledge and activities required in preparation for a hunting trip; (4) legal aspects of hunting; (5) safety; and (6) hunting ethics. In addition, information on the relative importance of all task items was extrapolated and interpreted with respect to implications for curriculum design  and instruction as well as for the identification of core competencies and modules for complex work environments.

It was hypothesized that the organizing circumstance (organizing factors external to the learner), rather than preplanning by the individual, is the directing force behind much adult nonformal learning. Nine formal and nine nonformal learners were interviewed to study their learning processes. Four major patterns surfaced repeatedly from respondents' accounts of their learning projects and provided a basis for establishing categories related to the circumstances affecting the learner. The four types were single event/anticipated learning, single event/unanticipated  learning, series of events/related learning, and series of events/unrelated learning. Findings suggested five areas for additional research: effects of the setting and circumstance on structure of the learning project, effect of circumstances on learners when the educational level is controlled, varying abilities of individuals to extract learning opportunities and resources from personal life spaces, elements in structure of nonformal learning that ought to be incorporated into formal learning to increase its effectiveness, and learners' perceptions of organization of their projects.

        "description":"Vocational education's mission in economic development calls for a more active and assertive posture at the national, state, and local levels. If vocational education programs are to meet the challenges posed by the increase of new technologies, vocational administrators must develop a system for updating vocational staff for hiring more instructors from business and industry, for channeling research and development funds to establish a data-based planning and management system to aid in improving training methods and developing systems, and for working together with business and industry to develop competency-based instructional materials. Among the national-level actions necessary to secure vocational education's role in the economic development scheme are the following:  development of incentives for states to design training programs needed for reindustrialization, productivity improvement, and national defense concerns; provision of funds for modern facilities and technical equipment; and revision of the existing \"apprenticeship training\" definition to encourage use of competency-based training programs. Furthermore, state vocational education agencies should develop their comprehensive state plans to include, among other things, development of \"fast response\" delivery systems for new innovations in high technology areas and provision of outreach programs to locate unemployed, disadvantaged, and handicapped workers and to deliver counseling, training, and support services to them.

        "description":"In order to determine adequately how community and technical colleges can work with business and industry to meet the training needs of the existing work force, one must first understand the relationship between lagging productivity and the national economy. In the short run, lagging productivity increases inflation and unemployment, lessens our standard of living, and confounds our ability to compete successfully in world markets. Long-term effects include social and political unrest, reduced national defense capabilities, snowballing economic problems, and worsened problems in competing in world markets. Investment in human capital and high technology in the form of improved vocational education and occupational training will result in a healthier economy. Vocational educators  can and must work cooperatively with business and industry to improve human productivity and quality of work life through new management practices. Among those areas of human resource development in which possibilities for partnerships among business, industry and vocational education exist are the following: training for job redesign, employee orientation training, technical and scientific skill development, communications and basic skill development, supervisor orientation training, and training for employee participation.

To identify these needs, researchers interviewed 340 of the approximately 3,174 Winnebago adults living in the Central Wisconsin area, administrators of 15 area secondary and postsecondary schools, and 103 Winnebago students attending area high schools. While job placement and vocational education services were of the most interest to the adults responding to the survey, a moderately high degree of interest in career counseling existed. Also considered important by the respondents was information on training requirements, financial requirements, jobs, and special training. Those with only a grade school education were extremely interested in career planning information. According to the administrators surveyed,  Winnebago students have slightly more difficulty in finding a job than do members of the general population. All of the school districts responding to the survey provided career counseling services and 12 of the 15 offered job placement services. The vocational areas in which the student respondents were most frequently enrolled were business education, home economics, industrial arts, and trade and industrial education. College or postsecondary vocational and technical education was the most frequently identified type of educational preparation needed to obtain the respondents' career choices. (MN)",

Data were gathered from 505 older adults (aged 60 and over), 145 nutrition directors (66 percent return), and 482 ABE teachers (19 percent return), using questionnaires about learning needs of older adults and demographic data. Analysis of the data gathered led to several conclusions. First, the  reading interests of older adults are as diverse as the population. Second, significant differences exist between the perceptions of educational needs of older adults by older adults and by the professionals in the field. A third conclusion is that, of the two professional groups in this study, nutrition directors were in greater consensus with the older adults. A fourth result of the study is that health is of primary importance to undereducated older adults, while the final conclusion is that these persons do not see ABE as a primary educational need. These conclusions should be considered by those who plan educational experiences for older adults; perhaps they should consider integrating ABE in health education classes. (KC)",

        "description":"An evaluation of the Nuclear Skill Related Training Program at Memphis State University was conducted to identify possible motivational and attitudinal variables that may contribute to the retention-attrition rates of Job Corps students (40 percent) admitted to the program compared to non-Job Corps students who are migrant workers (2 percent). The program consists of 26 weeks of intensive training on a daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. basis. A questionnaire was developed to determine personal and motivational attitudes of the 11 currently enrolled students related to the administration and content of the Nuclear Studies Program, and short personal interviews were also conducted with these students. Data gathered in the survey indicated that the students are somewhat pleased with the  program, have a strong commitment to the program, and feel that academic problems would be their major reason for dropping out if they did so. Most changes suggested by students involved the instructional area, especially in relation to the professors/instructors, modules, and the practicality of course control. Another group of suggestions was about student personnel staff. In order to strengthen retention of students in the program, the study recommended that enlistment personnel in Job Corps centers be more specific about program content, difficulty, and the probability of jobs after graduation. It also recommended that the program offer more remedial services and that instructors be more available for consultations and be more practical in class. (KC)",

        "description":"Policies and practices were identified that have led to the success of exemplary programs in adult vocational education in Ohio. Data were collected from adult vocational education personnel, students, and employers located in five exemplary planning districts. All districts had a full-time supervisor for adult programs, employed full- and part-time adult vocational education instructors, developed a separate budget, used craft advisory committees, conducted informal and formal evaluation of vocational education programs, and cooperated with local business, government, and community agencies. Less than one-half of all adult instructors held a bachelor's degree. Two-thirds used competency-based educational curricula. The most common teaching method was supervising individuals  working on projects or at cooperative training stations. Instructors were involved in job placement and student recruitment. Adult students attended vocational/technical classes to improve job skills and to prepare for a career or job change. About two-thirds were enrolled full-time. About two-thirds received employer or other support for tuition costs. Over one-half of the employers reimbursed employees and provided work release. Use of employer facilities as a classroom or laboratory was indicated as the most frequent cooperative activity. (Appendixes include survey instruments and data tables.) (YLB)",

Almost 86 percent were under age 35, with the heaviest concentration aged 20 to 24. Almost 59 percent were women; 67 percent were white. The largest percentage (61 percent) had completed high school just prior to entering the current program; approximately 27 percent had completed another vocational training program or had attended college. Students' parents generally had completed a high school education or less and were in the blue collar, clerical or sales fields. Most students selected the program in which they were enrolled because they had always wanted to enter  that field, and most selected schools primarily because of the school's reputation and placement capabilities. Almost 70 percent spent 20 to 37 hours per week in the classroom; 76 percent spent less than 10 hours per week studying. Less than one-half of the students were working. Of those who worked, approximately one-third worked fulltime. Sixty percent indicated they would continue their education; 50 percent said they would continue within the same field. Approximately 84 percent indicated they would seek employment in the field in which they were studying. (YLB)",

        "description":"The occupational distributions in the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) programs and the wage implications of these for men and women of different racial and ethnic origins were examined. Data came from two projects on CETA, both using Continuous Longitudinal Manpower Survey data. One assessed the nature and equity of men's and women's CETA experience, the other--ethnic and racial differences. Relative to men with the same placement characteristics, women were more likely to enter CETA under Title I (basic education, job training, work experience services) and less likely to enter under Titles II and IV (public service jobs). Small or no effects of race and ethnicity on CETA occupational status and wages were found. Training or working in traditional male or mixed  occupations gave women higher CETA wages than training or working in traditional female occupations. CETA wages were consistently lower for women than men in the same occupations, CETA service, or traditionality category. CETA employed 80 percent of the women and 67 percent of the men in occupations whose unsubsidized counterparts had the lowest wages and highest unemployment rates. In CETA training, CETA retained the percent of women in lower wage occupations but reduced the percent of men to 50 percent. (YLB)",

The four benefit programs included a control or baseline contributory program, the Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP); a second contribution program offering enhanced kickers in the Army, the Ultra VEAP; and two noncontributory plans, the Noncontributory VEAP and a tuition/stipend program. (In a contributory program, the service member contributes to an educational fund with the government matching the contribution at a set ratio. Any enlistee can participate in VEAP; for the other programs, an enlistee must meet a high quality criterion and enter a specified, critical specialty.) The largest estimated response appeared in the Ultra VEAP program that increased Army  enlistments by 9 percent. Effects for the noncontributory VEAP program were small. The tuition/stipend program increased Navy and Air Force enlistments by 5 to 8 percent. It also reduced Army enlistments by 6 percent, since the Army could not offer greater benefits than the other services as it does in VEAP. It was shown that educational benefits could produce significant increases in high quality enlistments but lead to a drop in the number of high quality Army enlistments. (YLB)",

        "description":"Job loss is a stressful event, partially because of the obvious stress of economic deprivation. However, research shows that job loss also has psychological effects. The impact of losing a job has been investigated in terms of personality (self esteem, mental health, and affective states) and in terms of the transitional stages of reactions to job and career loss over time (grief from the loss and stages of unemployment). Moderating factors have also been identified, such as social support and high activity level. Factors identified as intensifying negative feelings are a high degree of personal involvement with the job and concomitant domestic problems. Critical questions for future research concern elaboration of grief stages as they specifically relate to job loss, the role of  social support as a buffer for some of the negative emotional consequences of job loss, and the effectiveness of coping strategies as other moderating factors.

        "description":"This volume contains four papers presented at a 1982 conference sponsored by the National Council on Employment Policy. It begins with a brief policy statement warning that labor force and productivity data systems face deterioration because of budget cuts that have forced a decline in the quality and quantity of the published information and curtailment of needed research. Each of the papers, presented by a leading economic or statistical analyst, examines one part of the system. The first, by Leon Taub, explores the extent to which the Current Population Survey can aid in answering key policy questions relating to macroeconomic, labor market, and welfare issues. In the second presentation, by Robert Taggart, new measures of labor market-related economic hardships are proposed  to supplement existing labor force and poverty statistics. The third paper, by Elliot Grossman and George Sadler, cautions that conventional productivity measures concentrating on labor are overstating productivity growth. To properly capture the substitution of capital for labor and labor for capital, the need for up-to-date measures of total factor productivity is emphasized. The fourth paper, by Orley Ashenfelter and Gary Solon, emphasizes that longitudinal data collection should not be halted, since such data provide insights unobtainable from cross-sectional data. A conference summary, by Sar A. Levitan, based on selective hearing is also provided. (YLB)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken to describe efforts in three states to create customized vocational training for specific client firms as part of economic development efforts. Approximately 70 persons from education, business, and state government were interviewed; documents from the three states (Ohio, South Carolina, and New York) were reviewed; and, at least one week was spent on-site in each of the states to gather data. Some of the major findings and recommendations resulting from the study are the following: (1) programs vary in terms of centralization and use of single or multiple agencies as providers; (2) rapid response to client firm needs through a streamlined decision-making process is needed; (3) eligibility for subsidies varies from state to state; (4) client firms in all  three states were highly satisfied with the services they received, and provision of such services was cited as a factor in decisions to locate or expand in the states; (5) facilities and equipment must be up-to-date and flexible to accommodate a wide variety of training programs; (6) firms would have conducted their own training programs in the absence of those created for them, but such programs would have been of lower quality; and (7) a single state agency should be responsible for providing customized vocational education as part of the state's economic development efforts. Major issues raised but not answered by the study include the problem of private versus public responsibility for training, how states can document return on public investments, and how state economic development  efforts affect the economic development of other states and the nation.

        "description":"A study assessed the training effectiveness of instructional materials designed in accordance with three format models for (1) recalling facts about equipment, (2) applying rules and regulations, and (3) classifying objects and signals. Three types of self-paced instructional materials were compared: learning aids, programmed instruction, and traditional text. The evaluation was conducted at the Quartermaster School, Service School Command, Naval Training Center, Orlando, Florida. The materials provided information and skill development related to navigational lights, one part of the International Rules of the Road. Results showed that training conducted with materials designed according to the learning aids format produces better student performance than training with programmed  or traditional instructional materials. Students using learning aids spent more time studying. Effective techniques common to the format models were division of material into small, easily learned blocks; use of illustrations; distributed practice through exercises, self-tests, and directions for remediation at appropriate points; and immediate feedback on student responses. (Appendixes include data tables and excerpts from instructional materials.) (YLB)",

BOS prime sponsors spent less than regular prime sponsors for administration both on a statewide basis and for sites visited. The BOS prime sponsors' programs generally had comparable results but were less cost effective based on seven performance indicators. Each Balance of State prime sponsor had the same three advisory councils that CETA required of each regular prime sponsor--a planning council, a youth council, and a private industry council. State data used to identify the demographics of the CETA eligible  populations for BOS prime sponsors were incomplete and possibly inadequate for program planning purposes. Regular prime sponsors identified their CETA eligible population demographics and set their own equal opportunity benchmarks. (YLB)",

According to these data, CEIA monies have indeed been allotted and matched as prescribed by the act. Furthermore, the Division of Career Education, U.S. Department of Education has assumed a national leadership role in career education as well as an administrative one. The CEIA has also strengthened the role of state leadership in career education. In distributing local education agency (LEA) grants, some states have opted for intensity by concentrating resources in a small number of LEAs, while others have favored breadth by  awarding large numbers of small grants. The CEIA has created widespread awareness of and involvement in career education not only within the elementary and secondary education community, but also among the business/labor/industry community. Finally, all the data reviewed indicated that the CEIA has strengthened states' capacities to promote career education on an ongoing basis. (Appended to the report are (1) a list of career education funds disbursed to each state in fiscal years 1979 through 1982 and (2) the text of the Career Education Incentive Act. (MN)",

From testimony gathered from adult educators, other human service professionals, clients, elected officials, appointed administrators, and the general public, the council perceived that persons were basically satisfied with the program of adult education, with some revisions needed. Testimony related to how adult learning affected the individuals as workers, as persons, and as citizens and to how it benefited society through self-fulfillment of individuals, enhancement of the quality of life, and promotion of economic strength through preparation for technological  training. Witnesses also indicated that the federal government was more than getting its money worth from the programs.

Part 1 of three parts defines what is meant by vocational education. The goals, principles, and organization of vocational education are discussed. Part 2 describes six types of alternative programs: integrated occupational experience (cooperative education, capstone experiences, on-the-job training, apprenticeships, clinical experiences, internships, shadowing); supplemental/remedial programs, including topics, structures, and implications for programs and services; special needs programs and services;  competency-based education (CBE), including essential elements and desirable characteristics, differences between CBE and conventional programs, advantages, and implications for program planning; vocational student organizations; and adult/continuing education programs, including program subjects, delivery methods, marketing, and personnel. A sample checklist provides a general overview of the steps and criteria related to the development of local program plans. Part 3 suggests an optional activity--a visit to one or more program alternatives. An observation form is provided. (YLB)",

However, a great deal of variance in life satisfaction remains unexplained. Men (N=19) and women (N=21) aged 65 years or older were interviewed using the Life Satisfaction Index A and a measure of ego development in order to investigate the role of ego development in accounting for life satisfaction in aged individuals. Analyses of results indicated that people functioning at the post-conformist level of ego development were more satisfied with their lives than those at the conformist level, and that ego development increased the predictability of life satisfaction when  combined with the known predictors of health, activity and social participation, and socioeconomic status. The increased predictability of life satisfaction suggests that it may be useful to further explore the contribution of ego development and other psychological variables to life satisfaction. (JAC)",

        "description":"Embarrassment occurs when the social identity or &quot;face&quot; that one is trying to maintain is abruptly discredited. Thus, embarrassment usually assumes the presence of an audience, real or imagined, and a public predicament which changes the situation. Most people try to avoid embarrassment if they can, and if they have been embarrassed they will go to great lengths to restore their endangered identities, or &quot;face.&quot; Embarrassment not only affects the embarrassed person or actor but also the audience that witnesses the loss of face. It is possible for the audience to become so involved with another's embarrassment as to even suggest the notion of &quot;empathic embarrassment.&quot; There is still much to learn about this topic. Future investigations could profitably focus on two areas:  investigating the role of both actor and audience in creating and managing embarrassment; and examining embarrassment in its relation to other social anxieties. For example, research has shown that people who believed they were about to be embarrassed became distressed; they became shy and presented in advance a less positive identity, indicating embarrassment blended into shyness. There is, then, one common denominator in research of this nature: the management of social identity. Whether the emphasis is on the actor or the situations which produce difficulties our focus is on managing smooth social interaction. (JAC)",

In order to assess the effectiveness of the newly developed counseling services of the Office of Employment Counseling and Placement at Bronx Community College, graduates and alumni who had used the service during the 1979-1980 and 1980-1981 academic years were asked to complete counselor evaluation questionnaires. Results of these surveys were compared with results from an April 1980 college-wide survey conducted prior to the Employment Office efforts at program improvements. The percentage of graduates and alumni who rated the counseling services satisfactory increased from 46% in 1979-1980 to  67% in 1980-1981; this was significantly greater at the .01 level in both years than the percentage of students who rated job placement services adequate to excellent in the April 1980 college-wide survey.

Klugh describes the planning and use of the 15,000 square foot psychology laboratory at Alma College. Both case histories provide suggestions about the planning and design of undergraduate laboratories. The final paper, by Charles M.

Weight gain and the fear of weight gain after smoking cessation may also prevent many smokers from quitting. A sample of 45 adult smokers participated in a study in which three levels of preventive weight control intervention (weight control discussion; discussion with monitoring of eating habits; and discussion, monitoring, and homework exercises), combined with smoking control treatment, were compared for effectiveness in producing smoking cessation and preventing weight gain during and following treatment. Results showed all participants indicated a posttreatment abstinence rate of 43%, a percentage lower than that found in  previous studies. No signficant differences were found between the three treatment conditions in percentage of participants abstinent at 1 and 6 months posttreatment. A significant treatment effect was found for the intermediate treatment group which showed a 50% abstinence rate at 6 months posttreatment, compared to 15% and 29% for the other groups. Treatment condition was not found to affect body weight. Although treatment manipulation was expected to affect body weight, the absence of weight differences between groups may be related to the structure and social support the treatment groups provided to participants.

Hospital and community mental health center administrators and staffs were surveyed to obtain program planning input, i.e., selection of trainee groups, assignment of priority to training areas and topics, and choice of format models for the training programs. Job-title, training and experience levels, and job analyses data were obtained from respondents. A return rate of 50% or 901 valid responses provided a representative cross-section of mental health personnel. Analyses of results indicated that while a need for training was identified the area of greatest need was not suited to  traditional continuing education. Non-credentialed personnel, most notably state hospital psychiatric aides, were cited as needing most training, and a skill-oriented training format conducted at the work setting was suggested by the greatest percentage of all groups. To the extent that the results are capable of being generalized, the findings suggest that openness to the needs of training consumers is essential as the most effective means of ensuring that inservice training and continuing education programs continue to exist at necessary levels.

In order to investigate the effects of interviewing style and interviewer mode of dress, on the quantity and quality of information obtained from 8 to 11 year-olds in a standardized clinical analogue interview, two male interviewers saw a total of 64 boys and girls, selected from a normal school population. The design included three independent variables: \"warm\" or \"reserved\" interviewing style, formally or casually dressed interviewer, and male or female children. After the interview, children completed a reinforcement schedule and an attitude survey. Analyses of these results and the  ratings of the dependent variables showed no significant differences for any of these variables on the dependent measures of self-disclosure, amount of speech, problem admissions, listing of reinforcers, and rated liking of the interview. Significant correlations were found between children's grade level and several of the dependent measures.

        "description":"How we go about labeling and conceptualizing the social problem of burnout reveals much about the underlying values and assumptions of our culture. An examination of the history of social science and related, applied fields during the last 150 years, reveals two different paradigms, i.e., ways of viewing the world based on untested assumptions and biases, which have been used to guide research and practice: the moral-religious and the scientific-technical. When burnout is viewed from the perspective of the first it is more likely to be regarded as the loss of moral commitment rather than a maladaptive reaction to stress. This distinction is meaningful for research and action because a social commitment conception leads us to anlayze ways in which social systems generate and  maintain commitment; the dominance of the scientific technical paradigm leads us to think how social systems create stress. The problem underlying reliance on the scientific-technical paradigm stems from the fact that this mode of thinking actually contributes to burnout by weakening the ability to form strong commitment to any external frame of reference and strengthening the culture of professionalism which in turn weakens the bonds between caregivers and the settings in which they work. Burnout is the result of this diluted sense of community. These emphases inherent in the scientific-technical paradigm have undermined the social supports and commitment mechanisms that could protect caregivers in the human services from stress and burnout.

        "description":"Research and intervention on burnout have focused on the worker and the work setting. Since these factors are influenced by social, political and economic forces in society, alienation or burnout in the human services requires critical examination in a larger context, especially the history of the human services prior to 1976 when concern about job stress became popular. Events of the 1960's, specifically the establishment of social programs with unrealistic expectations for eradicating poverty or eliminating educational inequities, coupled with our society's cultural ambivalence about social welfare, contributed to the lack of resources, large caseloads and bureaucratic hassles that are common sources of burnout. The time involved in generating and coordinating required and  often meaningless data is also a common cause of burnout in service providers. During the 1970's public concern shifted from social welfare to energy and economics. The decreased importance of human services reduced the availability of human service jobs, making lack of job mobility and burnout likely responses to job stress. Based on this analysis, two implications emerge for reducing burnout in the human services: to be effective, change efforts must be directed at social attitudes and political dynamics; and these efforts must be based on a valid analysis of the causes of the burnout problem.

        "description":"While numerous studies have identified economic, social, and environmental conditions related to stress, greater stress has been found to be related to poverty, unemployment, assembly line work, crowding, and chronic exposure to noise. These stressful situations most frequently confront people with little personal, economic, or political resources to eliminate or control them. While stress is identified as a major psychological and health hazard, and numerous programs exist to help people reduce stress, there are serious problems with the present approaches to managing stress. Stress management programs are often designed for, and attended by, educated, middle-class participants. For most people confronted with the serious stressors of poverty, racism, and environmental  pollution, the typical stress management program is not only unavailable and inaccessible, but also irrelevant, inappropriate, and ineffective. In addition, current stress management programs oversimplify the problems of stress, support a &quot;blame the victim&quot; attitude, and are ultimately self-defeating because they encourage a passive atttitude which reinforces conditions in the system that create stress. Instead of a focus on personal adjustment strategies, empowerment approaches to stress management must be encouraged. (PAS)",

        "description":"The traditional method of measuring self-esteem has been to construct instruments based on their face validity, even though this approach has been shown to involve many difficulties when deriving scales for subjective dimensions such as self-esteem. An alternative approach to the measurement of self-esteem is based on techniques of psychophysical scaling and places respondents on their own subjective dimensions derived from judgments of trait self-descriptions. To test the technique, 35 college students, participating in groups of 10-15, judged similarity for 210 pair comparisons involving 20 traits plus the concept &quot;yourself.&quot; Results indicated the weight vectors and person locations provided alternative ways for representing individual differences relative to the evaluative  dimensions obtained from multidimensional scaling. Students generally placed more emphasis on the horizontal dimension than on the vertical dimension, and person locations were primarily on the evaluative side of the horizontal dimension. The location of individuals was not correlated with traditional measures of self-esteem. Charting coordinates for the self-concept in multidimensional trait space holds potential for producing a new measure of self-esteem. (JAC)",

        "description":"Investigations of moral development have usually relied on longitudinal research on adolescent males; such research has served as a basis for national educational efforts to foster moral development. To represent female as well as male perspectives in constructing theories of human development, conceptions of morality and conceptions of self and the relationship between them were investigated in a cross sectional sample of 36 individuals, evenly divided by sex, at each of nine ages, and matched for education and social class. From interview data, coding manuals were developed that identify and describe two different conceptions of morality (justice and caring) and two different conceptions of self in relation to others (separate and connected). The manuals were used to test the  hypotheses that: morality as justice is predominately male and morality as caring is predominately female; a conception of self as separate is predominately male and a conception of self as connected is predominately female; those whose conception of moraltiy is justice will have a conception of self as separate and those whose conception of morality is caring will have a conception of self as connected. All three hypotheses were confirmed. These results provide a basis for an expanded theory of moral development that represents the perspectives of both males and females and offers schools a new way to think about moral development in education.

        "description":"Some evaluations have concluded that diversion programs for juvenile offenders (programs intended as community-based alternatives to formal justice dispositions) reduce recidivism only among youths with the least serious offense histories. To investigate the relationship of offense history to program effectiveness, three diversion programs were studied using data from the national evaluation of diversion programs conducted by the Behavioral Research Institute. Offenders were randomly assigned to diversion and control groups. Data on arrest record as well as a broad range of outcome measures collected by personal interviews were used. Analyses revealed no significant relationship of offense history to program effectiveness. Reanalysis of data from earlier research revealed that  these findings were insignificant or unconvincing. The success of diversion programs at reducing delinquency appears unrelated to clients' offense histories and suggests that the goals of diversion will best be met by serving offenders who would otherwise have received formal justice dispositions.

To clarify the position of adolescents related to the elderly and the middle aged, to determine a pattern of attitudes, and to clarify the fourth or integrative dimension, undergraduates (N=150) were asked to rate attitudes toward ideal, real, and typical adolescents, middle-aged, and elderly people, using the Rosencranz and McNevin semantic  differential scale. Four subscales (autonomy, instrumentality, acceptability, and integration) were assessed. Analyses of results showed that ideal types were not seen to differ on either instrumentality or autonomy. Real adolescents and middle-aged people were viewed as equally instrumental and more instrumental than the elderly; for the typical category, instrumentality was seen to steadily decline with increasing age. Real and typical middle-aged people were seen as more autonomous than either adolescents or elderly people. Typical types were seen as less acceptable than either real or ideal. Integration was viewed as decreasing progressively from ideal to real to typical. The results support the notion of intergenerational affinities. (Author/PAS)",

But first, teachers must know just what this knowledge and these strategies are and how they can be presented to students. Akin to model building, reading comprehension involves a variety of behaviors and self-regulating strategies aimed at developing an interpretation that is plausible, complete, interrelated, and coherent. Studies suggest that secondary school students either lack these abilities and awarenesses or fail to use them. Other studies, however, suggest that knowledge and strategies can be successfully taught if teachers consider five things: (1) relevance--the skill or ability is worth teaching; (2)  explicitness--students should be informed why, when, where, and how to use specific strategies; (3) student as informant--students should explore strategies for themselves; (4) self-regulation--students must be moved beyond situations where they depend on the teacher; and (5) application--students must be given situations that stimulate the transfer tasks to which they are expected to put these skills, strategies, and awarenesses.

A study of inservice programs both highlighted the implementation stage as being crucial for determining whether a proposed change would be successful and isolated effective and ineffective implementation strategies. The study also identified the degree to which teachers believed in themselves and their ability to be successful with all students as a major factor in the change process. In order to incorporate teacher effectiveness findings into classroom practice, a recommended strategy would be to focus on attitudes and implementation. This approach stresses teacher potential  rather than deficiencies, allows teachers to use alternative pedagogies to accomplish a goal, and recognizes teachers' individual styles and personalities as well as the traits of individual classrooms. Other key components of an inservice model that focuses on the classroom teacher as the real agent of change include (1) faculty identification of goals and objectives congruent with their assumptions and beliefs, (2) continual monitoring of proposed changes, and (3) adaptation of changes being implemented to pupils and programs.

The second chapter examines the motives behind the creation of the Deseret alphabet, including the possibilities of a secret Mormon code, a protection from unwholesome literature, a case of being in the right place at the right time, a phonetic English orthography, and a preparation for a pure language. The third chapter traces the roots of the Deseret alphabet: the roots (pre-1850), the developmental period (1852-1857), and the rises and falls (1858-1877). The remaining three chapters examine the practical application of the alphabet, its successes and failures, and the effect the alphabet had on  English orthography.

        "description":"To examine the relative effectiveness of the language experience approach (LEA) as a means of motivating and teaching reading to behaviorally disordered students, two children were examined. Subjects were an 11-year-old (Jimmy) and an 8-year-old (Bobby), who were placed in a classroom with nine other children identified as emotionally disturbed. All LEA instruction took place in a special services room. After two topics of interest to the students were identified, illustrations were created and used to elicit the LEA stories. Each story served as an instructional base for a period of 4 days with each lesson scheduled for approximately 20 minutes. Two target behaviors were identified: (1) increased recognition of sight words taken from the Dolch Word List and from the LEA stories,  and (2) the ability to correctly complete modified cloze sentences at the end of each story. Results showed that while both subjects learned LEA sight words, they neither retained recognition of all new sight words introduced nor retained mastery of all words recognized immediately following instruction. Over all, Jimmy showed the greatest and most consistent growth in sight word learning. While both gave evidence of the ability to predict deleted words in the cloze sentences, Bobby performed this task with greater accuracy and exhibited more consistent use of context and understanding of the task demands. Conversely, Jimmy performed poorly over all. Both students exhibited less disruptive behavior and showed an increased attention to the LEA tasks. (HOD)",

The displays used in the experiments were well-illuminated 6 x 6 degree or 10 x 10 degree fields containing from 2 to 23 capital As, Bs, or Cs located randomly over the displays. The task of the subjects was to decide as rapidly as possible whether a predetermined target letter was present in the display. Reaction time functions had both linear and nonlinear components and varied from constant when targets were presented, to strongly curvilinear with one target, to strongly linear with a curvilinear aberration when there were no targets present. The results indicated that there are two separate processes that influence total response time in this type of visual search  task--acquisition and decision. Acquisition is a perceptual process and is nonlinear, while decision follows acquisition and is a serial self-terminating search. The results demonstrate that the time to search a display of N letters for the presence or absence of a particular target letter is not always linear. (FL)",

        "description":"Like legal language, medical language is a private language, a separate stratum containing some words specially defined for medical purposes, some existing only in the medical vocabulary, and some adding precision or solemnity. These characteristics often cause a breakdown in patient-doctor communication. Analysis of data obtained from prototype definitions responses to a list of 32 medical terms showed that there was a varying amount of semantic overlap between physician or nurse and patient ranging from almost complete overlap to almost zero overlap for some medical terms. Among some of the findings were the following: (1) medical workers have a more general, more inclusive meaning than do lay people for such medical terms as fracture, colic, diabetes, and arteriosclerosis; (2)  many medical terms (hypertension, stroke, obesity, prematurity) are not comprehensible at all or are barely so for certain patients, depending upon their backgrounds and experiences; (3) meanings are a result of beliefs and experiences for both males and females; (4) the causes of a disease or condition are less well understood than are the symptoms and results; and (5) lay people operate on a concrete level in understanding medical meanings. In order to improve matches between physician meanings and nurse/patient meanings, physicians need to understand the impact of presuppositions, intentions, beliefs, attitudes, moods, and encyclopedic knowledge in the interpretive processes. They need to lay bare the misleading assumptions common among themselves and nurses that account for  difficulties in comprehending medical terms. (HOD)",

Selection of schools used in the study was based on annual completion, percent of students set back, and withdrawal for academic reasons. The readability analyses were obtained using the Computer Readability Editing System (CRES) and calculated with the Flesch-Kincaid readability formula. The results indicated that the electronics technician curriculum had the most difficult readability grade level, 12.6. The least difficult course,  machinery repairman, was found to have a readability grade level of 8.1. The electronics technician curriculum also had the highest percentage of setbacks and the third highest percentage of academic attrition of the 11 courses studied. The fact that the mean readability grade level of the 11 sampled courses correlated positively with setback rates indicated that readability may be contributing to the setback problem. Based on these results, it was recommended that readability grade level standards be set to match the mean reading ability of the intended reader and that the CRES be used to assess and improve all technical curriculum materials.

Syntactic and semantic expectations are sources of information for top down processing, while knowledge of letter-sound relations provides information for bottom up processing. As children learn to read, interaction between top down and bottom up processing becomes more frequent. Since word recognition becomes automatic as readers progress, how rapidly children can read familiar words is an important factor in text reading, distinguishing between skilled and poor readers. Different explanations have been proposed for how children store spellings in memory; most likely spelling is a symbol linking visual representation to a word's  pronunciation. Both flashcards and meaningful text help children with some aspects of word learning, but neither method is adequate for acquiring complete word knowledge. Although these ideas on reading have experimental support, many questions about reading comprehension, reading readiness, and the actual classroom practice of the teaching of reading remain to be answered.

        "description":"Because of judicial indifference and legislative inaction, the conflict between the right of privacy and the freedom of the press is no closer to a resolution than it was a century ago. William Prosser's reduction of the common law of privacy into four separate torts has not solved the problem. The concept of \"newsworthiness\" has not been helpful either because the judiciary has neither advanced nor adopted a unified theory of the news. Efforts to link privacy to community mores have been misdirected, stressing the community's right to shield itself from indecency instead of the individual's autonomy and dignity, and failing to discriminate between various types of privacy. Privacy should be treated as a value worthy of its own status, as a matter of human dignity and a requisite  for a democratic society. Since prior restraint would be too destructive to freedom of the press, the goal of privacy law must be to prevent its further abuse. A four-part test can be used to balance the plaintiff's and defendant's responsibilities in a privacy action. The plaintiff must show that the disclosed facts are truly private and that their publication was sufficiently embarrassing to result in a loss of dignity; the defendant must explain why disclosure was \"in the public interest\" and thus privileged and why it was necessary to reveal the plaintiff's identity.

Such students might benefit from a program similar to that held at Oklahoma State University (Stillwater) in September 1981 for 12 Ecuadorian technicians. This four-session, 10-hour technical writing workshop was part of a larger program that also included intensive English language study. The workshop was team taught, but in general an English-as-a-second-language (ESL) instructor must have proficiency in the native language of the participants, some background in linguistics and teaching English as a second language, and knowledge of the field of specialization of the participants. Time  constraints, the students' lack of proficiency in English, and their apparently low level of technical knowledge all affected what was covered in the workshop. Material was presented on transparencies and handouts in short units; and oral presentations were slowed down, simplified, and translated into Spanish. The results of the workshop were not quantified, but those participating in it felt that it was beneficial to them. (JL)",

Because of their multidisciplinary orientation, many of the selections are presented as resources for teachers in writing-across-the-curriculum programs. The articles are divided into six parts, arranged essentially in the order that teachers would use the materials. Each part addresses a central concern  of teaching technical and business communication in two year programs: (1) preparing to teach the subject for the first time, (2) designing the basic course, (3) broadening the basic course or designing a program, (4) developing classroom strategies, (5) constructing effective assignments, and (6) teaching report writing.

Laboratory courses in psychology offer such an opportunity. These courses usually involve a heavy workload for both students and faculty, for, in addition to studying the regular course material, students attend a weekly laboratory in which they are taught experimental design and procedure, laboratory control, ethical considerations for psychological research, library research procedures, and preparation of manuscripts in appropriate American Psychological Association (APA) style and format. In one laboratory course, students are responsible for turning in two separate, completed  manuscripts. After a first draft, the instructor and lab assistant meet with each student in individual conferences to review first drafts. The first draft is then returned to the student for revision. The final draft, due about a week later, is reviewed and graded by the instructor alone. Students are instructed to emphasize organization and content in their first drafts and not to pay too much attention to editing and minor format considerations. First drafts are never graded; rather, students receive only praise and constructive criticism. The use of multiple drafts helps students to learn a new writing style and to understand the material they are writing about. An evaluation of the course shows the students like the multiple draft method. They perceive the benefits as being  substantive--internal as well as external revision takes place. (HOD)",

Subjects, 46 first-year medical students, were first interviewed on a series of structured tasks that assessed their constructs for perceiving people and the \"person-centeredness\" of their communication in situations frequently faced by physicians. After the interviews, the subjects completed a mail questionnaire designed to assess their attitudes about the medical interview and their levels of empathic motivation. In the final phase of the study, each subject interviewed a recently admitted patient at a university hospital to isolate the patient's present condition and to find out  information about his or her medical history, the medical history of the patient's family, current treatment, and life style. These results showed that person-centered communication was consistently related to medical students' ability to construe the dispositional and motivational characteristics of their patients. It appeared that when the physician's goal was to regulate, advise, or solicit information from a patient, those with more sophisticated interpersonal construct systems were more likely to conceive the patient's perspective and to use it in formulating patient-centered communication strategies.

        "description":"Journalists play a central role in U.S. presidential debates, but their exact role is unclear. Unlike the news conference or interview, the situation of a debate does not favor an adversarial role because journalists who assume this role tend to shift attention away from the main issues and reduce exchanges between the candidates. To insure true debate, journalists must pose well-defined questions that set the discussion agenda, focus on a point of opposition, and clearly imply a debate resolution. With this idea in mind, the panelists' efforts in the two 1980 debates between Ronald Reagan and John Anderson and between Ronald Reagan and President Jimmy Carter can be examined in terms of seven criteria: (1) brevity, (2) single question, (3) continuity in follow-up questions, (4)  focus on an area of disagreement between the candidates, (5) freedom from bias, (6) tone of goodwill rather than hostility, and (7) call for explanation and justification of significant policies. Results of this examination revealed that there were significant weaknesses in both of the 1980 debates, but that the panel for the Reagan-Carter debate performed much better than the panel for the earlier debate between Reagan and Anderson. The success of this later panel resulted from its ability to remove itself from the center stage, thereby allowing more exchanges between the candidates. (JL)",

He does not provide an adequate definition of &quot;situation.&quot; Both the type of factor analysis he chose (orthogonal rotation) and his use of a two-factor solution for interpretation of the data reflect inaccurate assumptions. Given these problems, his study provided no real test of the cross-situational consistency of the PRCA. In fact, given the inappropriateness of Parks's design for testing the PRCA, the amount of cross-situational consistency he observed was quite remarkable. Another study used 295 teachers and 295 of their friends as the subjects of a  test of the PRCA's cross-situational validity. The teacher subjects completed PRCAs for themselves and for their friends, and then their friends completed an identical task. Results indicated that the PRCA was a cross-situationally consistent predictive instrument. (JL)",

        "description":"In recent years, theatre faculty have come to understand that advanced degrees do not guarantee that a person is qualified for the subtle, complex, and dangerous job of teaching acting, and that actor training has more to do with the problems of human behavior than with the theatre. The fundamental problem with acting is the fear that controls human behavior. Theatre faculty should reach beyond theatre to the human behavior sciences for training techniques that can help students cast off this fear, free their imaginations and learn the skills of self knowledge and perception. Unfortunately, most graduate theatre programs are either unable or not inclined to prepare teachers for this new work, and many of the most valuable new techniques drawn from psychology and therapy are  dangerous in the hands of anyone not fully trained. Such teaching is better viewed as intervention (any interaction with another in order to change the other's behavior or attitudes) than as therapy. For any intervention, the instructor must know (1) what the specific intended impact of the intervention is, (2) the psychic or somatic mechanisms by which the intervention is expected to work, (3) any particular dangers posed by the technique, and (4) how to judge the actual impact of the intervention. Acting teachers must, in effect, become psychologists. What is needed is a thoughtful outline of a course of study for acting teachers and a full research bibliography of sources in the burgeoning territory of the sciences and technologies of human behavior.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, some of the usual explanations for their poorer showing are reexamined, suggesting that ability, personality traits, and early sex-role socialization are hardly a match for the real world constraints and barriers women face in the educational and occupational sphere. A conclusion is drawn suggesting that the social processes involved in becoming a professional scientist are better explanatory variables than individual factors in explaining women's achievements.

Two major types of activities of the consortium are the exchange of information, materials, and personnel among members in areas of mutual interest and concern and the development of educational materials and processes with a multicultural perspective. Major projects are concerned with developing materials to teach about the Pacific Ocean, collecting existing materials and organizing them into new materials for teaching about the Arctic and Southern Ocean, and providing opportunities for students and  teachers to exchange materials and ideas and to make personal contacts. In addition to the projects, a number of cooperative activities are being conducted. For example, in Japan and Australia instructional films are being translated and adapted for use in both countries. All activities proposed for NIE grant support during the period March 1981 to March 1982 were successfully completed: an annual meeting and a workshop were held; issues of a newsletter were produced; and the bylaws were revised.

The report consists of five chapters. Chapter 1, on the methodology, discusses how the data were collected through questionnaires and interviews. Chapter 2 contains case studies describing the programs. The four school districts provide many examples of the prospects for Holocaust curricula in various educational settings. Information is provided on the origin, teacher training, rationale, audience, developers, and content organization for each program. Chapter 3 discusses the instruction used in each of the four programs. Themes and goals,  perceived effects on students, and the teaching methods used are examined. Chapter 4 describes the effect that the Holocaust education programs had on the students. Chapter 5 contains the conclusions. Overall, students gained new factual information and developed a more comprehensive understanding of the factors accounting for the Holocaust. Results also showed that students' exposure to the Holocaust did not shatter their moral structures or rupture their patterns of judgments. (RM)",

Limited to the emergence phase (1966-70) of the organizations, the survey examines the National Organization of Women (NOW), the Feminists, and the Women's Equity Action League (WEAL) in terms of their definition of the major obstacle to be confronted, central goal, blueprint for the future, and methods of communication within and without their organizations. NOW specified sex discrimination as the major obstacle. Its goal was to reform the legislative status of women to ensure future equality. For the Feminists, man and his oppressive institutions were to be overcome. The goal was revolution and future equality for all human beings. WEAL  perceived its major obstacle as sex discrimination. Its central goal was &quot;responsible rebellion&quot; with a view toward dignity for all humans. The groups' forms of discourse consisted of brochures, general releases, letters and memos, conference reports, and essays. They assumed easy passage of the ERA and their increased radicalization damaged their ability to secure its passage. (KC)",

        "description":"The failure of the supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment to understand the rhetoric and world view of its opponents resulted in the defeat of the amendment. The opponents of the ERA had six arguments: women are not discriminated against; women will be drafted; protective labor laws will be eliminated; the ERA will destroy tradition regarding support, alimony, and child custody; legislation already exists to do what the ERA will do; and the ERA will require men and women to use the same restrooms. Opponents characterized proponents as radical militant &quot;libbers&quot; who are aggressive and unrepresentative of American values. Strategies of ERA proponents violated the world view of its opponents and of male legislators, that women should remain in their proper sphere, the home,  perform wifely duties, and ultimately be placed on a pedestal. Supporters could have emphasized that protective labor laws should apply to husband as well as wife, that existing legislation is not comprehensive and can be repealed, and that the ERA doesn't suggest there are not differences between the sexes, only that an individual cannot be penalized for a difference. The two conflicting rhetorical worlds had no common ground. (KC)",

Topics included energy, trade and development, migration, bilateral governmental relations, and the role of the press in these affairs. Mexico's oil and natural gas reserves were discussed; Mexico viewed its energy potential as a way to balance the expansion of its petroleum output with its overall industrial growth; the United States viewed the reserves as an energy issue. Illegal Mexican migration was considered by Mexicans as a brain and muscle drain; the United States saw the instituting of a regularized guest worker program as one solution to this problem. Regarding trade and development, Mexico was seen as  having more status as a world trading nation because of its development and control of natural resources. In discussions of bilateral governmental relations, the perceptions held of each other, the lack of communication over the years, and the need for consistent policy were considered. The media bear a heavy responsibility for building understanding and cooperation between the two countries. (Author/NE)",

        "description":"Based on research findings that sex stereotyping used for product commercials is offensive and often ineffective, recommendations for change have been proposed to the advertising industry. Women, in particular, have been portrayed in advertising in traditional domestic roles, emphasizing the consumer role, especially in television advertising. Advertisers continue to show stereotyped roles because they believe that this sells products better. Findings indicate, however, that advertising using liberated roles is more effective and less irritating to consumers. A review of the advertising industry's self-regulation bodies in Canada, the United States, and Great Britain states that although the problem of sex stereotyping has been recognized and guidelines established, the subject  is of low priority and regulation is not mandatory. Recommendations stress the need for use of improved measures to analyze the content of advertisements; use of social and economic indicators to measure impacts of sex stereotyping; and development of specific strategies aimed directly at advertisers. Included are reviews and recommendations of Canadian and United States advisory boards and a number of tables on the existence and criticisms of sex stereotyping in advertising. (BY)",

Randomly selected students from high schools in North Carolina participated in the study. The experimental group numbered 323; there were 152 students in the control group. The experimental group participated in a series of ten 50-minute lessons on death and dying. The study employed a pretest, posttest, and follow-up posttest design. Pretests showed that adolescents had moderately high levels of death anxiety but positive attitudes toward older adults. Significantly related to the pretest levels of death were students' sex, last personal involvement with death, and school. Age, religion, grade, race, and first involvement with death  were related to pretest attitudes toward older adults. In the posttest and follow-up posttest, both groups evidenced a small decrease in death anxiety and a slight change in attitudes toward older adults in a negative direction. Since these changes were not statistically significant, it cannot be concluded that participation in the lesson series influenced these changes. (RM)",

The official language of instruction at METU was English. However, most of the students didn't speak English, and he didn't speak much Turkish. Another frustration was the politicization of the students. The student organizations (METU was a leftist bastion) were very powerful. Students often boycotted exams or disrupted classes. Personal observations are also made concerning: the difficulty for Turkish  faculty to be promoted (they had to take exams and write another dissertation); business practices (the Turks lacked good business sense); television (those who had it watched it all the time); and smog (the burning of low-grade coal caused terrific pollution).

The sample consisted of 4,910 female and male candidates in state legislative elections to the lower house in Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. The relationship of party, incumbency, and urban or rural residency to female success was measured. Results indicated that women candidates increased over the decade, but still represent only 14.8 percent of the total. Generally, women do as well as men in primary elections but not as well in general elections, although by 1980 the differences were no longer significant when corrected for incumbency and party. Also, Republican women fared better than Democratic or nonpartisan women in comparison to the male colleagues. The conclusion is that since women fare about as well as men at the polls, the lack of female legislators can be attributed mostly to the paucity of candidates. The findings do not support the argument that political party elites work against females once they have become candidates. (KC)",

Part 1 addresses the problem of adolescent social development as a broad educational goal. Part 2 presents a set of six case studies describing special programs in Wisconsin designed for the marginal student: (1) Reuther Education At Large (Kenosha); (2) Lincoln Educational Alternative Program (Wisconsin Rapids); (3) Paper High School (Oconomowoc); (4) School Within a School (Janesville); (5) Alternative Learning Programs (McFarland); and (6) Academic Development Opportunity Program (Milwaukee). These programs were selected for study because they appeared to be effective in reducing dropout and truancy and had been praised by both  educators and students. In part 3, an interpretation of the case study data is offered that derives a set of generalizable characteristics about effective programs: These characteristics are categorized in terms of administration/organization, teacher culture, student culture, and curriculum and instruction. Part 4 begins with an exploration of one of the most promising innovations found in effective programs--experiential education. Under the assumption that public schools are not likely to implement widely this type of curriculum for the marginal student, a public policy of limited vouchers is advocated to stimulate experiential education programs.

        "description":"A survey solicited teachers' and education majors' views of their professional preparation pertaining to fostering their classroom students' emotional growth. A total sample of 78 inservice teachers and 22 education majors responded to a self-assessment questionnaire, which included sections on skills, concepts, and attitudes. The skills section focused on teacher/learner communication, fostering growth of students' self-esteem and independence, discipline strategies, group leadership, and counseling activities. The concepts section addressed topics in the areas of child development, adolescence, self-esteem development, and affective readiness factors. The attitudes section was designed to assess attitudes about teacher roles in fostering students' emotional growth. Teachers  rated themselves highly in regard to most skills and concepts but also indicated areas of only moderate or low mastery. Respondents reported frequent use of skills designed to increase students' ability to solve problems, make decisions, and foster self-esteem and acceptance of others. The teachers infrequently used the academic curriculum to achieve affectively oriented goals. Lack of professional development was mentioned as a causal factor in moderate or low mastery levels of affective skills. Education majors rated themselves higher on understanding adolescents and rejected the position that no one teacher can help all students. Both groups agreed that teachers can have an impact on the development of emotional well-being of their students. There was general agreement that increased  emphasis on skills, concepts, and attitudes essential for fostering emotional growth of students is needed in both preservice and inservice programs.

The report is presented in sections dealing with: (1) five areas of analysis and sources of information; (2) legal requirements and statutory authority for providing physical education; (3) legislative history of the physical education mandate; (4) status of the current physical education program; (5) an analysis of five areas of study; and (6) preliminary recommendations, conclusions, and summary of the development of a state physical education program. Discussion of the five areas of analysis centers on the narrow interpretation of the mandate in school districts and on the need to redefine the  mandate to include more realistic requirements. The summary and conclusions state the reasons that the current mandate is not viable and reasons that physical education programs are needed in Illinois. (FG)",

        "description":"An inservice program designed to provide high school teachers with experience in empirical research explored the factors contributing to the high dropout rate (60 percent) among a predominantly Native American student body. The practicum involved: (1) identifying the population; (2) developing instruments; (3) discussing and practicing interview techniques; (4) contacting and interviewing high school dropouts; and (5) analyzing the resulting data. Teachers interviewed 46 dropouts, and high school students were recruited for peer counseling services. Among the factors that were discovered to be important in the decision to drop out of school were teacher-student relationships, teacher attitudes, and the seeming irrelevance of schooling for Native Americans. It was also revealed  that a large majority of the dropouts regretted their action. In evaluating the value of empirical research to the professional development of teachers, it can be seen that although participation can equip teachers with a valuable heuristic for viewing teaching, process activities characterizing the various phases of research (literature review, hypothesis formation, empirical test) are not unique to research and that the teaching act itself includes the same activities and phases. Teachers, using the body of knowledge they have acquired in their training, continually formulate hypotheses of actions that will improve learning in their students and empirically test their theories in the classroom.

The questionnaire asked graduates to provide information on: (1) basic demographic data; (2) graduates' feelings and evaluation of their preservice undergraduate teacher education program; and (3) problems and experiences faced during the first year of teaching. The questionnaire also allowed for the collection of data on both recent graduates who are teaching and those who hold non-teaching positions. The second phase of the study contacted 1980-81 graduates who were in their second  year of teaching. For the last part of the study, two beginning teachers were observed and interviewed.In this three-section report (one section for each of the research methodologies used), data are displayed in tabular form. A summary and analysis of responses conclude each of the three sections. A case study is presented of the two teachers who were observed and interviewed.

Since teacher education institutions have historically had the responsibility for preparing educators for elementary and secondary schools, they must now take the responsibility for preparing educators for business, industry, government, human services, and other diverse educational settings. Women and senior citizens can also benefit from training in teaching skills tailored to their specific needs and interests. The human service educator is a new role being conceived for teachers, implying change, redefinition, and creativity in response to adult education needs. To address the needs of the human service educator, teacher education institutions must adapt and, in many cases, reform their  curriculum focus. These programs are already being offered in a growing number of universities to meet the needs of three groups of educators: (1) teachers seeking alternative teaching careers; (2) preservice teachers seeking positions in nonschool settings; and (3) professionals already teaching in nonschool settings.

        "description":"Two ninth-grade classrooms and the dynamics between the social organization of the classroom and the teaching of subject matter were studied. A general mathematics and a social studies class, both geared for the academically deficient, were observed during one academic year. Observations focused on student and teacher behavior in the two classes and on the events, both social and academic, to which students and teachers reacted. The two teachers differed in their goals, expectations, and classroom organizational structures. The mathematics teacher's goals focused on the students' general knowledge and attitudes about the specific subject matter, while the social studies teacher's goals were oriented toward general skills that were applicable to most subjects. The social studies  teacher viewed the students' learning problems and limitations as &quot;end-point factors&quot;--factors that prohibited the teacher from teaching or focusing more on subject matter. The mathematics teacher treated these problems and limitations as &quot;beginning-points&quot;--the place to begin planning and instruction. The mathematics teacher supported students as he worked directly with them, and he encouraged them to attempt higher level tasks. The social studies teacher attempted to gain student cooperation and participation by reducing the level of risk in any task through giving answers to the students and making classroom work easy. The differing goals and expectations of the teachers influenced their choices and the depth to which they could present subject matter. The relative positions of the  subject matter and the social organization in the two classrooms affected the students' opportunities to learn. (JD)",

        "description":"Ways in which five teacher education program development teams used codified knowledge in educational literature were examined. Questions guiding the research included: (1) To what extent was educational literature considered during the deliberations of the program development teams? (2) What was the relationship between discussions of educational literature and discussions of the content or organization of the proposed teacher education programs? and (3) To what extent did educational literature seem useful in responding to the expressed needs of the development team members? The documents examined contained meeting minutes of five development teams during a 1-year period. Findings included: (1) Empirical research results were mentioned in less than 1 percent of the recorded  discussions in any group; (2) Philosophical statements were virtually unmentioned in the minutes of two groups but were extensively discussed over a 2-month period in the deliberations of a team focusing on academic learning; (3) Team members rarely asked questions that could be answered by appeal to research or philosophical literature (most questions concerned needs for specific information, such as certification requirements or student enrollment figures); and (4) Discussion of codified knowledge was rarely associated with discussions of the content or organization of instruction. When such associations did occur, they usually concerned knowledge in the information category. (Author/JD)",

These standards represent duly filed rules and regulations under which the state superintendent of education, in consultation with the state teacher certification board, meet the statutory responsibility to recognize teacher education institutions. It is noted that the standards fall into two broad categories; (1) Standards 1-4, 11, and 12 determine the adequacy of the institution's commitments to teach education and the general results of these commitments; and (2) standards 5-10 test the institution's capacity to conduct programs in a fashion that ensures equitable and fair treatment of applicants and candidates. Eleven criteria used to approve Illinois teacher education  programs are also outlined, and descriptions of the rationales and intent of each criterion are provided. Suggestions are made on kinds of evidence institutions should present to demonstrate that a program complies with each criterion.

The experience of the Hampshire Educational Collaborative Inservice Program (Northampton, Massachusetts) is used as an example. The gradual accumulation of data on resource people and organizations for inservice teacher education is recounted, leading to the decision to put the information in a computerized retrieval system. Factors involved in designing the resource system, such as staff and user goals, information categories, and legal implications, are reviewed. An account of the frustrations of an equipment change and of the resulting  reexamination of goals and categories emphasizes the importance of flexibility and detailed planning. Data collection, coding, and entry are addressed along with publicity for the ongoing system. Appendices contain the first and revised sets of user instructions, sample printouts from the computer program, and a list of the subject categories stored in the database. (FG)",

        "description":"This manual is designed for the training of inservice facilitator teams, which include regular and special education teachers, administrators, and other school district staff. Inservice facilitator teams are defined as teams which develop inservice programs for their school system. Each chapter focuses on a specific skill for the training teams; the importance of each skill and alternative activities for teaching the skill are described. Each chapter also describes the continuing support network that is essential to keeping the teams functioning successfully. Chapter 1 presents an overview of the functions and responsibilities of inservice facilitator teams and information on how to use the manual. In chapter 2, there is a description of the strategies to be used in setting up a  team, selecting participants, the modeling of team skills by the training staff, and the structured interaction of team members. In the third chapter, techniques are discussed that may be used to help teams share their perceptions of their school system and establish achievable goals. Chapter 4 describes several ways to introduce needs assessment techniques. The fifth chapter offers descriptions of activities that are used to help teams develop resource management skills. Strategies for managing workshops are presented in the sixth chapter. Chapter 7 includes activities which can be used throughout the workshop to enhance communication skills. The eighth chapter is devoted to a discussion of how to develop and maintain political support. The final chapter presents a review of the work of  the training staff and articulates the theoretical basis for a successful inservice program. (JD)",

        "description":"As socially supported institutions, schools must take their share of the responsibility for developing a comprehensive curriculum about family life and sexuality education. Schools have the opportunity to integrate sound sexual information, understanding of attitudes, and the development of knowledge related to sexual matters along with instruction students receive in other areas. A concern of school administrators and teachers is opposition from community action groups, some of which may be organized outside the community and involve relatively few actual community members. Parents rightfully have the primary responsibility and opportunity for assisting their children in the development of positive health practices, attitudes, and values including those connected with human  sexuality. While the majority of parents feel that sex education is important for their children, less than 20 percent of parents actually take an active role in educating their children. The ideal in formal school sexuality education programs is to have the school working in a partnership with parents in providing accurate and honest sexuality education. However, parents will not understand the school's intentions of partnership unless the school makes them aware of it and works with them. Sexuality education can realistically be regarded as a valid educational pursuit which holds the promise of making significant contributions. It can add not only to the solution of important social problems but also to the enrichment of individual personal lives. (JD)",

Thirty percent (398) of the teachers contacted participated in the study, which consisted of a 65-item questionnaire, the Teacher Attitudes Survey, adapted from the Maslach Burnout Inventory. The most satisfactory experiences for the teachers were those that made them feel sensitive to and involved with their students and committed to and competent in their jobs. Relationships with their colleagues, families, and friends also were important. Sources of stress were excessive paperwork, unsuccessful administrative meetings, and lack of advancement opportunities. Three major factors emerged as a result of factor analysis with  varimax rotations: (1) general feelings of burnout; (2) commitment to the teaching profession; and (3) working closely with students. Few significant subgroup differences were apparent among the teachers. The results of the survey are significant, although limited by the location of the schools, the representative nature of the sample, and the lack of longitudinal data. (FG)",

SITIP was intended to provide training and technical support to all local education agencies (LEA's) during the adoption and implementation of innovative instructional processes. This report on the SITIP program contains eight chapters, the first of which is an introduction to the program. Chapter 2 of this report describes the stages and purposes of SITIP along with the topics, conferences, and institute conducted. Four topics were chosen for consideration in these meetings: (1) mastery learning; (2) student team learning; (3) management and use of  instructional time; (4) and processes for instructional improvement. Chapter 3 summarizes an overview of an independent evaluation of the SITIP program. Included in the evaluation are questions addressed, measures and methods of data collection, data sources, data analysis, and reporting procedures. Chapter 4 contains a discussion of the three kinds of training events organized by the SITIP program: awareness conferences, summer institutes, and follow-up sessions. Each type of training event is described, and data are provided indicating attendance patterns and participant concerns and reactions. In the fifth chapter, a description is given of plans developed by participating LEA's for implementation of innovations and the technical assistance needs. Chapter 6 describes local  implementation efforts concerning the four central conferences and institutes topics. The seventh chapter reports on technical assistance provided by the Maryland State Department of Education in support of local implementation of the four SITIP topics. The final chapter reviews SITIP activity areas and synthesizes major findings from the program. This report contains 83 tables presenting information on the SITIP program. (JD)",

With increased parental involvement in the day-to-day operation of the schools and greater parental awareness of the educational process, it becomes apparent that educators need to be prepared to respond to renewed parental interest in the education of their children. From both an ethical and a legal perspective, communication between parents and teachers is imperative. However, inappropriate procedures and inadequate skills and knowledge can create greater problems than may have existed before the meeting. This publication is intended to help teachers to improve their parent-teacher conferencing skills. First, it examines the  historical background and research relating to parent-teacher conferences. Then, it suggests effective ways for teachers to improve their communication skills with parents and to involve parents in the educational, personal, and social development of their children. The core elements of effective conferencing--listening, perceiving, attending, responding, and initiating--are identified and discussed. A list of 78 references is appended. (JD)",

        "description":"This monograph presents descriptions of six extensively researched and widely used cooperative learning methods and discusses research on the effects of cooperative learning. The term &quot;cooperative learning&quot; refers to instructional methods in which students of all levels of performance work together in small groups toward a common goal. The essential feature of cooperative learning is that the success of one student helps other students to be successful. The six methods are: (1) Student Teams Achievement Divisions (STAD); (2) Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT); (3) Team-Assisted Individualization (TAI); (4) Jigsaw; (5) Learning Together; and (6) Group Investigation. Some methods are highly structured, with well-specified group tasks and group rewards, while others give more autonomy to  students and have fewer specified group rewards. Some of these methods are used almost exclusively in social studies, and one is designed only for mathematics. Several can be used in all subject areas. All grade levels are represented. A case study of a junior high school student experiencing student team learning methods is presented, illustrating how team learning methods are used and where they are most effective. Reports are presented on research studies that examined the various methods of implementing student team cooperative learning. Their impact on academic achievement, intergroup relations, mainstreaming, and student self-esteem is discussed. The overall conclusion drawn from this research was that, when the classroom is structured so that students can work cooperatively on  learning tasks, students benefit academically as well as socially. A 58-item bibliography is appended. (JD)",

The study used experienced teachers to aid in adapting and testing classroom techniques for helping low-achieving students to become more self-regulated learners. Instruments were developed to measure student self-report of various cognitive learning strategies and interpretations (mental planning, attributions, self-efficacy, etc.). A 6-week application of the classroom techniques with low socioeconomic status black high-school students showed low overall use of cognitive learning strategies, large differences in cognitive self-report between classes, and complex pre- and post-changes  alternately favoring the treatment and control groups. Results are clouded by differences in teacher implementation and similarities between strategies used by treatment and control teachers. (Author)",

The research project was designed to develop a unified framework for the analysis of audiotaped discourse samples elicited from Spanish/English bilingual students that is directly applicable to assessing oral language proficiency. The framework for analysis integrated and applied recent research in a variety of fields including sociolinguistics, language acquisition, developmental pragmatics, the ethnography of communication and the philosophy of language. The paper summarizes information about the linguistic features, interactional communicative strategies, and discourse structures used by  kindergarten through grade five students in conversation with an adult interlocutor and when telling narratives from wordless books. Criteria distinguishing communicative strategies used by students displaying a range of proficiency from high to low are described in terms of multiple co-occurring variables across lexical, clause, prosodic and discourse levels. As elicitors' discourse styles strongly influenced the complexity and coherence of language produced by students, criteria were developed to describe and evaluate the quality of the elicitation process. Problems and recommendations in the application of a sociolinguistic discourse analysis approach to language proficiency assessment in school districts is discussed. (Author)",

Observational measures were developed for field dependence-independence, as well as for low- and high conceptual level to determine their ecological validity. They were designed to form an inferential hierarchy for each of the styles, completing the multitrait-multimethod matrix. Teacher rating scales, global measures, and behavior check lists were developed. Subjects were six female and six male adult student prison inmates (mean age = 31.6, mean grade level = 11). Observations were made by viewing a 40-minute videotape of students engaged in classroom discussion and problem solving activities. The reflection-impulsivity  style construct emerged as an ecologically valid and parsimonious descriptor of a component of student behavior. The unusually high rank-order correlations obtained and the patterns which emerged from the matrix suggest justification for use, although results in terms of correlations must be viewed as tenuous in view of the small number of subjects involved.

Many of the variables were generic to any type of organization. The model and variables were: PC = f(S, P, PxS, RI). PC represents psychological climate and describes the individuals' perception of his or her organization; S represents the situation; P is for personal characteristics; RI signifies the reciprocal interaction that occurs when the individual's perception of the climate influences S, P, or PxS. A distinction is made between the individual's perception of organizational attributes (PC) and the composite climate,  which can be represented by summing the individual PC's. The measure developed to assess the variables was entitled the School Ecology Survey. Items for the survey were drawn from the Organizational Climate Questionnaire, DDAE/CRITERIA, Building Questionnaire, Trouble Shooting Checklist, and School Climate Questionnaire. The authors used the School Ecology Survey to assess the psychological climate in the district and school surveys they conducted. (DWH)",

A mini-model of culture change, based on dimensions present in acculturation literature, is explored. The study applied dimensions of the model to events in one specific school, as a smaller unit of culture in the process of implementing the curriculum innovation. The study considered the relevance of the model to methodology and research on school change. An acculturative perspective allows for some prediction in  terms of events and is valuable in research for providing an overview of the change process.

The correlation coefficient (times 100) is shown to be the percentage of improvement of using the selection test over what would happen on the average if the test were not used. A simple formula is developed for approximating the probability that selection by chance would yield an entering class as able or abler than a class selected with the help of a valid predictor. It is further shown that, for reasonably sized colleges and with reasonable assumptions, selection using even small correlations will almost certainly result in an entering class that would earn higher criterion scores than would occur without the selection test.

It provides plausible composition and decomposition rules as well as a plausible measure of causal strength.

Multivariate analyses of variance were used to investigate the statistical analyses of evaluation data. It was found that: departments differed significantly on overall ratings of instruction; class size and level of instruction affected all overall ratings except those of instructor effectiveness; the effect of class size and level of instruction varied dramatically across departments; and ratings of teaching skills were different across departments, levels of instruction, and class sizes (within departments these relationships varied further). The interest/atmosphere factor was the best predictor of overall ratings of instruction. When this relationship was examined in  different subgroupings, it was found that lower level students in general placed more value on organization and clarity. It is possible to pinpoint courses which are generally rated lower or higher than others, and this does not seem to be dependent on level: both the highest and the lowest ratings were most often received by level 4 courses. The generation of questions which could be answered from analyses of questionnaire data is also discussed. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"The current state of usage of regression models in analysis of variance (ANOVA) designs is empirically examined, and examples of several statistical errors made in usage are presented. The assumptions of the general linear model are that all predictors are known without error of measurement and are fixed with no replication or sample variation; in the population, errors are normally distributed independently with variance, and errors are independent of all predictors. The rules for construction of the ANOVA allow the expected mean squares to hold just as if the levels of each factor had been randomly sampled. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) combines the elements of regression analysis with design, albeit in a restricted manner. The homogeneity of regression coefficients is a  parameter restriction from the design view point. The regression weight associated with a given covariate level is discussed. Most regression approaches to ANOVA and ANCOVA assume a fixed factor model under all design specifications. A major oversight of expected mean squares has contributed to the current lack of concern for the level of generalizability warranted from the design specification. Aptitude treatment interaction models are examined. (Author/CM)",

The instrument is also meant to measure attitudes toward blindness for blind persons, rehabilitation workers, and a &quot;naive&quot; group without contact with the blind. A method of assessing model fit by a Rasch Rating Scale Model was used to make group comparisons for any chosen demographic stratification without re-calibration for every set of comparisons. A conventional analysis of group and item distribution was undertaken, with an alternative analysis further recognizing that group differences must also exist within the residuals from the original overall analysis. The residuals resulted from the difference between observed  and modeled responses, and were scaled to yield a standardized residual. The analysis calibrated items to uncover peculiar individual response patterns from a combined sample of workers and blind persons, facilitating the identification of specific rehabilitation needs. Estimate plot, matrix techniques and graphs for comparing group residuals, and the uses of negative residual distributions in the calibrations are described. (CM)",

Thirty graduate teaching assistants who participated in a workshop on improving lecturing skills significantly improved their scores on specific lecturing behaviors that were taught in the workshop when videotapes of their teaching were evaluated by experts. A group of 18 undergraduate students then assessed these same videotapes giving an overall rating of the instructor and a rating of the instructor's warmth. An analysis of the data generated the conclusion that improvement on the part of instructors in specific areas is not likely to affect their global ratings. Additionally, student perceptions of  an instructor's warmth play a large part in determining the overall rating the students give the instructor, whereas, specific ratings do not seem to account for the overall global rating. The data appear to support the idea that, while specific skills can be changed through intervention, the overall impressions that students have of their instructors do not necessarily improve.

The sample of 950 students was from Pima County, Arizona. One approach involved the comparison of the psychometric indices of internal consistency reliability, which were reasonably high and comparable for the four groups; the rank order correlations of item difficulty, which were quite high and comparable for the four groups; and the rank order correlations of the differences in the difficulty of adjacent items, which were less comparable for Native American Papagos suggesting possible items by group interactions. A second approach involved the utilization of  transformed item difficulties and a quantitative method of outlier analysis to identify specific items as biased (i.e., as manifesting an item by group interaction). Results were not interpreted as evidence of cultural bias, however, since the possible confounding effects of socioeconomic status and overall ability were not controlled. Further, the items identified did not appear to reflect aspects of the assumption of &quot;interference&quot; implicit in the notion of cultural bias. (Author/PN)",

The discriminant validity of these three constructs was studied. Uninformed students were told about a mathematics test in a lesson just prior to administration. They were compared to informed students who were advised a week in advance of the test administration. The findings supported the existence of worry and emotionality as response factors separate from fear of failure. Fear of failure is concerned with the individual's tendency to anticipate negative effects in achievement situations. Worry is a cognitive concern, characterized by self-focusing. Emotionality refers to the tendency of experiencing actual autonomic arousal and  unpleasant states such as nervousness and tension. The interfering effects of fear of failure and emotionality on test performance were weakened in the informed condition; impact of the worry factor was most evident in the informed condition. The individual's performance expectancy is related to worry and less strongly to emotionality. The results of the study suggested that common testing procedures activate fear of failure, emotionality, and worry. Performance decrements seem most closely related to the cognitively oriented worry factor. (DWH)",

Non-hierarchical models suggested by Thurstone and Guilford are reviewed, and it is concluded that these models fail to give a theoretically and practically useful representation of the organization of human abilities. Hierarchical models proposed by Vernon and Cattell-Horn are compared, and it is concluded that the difference between these models may be more apparent than real. It is also concluded that it may be possible to construct a unified hierarchical model, which includes ability dimensions of at least three different levels of generality. This hypothesized model is tested in two empirical studies, which both yield support for the model.  Implications of the model for testing are discussed and it is concluded that while the model is compatible with much established testing practice, it goes beyond this by allowing hierarchically differentiated assessments. Included is a demonstration of how the model may be used in research on aptitude-treatment interactions, by simultaneous analysis of factors at different levels of generality in structural equation models.

A logic for conducting stepwise canonical correlation analysis based upon evaluation of canonical communality coefficients is presented. The coefficients indicate how much of a variable's variance is reproducible from the canonical solution. Variables with the smallest communality coefficients may be deleted in a stepwise procedure as a direct analoque to stepwise backward multiple regression analysis. A heuristic demonstration of the technique involving two criterion variables and five predictor variables in a 7 by 7  correlation matrix is presented.

It is also suggested that contemporary analytic practice reflects some improvements over more traditional practice. Researchers are increasingly investigating multivariate problems with multivariate methods.

The achievement items and 241 background variables were reduced through clustering techniques to composites: academic orientation; comfort/confidence about mathematics; community characteristics; effort in mathematics; extracurricular activities; individual program characteristics; locus of control; mathematics courses taken; personal demographics; school program variables; self esteem; and television watched. Causal models relating achievement to background found some relationship  between the availability of specialized equipment, specifically computers, and student interest as evidenced by the number and level of mathematics courses taken by students with similar academic orientation and background. After these variables were controlled, internal locus of control and greater levels of mathematics confidence were significant predictors of achievement. Although related to attitudinal measures, predictors were generally the same for both sexes. Predictor patterns were generally similar with respect to race but large differences in achievement levels were not explained by the variables.

In each of three National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) mathematics subtopics, Reiser's group-effects latent trait model was fitted to the proportions of correct response to items as observed in the cells of a design. Item parameters and contrasts among demographic groups were estimated in each of four data sets: 1972-73 and 1977-78 data for 13-year-olds and 17-year-olds. Based on items common to two or more data sets, results were linked across ages and over time in each subtopic. Item parameters and group averages were obtained on scales common across ages and years.  Successful calibration and linking in all subtopics demonstrates the feasibility of applying item-response methods to sparse sampling designs. However, scaling must be accomplished within fairly narrowly-defined skill areas, such as the NAEP subtopics, if the integrity of scales is to be maintained. Item response scaling of NAEP test booklets as a whole is discouraged. Primary type of information provided by the report: Results (Secondary Analysis). (Author/CM)",

The design provides a rigorous justification for extending survey results to the entire U.S. target population. Developments in the analysis of data from complex surveys which provide a straightforward method for taking account of the sample design through proper estimation of subpopulation estimates and their covariance matrix are reviewed. Relationships among subpopulations are then evaluated via large sample Wald statistics assumed to be asymptotically distributed as central chi-squared random variables. While these methods provide a mechanism for analyzing NAEP data, the computer software required to properly estimate  sample design-based covariance matrices is not generally available to NAEP data users. Design effect methods for adjusting test statistics obtained from standard statistical methods which implicitly assume simple random sampling from an infinite population are presented with several new decompositions obtained which display the effects of multistage clustering, stratification, and unequal weighting on the covariance matrix. A comparison of asymptotically valid sample design-based chi-squared tests versus analogous simple random sampling tests and design effect adjusted tests is given. Design effect adjustments on NAEP mathematics data are shown. Primary type of information provided by the report: Procedures (Sampling); Results (Secondary Analysis). (Author/CM)",

Skills were assumed to be intermediate between objectives and report topics, such as &quot;solving quadratic equations,&quot; and were treated as dichotomous - an examinee either did or did not possess the skill.

At age 17, six exercise parts of apparently common skills were drawn from each of six booklets. Item clusters which  could be collapsed and organized hierarchically were indicated by the latent classes. For each cluster, all analyses including it were examined together, yielding separate estimates of the proportion of examinees able to solve items in that cluster. The distributions of these estimates were an indication of the cluster's conformity to the assumption of skill dichotomies. Student mathematics skills at each age level are reported.

Although these questions were not specifically designed to be used in scales, many of the test packages contained five or more such attitudinal questions. Seven test booklets from 1977-78 for ages 9, 13 and 17 and all four test packages from the 1975-76 assessment were examined to derive reliable, valid and useful affective scales. The affective items were examined individually and as potential scales. The dimensionality of each item set was determined and the  derived dimensions and composite item sets were analyzed for internal consistency. A canonical analysis of the 1977-78, age 17 data evaluated the predictive power of the attitudinal dimensions; at least one scale of adequate internal consistency was found in each test package. At least one reliable scale was found in three of the four age 13 packages. The NAEP mathematics data base was found to be potentially rich for research on affective constructs.

Such item sets have been shown to be valid and useful for assessing mathematical problem solving. For the constructed item pool, a recently developed taxonomy based on the structure of the observed learning outcome (SOLO) was used as the basis for the development of the superitems. Four questions were written for each problem situation to assess five levels  of reasoning concerning the situation. The superitems were administered in separate group tests to 300 students of 9, 11, 13, and 17 years of age. The 38 items in the final batteries were mathematically correct and were related to the levels of reasoning in the SOLO Taxonomy.

Each superitem includes a mathematical situation and a structured set of questions about that situation. The questions were based on Collis and Biggs' recently-developed taxonomy on the structure of the observed learning outcomes (SOLO). The assumption underlying this report is that the response patterns of students to the superitems would be interpretable. To judge interpretability, three primary questions about the response patterns were raised. For each question the data strongly support the validity of the construct. The response patterns of the majority of  items matched the assumed latent hierarchical and cumulative cognitive dimension. The question profiles for student clusters were interpreted in terms of developmental base stages and the spiral notions of equilibration. These findings give support to the validity of the sequence of SOLO levels. The SOLO interpretation of responses appears useful for educators and researchers in describing the level of reasoning on school related tasks. Item analyses tables are appended. (Author/PN)",

Approaches for addressing goodness of fit were organized into three categories: Checks on model assumptions, expected features, and additional model predictions. Within the categories, several new methods were also advanced and several older methods which were not in common use for determining item response model-data fit were described. Many of these methods were then used to determine the fit of the one- and three-parameter models to six NAEP mathematics booklets (three booklets for 9-year-olds and three booklets for 13-year-olds) in the 1977-78 assessment. There were some inconsistent  findings but it did appear that the three-parameter model provided an excellent fit to the data sets whereas the one-parameter model did not. When a bank of content valid and technically sound test items is available, and goodness of fit studies reveal a high match between the chosen item response model and the test data, item response models may be useful to NAEP in test development, detection of biased items, score reporting, equating test forms and levels, item banking, and other applications as well.

It is important to both instructional and assessment specialists to develop measures to match the skills being tested.

The major sources of evidence include interviews with APC members and National Institute of Education (NIE) staff, minutes of APC meetings and historical documents on NAEP, statutes, and field research on use of NAEP. Several options for change are suggested that involve minimal disruptions of current operations: (a) the categories of APC membership specified by law should include an expert in statistical research policy; (b) the APC should have direct, routine access to a senior NIE executive who is responsible for liaison with NAEP and for articulating and explaining NIE's agenda; (c) a formal  mechanism for assuring that APC members are aware of new issues and ideas, apart from those provided by NAEP and NIE, needs to be created; and (d) the tension between NIE's research mission and the NAEP's traditional data collection mission needs to be resolved. Several options for a major change include those that focus more heavily on (a) research, (b) cooperative statistical systems and research, and (c) states. (Author/PN)",

        "description":"The reversal of subject and predicate terms in quantified, categorical expressions was studied as an operation that is potentially important in issues of representation and comprehension of quantified relations. In two experiments students were asked to evaluate the relation between two quantified expressions. The salience of reversal in the verification of expressions was shown in the first experiment, but quantifier encoding was not flawless. The second experiment examined whether the reversals could be blocked by simple semantic/syntactic manipulation. Blocking was shown to interact meaningfully both with quantifier type and the combined effect of quantifier and conqruity. A three-stage model for the observed latencies was developed, based on the experimental results.  Verification profiles showed that students make errors which are attributed to faulty encoding, without discriminating between symmetrical and proper inclusion relations. Alternately, the encoding might be weakly specified. In this way constraints upon subject-predicate order are minimal and low priority, except where the semantic and syntactic aspects of relations show significant asymmetries. (CM)",

NAEP provides time series data on student achievement within certain academic areas by age and geographic region. Its main purpose is informational, rather than diagnostic. Several objectives are recommended to insulate NAEP's governance from undue federal control. These include freedom from transient political influence, incorporation of provisions to insure continuity and institutional memory, and a reflection of the needs of NAEP's clients. These criteria would permit federal funding, while controlling federal temptation to use NAEP as a tool of federal interests. The structure of a governing board is described which would be  composed of local, state, and federal policymakers. NAEP should also establish a standing technical advisory board composed of recognized authorities in the field to assure the highest levels of technical competence. The governance structure as described would provide reasonable assurance of relevance and high quality. (DWH)",

Selected aspects of this field are reviewed. These include perceptual salience, causal attributions, and indirect ability communications. Their pertinence to the educational process is examined. Mainstreaming gives rise to a set of often unnoticed consequences that are anticipated and partially explained by cognitive social psychologists. The perceived causes of achievement outcomes, the antecedents that influence causal judgments, and some of the consequences of attributional beliefs are examined. Teachers unintentionally use indirect communications which carry low ability messages to students. The  following apparently positive actions could have negative consequences for self-esteem: praise for success at an easy task, excessive help especially when it is not sought, and expressions of pity for failure. Psychologists interested in self-perception believe that a specified praise/blame pattern, helping, and sympathy may lower self-perception of ability. Positive actions which may negatively influence self-perception of ability are frequently expressed toward the handicapped, ethnic minorities, and females. The report attempts to illustrate the connection between person perception and education. (DWH)",

Suggestions include cost reduction via assessment schedule cutbacks and re-use of released NAEP exercises; and a shift from federal to private funding by selling NAEP exercises with interpretative materials to schools or individuals. A major unresolved question concerns the validity of inferences which can be drawn from the aggregated results. NAEP validation procedures constitute content validation. However, content validation does not necessarily constitute validity evidence at all, if validity evidence must bear on the interpretations that are warranted on the basis of test or assessment results. This means that more work  needs to be done on the construct validation of the NAEP results as they are now commonly interpreted, i.e., with results aggregated across exercises. NAEP needs to become more clear in reporting aggregate results by specifying the facets of variance over which it is, and is not, attempting to generalize. Two strategies are suggested for the utility of NAEP results: developing norms for NAEP exercises, and making NAEP exercises and data more readily available to independent investigators. (PN)",

Increased involvement was seen as a signal of change in teacher-parent interaction and a larger professional role for teachers. The three study areas were a survey of teachers regarding parent involvement in elementary schools; parent education based on parent models of child socialization; and a survey of elementary school principals regarding their attitudes toward parent involvement issues. Teachers supported the need for training to work with parents, and suggested specific competencies in communication and interpretation of educational practices to parents of diverse  backgrounds. Varied class and ethnic groups of parents were studied regarding their beliefs and attitudes toward child rearing. Lay parent models of child socialization were identified to prepare guidelines for parent education programming. School principals preferred first hand experience with parents, teachers and other educators to better prepare teachers for parent involvement. Parent participation and training in home learning for children were recommended. (CM)",

Emphasis is on the effects upon California's children's services of Proposition 13, a tax relief initiative limiting property taxes in that State. Data from an Oakland, California, survey are presented to provide background on the characteristics of children who use such services as parks, museums, libraries, and zoos, and on the frequency of service use. This is followed by a description of the political and economic contexts of services provision, including decision making processes and financial considerations. It is emphasized that, while public support of Proposition 13 was not a mandate to reduce or eliminate children's  services, the resulting reduction in government revenues had that adverse effect. County and local government responses to the need for austerity in a period of financial crisis (such as closing of service site, staff reductions, user fees, and private sponsorship), and the inadequate consequences of these responses for different children, are described. In conclusion, the future of children's services is considered. (Author/MJL)",

Advances have occurred in systematizing curriculum development, producing more materials, developing teacher competencies, and generating greater interest in bilingual education. However, preservice education has prepared few teachers to work with minority students and in bilingual programs. Furthermore, teacher education has not addressed the prevailing tendency, reflected even in national policy and legislation, to view bilingual education programs as remedies for the problems of non-English speakers, and to emphasize language more than culture in such programs. Redirecting bilingual education requires that: (1) programs  integrate culture and history into the curriculum, thus reflecting the aims of parents who initially called for bilingual education for their children; (2) bilingual education not be identified with compensatory education, which assumes that speaking a language other than English is a limitation; (3) teacher education emphasize field training, humanistic approaches, the teacher's role as change agent, and training of paraprofessionals; (4) curriculum development consider the many factors surrounding schooling and students' lives; and (5) research focus on elements leading to quality and effectiveness in bilingual education.

The study was prompted by the concern expressed in previous studies that translated and adapted intelligence tests, which have been standardized primarily with children of one culture, do not account for cultural differences and therefore may not reflect the actual intellectual capacity of children of other cultures. From the test results, the researcher computed coefficients of reliability; item difficulty indices; item and subtest correlations; and mean scores for verbal intelligence, performance intelligence, and full intelligence. Findings of higher performance over verbal scores were similar to findings of previous  studies. The mean intelligence quotient was 109.9. Comparatively, an earlier study, which also tried out the WISC translation among Puerto Ricans, yielded a mean score of 88.01, 12 points below the American mean. The results of the present study suggest that the WISC is appropriate for measuring intelligence among Puerto Rican children. (Author/MJL)",

Chapter 1 compares the rate of agricultural land loss from 1900 to 1978 among blacks and whites. Chapter 2 outlines historical conditions, such as racism, lack of institutional economic support, and possession of only marginal landholdings, that contributed to black land loss in the past. Chapter 3 discusses how these historical factors, together with current economic practices that favor large farm operations, have placed black farmers in a disadvantaged, noncompetitive position which threatens their occupational survival. Chapter 4 reviews programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's)  Farmers' Home Administration (FmHA) to help black farm operators to keep their land, and analyzes data on black participation in these programs in 1981. Chapter 5 examines USDA's civil rights enforcement activities and assesses their impact on FmHA's loan services to minorities. It is suggested that FmHA's potential to help farmers to work on their land has not been realized because of racial discrimination that civil rights enforcement in USDA does not effectively address. Recommendations for improving this situation are presented. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"This is a collection of papers and research reports presented at a conference that focused on mental health issues and on individual, organizational, and community competence in relation to institutional racism. The report is divided into five sections. Section 1 discusses theoretical models of racism and community competence (community effectiveness in providing support systems for the physical and psychosocial needs ot its members). Section 2 emphasizes the importance of considering cultural pluralism in examining racism, provides a basis for understanding the cultural development and problems of minority groups, and suggests ways in which human services may serve diverse populations. Section 3 explores how forms of institutional racism vary in different settings, such as  business, education, mental health, and the community as a whole, and suggests what might be done to reduce racism in particular contexts. Section 4 describes different approaches and instruments for measuring racism. Finally, section 5 presents various interventions for reducing racism in organizations, in education, and in the community. (Author/MJL)",

It consists of seven components from which the task force analyzed responses. Within each of these sections, the analysis outlines points of consensus; points of controversy; and points of differences between school boards, colleges, and universities. The seven categories are definition and philosophy, adult basic education, coordination (local and provincial coordination and the roles of institutions), infrastructure (training of adult educators, provision of counseling and information services, information for future planning, and research), access to continuing education (TV Ontario, correspondence education,  and distance education), legislation and funding, and francophone response. A list of points raised by respondents and not covered elsewhere in the report is also provided. Appendixes, amounting to approximately one-half of the report, include a distribution list of the discussion paper; a list of respondents; a review of selected literature relating to continuing education, entitled &quot;Historical and Developmental Trends in Continuing Education&quot;; and a copy of the response form.

        "description":"The Minnesota Area Health Education Center programs (AHEC) from 1972-81 improved health care in rural Minnesota areas by providing 2,200 health-professional students and resident physicians with off-campus courses and clinical training. Other programs provided continuing education, patient education, quality assurance, and minority career recruitment. More than 3,000 participated in AHEC programs. A follow-up of 1,500 former participants and a survey of 400 AHEC-involved medical students and residents showed the following project impacts: (1) improved distribution of health professionals (to rural areas); (2) more primary care health professionals; (3) high-quality decentralized health-professional education; and (4) AHEC preceptorships during third and fourth years of medical  school being more influential than other AHEC-supported clinical training experiences in choice of specialty and desired practice location. Recommendations include flexible federal AHEC regulations that do not mandate decentralized training in community hospitals; a stable source of federal support for living expenses of students wishing to explore rural health-care practices; emphasis on off-campus AHEC preceptorships during third and fourth year medical school; provisions in future national and state AHEC evaluations for follow-up of former AHEC participants; control group designs; and greater dissemination and use of evaluation results.

        "description":"A participatory research study analyzed adult lifelong learning in voluntary association. Examined in the study were the associational environment for learning, learning leadership, learning goals and objectives, program content, and skill development. To obtain these data, researchers administered a mail questionnaire to a stratified random sample of 270 associations drawn from a universe of 3,050 Atlantic Canadian organizations. Based on data from 220 completed questionnaires, followup interviews, and field observations, researchers concluded that nonformal learning in voluntary association is dissimilar in both structure and content when compared to formal group learning. Because the teaching function is frequently exchanged among the learners with small-group skill practice  sessions, the hierarchical nature of teacher-student is minimized. Learning generally focuses on very specific behavioral change with less regard for a knowledge base and virtually no regard for a clarification of the value premises inherent in the behavior. Using data obtained during the survey, researchers constructed a model of adult associational learning. The model consisted of a taxonomy of environment, leadership process, objective, and skill development descriptors. Recommendations called for field testing the model and exploring the synergistic educational relationship between the learning leader and the learning member. (MN)",

The adult education field pioneered many approaches now advocated by specialists in program and project evaluation. Beginning in the 1920s and 1930s, United States agricultural extension specialists did extensive studies on farmer extension practices. In the 1950s and 1960s, international efforts began to build on some of the earlier agricultural extension concepts. Needs assessments, evaluation of adult education booklets, and evaluation of UNESCO adult education, literacy, and reading materials were all conducted. The UNESCO Experimental World Literacy Program  conducted 11 projects in the late 1960s to mid-1970s that had built-in evaluation systems. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the governing bodies of most international organizations stipulated more evaluative efforts to provide data on the impact of various organizational activities. Such evaluation efforts sensitized project and program personnel in international agencies and in national governments to the need for participatory evaluation specifically to improve projects and programs.

Findings are grouped into three categories: economic and social issues, improvement of the employment and training system, and problems of the hard to employ. Chapter 2 contains the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) research and development plan for FY 1982, organized under four broad focuses: labor market trends and impacts, labor and the economy, training, and program improvement. Chapter 3 summarizes major findings of program evaluation studies completed from  February 1980 through June 1981. The most significant new reports provide the first formal estimates of the net effects of CETA programs on participants' post-program earnings, and information on the post-program economic impact of the Job Corps program on its participants and that program's cost-benefit experience. Chapter 4 presents the ETA Evaluation Plan for FY 1982 with major emphases on effects of training programs, cost-effectiveness analyses, and new ETA initiatives.

Specifically, the study investigated the characteristics of the students who become involved in regular in-school programs and in the alternative HCL program, the differential program impact on the study groups, and empirical evidence supporting the implications of major theories of career development. Selected for the study population were 457 black youths who graduated from in-school programs and from the HCL Center. After examining data pertaining to the subjects' demographic characteristics,  aptitudes, school performance, last regular school curricula, and job requirements, researchers concluded that the HCL Center is serving a useful purpose inasmuch as its vocationally oriented training program has helped participants acquire the same aptitude levels as their peers from the regular schools. In addition, the HCL outreach program managed to graduate students whose early school records were very poor. However, in regard to job performance, the results are discouraging for both the regular school and HCL graduates. (MN)",

First, the OAI survey instrument was administered to 1,217 first-term airmen in 1973 and to 4,784 first-term airmen in 1975. Next, criteria consisting of concurrent statements about global job satisfaction, reenlistment intent and subsequent reenlistment behavior were regressed on responses to the 189 non-supervisory occupational attitude items of the OAI and a set of 53 biographical and job-related predictor variables. After cross-validating the OAI responses for each year against the three criteria from the other year, researchers concluded that the OAI was significantly related to global job  satisfaction, reenlistment intent, and actual reenlistment. Variance in the criteria was improved by 9 percent to 59 percent with the OAI over the amount achieved with biographical and job-related variables. Based on these findings, recommendations were made calling for use of the instrument in guiding management activities to improve job satisfaction in the enlisted force. (MN)",

        "description":"Without changes in Michigan's unemployment insurance law, the state's unemployment insurance debt will probably reach $3.8 billion by the end of 1985. Currently, Michigan's employers pay unemployment insurance tax rates that vary from 1 to 9 percent, depending upon the amount of benefits charged against their accounts. Beginning with the federal unemployment insurance payroll tax due for 1982 (payable January 1983) Michigan employers will have to pay an additional uniform penalty rate each year. Many employers who provide relatively stable employment opportunities object to sharing equally in the payment of past excess costs of other employers who have generated the debt. In addition, many employers in areas particularly hard-hit by unemployment feel that additional taxes would,  at this time, seriously hamper their recovery efforts. A number of changes in the existing state unemployment insurance program have also been suggested, including instituting a new employee tax, stiffening qualifying requirements for benefits, imposing a noncompensable waiting week, and freezing the maximum weekly benefit amount. While the burdens to be faced in dealing with Michigan's insolvency problem are considerable and painful to bear, failure to take some remedial action will probably increase the state's economic problems.

Using data from the young men's cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys, researchers examined the job training obtained by a sample of 1,525 young men between the years 1966 and 1976. Among the areas addressed were the following: the importance of informal on-the-job training, the ways in which those who receive no formal training acquire their skills, the comparative economic benefits of formal and informal training, and the existence of any significant racial differences in the training process and its outcomes. The study revealed that even in crafts occupations a substantial proportion of young men obtain their skills through informal methods. In fact, over 40 percent  of those holding crafts positions did not participate in skilled, manual training programs, and an additional 30 percent received some sort of on-the-job training. Formal training does, nevertheless, yield a substantial wage benefit for those who obtain it. Fewer black craftsmen received formal training than did their white counterparts. Furthermore, blacks were less apt to have apprenticeship or other formal training offered through employers. Recommendations called for continued support for training methods that compensate for blacks' low participation in apprenticeship programs. (MN)",

Before discussing the role of vocational education in easing the productivity crisis, it is necessary to understand the causes of the crisis. Included among these are rising energy prices; the segmentation of the American work force, by both geography and skills; high turnover due to lack of work readiness or to critical skill shortages in certain occupations; and the displacement of workers by automation. The solution to these problems lies in improved education and training. In response to the need for innovative and effective training techniques, the Control Data Corporation has developed a number of products and programs, including the following: (1) a competency-based computerized education  system called PLATO; (2) a program to help chronically unemployed youth find and keep jobs (entitled Fair Break); (3) a campaign to train and place disadvantaged people in skilled career positions; (4) a program called HOMEWORK that allows the disabled and/or homebound to work at home through a network of computer terminals; and (5) twenty-four Control Data Institutes that provide essential job training in the fields of computer programming and maintenance.

Ten observations on economics can be made as they relate to human resource development and the role of two-year institutions in that area. The poor national economic performance is connected to continued use of worn-out economic policies. People must be encouraged to be trained, not because they are poor, but because they are untapped human resources. More research is needed in the area of how to encourage greater investment in human resource development. Employment growth, currently concentrated in the service sector, must be shifted. Specific steps should be taken to alleviate the discrepancy between high unemployment and skilled worker  shortages. The cycle must be completed from new technology to reduced prices to higher quality in order to regain a competitive edge in the world market. New thinking about vocational education and vocational needs is required. Postsecondary institutions need to prepare to serve new types of students--adults with prior life experiences and work history. Urban extension programs are needed to address unique city problems. Finally, a national human resource development policy needs to be implemented through community and technical colleges. (Questions and answers are appended.) (YLB)",

        "description":"Vocational educators must look critically at the innovations and changing technology contributing to reindustrialization and must determine their role in training workers with skills necessary to obtain jobs in changing occupations. Included among the areas in which vocational educators must develop new programs are business and industry, energy production, agriculture, construction, industrial maintenance, electronic communications, and health care and support services. As the federal role in vocational education diminishes, vocational education must seek new national leadership. While it is clear that changes will be seen in vocational leadership, it is difficult to predict the source or direction of the change. One thing that can be predicted, however, is the fact that in the  future vocational students will be older and will have greater aptitudes and abilities. In addition, increasing numbers of women and handicapped people will enter the ranks of vocational students. Increased demands for more highly skilled workers will increase the need for relevant competency-based vocational instruction. Consequently, vocational administrators must do more to relate their programs to the training needs of business and industry. Furthermore, vocational educators must turn to research to find more efficient delivery systems and must give more consideration to long-range implications in their planning efforts. (MN)",

        "description":"Relationships need to be built between the military training system and vocational education. Vocational education, or specialized skill training as the military terms it, provides the skills and knowledge needed in specific military occupations. It has two parts--initial training and progression training. A process called Instructional Systems Development ensures that training is consistent with job requirements. Because of the time required in the process, shortcuts have often been taken to speed up the process and mistakes in the development of some training systems have been made. Corrective action has two forms: lengthening of formal school training and more classroom instruction at or near the job site. Other trends in training include development and use of simulators and  simulation technology and experimentation with computer technology and video technologies. One way to broaden the military's partnership with vocational education is through cooperation between the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Education. The DOD has provided training packages to education for conversion to high school curricula for vocational and technical schools. There is interest in vocational education assistance in recruitment, military training, and training for civilians for defense-related industries. The DOD also needs information about the capacity of industries to gear up for defense production. (Questions and answers are appended.) (YLB)",

The sample consisted of employed persons 20 to 64 years of age working full- or part-time in the United States, Australia, Denmark, Finland, West Germany, Great Britain, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Israel, and Japan. Four determinants of occupational attainment were identified: father's occupations, age, marital status, and educational achievement. The dependent variable was the occupation of the respondent measured by the prestige and occupational wage rate scale. Use of the measure of wage rates of men's and women's jobs in regression analysis showed gender differences in the process of occupational allocation. Findings from  cross-cultural analyses of occupational attainment showed that educational attainment is consistently the most important predictor of occupational positions for men and women. For men it is only one of several factors, but it is the only identified factor for women. Findings suggested that fundamental restructuring of ways in which work is organized will be required to equalize women's and men's occupational options. (YLB)",

        "description":"There is a strong case to be made for mainstreaming older people into regular classes and schools rather than segregating them in special, separate groups on the basis of age. Many older Americans are in need of elementary-secondary level training in order to become functionally literate. Similarly, the continually changing nature of work has forced many middle-aged and older adults to seek vocational training or retraining. The decline in enrollment and financial problems currently being faced by institutions at all educational levels make the mainstreaming of adults into regular classrooms not only feasible but economically advantageous. While it is true that education has traditionally meant education of the young, America has manifested a historical trend toward all-inclusive  education. Many of the traditional assumptions underlyinq American education would tend to support the mainstreaming of older adults into regular classrooms. Included amoung these are the notions of education as preparation, education as continuous growth, and education as an end. What is needed now is an age-inclusive system of education in which schooling would no longer be viewed as preparation of youth but rather as a lifelong process. (MN)",

After analyzing testimony given at congressional hearings, reviewing a random sample of prison systems in 20 states, and constructing estimates of payments to prisoners from SSA, VA, and other similar federal programs, GAO staff estimated that over 4 percent of incarcerated felons (over 13,000 prisoners) were receiving such cash benefits in 1980. Another 4 percent of incarcerated felons received postsecondary education funded through Pell  Grants. Because of the numerous instances of fraudulent and/or improper receipt of such benefits discovered by GAO staff, the GAO recommended that the SSA and VA encourage state prison systems to give the SSA periodic lists of prisoners, incarceration dates, and accurate social security numbers and to share all such corrected information with the VA and with state prisons. In addition, the GAO recommended that Pell Grant program regulations be amended so that students' attendance costs are calculated after any tuition waivers have been granted. (MN)",

Standardized survey questionnaires mailed to former participants in the IIB and YETP in-school youth programs focused on post-termination education, employment experiences and views on how programs helped with education/employment goals. Survey questionnaires mailed to prime sponsors obtained information on structure and operation of 1981 in-school youth programs and views on potential provisions of future employment and training legislation. More prime sponsors served in-school youth under YETP than under IIB, but there were few statistically significant differences between the two  programs. Those differences tended to stem from specific objectives in the YETP legislation. More YETP participants were awarded academic credit, and YETP permitted a greater array of services. Also, few differences were found between YETP and IIB participants.

Chapter 3 outlines a  general participative strategy for worker-centered productivity improvement. Techniques are discussed for carrying out the four stages--information, communication, understanding, and involvement--of infusing an organizational commitment to productivity.

Chapter 1 explores the meaning and measurement of productivity and the benefits of productivity improvement--profits, a weapon against inflation, success in international trade, increased standard of living, improved quality of life, and equality of economic opportunity. In chapter 2, four major technological innovations and their consequent skills implications are briefly discussed. The four technologies are microprocessors, robotics, computer-assisted design, computer-assisted manufacturing systems, and the office of the future. Chapter 3 examines major external forces influencing America's present productivity position, including the thirst for capital, the shrinking  share in foreign trade, a segmented economy, the job creation process, labor shortages, and the management climate.

The rationale is discussed, and workshop goals and objectives are stated. Suggested procedures are described for the attainment of each of the five objectives: to present evidence of the productivity problem, to demonstrate why productivity is of critical economic and social importance, to discuss major factors that have contributed to productivity decline, to explore the significance of social trends in shaping vocational education's role in productivity improvement, and to identify possible strategies for vocational education intervention. Procedures contain a  discussion of recommended workshop strategies and are accompanied by references to sources of additional information. Workshop evaluation is considered, and a tentative agenda is provided. Three appendixes include workshop transparencies, a prototype copy of a document for pre-planning for a vocational education productivity emphasis for use in the workshop, and a productivity workshop evaluation form.

This purpose was to be accomplished through a two-fold goal: enhancing vocational education responsiveness to technological change and promoting a heightened public- and private-sector awareness of vocational education as a mechanism for productivity improvement. Through a literature review, major new technologies with impact relevance for vocational education were identified. The next step, assessment of the programmatic implications of the new technologies identified, was accomplished by relying upon 37 experts in the field to write 56 working papers. They provided information on job skills and the vocational education equipment and facilities necessary to teach those  skills. Project staff prepared a monograph on the role of vocational education in productivity improvement, a paper on the role of state vocational education agencies in productivity improvement, and productivity workshop materials. The 56 working papers were also developed into a series of 7 reports that are each devoted to 1 of the major vocational education program areas: agriculture, distribution, health, home economics, office, technical, and trade and industrial.

        "author":["Hopps, Zona Joyce"],
        "description":"Since vocational education normally deals with potential workers, it needs to include courses whose content focuses on developing effective coping strategies to deal with occupational stressors that affect job satisfaction. Occupational stress is defined as a dynamic reciprocal relationship between an individual and the work environment. Antecedents, or moderators, of strain that leads to job dissatisfaction are role ambiguity, role conflict, quantitative and qualitative overload, boundary spanning, role responsibility, and personality traits. As the definition of stress implies, stress is caused by a degree of imbalance between a person's needs and skills and the organization's requirements and demands. A model that proposes the congruence of persons and environments in  organizations seems appropriate to reduce strain and increase job satisfaction. Determinants of job satisfaction include mentally challenging work, autonomy, variety, task identity, recognition, higher-order need strengths, need for independence, educational levels, participation, and role perceptions. Vocational education needs to provide students with those skills necessary to detect potentially stressful situations and cope with anticipated job stressors and thus improve workers' total effectiveness.

        "description":"A study examined two models--increased opportunity and affirmative action--as proposed solutions to sex inequities in wage and occupational distribution. The Increased Opportunity Model assumes that increased economic opportunities will disproportionately benefit women and minorities because of their relative position in the labor force. The Affirmative Action Model contends that the problem of inequity cannot be solved with increased opportunities in the labor market because the inequities are creations of that market. To compare the validity of the two models, researchers collected data pertaining to the yearly income, occupation, place of residence, and sex of 1,560 members of the labor force in East St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. Next, they compared this employment data with  similar data for the State of Louisiana. Based on their comparisons, the researchers concluded that increased opportunity will not, in and of itself, reduce sex inequities. Therefore, they called for further research to delineate the impediments to increased female labor force participation in order to pinpoint effectively appropriate affirmative action strategies.

        "description":"Researchers propsed a new method for measuring the mismatch between the level of schooling and occupation on a per-worker basis. The method is basically a prevalence measure that relies on census data pertaining to schooling, occupation, and the match between them on a per-worker basis. After applying their method to data derived from the March Current Population Survey for each of the 12 years from 1969 through 1980, researchers determined that there has been at least a 64 percent increase in occupational mismatch over the 12-year interval. Also emerging from the analysis was the fact that the 20 through 34 age group experienced the most alarming increase in mismatch. In addition, researchers found that the broad category of managerial occupations registered over a 9 percent  increase in mismatch risk, indicating the types of occupations into which over-educated workers are typically being placed. Feeling that their measure of occupational mismatch is more comprehensive than other similar previously-developed measures, the researchers called for further research on how the new method should be used in demographic research on labor force or labor market problems. They also recommended using the mismatch measure on the educational and employment policy fronts. (MN)",

        "description":"A study examined the educational and labor market experiences of female graduates of agricultural programs. During the study, researchers interviewed 95 female and 84 male graduates of agricultural programs at 3 community colleges and 6 universities in California between the years 1977 and 1979. Survey participants were asked to supply various demographic data as well as information pertaining to the agricultural program from which they graduated, job-related experiences, and recommendations to women entering agriculture. It was found that women were concentrated in plant science, animal science, and ornamental horticulture programs whereas men, although also included in these programs, tended to enroll in more management-oriented programs. Nearly twice as many male students as  female students had actual farm backgrounds. While the females perceived little sexism in the educational setting, the situation changed upon their entry or attempted entry into the labor force. Emerging from the study was evidence of wide discrepancies in wage rates between men and women, disproportional promotions and pay raises, and subtle hiring discrimination against women. Recommendations included calls for more internship programs for women and for recruitment of women instructors into all program areas. (MN)",

Some studies conclude that an unusual first name or surname is detrimental to a person's self-concept; other studies conclude that an unusual first name, especially if it is a surname, cause no ill-effects on a person's psychological well-being. College students (N=79) participated in a study of the impact of male therapists' first names and surnames on potential clients. Students evaluated selected &quot;most appropriate&quot; and &quot;least appropriate&quot; first names that were paired with &quot;most appropriate&quot; and &quot;least appropriate&quot; surnames. Results showed the name combinations most favorably evalutated were &quot;most appropriate&quot; first name paired with &quot;most appropriate&quot; surname. Male and female differed in  their ratings. Socialization patterns may play some part in the favorable or unfavorable perception of names. The counselors' important job of presenting themselves to their communities may become easier if they develop an awareness of the effect their names may have on clients. (Author/PAS)",

        "description":"The role of environmental stimuli in the control of cigarette smoking has been the object of theoretical speculation, but there have been few experimental demonstrations of the control exerted over smoking by environmental events. Self-report data on smoking in the natural environment were compared to observations made of smoking among subjects residing in a laboratory. Participants in the residential studies were exposed to one of two activity schedules in which they were either allowed to determine the duration of each activity (N=11 subjects) or were required to change activities every hour on the hour (N=8 subjects). The smoking patterns of the subjects on the temporally unstructured activity schedule in the residential laboratory were similar to the smoking patterns of  subjects in the natural environment. Subjects on the activity schedule showed both changes in the shape of the intercigarette interval distribution and a decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked per day. The findings suggest that smoking patterns may be dependent on temporal characteristics of daily activities and that experimental analyses of smoking patterns may reveal relationships not observed in studies using per-unit time measures of smoking.

The paper discusses the impact of child rearing on life satisfaction and feelings of stress and considers the special problems of the working mother. Changing social attitudes surrounding a woman's role as wife and marital dissolution as another source of stress for women are investigated. The importance of support in the form of good child care arrangements and positive family attitudes are noted as two variables which can help reduce the stress of role conflict for working women. The role of mental health workers in dealing with stress is emphasized along with the importance of a systems approach to alleviate stress. (JAC)",

To explore the extent to which the attributions made by a perceiver about another person are related to the perceiver's self-attributions, 93 white and 71 black college students were asked to engage in a 20-minute conversation with a partner. They were then asked to describe themselves and the partner in terms of an adjective scale. Results indicated that, in this context, the ways in which individuals perceived each other were related to the ways in which they perceived themselves, although the results did not imply that how the self was perceived was responsible for how others were perceived.

To investigate whether the trend has continued into the 1980's, convention papers presented at the meetings of seven psychological associations and articles published in nine American Psychological Association (APA) journals during 1980-81 were categorized by number of authors. Results indicated that the trend towards more multiple-author papers has continued, with 70% of the convention papers and 76% of the journal articles having more than one author. The findings suggest that the complexity of experimental methodology, the &quot;publish or perish&quot; pressure, and the support provided by a team of researchers may account for continued  multiple authorship.

Recent data, however, have suggested that the relationship between cognition and affect is a reciprocal one in which each influences the other. Temporary mood states were induced in college students (N=60) to determine the extent to which moods alter cognitions about the world and the future. Subjects were randomly assigned to either an elated, depressed or neutral mood induction procedure and completed the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist after mood induction. The number of rigid and pessimistic statements about human conduct that subjects agreed with differed significantly across the three groups. However,  only the difference between the elated and depressed groups reached significance among the individual comparisons. The results support the conclusion that general views of the world are under partial mood control. (Author/JAC)",

Results showed that counseled students achieved significantly higher scores on the Academic Orientation Scale and the Investigative and Artistic themes of the SCII than students who had not sought counseling. Uncounseled students achieved significantly higher scores on the Enterprising theme than the counseled students. Men were more oriented toward mechanical and technical pursuits than women, while women were more oriented toward artistic interests, reflecting traditional sex role interests.

To illustrate the problems of acculturation, two sample conversations, taken from actual situations, are presented which deal with early adjustment to America. An accompanying analysis is based on explanations by former Russian counselees who describe their own cultural and linguistic differences. Appropriate counseling techniques are suggested to help immigrants adapt to  American culture, such as using a humanistic approach and recognizing the individual's developmental stage of life.

Police and court records of three cohorts comprised of 6,127 persons were analyzed. The most prevalent pattern of delinquent behavior was one of declining seriousness and discontinuation after the teenage period. With few exceptions, intervention by the agencies of social control did not play even a moderate role in decreasing the seriousness of adult controls. It was apparent that police contacts and more serious contacts had their highest incidence in the inner city. While removal from the community may appear to be a solution, the records show that most juveniles and adults will return and must be integrated into the community. (JAC)",

        "description":"One of the important cognitive strategies individuals use when learning is to organize many bits of information into integrated patterns called chunks. To investigate the process of chunking spatial information, 32 college students integrated two cognitive maps either before or after an interfering task. The combined spatial layout formed either a symmetric or asymmetric configuration. The accuracy of movement between points in the spatial layouts significantly increased only when symmetric representations were constructed before the interference. Speed-accuracy tradeoffs during the integration of the spatial layouts and during the performance of the tests could not account for the increased accuracy. The results suggest that the facilitating effect of chunking requires not only  the generation of an integrated representation, but also an additional abstraction derived from the integration representation.

A study of 145 older adults was conducted to determine the extent and effectiveness of services provided by a southern Area Agency on Aging (AAA) to an urban, black, elderly population in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Interview results showed that blacks utilized AAA services more frequently, were more knowledgeable about all AAA services, and tended to be more satisfied with services than their white counterparts. Despite this pattern, almost half of all blacks and whites did not know about the AAA, and fewer than 1 out of 3 blacks and approximately 1 out of 10 whites actually used the services. Lower income respondents and those with less education were more  knowledgeable and tended to use the services more often. The findings indicate that the expected pattern of non-minorities having greater service utilization of AAA services was not supported. (JAC)",

Results indicated that the basic assumption underlying the use of the McCauley and Stitt (1978) procedures was being met and that subjects used Bayes appropriately. The correlations of the estimated percentage of trait given sex with both base rate (the overall frequency of the trait in the population) and with representativeness (the frequency of a particular sex showing a specific trait)  were all large and significant.

        "description":"Much of the current controversy in the area of story theory derives from a failure to make clear the distinctions among theories of (1) plan comprehension, (2) narrative comprehension, and (3) story schema. A theory of plan comprehension attempts to account for the ability of humans to interpret the observed actions of another person in terms of that person's intentions. A theory of narrative comprehension is one that attempts to account for the ability of humans to understand narrative discourse. A theory of story schema attempts to deal with the individual's knowledge and enjoyment of the subclass of narrative discourse that comprises stories. Evidence from research suggests that many theoretical and empirical findings thought to contribute to theories of the story schema are  better interpreted as relating to plan comprehension and narrative comprehension. To better understand the properties of stories, it is necessary to examine the function of different types of discourse and to take into account the discourse force of the genre being investigated. Stories are the subclass of narratives that have entertainment as their primary discourse force. Research from this perspective has related particular discourse organizations to particular affective responses in the reader and related these to the reader's liking and story intuition judgments. Surprise, suspense, and curiosity were three major discourse structures accounting for the enjoyment of most stories. (HTH)",

Awareness of segmentation (sentences, phonemes, words) was found to be significantly related to degree of literacy, not to amount of schooling or general ability, although some components of the segmental awareness measure did not correlate with literacy. Subjects' concept of &quot;word&quot; as shown by elicited definitions also differed significantly by reading levels, but the differences did not fit well into  the developmental scales proposed for children by I.

Subjects, 60 adult monolingual English speakers enrolled in adult education classes, were divided into three groups according to reading level. Data were gathered through a structured interview consisting of (1) questions about the segmental structure of English, (2) an oral vocabulary test, (3) a question asking for the definition of &quot;word,&quot; (4) questions asking for judgments of oral and graphic items, and (5) background questions about schooling and language experience. Analysis of the content of the subjects' definitions revealed three main kinds of features--units, meaning, and functions--with an increasing elaboration  of references to units with reading level and a change in the kind of functions referred to, with written functions mentioned more often by lower readers. Analysis of definitional form reinforced the idea that higher level readers are more likely to talk of words as &quot;units of language.&quot; In contrast to some developmental theories, these results suggest that factors other than developmental level affect people's concept of &quot;word&quot; and that metalinguistic skills are not one, undifferentiated domain but may be tied into specific areas of cognitive experience and expertise.

First, reading and study skills programs must include learning resource centers where students of all skill levels can come and improve themselves. Program staff members discussing long-range plans should consider providing classes for good and poor readers, adding adult basic education and high school equivalencey (GED) classes, creating content area computer modules, teaching adjunct classes with content area faculty, and providing special inservices to meet the needs of business and industry. Second, reading and study skills people need to be knowledgeable and receptive to computer technology. Third, adding a  volunteer component to the program would be good for public relations, community development, and faculty support. Evaluation is another issue. Staff must be able to present to the college administration written and objective (computer-analyzed) evaluations of their classes. They should be certain that they have a solid screening procedure so that student skills improve sufficiently before the students enter regular academic classes. Finally, reading and study skills faculty should be aware of new developments in the field and incorporate them into the curriculum. (HOD)",

Recent research suggests that SSR is of significant value when combined with a regular program of reading. Educational accountability in reading instruction is usually determined from test results. It should, however, address both the cognitive and affective development of readers. Considering the two major variables of content covered and academically engaged minutes, open and closed teaching models seem to stress one or the other of the two areas of development. Although a supplementary activity that cannot replace reading instruction itself,  SSR bridges the gap between learning outcomes associated with cognitive reading achievement and affective reading achievement. As such it addresses the concerns of accountability with a single investment of time and without compromises and trade-offs. Although SSR isn't always workable on a schoolwide basis, its strengths and features make it deserving of consideration from reading specialists, classroom teachers, and administrators responsible for accountability and effective reading instruction.

The peer differentials hypothesis argues that differential outcomes in schools are influenced by patterns of peer allocation and influence. Subjects were fourth grade students in a single urban school. Two types of instructional grouping systems were analyzed: within-classroom grouping for reading instruction and across-classroom ability grouping. Although the self-fulfilling prophecy was at work in both grouping systems, the two forms of grouping affected the processes  of peer allocation and differential instruction differently. Instructional processes and peer group formation tended to place students in lower strata of the cross-classroom ability grouping at a disadvantage, but to work in favor of students in the lower strata of the within-classroom reading group system.

        "description":"An experiment investigated the effects of the instruction rubric at the beginning of an examination paper and of the format of the examination questions themselves. A history test whose questions originally differed widely in format was modified so that its rubric was as clear and concise as possible and all the short answer questions were of the same format. The design of the experiment produced four versions combining the new and old rubrics with the new and old questions so that the effects of the different changes would not be confused. Statistical analysis of data from 200 subjects seemed to indicate that the original version produced the highest candidate achievement scores; however, closer study revealed that the new rubric was in fact leading to better achievement results  than the original one. Although the original rubric was clearly superior in the familiar situation, when the situation was less familiar, the new rubric began to show its worth. Readability measures also showed that the new rubric was simpler and easier to understand. Analysis of candidates' choice of questions revealed that question-style may outweigh the actual subject content in the candidate's process of choice and that questions appearing earlier in an examination are more likely to be chosen. These findings indicate that exam writers should consider the effect of the way a question is couched and the importance of readability of instructions. (JL)",

        "description":"The writing-reading process is a total interacting system comprising four subsystems: the writer, the text, the reader, and the context. A model of the complex interactions among these four subsystems is useful to the extent that it provides a framework for established facts, and in so far as it explains phenomena and suggests hypotheses. While syntax or grammatical structure may account for arrangements among lexical items within the sentence, cohesion refers to the nonstructural resources of language needed to account for relations between sentences. When writers introduce people, objects, and places and then keep track of these, the type of cohesion principally used is reference; co-reference maintains this relationship of identity. Conjunction is the type of cohesion when  writers use an explicit connective to join one section of a text to another. Lexical items drawn from a restricted domain provide lexical cohesion. Texts lacking these cohesive strategies cannot be described as &quot;normal.&quot; Data from studies examining student perception of textual cohesion using the framework of the writing-reading systems model lend support to the general hypothesis that linguistic facility and background knowledge and experience, as well as control over textual cohesion, increase as students develop greater language ability.

        "description":"A study examined hierarchical relationships among three developmental components of reading ability in grades 1 through 3. It was predicted that semantic skills develop initially, followed by letter identification skills, phonological skills, and visual skills. Reading ability was assessed with a word identification task. The semantic components of reading were assessed with word definition tasks, phonological skills were measured with rhyming tasks, and visual graphic skills were tapped with a letter naming task. Hierarchical relationships among performances on tasks were examined as they characterize the acquisition of reading for beginning readers. Children were tested individually, and all responses were recorded as pass or fail. The results showed that children performed  most accurately and correctly on verbal definition and picture tasks, scoring at ceiling levels in all grades. Their performance was successively less accurate on letter identification, rhyming production, and reading production, particularly for first and second grade students. The results suggest that most beginning readers acquire reading skills in a hierarchical order most of the time. The findings also show the relevance of visual graphics and phonological skills to reading development--most children who consistently failed visual graphics and phonolgoical tasks tended to experience difficulty in oral reading performance and to read below grade level in class.

        "description":"The research and practical questions about the internal lexicon, the associated network of internal representation basic to word meaning, boil down to whether in reading English the phonological route is obligatory or optional. Since the English writing system is morphophonemic, not phonetic, access to the internal lexicon cannot and should not just be at the surface, phonetic level. Simplified spelling cannot quite bring out much of the relevant information in the English writing system. Teachers must balance phonic subskills and reading comprehension even in primary grade classes. The concept of internal dictionary must be broadened to that of an internal encyclopedia or internal library. Fast, accurate decoding of words is necessary but not sufficient for comprehension of  text. Research on the reading process has led to schema theory, which postulates that story comprehension evolves around high-level representation of schemata that helps to organize and integrate a story and makes it comprehensible and recallable. The idea that comprehension of text, memory, and knowledge are interwoven means that teachers will have to teach learning strategies explicitly and should be wary of &quot;simplified&quot; stories. The interactive nature of the reading process underscores the importance of both the structure and function of language. Replacing formal, rigid language and reading instruction with instruction that stresses the flexibility and ambiguity of language will produce better teaching methods. (JL)",

        "description":"Within the framework of a general model of communication, a model of language communication has been developed and applied to the perception of cohesion. To measure students' perception of textual cohesion, a pilot study in the United Kingdom built \"noise\" into texts by deleting parts of each texts. Subjects, 59 nonremedial students whose first language was either Italian or Punjabi, were given two test booklets in English, one fiction and one nonfiction. Each booklet contained 65 text deletions. Using an accepted guideline of miscue analysis, results did not indicate serious weaknesses in the students' reading at the points measured. Examining the measure of consensus displayed by students' responses leads to the intuitive conclusion that in these cases consensus measure is more  important than exact match score. The results confirm that this type of analysis can provide potentially useful insights into readers' text processing strategies. (JL)",

The initial focus of the study was on methods of assessment. Analytic inquiry focused on strategy differences between good and poor readers and remediation techniques for teaching comprehension skills beyond the word level. Following the analytic inquiry, a series of three empirical studies investigated an important but not widely studied aspect of reading skills development--children's perception of meaningful, intrasentence units in printed discourse. These studies found that (1) phrasally segmented text  improved children's oral reading in regard to appropriate intonation, stress, and pauses; (2) both good and poor readers were able to use prosodic features in order to identify functional intrasentence units in speech, but poor readers had difficulty compensating for the lack of these organizing cues in printed text; and (3) oral modeling of text helped moderately poor readers to read out loud in a fluent manner, suggesting an improved understanding of text. These results suggest that auditory language skills should also be used as the basis for teaching children to analyze the phonological and structural organization of text on the larger level of phrases and sentences.

In the first, second, and third conditions, the subjects completed both a comprehension message measure and a parsing activity in which they indicated points in the story where pauses were acceptable. Children in the fourth condition participated only in the comprehension activity. Results showed that the subjects were able to understand the parsing task and could identify intrasentence units in written  passages. This was true even for those who did not have any auditory support during the task. The results of the parsing task showed that both good and poor readers readily perceived suprasegmental features in speech and used these cues effectively in identifying sentence structure. The findings support the theory that the poor representation of prosodic features in written text adds to the difficulty some children experience in learning to read.

        "description":"Emerging videotex news services--systems for distributing textual information on television screens that permit direct competition with pulp newspapers--are presently rooted in a limited theory of newsreading. The first of two rival theories of newsreading applicable to electronic newspapers is &quot;uses and gratifications&quot; research--the belief that the audience is active and that an important part of mass media use is goal directed. Such research, however, ignores the possibility that newspapers are read for pleasure and for no ulterior purpose and suggests that the adaption of work-related, task-oriented storage and retrieval systems to videotex newspapers is theoretically appropriate. A second newsreading theory, the ludenic theory, asserts that the process of newsreading is  intrinsically pleasurable, and that pleasure is at the root of both mature, highly ritualized newsreading as well as more casual, unstructured newsreading. On the surface, an electronic newspaper with countless information retrieval options would seem to embrace the concepts of selectivity and apperception inherent to pleasure reading, but the &quot;true&quot; ludenic electronic newspaper would consist of a number of information items strung together electronically in a manner that enhances the newsreading of an audience segment. The key to successful development of electronic newspapers is development of forms consistent with the type of play that characterizes such newsreading. True ludenic newsreading cannot be transformed into a task-oriented drudgery of data base manipulation and intricate  information-recovery protocols. (HTH)",

Results indicated that the streamlined graphics used in &quot;Scientific American&quot; (primarily black and white or one-color diagrams and graphs) helped to offset the complexity of the written material.

The first objective/section discusses the ways that students may undertake personal kinds of writing as a way of improving thinking skills and of learning both subject knowledge and knowledge about themselves. The second objective/section deals with the types of writing students are more likely to do in school or social settings and presents three primary purposes for public writing: informative, persuasive, and literary. The third  objective/section reflects a change in focus in writing education from product to process, while the fourth discusses control of such skills as organizing, elaborating, and appropriately using the conventions of writing (usage and mechanics). The fifth objective/section underscores the importance of students' learning why writing is a valuable personal and social activity. The final section is an effort to enhance the utility of the writing objectives by sharing some ideas and suggestions for teaching that have proven useful to others.

        "description":"The &quot;expressivists&quot; in composition philosophy have seized upon reader-response criticism for its potential in the literature-based composition class. The literature-based course in composition falls into three main models: (1) a literary approach in which the focus is on literature with compositions to be written on the side; (2) a themes approach in which works to be read are chosen not according to concepts of literary history or criticism but because they embody, thematically, problems and dilemmas that students are thought to be able to respond to and write about; and (3) the reader-response or subjective-criticism approach in which students are encouraged to write about their personal, subjective, emotional responses to works of literature and to include in these responses  accounts of analogous personal experiences. However, while a significant fraction of the composition sequence should be on responses to texts, the works of imaginative literature are not the most suitable texts for teaching writing because students must read one form of discourse and write in another. Instead, the course should accurately represent modern prose. To the extent that literary readings are not prose and not modern, they do not fit the bill. Nevertheless, passages from literary discourse are sometimes used for formal exercises in imitation. Another objection is that the secondary goal of literary instruction often overwhelms the primary goal of writing instruction. Furthermore, writing about literary texts is referentially atypical. This makes the literature-based course poor  preparation for academic and public discourse, and it makes for inefficient internalization of the language of readings. (HOD)",

        "description":"The shift in paradigm from product to process should force a new look at the ways in which the teacher reads student writing. From the perspective of reader-response criticism, it should be no surprise that teachers would differ in their response to, and therefore assessment of, student writing. Examining two graded student essays, one from a sixth grade student and one from a college student, reveals that teachers do not read; they edit from the perspective that the text is autonomous and free standing, the real world manifestation of an independent ideal form. The contextless, unnatural writing that is promoted in the academic world may be the source of bad writing outside of it. Reader-response criticism may help solve this problem. Writing, like living, is both free and  constrained. At present, teachers tend to cancel or ignore their &quot;real&quot; response to a piece of writing and replace it with a &quot;professional&quot; response. The connections between critical practice and the ways teachers read should be examined. Then, perhaps, teachers can be freed from the requirement of &quot;normalized&quot; responses. Student writers write for someone--the teacher--so teachers should allow themselves to become readers, valuing subjectivity and trusting and expressing their first and best response to the student's text.

        "description":"Although the short story is brief and seemingly simple to comprehend, experienced teachers know from painful experience that students often read without \"seeing\" and that the only way to get them to \"see\" is to isolate some of the elements of the short story and present them in a different way to focus attention on them. For example, to demonstrate the importance of sequence in plot, students can be asked to list some personal events on six file cards. The cards are then exchanged and students are asked to arrange the events in what seems to be a logical order. To assist students in making a distinction between plot and theme, students can be asked to develop a collection of pictures that seem to suggest stories. Divided into groups, students can select pictures that illustrate  different stories with similar themes. Once students seem to have grasped plot structure, the teacher can assess their ability to recognize effective plots by asking them to supply the ending for selected situations. Constant practice in examining settings and inferring clues from the story will also help students perceive the significance of these elements and train them to keep track of details as a story proceeds. Characterization can be studied by demonstrating the limitations of stereotyping and making students aware of the need for collecting as much evidence as possible before forming any judgments or generalizations. A final assessment of student growth can be accomplished through creative problem-solving \"tests\" using such approaches as improvisation, visual aids, and writing.  (HOD)",

Teachers may be acquainted with colleagues who have published, and newspapers, libraries, and even the telephone book may provide resources from which a writers directory can be compiled. Once a writer has been contacted, the instructor should discuss the scheduling details, stipend if any, and the possibility of videotaping the author. Prior to the classroom appearance, the author may want to submit a brief autobiographical sketch. Samples of the writer's work may be read during the appearance, and the author can describe his or her writing habits, attitudes, and changes in writing style over the years. Having the class write advance questions to ask can  stimulate thought, as well as ensure attention during the appearance. Question-answer time should also be allowed at the end of the session. Because such a unit may be used by teachers in other content areas, the authors directory should contain appropriate information, and the directory should be made available at a central location. The videotapes will also make the author's appearance available to other teachers. The author's visit should be publicized through media releases, displays, and word of mouth; each successful appearance will set the stage for future appearances. (HTH)",

Data collected in all three phases of the research included measures of preschool oral language development, transcripts and interviews concerning parental and child interest in literacy, classroom observations of primary schooling, tests results, and writing evaluations. Subjects' writing at age 5 was scored according to language level, message quality, and directional principles; at age 7, in accordance with the journalistic features of who, what, when, where, how, and why; and at age 9, holistically. These qualitative measures were submitted to a correlation analysis along with the other measures. None of the measures for oral language correlated significantly  with the writing quality measures. The study of writing progress indicated that those parents who were providing experiences relevant to literacy development during the preschool years had a lasting effect. The observed teacher characteristics positively related to progress during the three stages of writing development were those related to the conventions of written representation of language and those related to the content of children's compositions. In an index of scores for good and poor homes and good and poor schools, it appeared that the differences between the contributions of the homes were far greater than those between schools, emphasizing the influence of home literacy experiences.

Nineteen items, extrapolated from Maslow's model but rendered more generally communicative than the original wording, constituted the PCE scale used in the study. Subjects, 37 females and 37 males enrolled in a required speech communication course responded to each of the 19 items using a five-point scale from &quot;very true&quot; to &quot;very untrue.&quot; Statistical analysis of the results identified six peak communication components: (1) loving acceptance, (2) openminded insight, (3) spontaneity, (4) pleasant fear, (5) absorption,  and (6) self-detachment. Males and females did differ in their PCE reporting, with females rating significantly higher on both loving acceptance and spontaneity and rating the PCE as involving more pleasant fear than males did. These differences seem to be sex-role appropriate. Many PCE questions still await the researcher interested in developing a high-ceiling interpersonal communication theory, but clearly the exploration of PCE's will yield new insights in human communication practices and possibilities.

A final list of 18 intuitively independent student-generated statements was developed, with each student statement being used to construct three items of the instrument.

The second item asked the student to estimate how much of the time the student would prefer the teacher to act in the manner described. The third item asked the  student to describe how much of the time the teacher did act in the manner described. A test of the instrument in 14 intact classroom units in a large university showed (1) the importance assigned individual teacher behaviors revealed no consistent overall pattern; (2) students across classes preferred teachers to enact three standard behaviors virtually all the time, yet students in different class situations attached differing amounts of importance to those standards; (3) correlations between the importance and the preferred frequency of teacher behaviors varied according to which behavior was rated; and (4) students observing the same teacher in a particular class tended to respond to questionnaire items regarding their observations in similar ways, suggesting evidence of the overall  reliability of the questionnaire.

The results indicated an increase of scores over the semester for communication and English subjects and a decrease in scores for psychology and biology subjects, supporting the first hypothesis. The results showed that the instruments measuring general self-concept were not highly related to the instruments measuring the dimension self-concept of communication ability, supporting the second hypothesis.

        "description":"Medical scientists, doctors, and patients have different models of disease that cause doctor/patient communication problems. The patient model is reflected in the average American who is a high school graduate but who has little understanding of the human body and science. The model of the medical scientist is reflected in the typical graduate of medical school who decides to specialize in an area of research such as genetics. The exemplar for the doctor model is the medical school graduate practicing the art of healing medicine. Laypersons classify diseases very differently from the medical scientist/doctor and are not concerned with diagnosis of the disease. The medical scientist and doctor want a rational explanation of every worsening and bettering, but the patient does not.  The patient is interested in results. Treatment is more important to the patient than diagnosis and etiology. The scientist's first concern is with the pathogenesis of the disease, the development of the morbid process. The patient's first concern is with a cure; the doctor's first concern is treatment. If doctor/patient relationships are to improve, there first must be awareness of the problem. Next, there must be awareness of the causes of the model variances: culture, world views, schooling, attitudes, values, and stances. The solution is a realization on the doctor's part that he or she must bridge the gap between theory and common sense and between the scientist's model of disease and the patient's model of disease.

Although attempts have been made in experimental television (&quot;video art&quot;), systematic studies on the idiosyncratic nature, unique features, and specific components of the medium as a separate art form are still scarce. A review of these idiosyncracies, features, and components leads to the conclusion that the delay in the development of a television language can be attributed mainly to the lack of understanding of the medium's ultimate role, its unique characteristics, and its specific elements by those involved with television production and study. The development of television's language depends  greatly on wider experimentation and research that acknowledges research already done in other disciplines. (Author/FL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine if communication apprehensive students enrolled in a basic speech communication course preferred specific instructional methods and perceived these methods as beneficial in reducing public speaking anxiety. During four consecutive semesters, 620 undergraduate students completed the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA) and indicated whether each of a number of instructional methods would help them feel more relaxed and comfortable when delivering their speeches in the course. Grading options, speech preparation procedures, speaking order options, topic selection procedures, and administration procedures were the types of instructional methods tested in the study. The results indicated that administration procedures (audience size,  speech length) presented the most significant source of speech anxiety for communication apprehensive students. On the basis of these findings, apprehension about public speaking may be attributed to the process of speaking rather than the content of the speech or the skills of the speaker. However, the findings also demonstrated that apprehensive students prefer a number of procedures that may not always enhance their speaking skills. For example, some prefer that oral comments not be made after their speech. Instructors may counter such fears by explaining the importance of feedback as well as demonstrating it by insuring that sufficient time is available for oral comments between speeches. (HTH)",

        "description":"For some time organizational theorists have been calling for increased attention to and appreciation of the role of specific contexts in organizational processes. One group of researchers has heeded this call by treating the organization as a cultural phenomenon. This approach has raised many questions, including (1) What is cultural in an organization? (2) How does the cultural relate to the communicative in organizational life? (3) What descriptive framework guides inquiry of organizations as cultural phenomena? and (4) What are the advantages and goals of treating the organization as culture? In pursuing answers to these questions, researchers may gain insights regarding the salient symbols and meanings, topics, concepts, and premises in organizational communication; the role  of speech contexts in organizational life; and the forms of speech used in completing communal tasks. By discovering and describing these features, researchers will be able, in principle, to construct a theory of a case which is adequate to its task. Additionally, they will develop a descriptive framework and contribute to a fund of studies for use in comparative research. (FL)",

Once they acknowledge the problem, speech communication professionals can become better informed about sexual harassment and ways of dealing with it, and commit themselves to responsible communicative action. First, speech professionals must initiate discussions among friends, colleagues, administrators, staff, and students and confront the fears and faults of their institutions and of society as a whole. Second, individuals experiencing a situation that they do not like are obligated to say so, either to the perpetrator or to someone in a position to alleviate the situation. Ignoring the situation will only encourage or escalate it.  Institutions should have sexual harassment policies, and the procedures and commitment to follow through with them. Finally, those who harass without realizing they do so need to think about how they want other persons to feel as a result of a particular statement, look, or gesture. They should examine their motivation, as well as the verbal and nonverbal feedback they receive. (HTH)",

Approximately 200 institutions were represented in the 3,771 entries in the data base; 90 percent of the authors held doctoral degrees. Analysis of the data involving authors with degrees in speech communication indicated that the University of Iowa's graduates had been the most active publishers, followed by Pennsylvania State University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Illinois, and Michigan State University. When considered with data supplied by other researchers, these results indicate that regardless of the measure used to  establish prestige, institutions housing doctoral programs produce more productive graduates. Although the presence of one or two prolific publishers and the failure to obtain some information on where the degree was obtained reduce the authority of these findings somewhat, this study does suggest that prestige, as measured by the number of articles published by an institution's graduates, does seem to index institutions.

The interview assessed home environment (1) television viewing relationships, including viewing companion and parental control; (2) television viewing behaviors, including level of exposure and favorite programs; and (3) television attitudes, including television affinity and perceived realism. The results indicated that siblings were the principal viewing companions across all age groups, while a substantial number of children also watched with their parents. A greater percentage of younger than older children were told by someone at home how much  television they could watch. The number of television programs viewed during the day previous to the interview was not significantly different across age groups. The frequency of preferences for cartoons and children's programs decreased with age increments, while the frequency of preferences for comedies and adult drama and adventure programs increased with age increments. Younger children felt that television played a more important role in their lives than did the middle or older groups of children, and the younger children perceived television content to represent reality more directly than did the middle and older groups of children. The findings suggest that what children watch on television and how they perceive television and its content, are very much related to the early stages  of a child's cognitive development. (HTH)",

        "description":"The concepts of moral reasoning developed by Lawrence Kohlberg can be applied to the analysis of communication in intimate relationships in an attempt to deal with the high rate of marital dissolution. Kohlberg has identified three levels of moral reasoning: (1) preconventional, in which a person reasons in terms of punishment, reward, or exchange of favors; (2) conventional, in which the individual is concerned with maintaining the expectations and rules of his or her family, group, or nation for its own sake; and (3) postconventional, in which moral reasoning is based on autonomous principles. Each level contains two stages. This paradigm opens new vistas for analysis of family communication breakdowns. For instance, it is possible to hypothesize that couples who reason at the  same level are likely to handle disagreements more productively, to have a better chance of staying together, and to suffer fewer family communication problems. Research is needed to check this hypothesis. Discussing moral dilemmas could help bring parents and children to higher levels of moral reasoning, which in turn may lead to the strengthening of society as a whole. (JL)",

        "description":"In recent years, a number of concepts have been introduced by communication researchers in an effort to transcend the limitations of the chronological age concept. Among these is the idea of contextual age, which asserts that social and environmental factors are better indicators of aging and communication behavior than is chronological age. A study was undertaken to (1) develop and examine an index of contextual age and (2) explore the associations among the component dimensions of that index and various sociodemographic descriptors, especially chronological age. The 18-item index that was constructed represented six interrelated dimensions: physical health, interpersonal interaction, mobility, life satisfaction, social activity, and economic security. The associations among  contextual age and sociodemographic characteristics were examined for a sample of 640 people, ranging in age from 17 to 92. Results showed that contextual age transcended the limited heuristic nature of chronological age. Contextual age was shown to consider the individuality of aging, depending on life position indicators, and to be a more viable construct. The findings suggest that this concept should be considered in future communication and aging studies and that the continued use of chronological age as an absolute measure of aging and life position can only foster inadequate and inaccurate stereotypes of the elderly.

        "description":"When the American Civil War ended, the southern aristocracy turned to sharecropping as a means for continuing its existence and for keeping former slaves in the fields. Tenant families during the economic depression of 1929 were forced to live in squalid conditions, and the natural antagonism between whites and blacks was exacerbated by the competition for jobs during this period. Landowners tended to replace black tenants with white workers who had been laid off from factories. In July 1934, 27 tenant farmers, both black and white, set aside their racial differences to organize the Southern Tenant Farmers Union (STFU), to work for decent living and working conditions. By 1936, the STFU had enrolled nearly 31,000 members. The rhetoric of the STFU was characterized by four basic  strategies: an association with the church, a reliance on music and poetry, the two-local tactic (two segregated unions in larger communities), and agitation to attract publicity. William Thomas Brown, a black tenant farmer's son and a student at Shaw College-Raleigh, instigated the only STFU local to form in North Carolina. His activities were conspicuous for only 3 years, however, after which the local union disbanded. No other such locals were ogranized in the state. William Thomas Brown acknowledges that the STFU failed to sustain its foothold in North Carolina for two primary reasons: the impact of the Old South paternalistic attitudes toward tenants and the absence of white leadership, which curtailed the potential for a powerful interracial tenant farmers union.

        "description":"Assuming that the forensic coach should attempt to facilitate the students' success in original speech events as well as provide a basis for understanding communication skills to be transferred to other communication settings, the coach as \"educator\" is crucial. While the purpose of the coach is to guide and direct a student toward an appropriate topic--not dictate the topic--the coach should strongly encourage topic choice based on the nature of the event, competitor, situation, and audience. The student, however, should conduct the major portion of the research as an independent effort. Encouraging the student to explore a variety of resource materials and allowing the student an opportunity to exert considerable effort in the development of this project will invariably lead to  a better understanding of the topic and greater satisfaction with the end result. While there are many coaches who encourage an extemporaneous style of delivery, such skills can be developed through other events, and there are valuable skills taught by the specialized care required in a memorized manuscript speech. Once the student has memorized the original speech, the coach should begin training the student to use his or her voice and body effectively in the delivery of the speech. Finally, a coach's input into critical evaluation can be invaluable. Analyzing formal evaluations outside the competition will enhance the value of the educational competitive setting. (HTH)",

Among the fundamental changes affecting society are the diversification of lifestyles, the development of genetic engineering, trends toward automation, and the information explosion. The educational crisis reflects these changes. Torsten Husen notes the increase in schools' bureaucratization, sorting functions (which cause fierce competition), and socialization functions (which stifle needed student qualities). To survive the crisis, the school curriculum must assume three new orientations. First, the curriculum should have a futures orientation and should include studies of futurism, forecasting methods, and alternate futures. Second, the curriculum  should have a systemic orientation. Current Western thought is too analytical. Education should instead start with the whole, not the parts, and should avoid linear or sequential approaches, stress the concepts of limits and interdependence, integrate disciplines and levels through a thematic approach, and emphasize understanding the relationships among facts. Finally, the curriculum should have a global orientation to prepare students for the future's heterogeneous \"global village.\" Schools should reinstate foreign language study at all educational levels and should infuse curricula with comparative, cross-cultural perspectives. Following these three orientations will help produce the \"competent generalists\" needed in the next century. (Author/RW)",

The Division directs the delivery of food services to all 178 schools in the county. This study describes the food service system: how it operates centrally and at the building level; who bears responsibility for which functions; what procedures are used to track food and funds within the system; and the quality of delivery of food services, assessed in terms of attitudes toward the program, plate waste, and nutritional issues. Various data collection methods were employed, including questionnaires, surveys, and  interviews. Records were reviewed and audits conducted of a selected sample of school cafeteria accounting and inventory systems. A stratified random sample of 34 schools was selected for in-depth participation in the study, including a plate waste study and observation of cafeteria operations. An additional 47 schools received questionnaires directed to principals, teachers, and cafeteria managers and workers. Recommendations accompany each of the 12 chapters of this report. The three major cost reduction recommendations are: (1) conversion of all on-site elementary school kitchens to satellite operation, (2) elimination of local tax-supported funding, and (3) investment of surplus food services funds.

        "description":"A study of the conflict management behavior of 103 school superintendents and city managers in two major metropolitan areas revealed that the superintendents were more professionalized than the city managers but, when dealing with the public, were less likely to use the analytic-technocratic conflict management methods typically associated with professionals. City managers tended to use these methods both when resolving intraorganizational conflict and when resolving issues involving the public, while superintendents managing public-oriented conflict tended to deviate from their professional opinions and engage in the bargaining, lobbying, and compromising behavior typical of the political-bargaining approach. Data for the study were gathered using interviews and questionnaires,  and were subjected to log-linear analysis for the purpose of constructing a model of conflict management behavior. Two school closing cases are isolated and described as prototypical examples of the two identified approaches to public-related conflict management. In addition to the results noted above, the study found that, unlike city managers, superintendents were more likely to confront intraorganizational conflict than public-related conflict. The researchers suggest that superintendents' reliance on political-bargaining methods may be forced by the more ideologically-rooted nature of the public issues they do face. (Author/PGD)",

The researchers conclude that while perhaps appearing arbitrary to outsiders, the principal's actions and the environment in which he chose to act were &quot;minded&quot; expressions of his experience-based and image-related personal philosophy (a form of personal practical knowledge), and whether conscious or  not served to support and enhance acceptance by others of his approach to schooling.

The control group consisted of all the 119 pupils in grades 2, 3, and 4 in the 1936-era school. The experimental group consisted of all the 96 pupils in grades 2, 3, and 4 in the 1923-constructed building who were later transferred to the new school. Pupil pre-test and post-test scores on the &quot;Our School Building Attitude Inventory&quot; served as the dependent variable. The independent variables were the physical facilities in the three school buildings, and students' sex, race, and socioeconomic status. Analyses of covariance and variance were used to examine the variables. The main finding of the study  was that pupils housed in a modern school building have significantly more positive attitudes toward their school building than do pupils housed in an old building. Race and socioeconomic status had no effect on pupil attitudes toward school buildings, though females in the control group scored significantly higher than males in both the pre-test and the post-test. Six pages of selected references accompany the report. The appendices contain the attitude inventory and a five-point rating scale of 33 characteristics of the 3 schools. (Author/MLF)",

The time wasters considered fall into the areas of personal attitudes, personal and organizational planning, and working conditions. The time savers include ways to practice self-control, make decisions, eliminate distractions, organize activities, and delegate authority. Most importantly, the administrator must have a capable secretary. The author concludes that there are two ultimate &quot;secrets&quot; for saving time: to decide what is to be done with one's life personally and professionally, and to take  charge of one's life personally and professionally.

This document treats the retrieval bargaining process, explaining first the factors that could make such cutback management techniques necessary in the public sector, including federal funding reductions, inflationary pressures, and declines in client populations. Potential obstacles to retrieval bargaining, notes the author, include union resistance, civil service job security provisions, government regulations, public opinion, and public employee unions' concepts of productivity. Counseling against cutting employee salaries except as a last resort, the author suggests several areas for cutting costs and proposes a procedure for handling  retrenchment in a hypothetical case. Finally, the author recommends tactics that public sector employers can use when conducting retrieval bargaining. Among these tactics are publicizing the financial position of the agency, ensuring the support of members of the agency's governing body, reviewing the current contract, modifying compensable benefit provisions, increasing employee workloads, cutting salaries, and providing cost-free benefits.

        "description":"Three general approaches are available to help discipline the use of qualitative methods in educational research without sacrificing subjective understanding, according to this paper. The most private, least confirmable, yet richest approach is the intuitive, which depends on the researcher's thorough immersion in the field setting and contemplation of the situation. Procedural approaches tend to restrict the effects of individual judgment--in their ideal state they involve the establishment of research procedures that are followed through in their entirety before analysis of the results is attempted. Data display techniques, triangulation, the use of guidelines for induction, and quantitative techniques are among the procedures that can be used when dealing with qualitative  data. The third approach, the intersubjective, requires interaction among researchers or between researchers and setting participants for the development of shared understanding and the verification of findings. The characteristics, strengths, and shortcomings of all three approaches are considered in this report, and studies utilizing the different methods are cited as examples. Noting that the three approaches usually appear in some combination, the authors conclude with a brief discussion of the ramifications of some of the combinations possible. (Author/PGD)",

The authors next demonstrate the variety in qualitative  research by describing some dimensions on which qualitative studies vary. In the area of data collection, qualitative strategies can vary in at least five ways: (1) the number of sites studied, (2) the extent of researcher immersion in the situation studied, (3) the extent to which activities are structured in advance, (4) the nature of the observation frameworks, and (5) reporting strategies.

        "description":"Collective bargaining relationships in school districts are affected by court actions in a variety of ways. Courts have acted as a \"surrogate legislature\" by providing legal structures where legislation is absent and by modifying legislation through the process of statutory construction. This paper examines the courts' role in structuring bargaining relationships. Three detailed case studies are presented. The first case, from Hazelwood, Missouri, demonstrates how judicial involvement can affect the existence of bargaining relationships in a school district and the development of such relationships. The second case reviews the impact of the 1968 \"Holland rule,\" requiring careful judicial scrutiny of a strike before injunctive relief is granted, upon subsequent events in Michigan  and elsewhere. The third case study examines the initial effects of a California Supreme Court case and shows how the courts can affect the role of public employment relations boards in labor-management relations disputes in public education. In a concluding section the authors note that the courts, using familiar judicial paradigms, regularly structure bargaining relationships. The authors also discuss some of the underlying limitations of judicial structuring of school labor-management relations. (Author/MLF)",

Five of the studies used a rationalistic, quantitative methodology, while the other eight utilized naturalistic, qualitative techniques including interviews, observations, and record analysis. The research on educational change focused on the characteristics of rational and incremental approaches to change, motivations for change, the financial resources and  training required for change, and factors inhibiting change. The leadership studies concerned relationships between leadership behavior and situational factors, positional and emergent leadership, and leadership behavior and school effectiveness. The research on decision-making concentrated on the content of educational decisions, staff involvement in decision-making, and individual and group decision-making processes. Drawing on the summarized research, this report proposes a theoretical model synthesizing the interactions over time among and between change, leadership styles, and decision-making processes.

This report details the decade-long process that led to this decision, treating in particular the changing relationships among the school district, the city, and concerned citizens. Drawing on interviews with local city and school officials and community representatives, and on examinations of the records of the period, the researchers found that the process of school district policy-making on facility utilization had been fraught with many difficulties and had undergone many changes. The roles of the school board and citizen groups in obtaining, developing, and utilizing relevant information  changed considerably over the years. Despite an outcome that failed to satisfy all participants fully, the policy development process did lead to some positive results and suggested to the researchers ways in which the many problems raised by massive retrenchment can be overcome.

The literature types considered are case studies (descriptions of effective schools), comparative studies (comparisons of effective and ineffective schools), program evaluations (examinations of effectiveness-oriented programs), and reviews of the school effectiveness literature. The literature is divided into three groups for coherent synthesis: group 1 consists of five case studies and a review of the literature, all of seminal significance and frequently cited; group 2 includes studies and reviews that address further the issues raised in the studies in the first group; and group 3 studies do not utilize measures of student  achievement and are the least frequently cited. The synthesis of this literature begins with consideration of definitions and concepts of school effectiveness and of qualifications limiting the applicability of the research findings. The review then discusses the major factors affecting school effectiveness as identified in the research, including time on task, expectations for student achievement, student success rates, curriculum alignment, staff task orientation, behavior management techniques, school environment, staff cooperation, instructional leadership, parent participation, and instructional practices.

        "description":"Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized the creation of sex desegregation assistance centers (SDACs) to provide local education agencies with technical assistance and training for improving sex fairness in education. This role was later expanded to include assisting local districts in implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. This document reports the results of a survey designed to obtain information on the role, function, and effectiveness of the SDACs, to determine the current need for sex desegregation assistance, to suggest future directions for civil rights assistance activities, and to identify areas for future research and investigation. The surveys were completed by all 11 directors of the SDACs and by 6 of the 10 regional office directors of  the Office of Civil Rights (OCR). The report focuses on the differing perceptions of the SDAC and the OCR directors, SDAC coordination with other agencies, SDAC evaluation and accountability, factors inhibiting provision of optimally effective services, and achievements in promoting sex equity. The researchers found needs for the services; for consistent administration, support, and federal funding; for coordination between SDACs and other agencies; and for a comprehensive, longterm evaluation of the program.

In I:TO, the child was placed in a separate room used exclusively for time-out. Used as a last resort, punishment usually meant loss of privilege. Staff coded and weighted inappropriate behavior. Analysis of mean antecedent and subsequent behavior values obtained with the use of punishment, I:TO and E:TO indicated that severity of behaviors increased with both the use of punishment and the two types of time-out.

        "description":"The study, involving 100 children (11 and 12 years old), was designed to generate descriptive data regarding the behavioral and psychometric characteristics of exceptional children in the public schools. A review of the literature revealed that it is difficult to make a differential diagnosis among educable mentally retarded (EMR), emotionally disturbed (ED), and learning disabled (LD) students when behavioral and psychometric characteristics of each group are considered. Limited empirical research has been undertaken to quantify similarities or differences in the characteristics of these categories of exceptional students in the public schools. Five groups of Ss (20 EMR, 20 ED, 20 LD, 20 at-risk, and 20 normal) were directly observed in the public schools and were assessed by  commonly used psychometric measures. The latter two groups served as controls to evaluate the effectiveness of the behavior observation procedure and to serve as comparison groups for the observational procedure and the psychometric test battery. Teams of observers and certified psychometricians collected behavioral and psychometric data in 22 elementary schools. Results indicated that the exceptional, at-risk, and normal students did not differ in behavioral characteristics. However, data suggested that exceptional children showed lower frequencies of non-task oriented behavior and higher frequencies of task oriented behavior when placed in special education resource rooms. Cognitive, achievement, self concept, and visual-motor measures were administered to all groups. Results suggested  that exceptional children do not differ among groups on achievement, self concept, and visual-motor measures. At-risk and normal Ss generally yielded significantly higher scores on all psychometric assessment devices. Findings of the investigation with regard to the labeling and placement of exceptional children in special education programs were discussed. Also considered were the efficacy of special education resource room programs, noncategorical special education models, and implications for teacher preparation. (Author/SW)",

Previous studies have found that the use of cooperative learning instructional processes can improve relations between normal-progress students and mainstreamed handicapped students; however, these processes incorporate class-paced instruction, which is generally not appropriate for handicapped students. Principal components of the Team-Assisted Individualization Program (TAI) were four- or five-member teams each with high, average, and low achievers; presentation of a diagnostic test at the beginning of the project on mathematics  operations; individualized curriculum materials covering addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, numeration, decimals, fractions, and word problems; the team study method; team scores and team recognition; and teacher review sessions. A materials-only (MO) group used the same curriculum materials and procedures as the TAI group except the students worked individually and did not receive team scores or certificates. The control group used traditional methods for teaching mathematics. Ss were evaluated on sociometric measures, mathematics achievement, attitudes, and behavior ratings. Results confirmed the hypothesis that the cooperative individualized program for mathematics instruction (TAI) would increase the sociometric status of mainstreamed academically handicapped students.  However, it appeared that the use of cooperation per se may not have been the critical component of the program, because the mainstreamed students in the groups using individualized curriculum materials only also improved significantly in sociometric status.

Following a foreword (part 1), part 2 offers several definitions of vocational evaluation and vocational assessment. Part 3 compares school-based and rehabilitation-oriented vocational evaluation programs in terms of physical facilities, target populations, tools and techniques, goals and objectives, staffing, and enabling legislation. In part 4, tools of vocational evaluation are defined and their applications described. Tools are divided into three categories: situations as tools (on-the-job evaluation, work samples, psychometrics), resource tools (occupational  information, referral information), and applied tools (interviewing procedures, observational procedures, reporting procedures, job analysis, learning assessment). The purpose of part 5 is to describe the vocational evaluation process as it typically exists within a Comprehensive Vocational Evaluation Center (CVEC). The CVEC follows an eight step approach: referral/intake, orientation, initial interview, individual evaluation planning, formal testing/feedback, staffing, final report, and follow-up. A sixth part considers the relationship between vocational evaluation and the individualized education program, while part 7 offers a summary of vocational evaluation. Appendixes include a vocational evaluation system outline, a form with suggested guidelines for evaluating work samples, a  report titled &quot;The Mobile Unit for Vocational Evaluation,&quot; a sample vocational evaluation referral form, an outline for an initial interview, an example of a well-planned and documented referral to an evaluation unit from a field counselor, and a vocational evaluation final report.

Information is organized around seven questions: what is the purpose of the evaluation? what information is needed, and from what sources can it be obtained? when and under what conditions will information be gathered? by what means can information be obtained? how will the information be analyzed? how will the evaluation plan be accomplished, and what are the constraints on this plan? and how and to whom will the evaluation results be reported? Five purposes of evaluation are addressed: to make decisions about program installation; to make decisions about program development and modification; to make decisions about continuation, expansion,  certification, or termination of a program; to marshall evidence for support of or opposition to a program; and to advance the understanding of basic psychological, educational, social, and other processes. The process for determining what information is needed and the sources for obtaining that data are considered. Types of analytic designs (including true experimental and quasi-experimental designs) are pointed out, and charts of some basic evaluation designs are offered. The types of measures for obtaining data and considerations for selecting appropriate measures are pointed out. Defined are differences in kinds of statistics, level of measurement, and analysis techniques. Some practical matters concerning evaluation roles and responsibilities, resource review, cost estimates, and  ethical guidelines are mentioned. Finally, the impact of the final evaluation report is reviewed.

In Phase I, open ended interviews were conducted to identify the themes, patterns, and the range of responses which characterize how parents define and describe preschool services. The information gathered in the open ended interviews was used to develop a quantitative rating scale which was administered in Phase II of the study. All of the interviews were audiotaped and transcribed on unisort cards. Results were drawn from three  sources of data -- the open-ended interviews, the frequency counts and percentages from the Phase II quantitative rating measure, and direct quotes of parents. Data were categorized in terms of parent perceptions of child needs prior to placement, benefits and drawbacks for parents in regard to their child's potential, opportunities to engage in parent activities, attitudes toward parent activities, and parents' perceptions of an ideal preschool. Among findings were that the most salient issue for parents is the importance of having a warm, sensitive, and well trained teacher who is able and willing to communicate frequently with the parents; that parents have definite needs which influence their choice of preschool, including services for themselves and logistical arrangements; and that  almost all of the parents preferred having some sort of role in their child's education.

Among responses were the following: 93% of parents were notified of the individualized education program (IEP) meeting; 39% reported not doing anything special to get ready for the meeting; 63% thought their opinions were considered by other people at the meeting; and 57% knew by the end of the meeting how and when the effectiveness of the IEP program would be evaluated. Results suggested a need to increase active parental participation through the establishment of professional guidelines for  conferences with parents; identification of a liaison person to explain the IEP process to the parents; and provision of parental training through flyers, meeting preparation worksheets, or a video tape portraying meaningful parental participation.

        "description":"Intended for teachers, the document provides a framework for developing curricula for gifted and talented students in Georgia. Section 1 offers a rationale for the curriculum framework and considers components of curriculum design. It is pointed out that by providing varied and ongoing experiences in the composite world of the learner (arts/sciences/humanities), the entire curriculum program for the gifted learner renders an open-ended framework for exploring vocations and avocations compatible with interests, needs, and abilities of individual students. Section 2, which makes up most of the document, contains a variety of mini-courses or units of study designed for and field tested with gifted and talented students enrolled in special education programs within local Georgia  school systems. Courses represent a variety of ages and levels of development (primary through senior high). Each mini-course is presented as a sample, model, or prototype. The section begins with an introduction to the mini-course and a sample evaluative instrument. Goals and procedures for conducting an independent study program are outlined. Another part contains an outline for teachers to use in organizing a study tour (a project in which the student develops a product which helps gain more sophisticated skills in specified performance areas). A mini-course titled &quot;Say Cheez&quot; contains nine parts with lessons and activities for primary through senior high school students. Subsequent mini-courses cover subjects which include the following: emotions and creativity, American Indian art  and customs, proverbs and fables, flying machines, rocks and minerals, string sculpture, creative dramatics, family finances, communication, architecture, oceanography, career exploration, speedreading, Greek and Roman mythology, and humor in literature. Usually outlined for each mini-course are student objectives, thought processes to be developed, instructional materials, content, questions to be considered by students, activities and strategies, and evaluation procedures.

Introductory information includes self appraisal questions for the service provider and an overview of the assessment process. The major portion of the document consists of sample forms and explanatory information concerning the five steps of the assessment process: the family interview form, the parent questionnaire, the resource utilization checklist, the family needs inventory, and the individual family plan. A sample case history of a 5-year-old with behavior problems is  used to demonstrate the assessment process and the use of the forms. Following the forms, there is a section which provides additional suggestions coded to components of the family needs inventory; a list of 118 books, pamphlets, audio-visual materials, kits and curricula listed alphabetically by topic; and a list of 33 organizations that work with people with various handicapping conditions. The final section contains blank copies of the forms and an evaluation report of the use of the program assessment process with 162 children in 138 families in Thomasville, Georgia. A videocassette of the Family Assessment Process has been produced to supplement the manual. (DB)",

Instead of studying the new language in a school setting, the student receives a week of orientation and is then placed in the community and expected to practice communicating with the native speakers at every opportunity. The student follows a course prepared by the Foreign Service Institute and uses textbooks for self-teaching. The emphasis is placed on observation of and involvement with the native population as well as frequent practice speaking the new language with native speakers. A native language informant is employed by each missionary to assist in intonation and pronunciation. A series of language drill tapes and a self-paced program titled &quot;First Lessons in Bemba&quot; provide  support for language practice. The student prepares a speech related to daily living and then practices it in the community as often as possible during the course of a day. This language learning approach has been successful and widely accepted by the Zambians. It is seen as a means of combatting the ethnocentrism and cultural myopia prevalent in the United States and learning about the diverse languages and cultures of the world. (RW)",

The repeated measurement technique used to check internal consistency of responses and concurrent validity of the affective questions was found to be a reliable method. The affective questionnaire was found to have a degree of convergent and divergent validity although contaminating factors such as self-flattery, social acceptance, and consistency may influence responses. Exposure indices and affective  variables were better predictors of language proficiency for the Japanese and Chinese students than for the Thai students. Positive attitudes toward English were positively related to English proficiency among the Chinese students. Affective variables were better predictors of English proficiency for the Chinese than for the other students.

        "description":"The effect of humor on retention of lecture material was studied with 100 undergraduate students at California State University, Dominguez Hills. Within each class, students were divided into four equal groups, and four versions of a lecture on language development were presented on videotape by a college faculty member. The lectures were identical in content and varied only in type of humor: (1) humor related directly to items in the learning test; (2) humor unrelated to the items being tested; (3) no humor; and (4) a repetition of the concept that preceded the related joke (repetition control condition). Both the related and unrelated jokes were inserted in identical places within the lecture content. A joke was considered related if it was associated with, or served as, a  mnemonic device for the concept to be learned and recalled. Information learned or recalled from the lectures and data regarding each subject's attitude toward the lecture and the speaker were assessed, along with ratings of the level of humor in the 10 jokes from the related humor lecture. The related humor lecture facilitated retention of information significantly more than both the unrelated humor and the nonrepetition control lectures. The nonrepetition control and the unrelated humor conditions were recalled equally well. That is, repetition, whether or not through the use of humor, enhanced recall. Furthermore, subjects found the humorous presentation more enjoyable. It is concluded that in cases of rote learning, related jokes contribute by both repeating the concept and making the  learning process more enjoyable. (SW)",

        "description":"The objectives and techniques of faculty evaluation are examined. It is suggested that the reasons for the evaluation process play a significant role in how such evaluations are perceived by all involved and how successful the process will be in reaching the objectives of the evaluation process. Four specific competencies that can be evaluated are: technical skills, interpersonal relationship skills, conceptual skills, and dedication. Generally, there are four commonly used systems or styles of evaluation in use today with education: self-evaluation/self-assessment, administrative evaluation/assessment, peer evaluation, and student evaluation. Study findings have revealed that the most common system of evaluation involves only student and administrative evaluation. When  evaluation information is used as feedback to aid in staff self-development, research suggests that teachers, staff, and administrators favor such evaluation. However, if this information is used exclusively for administrative decisions such as rehiring, dismissal, salary increments, and tenure, teachers do not support evaluation. The Peer and Self-Evaluation Checklist, which is appended, may be used for self-evaluation, administrative evaluation, and peer evaluation, and covers six competency areas. Criticisms of self-evaluation and about evaluation in general are identified. Appended materials include evaluation forms used by Ohio Northern University; an instructional or coinstructional assessment sheet that delineates the quantitative tasks that absorb an individual's time and effort;  student evaluation form for physical education activity class; form for student evaluation of course instruction; and faculty evaluation form.

        "description":"A constitutional analysis is presented of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of Senate Bill 550, the Packwood-Moynihan proposal for federal tuition tax credits for parents who pay tuition in order to send their children to a nonpublic school. The Supreme Court has developed a three-part standard under the Establishment Clause: the legislation must have a secular purpose and a secular effect and it must not create excessive entanglements between government and religion. With respect to the secular purpose requirement, the articulated purpose of the Packwood-Moynihan proposal is to promote educational (not religious) pluralism and to enhance educational opportunity for all Americans at their chosen schools. The entanglements test has two concerns: whether legislation  creates undue administrative involvements between church and state; and whether it fosters serious political divisiveness or fragmentation along religious lines. It is suggested that whereas the secular purpose and entanglements tests should not threaten the validity of federal tuition tax credits, the secular effect requirement presents a more difficult question. Attention is directed to the Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist decision, which invalidated New York's tuition tax benefit program. Among the arguments favoring the bill are the following: the proposal would grant assistance to individuals, not institutions; it proposed national tax legislation in line with the power of Congress to tax and spend; aid can be viewed as going to nonideological secular functions of  church-related schools; and the legislation might help reserve freedom of educational choice which the Supreme Court has held is constitutionally protected. The text of the bill is appended. (SW)",

It is suggested that solving problems of organization will lead to shifts in management style, which in turn may affect flows of funds to disciplines. The outcome may be a change in academic scope and either limiting or expanding institutional opportunities. The principal questions for research on institutional finance stem from an understanding that colleges and universities are not businesses, and from a shift of attention away from questions of productive efficiency and toward a new understanding of the importance of process in the structuring of institutional finance. It is claimed that colleges and universities are not businesses because they are not organized vertically, are not concerned  with profit, and have not traditionally invested much energy and resources in the process of conducting business itself. In organizing an institutional research agency, it is important to recognize that the American campus is fundamentally like a municipality, and that the problems that institutions of higher education will face in the 1980s--organizationally, structurally, and financially--are similar to those that American communities have been facing for more than a decade. Questions on curriculum and the scope of the academic enterprise are addressed in relation to financial planning. Additional topics include: public policy related to the financing of graduate education; changes in how the federal government pays for sponsored research; and the financial consequences of regulations,  competition, and cooperation among institutions.

Demographic and academic profiles were developed, and persistence rates were calculated for the overall population of 3,166 freshmen, and by gender and ethnicity. Additional demographic variables were residency status and age. The academic variables included major, composite American College Testing (ACT) score, rank in high school graduating class, first semester grade point average (GPA), last semester of attendance, and cumulative earned hours. Forty-seven percent ranked in the top two deciles of their high school graduating classes; 84 percent ranked in the upper half. Almost 75 percent earned a GPA above 2.0 during their first semester, and the most popular major was business. Of the  1,625 males in the study population, 571 persisted to graduation by fall semester 1981, and an additional 138 persisted but failed to graduate. Among the 1,541 females there were 562 persisters, 435 graduates and 127 nongraduates. Graduates and persisters were on the average slightly younger and also had higher average high school ranks, ACT composite scores, and first semester GPAs. Among those majors enrolling more than 75 students, the highest combined rates of persistence and graduation were in engineering, architecture, biological science, business, communication, and health science. Asians achieved the highest combined persistence rate (63 percent). Among the important indicators of persistence were previous academic performance and first semester GPA. Other factors that should be  considered include whether students have clear academic objectives and the needs of minorities. (SW)",

Twenty-eight relatively specific major fields and 11 more general major fields are covered, along  with majors in professional fields, arts and sciences, and other fields. Of the approximately 930,000 persons who received bachelor's degrees in the 1976-1977 academic year, an estimated 68 percent were employed full-time; but the unemployment rate was 5.8 percent, and 24 percent of those employed full-time were underemployed. The average annual salary for those employed full-time was about $11,500. Bachelor's recipients who majored in professional fields fared better than bachelor's recipients who majored in the arts and sciences. However, arts and sciences graduates were much more likely than graduates in professional fields to be enrolled for an advanced degree, which discourages working full-time.

Policy instruments are tuition, admissions requirements, location of different kinds of colleges, and draft deferments. The following economic and social environmental factors are indirectly influenced by government: the social status of the student's neighborhood, the opportunity cost of the student's study time, and the size of the anticipated earnings payoff to college graduation. A binominal logit model was fitted to the college attendance behavior of 27,046 male high school juniors, divided into 20 subgroups  defined by student ability and family income, in 1960. Tuition, high admission standards travel costs, and room and board costs had significant negative effects on attendance. The highest elasticities of demand were found for the low-income strata and lower-middle ability quartile, suggesting that an efficient subsidy program should focus on these groups. The powerful impacts of public policy measures and draft pressure suggest that the Vietnam War and public policy shifts that lowered the real cost of college attendance contributed to the high growth rate of college attendance in the 1950s and 1960s. The policies that contributed to this growth were increased student aid, liberalized admission requirements, and the establishment of new community colleges and public universities in  previously unserved areas.

Beyond access to education the interest in justice for students appears as a demand for uniform standards across a system. In addition, personnel and whole enterprises steadily pursue equitable treatment. The call for competence comes in many ways: the work of academic individuals and groups, the quality of students at entry and exit, and the effectiveness of institutions and systems. A third set of values that affect systems of higher education links together choice, initiative, innovation, criticism, and variety; and the central idea in this complex is liberty. Departmental groups seek self-determination within  the university, and the university presses for autonomy from the state and outside groups. This set of values includes the powerful academic ideologies of freedom of research, freedom of teaching, and freedom of learning. Loyalty values are connected with the state-university relationship. What the state wants from the higher education system may include socioeconomic relevance, defined in terms of practicality and professionalization; cultural relevance, referring to cultural revival and national identity; and political relevance, defined as good citizenship and commitment to political goals. Actions carried out on behalf of the different values often clash and necessitate accommodations that lessen conflict and allow simultaneous expression. Six ideas are offered regarding accommodation  of conflict of these values. It is suggested that competence and liberty require sectors and hierarchies, while merit and choice entail differences and rankings. (SW)",

        "description":"Previous analyses of higher education policy in Sweden are addressed to examine the nature of the major tradeoffs between values. In addition, a set of value categories relevant to higher education policy in general is suggested. Values identified as particularly relevant to the analysis of higher education policy are equality, excellence, autonomy, accountability, and efficiency. Higher education admission policy, the geographic location of new institutions, and many nontraditional teaching and learning modes are motivated by values of equality. In addition, the desire to achieve greater equality of status between different institutions and programs was a chief motive behind a 1977 decision to create an integrated system of higher education. In recent years, excellence in higher  education has begun to be emphasized and admission regulations have been adopted that will improve the relative standing of applicants with high academic merits. While autonomy and the freedom to choose between alternative courses of action has been an important value, the Swedish system is centralized and uniform in terms of decision-making authority. The desire to improve accountability by opening up higher education institutions to various external interests has been most pronounced with respect to undergraduate education. Efforts to improve efficiency in Swedish higher education are also noted. Value conflicts and tradeoffs are addressed, including equality versus excellence and autonomy versus accountability. One specific problem concerns the links between tradeoffs in higher  education policy and the more general problem of meritocracy. It is suggested that higher education policy must relate to a broader set of policies vis-a-vis the role and distribution of knowledge in society. (SW)",

        "description":"A comparative analysis of the process by which conflicting interests are implemented in the higher education systems of the United States, England, Sweden, and France is presented. Attention is also directed to differentiation in these systems, and to the systems' receptiveness to such differentiation (i.e., splitting up existing functions, or adopting new, distinct roles for higher education). Although focus was on the varied roles of the state with respect to differentiation, consideration was given to the power relations of groups and the ways in which particular systems promoted the access of certain groups to the policy-making process. Implementation of the sometimes conflicting interests of social justice, competence, academic freedom, autonomy, or accountability is  basically a matter of relations between the higher education system and society. The key to the flexibility of the system, to its receptiveness to differentiation, appears to be the balance of the relationship (or the power differential) between the academic profession and the laity. In addition, the commitment of the academic profession to challenging interest interpretations and emphases introduced from outside the higher education system is important. The contrasting cases of Sweden and France reveal that state intervention is sometimes necessary to ensure the responsiveness of higher education to market demands. A strong legislative branch in government seems to be especially conducive to the openness of the system to access by lay groups, particularly in the policy-making realm.  (SW)",

        "description":"Hearings on the effects of recently enacted cutbacks in social security student benefits are presented. Since the Reagan administration proposed phasing out the social security students benefits, attention is directed to whether needy students who would have received these benefits will receive benefits under the other student aid programs. The efforts of the Social Security Administration (SSA) to notify students now receiving the benefits about the cutbacks are also addressed. Students who are not attending college in May 1982 will not be eligible for any grants, and students in college in February 1982 will have their benefits phased out over a 4-year period. Total savings of $2.3 billion are estimated as a result of the cutbacks, which were enacted by the Budget  Reconciliation Act in 1981. An estimated 100,000 to 150,000 high school seniors are affected by this change in eligibility. Social Security benefits have been paid to 18- to 22-year old children of retired, disabled, or deceased workers if they are full-time students, regardless of individual need, with the level of benefits related to the parents' past earnings. Questions have been raised about the adequacy of SSA's efforts to notify beneficiaries of the benefit cutoffs. According to the Associate Commissioner of SSA, a nationwide public information campaign about changes in the law has been conducted. In regard to other financial aid, the administration proposal for fiscal year 1983 eliminates funding for two campus-based programs and reduces funding in the College Work Study program.  (SW)",

        "description":"The reasons academically gifted high school seniors select institutions of higher education and their interest in precollege, university-level courses were studied. Gifted seniors in the Tucson Unified School District were mailed the Higher Education Orientation Inventory (HEOI), an adaptation of the Graduate Student Satisfaction Questionnaire. Gifted seniors were identified as those scoring at or above the 90th percentile on at least two of the three sub-areas of the California Achievement Test, Form C, Level 18. A total of 165 responses were analyzed with a principal components analysis followed by a varimax rotation. Findings for the 73 males and 92 females from 10 high schools were as follows: there was a substantial interest in attending university-level courses; of the 29  reasons posed there were 4 underlying factors of choice (the academic quality of the institution, special institutional features, social aspects of the institution, socioeconomic forces); and the academic quality factor had three aspects (instruction, interaction, and independence). Specifically, 84 percent of the academically gifted seniors felt that earning college credit before high school graduation was valuable, and 73 percent indicated that they would attend an intensive college-level course if it were offered. However, only 59 percent were interested in attending a summer university program designed to introduce them to college life. It is suggested that findings would be valuable to college and university administrators, recruiters, and high school counselors. Appended information  includes factor loadings of the 29 reasons for choice of schools posed by the HEOI. (SW)",

        "description":"The effect of student evaluations of teaching on administrative personnel decisions at the Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario, was investigated. In addition, the apparent impact of summative student evaluation of teaching upon faculty attitudes and faculty teaching performance was assessed. In the Department of Psychology, undergraduate student evaluations are obtained by a 10-item questionnaire that focuses mainly on expositional skills such as clarity, preparation, and use of examples, and includes a final overall effectiveness item. It was found that: student evaluations of teaching contributed significantly to decisions on faculty salary and tenure, but not to decisions on promotion to full professor; after 12 years of mandatory summative evaluation,  faculty members continue to have generally favorable attitudes toward student evaluations of teaching and their use in administrative personnel decisions; and the mean level of teaching effectiveness of the Department of Psychology as a whole has improved substantially over the past 12 years, presumably due, at least in part, to the incentive and selection functions of summative evaluation of teaching. It is suggested that a fully effective teaching evaluation system must include both formative and summative components in order to effect the right combination of feedback, motivation, training, and selection needed to gain faculty acceptance and to produce significant improvement in individual and institutional performance.

        "description":"Approaches to cooperation between colleges and schools in serving students capable of advanced work are examined. Two major ways of serving bright high school students within their own schools in coordination with colleges are: programs developed by individual colleges with particular high schools, and the College Board's Advanced Placement (AP) program. A notable example of a program developed by an individual college is the Syracuse University Project Advance. The College Board distributes its curriculum materials to high schools that wish to participate in the AP program. The quality of the high school offerings is safeguarded through nationally developed tests in any given discipline that are taken by participating high school students. Data on student participation in the AP  program and migration patterns of AP candidates as they go to college are examined by states. Many colleges award sophomore status to high school students who present qualifying grades in enough AP examinations. Courses, institutes, or seminars on college campuses open to high school (and sometimes younger) students represent another approach to serving the needs of bright youths. Some programs are noncredit enrichment efforts, while others award regular college credits. Joint enrollment of high school seniors who earn credits from the college and the high school simultaneously is a growing phenomenon. The most prevalent college involvement in serving gifted youngsters is through special summer offerings. Summer programs funded by state departments of education, early identification of  talented students, student fee arrangements, training teachers of the gifted, and state support for educating the gifted are also noted.

        "description":"Changes in access to higher education with regard to sex, race, and social class of college students during 1940-1980, a period of expansion in higher education, are analyzed. Seven hypotheses concerning access to higher education are examined, based on statistical data from various sources. It is hypothesized that race, sex, and class differentials in access to higher education have narrowed during this period. It is also hypothesized that financial factors affect where people go to college and that stratification within higher education has become greater over time. It is concluded that since at least 1965, there has been an increase in college access among those of lower socioeconomic origins. While in 1940, men and women 25-29 years old had completed at least some college in  about equal proportions, by 1960, men had a 50 percent advantage. In the last decade, women have almost reached parity with men in terms of college attendance, but in terms of retention, institutions have been more successful with men than with women. Race differentials in access to higher education have also narrowed between 1940 and the present, though most of the narrowing has been due to the increased rates of high school graduation among minorities. It is suggested that recognition as legitimate pressure groups has enabled blacks and women to make greater inroads into the better higher education institutions, while those from lower social origins have not achieved significant political mobilization and have tended to be more skewed toward the lower end of the higher education  hierarchy. Problems involved in attempting to reconstruct data on college access from diverse sources are addressed. (SW)",

        "description":"The political dynamics surrounding the adoption of an open admissions policy at the City University of New York (CUNY) are discussed. Analysis of the case of CUNY also provides a basis for considering the politics of structural change in American higher education. It is suggested that when Chancellor Albert Bowker took office in 1963, he followed a systematic policy of rapid institutional expansion. In view of the fact that CUNY's traditional constituency, the Jewish population, was declining, Bowker hoped to increase enrollments by incorporating the Black and Puerto Rican communities into the CUNY coalition. Bitter conflict ensued over the pace of change: for many of the increasingly militant minority population, it was too slow, while for many White ethnics, it was too fast.  The seizure of the South Campus at City College in 1968 presented Bowker with an opportunity to capitalize upon widespread fear of racial insurrection to break an admission stalemate between Blacks and Jews. He was able to use the mobilization of the City's Blacks and Puerto Rican masses to realize his objective of adopting a policy of universal access to CUNY. The open admissions policy ended the battles over places in the freshman class and also meant that the university's resources would increase. It is concluded that, above all, open admissions constituted a solution to a distinctively political problem faced by the university. As long as the demand for places in the university far exceeded the supply, the issue of admissions would have been one of conflict. Any attempt to expand  opportunities for minorities at CUNY at the expense of other groups would have aroused great opposition. The substantial size of the City's growing minority populations required that they be incorporated into the CUNY coalition. (SW)",

        "description":"Key federal policy decisions since World War II that have affected the number and characteristics of students entering higher education and, overall, the social-stratification role of higher education are reviewed. The focus is on legislation and other policy decisions concerning student aid, community colleges, and postsecondary vocational education. Attention is also directed to institutional aid, higher education coordination and planning, persons and groups instrumental to the passage of major legislative enactments, and the climate of opinion in which federal policy decisions have been made. From 1945 to 1958, the central arguments in favor of increased access were that: the United States faced severe shortages of highly trained manpower, the Soviet Union was dangerously  ahead in the training of such manpower, and the realization of the goal of equality of opportunity required equality of access to higher education. While initially, discussions about who should enter college mostly focused on the highly talented, attention shifted in the early 1960s to specific social groups, notably black and lower-income youth. Policymakers did not rely primarily on the goal of equality of opportunity as a justification of greater access until the mid- to late 1960s. Among the issues pertaining to direct federal aid to colleges was the need for constructing academic facilities to respond to large increases in enrollment. Interest in community colleges and postsecondary vocational education accelerated markedly during the early 1960s. By the late 1960s, the focus of  attention was for aid to be used for general operating expenses. During 1973-1980, retrenchment in higher education was the major concern. Appendices provide a synopsis of federal higher education legislation and information on sources of funds for higher education, 1930-1980. (SW)",

The monographs discuss contemporary policy issues concerned with higher education's relationship with occupational training and present case studies of two- and four-year educational institutions. The focus is the benefits that have emerged for students in particular and institutions and communities in general as a result of successful relationships between CETA and higher education. The monographs highlight colleges and universities that have improved areas such as instruction, student services, linking work  and education, institutional leadership, policy development, and working with the private sector. The Higher Education/CETA Project has underscored the importance of the following three points: (1) in general, successful organizational structures and processes between CETA and higher education would apply to relationships between private and public training and employment organizations; (2) the programmatic relationships between CETA and higher education are not limited to improving the learning and life chances of CETA students but often apply to learners in general; and (3) college and university personnel, structures, and processes established and/or developed through relationships with CETA and the private sector will continue to be important in their own right and as they mesh with  future government-funded programs. Each monograph contains a series of action-oriented recommendations for higher education leaders and employment and training administrators. (SW)",

In addition, demographic factors and employment characteristics are examined since they provide a background for understanding college and university involvement with training and employment programs and services. Several case studies are included that illustrate successful occupational training and employment programs and services. Occupational education has been an established program in public education since before World War II, and during the 1960s and  1970s it grew steadily as college enrollments were increasing. A variety of occupational education programs and services that were more specialized than those available to traditional students in colleges and universities were developed to help those who were experiencing difficulty in entering the labor market. The case studies illustrate how two- and four-year colleges have responded in providing: classroom training in both academic and job-specific content skills in both blue-collar and white-collar occupations; employment services; employment and related research; program and policy evaluations; and continuing education for personnel specialists. Attention is focused on postsecondary programs and services funded under the CETA program. Recommendations for change are proposed in areas  such as funding patterns, the structure and role of higher education, and the delivery of programs and services. (SW)",

Attention is directed to the linkage between higher education and the federally-funded CETA program. The philosophical orientation of the CETA program, dollars expended, and persons served by the program are considered. Among the main functions of colleges working with the CETA program are the delivery of credit-based and job-specific classroom training and the provision of support services to participants. Training should enable workers to enter the job market, advance in their present job, or  keep pace with technology. Two options for postsecondary institutions interested in working with the CETA program include a nonfinancial agreement or a contract with a prime sponsor. The contractual basis offers the institution a wide range of opportunities, including: credit- and noncredit-oriented direct services to individuals, credit- and noncredit-oriented professional staff development, research and evaluation projects, and technical assistance and consultation services. Attention is directed to policy issues related to participants, organizations and personnel, educational finance, curricula, institutional evaluation, and to college involvement with employment and training programs established through operational alliances or decision-making influence. Strategies for providing  decision-making influence on the local and state levels and information on federal employment legislation are presented. (SW)",

An institution that collaborates in employee development efforts such as CETA can offer a range of possible contributions, including assessment services, basic skill development, job training, counseling services, and job development and placement. The use of existing instructional programs by CETA students is widespread, especially in community colleges. In some  cases, special programs are developed and conducted for only CETA students (i.e., class size programs). For many public institutions, when CETA prime sponsors totally fund class size offerings, they can design or customize the class to suit students' needs. Colleges and universities often have outstanding student service and continuing education components to provide career counseling and support to the unemployed. Opportunities for the four-year school to participate in CETA-type manpower development programs also exist, especially in the research and development area (i.e., curriculum guides and staff development expertise). The following aspects of higher education/CETA collaboration are addressed: contract and auditing routines and procedures, risk management and insurance,  administrative costs, and personnel considerations. Advantages of participation to the institution, instructional faculty and staff, students, and the private sector are discussed; and six brief case studies of collaborative projects are presented.

It is suggested that student services must continue to expand its role in working with nontraditional students, and that CETA funding and CETA-eligible students have challenged higher education's adaptability in programming and service delivery. One area of adaptation is instruction: student development courses are being integrated into the curriculum. Three major clusters of courses can be identified: courses in human  development, life planning, and personal understanding; courses emphasizing independent study and experential learning; and remedial, affective, and behavioral education courses. Colleges and universities have been able to bring their experience with curriculum development, career counseling, and support services to the disadvantaged student. On the other hand, CETA has provided a previously untapped source of students and additional revenue. The partnership has also created benefits for the non-CETA student, especially various nontraditional students who have benefited from new formats, curricula, and extended services. Many students have profited from materials and equipment provided by CETA funding, and faculty have benefited from the opportunity to work with nontraditional students.  The relationship between student services and CETA programs is discussed, and seven case studies are presented. (SW)",

A skill center is defined as a single organizational unit that provides training in multiple occupational areas. Skill centers, which provide trained persons for the private sector and also serve populations traditionally denied access to jobs, offer training in such varied occupations as office occupations, auto mechanics, food preparation, and electronic assembly. Centers offer a number of training programs in line with local employment needs, especially in new, rapidly changing, or  expanding occupations such as word processing, data processing, and cable T.V. installation. Training cycles range from 6 to 52 weeks. Some training programs are company specific and the curricula stress hands-on training. Allied instruction and services are an integral part of the curriculum at many skill centers, and instruction in mathematics, reading, and writing is frequently offered. In addition, students are offered services that enhance their ability to obtain and remain in a job. Since most skill centers are funded wholly or in large part by CETA, the students must meet CETA eligibility criteria. The organizational structures of college-associated skill centers and advantages of locating skill centers in colleges are discussed. Three case studies are presented that demonstrate  varied organizational structures for college skill centers, the range and types of programs and services, the types of participants served, and the geographic mix of institutions.

Title VII of the CETA legislation created the Private Sector Initiative Program (PSIP) to involve business and industry in the design, implementation, and assessment of CETA-funded training programs and services. The major program objective is to secure unsubsidized employment for disadvantaged workers. The program mandates the establishment of private industry councils (PICs), which evaluate local labor markets and  training and job placement programs. There are indications that PICs are turning to higher education, especially community colleges, for training programs. Four-year colleges and universities are also involved in conducting research needed by local PICs, and often provide an array of occupational training programs and services. Based on case studies, interviews with employers, and interviews with current and previous CETA participants, needs of CETA participants and barriers to successful training, employment, and job retention are identified. It is suggested that in pre-employment training key learning activities should be integrated throughout all activities. Barriers include the following: low self-esteem, lack of acceptable work attitudes and behaviors, below-minimal levels in basic  academic skills, and inadequate job search skills. Recommendations to PICs and to higher education are offered, and five case studies that outline education's involvement are presented. (SW)",

The most significant benefits obtained by agencies from work with higher education have been: access to qualitatively sound, existing resources; the public legitimacy and respect that programs associated with higher education enjoy; cost-effective services; and flexibility in selecting from a wide range of resources that most colleges and universities command. A typical pattern of involvement by two-year colleges includes provision of training programs for the disadvantaged and other  supportive job-related services. Other lines of local activity by colleges and universities are administrative support services, including data processing, and labor market surveys. In addition, colleges have assisted with interagency coordination, and the continuing education divisions have been a source of technical assistance and staff training for local employment and training agencies. The principal purposes of cooperation between higher education and state employment and training programs include: development of information to support new policy or program initiatives; and support for implementation and further development of new technologies for training, program planning, or administration. Higher education has also developed and disseminated significant new knowledge about  statewide and national issues in the human resources area. Examples of the types of work completed are briefly described. Historical, administrative, and philosophical barriers to linkage are considered, along with the potential for future cooperation.

Information on program objectives, issues, and problems was obtained from work with students at the University of Pittsburgh, the literature, program records, and interviews with foundation officials. The foundation administers a scholarship program to enable students to study abroad in areas of priority for the country, including the development of scientific and technological independence, the preparation of high quality scientists and technicians, and the development of the capacity to prepare technical personnel within Venezuela. Students are chosen to study in areas such as petroleum and petrochemicals,  agriculture, the sciences, education, and engineering. Special attention is placed on recruiting scholars from low-income families and from the nonmetropolitan areas of Venezuela. By 1978 the program emphasized higher-level technical education and graduate education rather than undergraduate education. Among the problems that were encountered were: a lack of understanding of the nature of the U.S. liberal arts college; the U.S. system of accreditation and measures of quality; the different types of higher education and degrees; the relationship of the student's thesis with Venezuelan development needs; the quality of the relationship between the Venezuelan sponsoring agency and the student; Venezuelan students' feeling of isolation in the United States; placement in Venezuela after  studying abroad; issues relating to educating undergraduates in Venezuela; revalidation of degrees and professional training; and preparation of students for overseas study.

        "description":"Basic problems associated with the role of college faculty, working conditions and situational adjustments, and interpersonal relationships are investigated. Unresolved problems and the social structural circumstances that generate and perpetuate them are also examined. The sociological literature regarding the potential problems in academic work is reviewed, and the results of surveying faculty in the fields of history, political science, biology, and business economics are examined. Four categories of problems are identified: professional, organizational, collegial, and client. Professional problems derive from the limitations of graduate training and professional organizations, while organizational problems stem from the fact that college professors are not free professionals,  but employees who work within complex, formal organizations. Collegial problems arise because professors within departments, and sometimes between departments, are dependent upon one another. Client problems exist because professors must interact frequently and directly with students and because student opinions and actions may influence the professor's careers. Interviews were conducted and the Potential Problems Inventory was administered to faculty members from the four departments in both a private college and state college. Among the findings was that enrollment economics pose the most acute problem facing these college professors today. There appears to be a shift from the traditional academic ethos to a market ethos, which threatens the usual patterns of relationship between  professor and the discipline, the college, the students, and colleagues. A bibliography, questionnaire, and interview schedule are appended. (SW)",

In addition to the option of awarding academic or nonacademic credit, some training programs lead to a licensing exam, or provide preparation for a General Education Diploma. A certificate of completion may be awarded to indicate that the individual has studied and mastered a body of content, such as auto mechanics or English, for a given length of time. There are also programs such as apprenticeships and proprietary school training. Most of  the studies relating to the credentializing of CETA training indicate that a credential for training or education is generally considered valuable, particularly for employment. In some instances, it is the credential, not the training or skills, that determines employment. In the case of the participants, the awarding of credit is seen by some CETA staff as a possible motivator and source of self-esteem. Many employers feel that academic credit for training indicates some qualities important to successful employment, including dependability and staying with a project until completion. Generally, academic credit seems to be most valuable if it leads to a degree or diploma. The problem of establishing credit for training offered by community-based organizations and other barriers to  awarding academic credit are reviewed, along with examples of successful credit-awarding programs. It is noted that a record of credentials may be important in 5 or 10 years for verification of the CETA participant's training. (SW)",

The study was concerned with differential instructional effectiveness, as measured by cognitive dependent outcomes attributable to illustration iconicity. Both automated information retrieval and manual search procedures of selected indices and references were used to identify a final sample pool of 121 data sets. Four major variables--illustrations, pacing, grade level, and achievement--and five physical attributes of treatment illustrations--production, shading, context,  embellishment, and chroma--were coded. A jackknife technique was used to average 2,607 effect-size values across all studies and all variables. Results showed that illustrated treatments were more effective than verbal treatments, illustrations were most effective with secondary students, and externally paced illustrations were more effective than internally paced illustrations; color illustrations were more effective than black and white.

        "description":"The effects of intervening synthesis/review sheets, periodic practice worksheets, a combination of review and practice, and an advance organizer on learning from prose text were investigated. Using 161 college students as subjects, the study increasingly added learner activities to an instructional unit (Lamberski's revised edition of the Dwyer heart materials) to determine their effect on achievement. The short unit-introduction statement was replaced with an advance organizer containing general orienting information, educational objectives, and a preview of posttest question types. Initial analysis showed no significant differences among treatment groups, and increased time spent on learning activities did not correspond to increased achievement. A related study providing  scores on the same prose/test arrangement without an extended advance organizer and another study identifying problems with the original Dwyer text provided a basis for further analysis. Results suggest that the pre-set that the subjects received with additional information in the advance organizer introduction made a difference in learning and storage of the material for testing. It was concluded that difficult or detailed concept learning may require more planned instructional activity (such as review and practice) than reading a text or viewing a visual. (LMM)",

The hypothesis proposed that instructional treatments utilizing reduced step size and elaborate visual cueing alone and in combination would be superior to treatments using larger step size and simple visual cueing. Parts of Dwyer's instructional materials were modified and used with varying degrees of visual cueing. Simple visual cues employed were static position indicators. Dynamic-process arrows, motion indicators, and shading were used as elaborate cues. Immediate and delayed posttests were administered to 92 university students in four treatment groups, following self-paced  interaction with assigned instruction presentations. Results showed that visual step size affected achievement on certain criterion tasks. Selective reduction of visual step size had an overall facilitative effect on immediate learning and on the individual drawing task, but effect was maintained only on the drawing test. Instructional treatments differing only in degree of visual cueing used were equally effective. No advantage was gained in visualized instruction by using elaborate visual cueing.

The 176 college student subjects received instruction and testing using varied combinations of color or black/white materials. Instructional materials were a self-paced learning booklet with simple line drawings, word labels, and prose text on the human heart. Self-paced test materials measured four cognitive knowledge tasks. Color-coded, self-paced presentation materials were superior to black/white presentation materials on both immediate and delayed posttests; however, color presence in evaluation materials did not affect achievement. The effectiveness of color-coded instructional  materials may result from the sustained student attention and content interaction they demand and the enhanced associative memory structure they provide. Color-coding had a more positive impact on visual than on verbal task tests. Recall decline from immediate to delayed retention testing was similar for both color-coding and black/white instructional groups. (LMM)",

        "description":"A major problem in mainstreaming and implementation of Public Law 94-142 has been in establishing evaluation criteria to determine appropriate learning environment placement. Providing appropriate education in the least restrictive environment is primarily the classroom teacher's responsibility, requiring decision-making based on these questions: (1) What am I doing?, (2) Why am I doing it?, and (3) How do I know what I am doing is effective? To guide this decision-making, the 6-S paradigm was developed as a model for representing an instructional system, permitting teachers to reduce instructional systems complexities and develop programmatic solutions. The paradigm's components include (1) Someone--the classroom manager; (2) Something--the content of instruction; (3)  Somebody--the student; (4) Somehow--the strategies and tactics for guiding learning; (5) Somewhere--the learning environment; and (6) Sometime--time-relevant factors including scheduling, pacing, and readiness. Using the paradigm as a framework, teachers can generate questions affecting program implementation and development decisions. A major problem in answering these questions is student and delivery-system variability. A teacher-directed rather than a teacher-related research model approach to answering 6-S questions is needed.

        "description":"Curriculum is an essential element in Individualized Education Program (IEP) development, which has often been left to special education teachers unequipped for the task. A lack of district-wide curriculum foundations leads to haphazard decision-making. Teachers have often relied on their own content biases, speculations, and standardized tests for evaluation. Curriculum projects and models do exist and need to be implemented districtwide to form a common curriculum base. The 6-S paradigm differentiates the instructional process so that constituent elements may be examined independently before their interaction is studied. In this model, someone teaches something to somebody, somehow, somewhere, sometime. Such models are necessary because teachers need to use curriculum as an  objective means for evaluating and adapting instruction based on ongoing assessment of student progress. They also need to provide instruction that is integrated across subject areas, allowing students to build a knowledge base for future learning. Special education programs need to provide continuity through a developmental and relevant progression of content. A 17-item bibliography is included. (LMM)",

The South Dakota Medical Information Exchange (SDMIX) studied the utilization of administrative teleconferencing by the state's Alcohol Person Power Project staff. Pre- and post-conferencing questionnaires were used to assess change, and results showed that levels of concern changed after a single exposure to teleconferencing, although not everyone changed. SDMIX conducted another study investigating the effects of a teleconference  workshop experience on participants' concerns. The workshop provided information on teleconference presentation design and allowed the development and evaluation of teleconference programs. Levels of concern changed after workshop participation, away from the information and personal levels towards the management and consequence levels. Data tables and 21 references are provided.

The researchers sought to identify those communication and selection conditions in media treatments of specified subects most likely to have the desired effect on student attitudes. Using a mediagraphy, instructional media on the topics of mainstreaming and disabilities were chosen according to either student-expressed interests or teacher/media specialist perceptions of student interests, or were unrelated to student interests. The 120 sixth-grade subjects were pre- and posttested to determine attitudes toward the topics. The communication conditions (cognitive processes) involved user or non-user input through media  selection pre-questioning. Follow-up interviews with 16 students determined their uses for presentation information. Groups receiving media based on student-expressed interests had a more positive attitude toward disability, though not mainstreaming. Participation in the pre-selection inquiry did not affect attitudes, indicating cognitive involvement through expression of interest in a topic cannot predict a more positive attitude, but may be related to more personal information use. Overall group interests may be effectively expressed by a peer group, making direct expression of users' interests unnecessary. Teachers and media specialists were unable to determine what most interested students. (LMM)",

Using a learning strategy screening procedure, students were classified as demonstrating high, medium, or low dominance of verbal or visual learning strategies. Students then saw and/or heard an 18-minute children's story, via audiotape, slide-tape, or a synchronized audio-slide-tape presentation. Upon completion of the presentation, a 24-item recall test--12 items measuring recall of abstract content and 12 measuring recall of concrete content--was administered. As predicted, the combined audiovisual presentation yielded superior recall of both concrete and abstract content. The  picture-only presentation yielded greater recall of concrete content than the oral-only presentation, but no differences were found for abstract content. Contrary to expectations, neither strength of reported strategy nor the interaction between learning strategy and presentation modalities was significant. Six references are listed. (Author/LMM)",

Three categories of proctor/student interactions were identified: (1) specific to the course activities or objectives; (2) related to the content but not directly to course activities; and (3) unrelated to the course interactions. Proctors observed and recorded student-initiated interactions. Results showed significant differences in social behaviors, but not achievement, between  the two groups. Among field-dependent students there was a significantly greater tendency to obtain specific course information through social contacts initiated with proctors.

The current study appended compressed data from the principal and library media specialist to 592 teachers' records, in effect, regarding the characteristics of a teacher's principal and media specialist as environmental attributes. Teachers' ITV use was largely explained by their past and present disposition towards the medium. Although data from principals accounted for far more variance than data from media specialists, when combined with information from  teachers, principals' characteristics added no new information, while media specialists' attitudes and practices did covary with teacher use of ITV. Less experienced teachers used slightly more ITV, and training in ITV utilization did not affect frequency of use. It was concluded that teachers should be introduced to a few positive experiences with ITV using an approach geared to integration of ITV with daily teaching, and that the media specialist's role as change agent and consciousness-raiser should not be underestimated.

However, these models are prescriptive and not based on research into how designers actually think when they approach a design task. A summary of theoretical and empirical studies from the fields of art, architecture, and artificial intelligence which were examined for their relevance to instructional designers introduces a study of design activities among 26 novice instructional designers. This study investigated (1) the prevalence of initial generation of multiple design solutions; (2) the basis for acceptance or rejection  of candidate solutions; (3) the constraints encountered in executing the design; and (4) how designers knew the design was finished. Results indicated that novice designers have difficulty entertaining multiple possible solutions, especially for more than a few steps into design work. They eliminate alternatives rapidly and are not proficient in representing design problems to themselves or to others. They have trouble determining a reasonable stopping point.

Hour-long interview tapes were content analyzed to discover reasons why these university professors chose to support their verbal lectures with media materials. Though 70 percent of the respondents were untrained in instructional media use, all felt media materials are essential for effective teaching; e.g., they provide variety, change of pace, and focus for transferring conceptual information in a manner that caters to individual student learning styles, and the media experiences shared by the entire class provide valuable discussion starters. Respondents' preference for using personally developed media  materials has important implications for financial administrators, instructional media center directors, media librarians, and educational technologists.

        "author":["Simonson, Michael R."],
        "description":"A relationship exists between attitudes and some behaviors, and learners' attitudes are definitely influenced by mediated instruction. Attitudes can be defined and measured, using systematic processes such as self-reports, reports of others, sociometric procedures, or records. Researchers have examined the relationship between attitude positions and message design, so that a tentative set of guidelines for the relationship between these two variables could be proposed. Simonson (1979) suggested that favorable reactions toward instruction are developed by (1) using realistic, relevant, and technically stimulating media; (2) including new information; (3) presenting messages credibly; (4) involving learners in planning, production, or delivery of mediated instruction; (5) including  guided post-instruction discussions and critiques; and (6) having learners experience purposeful, emotional involvement during instruction. A more definitive set of recommendations is needed. Media-attitude research has often had problems of definition, measurement, design, and follow-up. Future research requires attention to instrumentation, experimentation, media-aptitude-attitude interaction, and theory-based research. This paper includes 46 references. (LMM)",

        "description":"This study investigated the relationship of two anxiety measures (the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form and the S-R Inventory of Anxiousness-Exam Form) to performance on a visual concept-learning task with embedded criterial information. The effect on anxiety reduction of cueing criterial information was also examined, and two levels of embedment were investigated. Two treatment groups of 24 college students each located embedded figures, identified the concept criteria, and identified non-example concept set members, with one group using materials cued with red outlining. Significant main effects were found for trait anxiety with the lightly and heavily embedded figure scores, and for cueing with the heavily embedded figure scores. A significant interaction was indicated  between trait anxiety and cueing for the heavily embedded figures. A non-significant interaction was found for the test anxiety measure with cueing, with the high-anxious, cued subjects scoring the highest and the high-anxious, non-cued subjects scoring the lowest. A high degree of both types of anxiety had a severe debilitating effect on non-cued task performance. Cueing greatly reduced the influence of both measures and was associated with superior performance by the high test-anxious, cued subgroup. This report includes 26 references and 13 data tables. The two anxiety measures are appended. (LMM)",

        "description":"A set of interactive, computer-simulated experiments was designed to respond to the large range of individual differences in aptitude and reasoning ability generally exhibited by students enrolled in first-semester general chemistry. These experiments give students direct experience in the type of decision making needed in an experimental setting. For instance, the student is encouraged to develop a strategy for empirical problem-solving, e.g., the determination of the first and second ionization potentials of an element. Generally, this strategy involves breaking the problem into three sequential phases: empirical, graphic, and symbolic. In the empirical phase, the student must select productive experimental conditions. While many students have difficulty in deciding which  values produce meaningful results, first semester students in general chemistry can learn to make empirical decisions when given several computer-simulated experiments with a consistent pedagogic structure.

First, the different activities supported by this technology are described, with emphasis on the commonality of game playing to both hand-held devices and microcomputers. The need for research to investigate the motivational qualities of these games and their influence on learning is stressed. Motivational aspects of microelectronic games are discussed, particularly the attributes of popular computer games and the effects of external constraints on intrinsically motivated activities. The types of learning which can be influenced by electronic game playing are considered. To illustrate how cognitive learning strategies might be affected, a general description of  developmental and population differences in learning and memory is provided, and factors which may cause changes in strategy use are discussed. Specific examples for research, involving both observational and experimental methods, are presented. A 9-page reference list is included. (Author/LMM)",

The evaluation effort includes an analysis of the contents of CATALIST, a general survey of all 251 CATALIST users to obtain usage and effectiveness perceptions, and  further collection of data from CATALIST users to ascertain the hit rate of all finding tools used during the interlibrary loan (ILL) search process. In terms of content, CATALIST is determined to be public library oriented. It is further shown that CATALIST receives widespread use in support of interloan services and that it is effective and easy to use. Areas for improvement, notably inclusion of more titles and more evenly distributed geographic coverage, and a variety of factors influencing the future of CATALIST are identified. The report concludes with three appendices: samples of the general survey and data collection forms, and a list of comments received on the impact of CATALIST upon ILL patterns of individual libraries or systems.

The emergence of information industries, based on rapidly developing computer and communications technologies, and their impact on public libraries are outlined. A review of the income, expenditures, services, and current status of public libraries suggests that the role of the  public library is changing, and that there is a strong connection between the functions a library performs and its funding. Results of shifting patterns of public library support in California and West Virginia are examined and three options for future funding of public libraries are presented: continuation of the status quo, achievement of a balanced intergovernmental funding system, or increased use of fees for service.

        "description":"Our current transformation to a computer literate, high technology, information society has numerous implications for a new role for postsecondary education. To help define its own role, North Central Technical College (NCTC) has developed a strategic planning and human resource development model that specifies assumptions on which to base subsequent planning and then states goals and objectives. NCTC has used this model to project its data/word processing needs for the next several years and to implement an institutional commitment to computer literacy. Within postsecondary education as a whole, the implications of the coming information society can be seen with respect to both internal and external planning. Factors relevant to institutional planning include the increasing  problem of illiteracy; changes that technological advancements have made in technical fields, such as engineering; the growing role of data and information processing in almost every occupational field; the professional preparation and continuing education of instructors in technical fields; the educator's new role as learning facilitator; and the expansion of institutional planning, management, and evaluation to include needs assessment, market analysis, environmental scanning and trend analysis. In the past, postsecondary education's relationship to the economy has been seen in terms of providing an educated workforce. The future will require a new proactive role in facilitating the transition to an information society. (KL)",

        "description":"The influence of professional accreditation on community college nursing and allied health curricula is discussed in these five papers. First, Robert Evans presents the community college viewpoint, distinguishing between general/institutional and programmatic accreditation, outlining the growth of programmatic accreditation, and citing as concerns the financial cost of specialized accreditation activities, the increasingly narrow focus of accrediting agencies, and the relationship between accreditation and program quality. Bernadine Hallinan then presents the nursing viewpoint, noting activities of the National League for Nursing in promoting nursing education, i.e., testing, consultation, continuing education, publications, research, and accreditation, and citing reasons for  seeking program accreditation related to self-analysis, quality assurance, and career mobility of graduates. An accreditation viewpoint is expressed by John Fauser, who discusses the purpose of specialized accreditation and the responsibilities and current concerns of the Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation. Next, William MacLeod summarizes the three viewpoints and discusses the history of specialized accreditation, its purposes and concerns, and how accreditation issues may be addressed by accrediting agencies, the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation, and the institutions. Finally, Gladys Hatfield surveys current literature on specialized accreditation issues. (KL)",

After the manual's introduction covers the background and hardware requirements of the system and provides an overview of the ARS and the use of the manual, the next section describes the three ARS files: the ARS  database, community college history files, and SUS files. The following section focuses on the program, format, and documentation libraries of the ARS. After a description of operating procedures for adding and changing data, obtaining special reports, and maintaining the ARS libraries, the manual examines the Curriculum Evaluation Product, which permits the comparison of performance in community college and upper-division courses. The final sections focus on system output, ad hoc reporting, and ARS catalogued procedures.

The next section discusses persistence and performance rates of transfer students, difficulties in obtaining information on students who drop out within a year, and the problems of comparing transfer and native four-year college students. In addition, programs instituted in the universities to provide information on transfer students to the community colleges are examined.

The study sought to assess the patterns of behavior of students enrolling in developmental communications courses, completion rates, and the correlation of course performance with standardized placement test scores. An analysis of the records of a random sample of 136 of the 410 students enrolled in Communications 051 in fall 1981 revealed that: (1) 92% of the sample were under 25 years of age and two-thirds were enrolled in four or more courses; (2) the majority of students enrolled in the course had below college-level scores on the Nelson-Denny and Educational  Testing Service (ETS) tests; (3) half of the students enrolled in the course received a passing grade; (4) a substantially higher proportion of the Communications 051 students received non-passing grades in fall 1981 than of the student body in general; (5) 74% of the students in the sample continued at Oakton in spring 1981, as compared with 61% of the entire student body; (6) while Communications 051 students tended to have higher than average completion rates in Communications 101 (84% compared to the overall course completion rate of 76%), they tended to earn fewer high grades in the course; and (7) neither the Nelson-Denny nor ETS tests predicted academic performance as measured by grade point average.

These studies have sought to identify trends in college-going rates; examine the gains and losses in these rates experienced by various counties in light of statewide trends; compare the ethnic distribution of high school graduates with that of first-time college freshmen; and to examine trends in community college transfer, comparing the ethnic distribution of transfers to that of first-time community college freshmen. Highlights of the 1981 study included the following: (1) college-going rates for recent high school graduates increased for the University of California, remained the same  for the California State University, and decreased slightly for the community colleges; (2) the percentage of males enrolled as first-time freshmen in each segment of public higher education was slightly smaller than that of females; (3) the percentage of Hispanics continued to be smaller in the distribution of first-time freshmen than in the distribution of high school graduates, while the reverse was true for Blacks, Asians, American Indians, and Filipinos; and (4) the flow of community college transfers to independent institutions appeared to be declining. The bulk of the report consists of data tables, showing the flow of transfers, college-going rates by county and year, and sex and ethnic distributions. (KL)",

Fourteen units are provided, each focusing on a different topic. Topics include the development of the child's self-image, language abilities, and physical movement abilities. Some units provide guidelines for story reading and story telling with children, for helping children cope with stress, for meeting children's nutritional needs, and for cooking with children. Other units discuss carpentry activities, techniques for teaching children at home, religious education for young children, nature discovery activities, self-expression through creative drama, art, and music. Each unit consists of a statement of objectives, introductory content material, discussion  questions, program format ideas, lists of media resources, and suggestions for further reading. Introductory content materials for each unit are designed to be duplicated and used as handouts which parents may keep. Since the units provided do not constitute a comprehensive curriculum for parent education, a &quot;cookbook&quot; approach toward unit selection is recommended. (RH)",

        "description":"The series of experiments reported here investigated dimensions of children's sex stereotypes. The first study revealed that children were aware of sex stereotypes as early as 2 1/2 years of age. Furthermore, the tendency to categorize according to sex increased through their eighth year. The second study investigated whether sex stereotypes influenced children's evaluations of competent performance. It was found that, apparently, children base their evaluations of likely competence on the sex of the performer of sex-typed activities. The third study allowed children to express the strength of their beliefs in sex-typed evaluations of competence. Children's ratings of the competence of males' or females' performance on sex-typed activities revealed a clear bias toward  sex-stereotyped performance. However, the children did not assume that the counterstereotypic performer would be totally incompetent, and ratings were closer to judgments of equal competence than to stereotyped extremes. Also collected were data on memory deficits for counterstereotypic portrayals; these revealed that children had considerable difficulty processing this type of information. Results of two additional studies indicated that discriminations based on sex stabilize by the time children reach the second grade and that children do not discriminate on the basis of sex when they make evaluations of individual performers. These results, additional findings, and implications of the findings are discussed. (RH)",

All studies used the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME) and drew their data from the files of the Houston Parent-Child Development Center, a 2-year parent/child education program for low-income Mexican-American families. The first study examined the relationship between the child's HOME scores at age 3 to his or her general school performance. The second study investigated the relationship of the child's HOME scores at age 1 to later grade retention, while the third study dealt with the relationship of HOME scores gathered at ages 1, 2, and 3 to school measures conducted in first and second  grades. In the first two studies HOME scores were found to be poor predictors of grade retention and only fair predictors of school achievement test results. The third study, however, found HOME scores to be strong predictors of school performance, especially for children 2 years of age. (MP)",

        "description":"Members of a group of hospitalized children under 4 years of age (48 under care for child abuse, 97 for accidents, 41 for failure to thrive, and 23 for ingestions) were matched individually on age, social class, and race with controls suffering from comparable acute medical conditions. A structured maternal and paternal interview yielded 63 significant single-variable comparisons in these domains: child health and development, past and present family disruption and conflict, parental physical and emotional health, and environmental setting. Discriminant function analysis suggested interrelationships among the case groups and an additive mode of pathogenesis, with more severe stresses associated with more severe childhood symptoms. A classification analysis was performed to  determine the extent to which equations generated in the discriminant function analyses successfully differentiated between patients in the illness categories and in the control groups. Cluster analysis on a random half-sample identified three cohesive groups, characterized as &quot;ecologic equilibrium,&quot;&quot;adversity,&quot; and &quot;crisis.&quot; This reformulation subsumed respectively increasing proportions of severe symptoms and replicated successfully on the other half-sample. Its elaboration gives a convenient matrix for organizing data from practice and a value-free alternative to the present manifestational classification system. Additionally, a statistical analysis of group profiles was performed, and high-risk families were profiled in nine vital aspects of their lives. In nearly every aspect the  crisis group was found to suffer. (RH)",

Research in area 1 tested three predictions, generated from a revision of Piagetian theory, concerning children's performances on two anticipatory imagery tasks and a standard conservation task. Discussion in area 2 reports results of a study testing the hypothesis that drawing errors on anticipatory kinetic imagery tasks reflect children's poor images of objects in anticipated states of  movement. Also reviewed is a study comparing preschool and older children's abilities to mentally track an object through a rotation movement, as well as further investigations addressing questions of developmental differences under certain task conditions, age differences in mental tracking strategies, and the relationships of strategies to tracking rates. Research in area 3 investigates whether children mentally transform object states on tasks in which particular processing strategies are unspecified and examines the effect of transforming strategies on short-term and long-term memory for figurative states.

The argument is made that, since computers are being touted as a revolution in pedagogy, teachers must become knowledgable about the potential of computer technology. Only when equipped with such knowledge will teachers be able to assess proponents' claims and to lead in appropriately introducing computer technology into educational settings. Specifically, it is asserted that teachers must consider the context in which computer technology is introduced and the various potential uses  of computers. In line with this recommendation, the course described, entitled \"Teaching with Microcomputers: The Early Years,\" offers undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to use the computer as a tutor, a tool, and a tutee. Tutored by the computer, they experience, evaluate, modify, and write instructional/managerial programs across early childhood subject matter domains. Using the computer as a tool, they learn about word processing and information management for themselves and children. Using the computer as tutee, they \"teach the computer,\" learning to program and to teach young children to program in Logo. Finally, teachers are advised that others will take leadership in providing instruction with computers, if they do not. (RH)",

The first study involved administering the Child Rearing Practices Report to 65 adult participants, then asking the participants to describe their parents' childrearing attitudes. Results suggest that those respondents who were born to parents age 33 or older perceived their parents as being warmer and less likely to adhere to stereotypical parental roles. The second study provided for a secondary analysis of observational data collected in the homes of 52 families. Multiple regression analyses indicated that parental age effects are more apparent for mothers than for fathers and that women who are older when their children are born maintain higher  levels of interaction with those children and are more positively disposed toward them. Further research to explore the timing of parenthood from the parents' perspective is recommended. In addition, the possibility that delayed parenthood may represent an adaptive mechanism for coping with a depressed economic climate is discussed. (Author/MP)",

        "description":"Three different models of inservice nutrition education implemented by Detroit's Nutrition Education Training (NET) Project are described and compared. The NET Project was funded first as a pilot project in 1978-79, and was refunded in 79-80 and 80-81. The original pilot project goal was to demonstrate the value of teaching urban day care staff members to provide hands-on, classroom food activities for the preschoolers in their care. The Year I Model provided intensive, on-site training in six workshops focused on topics such as food attitudes, nutrition facts, and mealtime procedures in the center. The goal in the Year II model was to develop a less expensive model so that several centers could receive on-site training. Experience showed that (1) the Year I Model could not be  reduced to one session and that (2) the original emphasis on classroom activities was of secondary importance: first priority had to be given to upgrading mealtime and nutrition at the 10 participating centers. In the third year, on-site training was impossible because of reduction in funds. Therefore, a 2 1/2-hour nutrition session was presented as part of a 20-hour training experience in the Michigan Day Care Provider Training Project. Comparison of the three models leads to the conclusion that the most relevant inservice intervention uses the mealtime situation as learning occasions for the children. (RH)",

        "description":"Controversy exists in the field of child day care concerning the training of child care workers. Becker (1979) states that trainers should be child care professionals who help to engage workers in an educational/developmental process, as opposed to &quot;outside&quot; trainers from other professions who view training as a mechanism to &quot;add on&quot; skills such as conflict resolution or communication skills. On the other hand, Ouderkirk (1980) argues that competent trainers from outside the field can impart needed skills by using accepted methods of adult education. The purpose of this paper is to present evidence concerning the effectiveness of Becker's approach to training in conveying knowledge and in imparting ideas about child care practices. A statewide, decentralized program was conducted  which used child care professionals as trainers and provided for the modification of course content to fit the needs of local providers. Almost 1,400 center and home providers in 57 counties were trained. Test data from pre/post program measures and trained/untrained group analyses, as well as behavioral observations, demonstrated program success. Findings also indicated an expansion of provider/community contacts and an increased sense of professionalism. In conclusion, this training approach is viewed as being both practical and effective.

Composed of third- and sixth-grade students, the sample included 13 girls and 10 boys previously categorized as exhibiting different levels of involvement (expert, sampler, shunner) in playground games. Two sets of analyses were conducted. Initial analyses centered on how children structured their activities on the playground. Here the specific focus was both upon the structure of the  activity itself (operationalized as the pattern of turn-taking) and the allocation of players' activity during the course of the game. The temporal nature of activity structures was also determined. The second set of analyses centered upon the process of game play itself. Here interest was principally upon utterances children made in monitoring ongoing action in the game. Of particular interest were distractions threatening ongoing game performance and game maintenance strategies contributing to the continuity of action in the game.

        "description":"Student interaction patterns in eight elementary school classrooms were examined to investigate (1) the relationship between interaction patterns and sociometric indicators of friends, (2) the process by which children become stratified, and (3) the structure of peer relationships in classrooms. Chapter 1, the introduction, briefly discusses the central concerns of the study. Chapter 2 presents a model of the stratification process and discusses a variety of factors which must be taken into account for understanding this process. Chapter 3 describes the methods employed in the study and contains descriptions of the children and the classrooms studied. Chapters 4 through 7 present the results of the study. Chapter 4 concerns the relationship between sociometric choices and actual  interaction patterns; chapter 5 looks at the structure of peer groups; chapter 6 examines the relationship of reading groups to interaction patterns; and chapter 7 examines the cross-sex interaction patterns. Each of these four chapters starts wih a review of the relevant literature. Variations among the classrooms along certain relevant dimensions are then described. These variations are related to critical factors which lead to the variation and explain the particular pattern found in each classroom. The final chapter, chapter 8, presents a summation of the findings, an elaboration of the model proposed in chapter 2, implications for classroom practice, and suggestions for further research.

        "description":"In two previous experimental observational studies, the Safe-Playing Kit, a program with empirically proven potential for reducing the risk of pedestrian accidents to preschoolers, was developed. The purpose of the present study was to field test a prototype of the kit in 17 diverse preschools and day care centers located in eight states. Feedback on the process of implementation came from evaluations and suggestions made by preschool teachers, parents, and administrators, as well as through two concept probes employing children's responses to storybook situations, one administered before and one after the program was implemented. Results indicated that most teachers and parents felt the program was successful. In addition, children showed highly significant gains in scores on  pretests and posttests following the use of the program. It was concluded that the Safe-Playing Kit can be implemented in a diversity of communities, preschools, day care centers, and families across the country and that the program can be successfully conducted by trained teachers and parents as a part of their everyday activities. Forms of and results from the teacher's survey, as well as versions of the parent surveys, are appended along with a description of methods used and results obtained from the children's responses to storybooks and concept probes.

        "description":"Grandmothering has been described as a &quot;tenuous&quot; role in modern families in that grandparenting is specified as a symbolic linkage but is ambiguous in terms of behavioral expectations. This paper addresses the following question: How do role relational partners modulate their own behavior when there is ambiguity in expectations for interaction? The pilot study reported here examines patterns of consensus and dissension about grandparenthood by comparing the responses of (1) mothers and grandmothers and (2) maternal and paternal grandmothers. &quot;Tenuous&quot; role relationships were expected to be characterized by consensus on the symbolic structure of the relationship and dissension on the expectations for interaction. The sample consisted of 30 family &quot;cases&quot; with maternal and/or  paternal grandmothers residing locally -- yielding 44 mother-grandmother dyads. Tape recorded telephone interviews were conducted with 30 mothers, 20 maternal grandmothers, and 24 paternal grandmothers. The interviews focused on expectations for interaction. The mothers and grandmothers were given an equivalent series of five scenarios referring to possible types of interactions: babysitting (daytime-emergency and evening-entertainment), advice-giving, playing, and discipline. For each scenario, the respondents were asked to tell what hypothetically they would do and to describe comparable situations. The interviews also included a number of background questions and a few open-ended questions about the symbolic nature of grandparental relationships. Results are discussed. (RH)",

        "description":"Numerous childhood activities and relationships have been studied within the context of socialization, but one form of interpersonal experience has not yet been investigated by social researchers: the carpool. This paper investigates the types of interaction which take place within the carpool setting, both between children and adults and among peer group members. The authors conducted 50 intensive taped interviews with carpool parents, talked with teachers and administrators at several private schools attended by the children of the sample population, and observed events occurring both during and relating to their child's carpool as well as events in the carpool experiences of friends' and neighbors' children. These interviews and observations supplemented over 800 carpool trips  the authors had personally participated in as they drove to school, camp, and after-hours activities over a 3-year period. Results demonstrated that apart from their function as educators, the most significant socializing influence carpooling adults have on children is to serve as role models, demonstrating and stressing the importance of certain values and behavioral norms. These include appropriate automobile safety; tolerance for other people; respect for people's feelings, privacy and personal space; and fairness in treating people equally. As for the child-child interaction, results indicated that most of the children's carpool play was characterized by friendship and cooperation. When friendship and cooperation break down they may be replaced by antagonism, meanness and hostility.  The authors conclude by assessing how carpooling socialization corresponds to the three primary models of socialization - internalization of society's norms and values, learning roles for future use, and developing interactional competence - depicted by sociologists.

        "description":"Despite increased interest in and acceptance of the concept and mandate of providing adaptive instruction to ensure schooling success for each student, a sizable gap exists between identification of specific educational practices and application of such practices in schools. The work described in this paper is aimed at examining the feasibility and practicability of widespread implementation of an adaptive instruction approach. Discussion focuses on four areas: (1) the conceptual and practical implications of the adaptive instruction approach and the effective allocation and use of school time; (2) the rationale and design of an adaptive instruction program that includes features thought to be particularly effective in enhancing student learning; (3) the results of a descriptive  study of the program's impact on classroom processes, student achievement, and the allocation and use of school time; and (4) the comparability of the study's findings with recent literature on effective classroom instruction in general and investigations of the use of school time and student learning in particular. The descriptive study was conducted in 156 kindergarten through third-grade classrooms where the Adaptive Learning Environments Model was implemented as the core educational program. It is concluded that it is unnecessary to trade off achievement in basic skills for student growth in areas such as independence, self-responsibility, and social cooperation. (Author/RH)",

        "description":"Approximately 10 to 15 years ago the Swedes became aware that the incidence of cohabitation under marriage-like conditions but without marriage had increased tremendously. This increasingly prevalent social behavior raised problems concerning the legal custody of the children of such unions and, ultimately, a way of granting unmarried parents joint custody of their children was worked out. For Americans and Norwegians joint custody became a social issue in the context of divorce. Research and public debate in this area have focused exclusively on the problem as found in the U. S. and Norway; until recently, there has been no discussion in Sweden about what joint custody is, could be, or should be. Custody from legal points of view is a fairly simple matter; the concept of &quot;true&quot;  custody (i.e., custody in practice, or in &quot;reality&quot;) is also fairly simple in nature. The concept of joint custody, however, presents complications that are evident in literature from Norway, Sweden, and the United States. Especially complicated is the issue of &quot;equal rights and responsibilities&quot; in the context of joint custody. Depending on how the concept is handled, the term can be meaningful and important or an empty formality. (RH)",

The report looks at the positive and negative factors influencing rural curriculum development and provides a definition of curriculum in the rural school district. Curriculum leadership and responsibility are addressed via eight components of the curriculum leadership hierarchy - administrator, curriculum director, curriculum steering committee, curriculum subject area committee, consultants, school board, students, and lay people. Six steps of planning and implementing school curriculum are outlined: (1)  establishing the goal-objective hierarchy; (2) determining scope and sequence; (3) developing curriculum guides; (4) implementing curriculum through classroom instruction; (5) implementing curriculum evaluating activities; and (6) implementing curriculum revision based on evaluation findings. Among the nine advantages of the goal-objective hierarchy described are: development of curriculum can become systematic; relationship between school and individual teachers can be identified; and monetary allotments to departments or subject areas can be based on need.

The first program addresses what to do if clothes catch fire, teaching about matches, and exiting during a fire (crawling under smoke, raising windows, and unlocking doors). Instructional strategies and activities are outlined for three age groups in the second program: infants/toddlers, children 3-5 years old, and children 6-8 years old. Since infants/toddlers cannot care for themselves, concepts suggested to be taught to their caretakers include the dependence of infants/toddlers upon adults, the need for constant adult supervision, and the need to remove hazards to make childrens' environment safe.  Activities for 3-5 year olds are suggested to foster the dual nature of fire (friendly but dangerous); stop/drop/roll technique to smother clothing fires; danger of matches; image of firefighter; and simple fire escape procedures. In addition to reinforcing the previous concepts, it is suggested that 6-8 year olds be taught basic components of fire, role and operation of the fire department, home/community hazards (such as flammable liquids, lighters, and matches), and how to correctly report a fire.

Among the most basic is a country's capacity to feed its people. By this measure the Soviet Union appears to be in deep trouble. Massive spending has increased Soviet military strength in recent years, but the country has become weaker agriculturally. While the two superpowers now appear roughly equal in military strength, the advantage in agriculture has shifted dramatically toward the United States. The U.S. exportable food surplus is climbing, while Soviet dependence on food imports is growing. The dramatic shift in the agricultural balance of power between the two countries has been decades in the making, but contrasting  food surpluses/deficits have been highly visible only in the last decade or so. As deterioration of Soviet agriculture continues, the need to import food will become even greater. The relationship between grain flow from the United States to the Soviet Union constitutes a new economic tie between the two countries, one that could eventually transform their political relations as well.

It is noted that of all the significant world problems, the nuclear arms race has proved one of the most intractable. The main concern of the module is to investigate a possible solution to the arms race, based on extending the classic two-person game of Prisoner's Dilemma and allowing for sequences of moves. An analysis of the generated model is followed with considerations of possible extensions to both new games and different scenarios. The material is designed to help students: (1) understand some basic concepts in game theory; (2) apply concepts to arms race analysis and other two-person conflict situations; (3) derive consequences of extended play of different games and scenarios; (4)  illustrate consequences graphically; (5) state policy implications of an analysis; and (6) justify normative judgments based on analysis.

Part 2 describes the following accomplishments of the first year: (1) learning activities (K-12) using  sex-fair materials were compiled; (2) a volume of sex-fair activities in language arts, math/science, social studies, and fine arts was designed for lower primary students; (3) workshops were conducted for faculty and staff; (4) presentations were made to local parent, business, and community groups; (5) project brochures were distributed; and (6) technical and final reports were written. Project evaluation results are described in the third part. Several attitude surveys and questionnaires were used to assess teacher and student awareness of equity issues and students' aspirations toward nontraditional roles. There were measurable reductions in stereotypic behaviors. The awareness of equity issues was increased. The report concludes with a discussion of lessons learned from the first  year. (RM)",

Although the most widely accepted criteria for determining a discipline is that it have a structure of basic principles and a specific mode of inquiry, the standard attempts to define a social science discipline result only in descriptive statements of what the \"disciples\" do and what exclusive language they use. For example, most definitions of the social sciences envelope the content of other fields. History, anthropology, geography, sociology, psychology, political science, and economics all endeavor to examine the actions of humans; none have unique  structures of knowledge or modes of inquiry. The implications for social education are great. The current dominant social mentality is functionalist; it operates to preserve and protect the established social order. This functionalist ideology is expressed in social studies curricula and texts and in the social sciences themselves. The social studies curriculum assumes that the disciplines offer truth rather than tentative theories; the result is the imposition of dominant class values, norms, and assumed order without criticism.

The authors suggest that research would better benefit policy makers if it included alternative policy solutions to problems rather than suggesting further research needs and if data summaries of research were prepared for quick reference. Moreover, the authors believe that the social attributes of the Southwest, e.g., the region's rapid growth and change, multicultural population, diverse environment, and the high concentration of older women in retirement communities, renders research results applicable to the entire nation and therefore should be of concern to policy makers. Current research on women in  the Southwest focuses on growth and change issues, the multicultural population, and older women. Numerous studies are listed under the topics of the effects on women of migration to the Sun Belt, energy boom town, education, employment, and the political process. Types of health care among women of varied ethnic backgrounds have also been researched.

Southerners are less likely than non-Southerners to engage in most of the  activities examined. The analysis suggests that differences in participation do not reflect the fact that Southerners face greater barriers. Indeed, the data suggest that they face fewer barriers, and that removing barriers to participation might well accentuate existing regional differences. Nonwhites and women are much more likely than whites and men to indicate that there are arts-related activities they would like to engage in, but do not. Present participation in some activity and demand for additional participation are almost always positively associated. (RM)",

        "description":"Results of a survey of 3rd through 12th grade students illustrate that the majority perceive traditional sex roles as their only choice. The sample consisted of approximately 2,000 students in both large metropolitan districts and smaller rural districts throughout Colorado. Participants were asked to respond to a single question: If you woke up tomorrow and discovered that you were a (girl) (boy), how would your life be different? Several underlying themes emerged from the responses. For example, females learn that it is best not to work outside the home, but if one does, one should choose from a limited number of career options. They learn that their most valuable asset is their appearance and that they should be dependent, compliant, and fearful. Males are taught that females  are to be treated as sex objects; that males should be independent, competitive, and aggressive; and that their activities are less restricted than females. Both sexes tend to avoid nontraditional courses and extracurricular activities. Educators interested in addressing these issues should contact committees organized under Title IX education amendments, parents' organizations, and sex equity teams. (KC)",

        "description":"A survey of textbooks used in French elementary schools during the Third Republic illustrates that period's attitudes toward female roles, social class, and religious differences. A sample of 126 public school books and 43 Catholic textbooks reveals that young students were presented the ideal of a woman content to remain inside an orderly household, devoting herself to husband and children. A wife contributed to the social order by keeping her husband happy at home, spending his money wisely, and reminding him, if he was so inclined, that work strikes were harmful to the family. Catholic texts rejected the possibility of divorce which the republic reintroduced in 1884. Both public and Catholic reading texts presented stories about heroes and heroines with whom young people could  identify. Girls received messages of social immobility and were warned against trying to improve their status through marrying. Both sexes were taught the desirability of a stable society free from class warfare. The reasons for the emphasis on domestic duties for women lie in the realities of the republic: the rate of industrialization was less rapid than in other countries; working class unrest and militancy existed; and the low birth rate greatly disturbed political leaders.

        "description":"Examples drawn from books and interviews of blacks reveal techniques of oral and literate communication both during and after slavery. These techniques fall into two complementary categories: communication as surreptitious resistance and communication about overt resisters. Surreptitious communication occurred through the use of code words which signalled meetings and escapes. For example, spirituals with heavenly themes actually referred to the end of slavery and the word \"weevil\" referred to the white patrollers who kept slaves from escaping. Often tales included messages at odds with stated conclusions; that is, a testimony stating that blacks are not dependable because they learn so early to be deceptive really illustrates a unity among the slaves who used code words when the  white master eavesdropped on them. Communication about overt resisters, both male and female, usually focused on the slave who wouldn't be whipped. The message of these tales was that a slave who resisted punishment asserted his or her humanity and dignity. Thus, the personal accounts of slaves illustrate that they resisted in many ways. What they remembered and how they communicated their memories reveal messages important to them beyond slavery itself. (Author/KC)",

        "description":"The pre-emancipation (1830-1865) black woman reformer was concerned with race \"uplift,\" a sense of duty and obligation to her race. Black women in the North formed mutual aid societies for the economic survival of the destitute. Regardless of economic status, free blacks consistently sought to aid slaves in the South; the poor often saved for years to purchase their relatives. Some black women, Harriet Tubman, for example, worked toward helping slaves escape to the North. While both white and black women formed charitable organizations, it is commonly agreed that black women organized for survival and self-improvement while white women's organizations were mainly self-serving. Even though the women's rights movement began at this time, black women were excluded from it. Education  became a primary concern of race \"uplift\" as blacks sought to erase the myth of intellectual inferiority. Because whites were reluctant to teach blacks anything but rudimentary skills, black teachers for black students became an important issue. Black women worked both toward the establishment of formal schools and of educational organizations which provided for adult education. In fact, education became the major force in creating black nationalism. (Author/KC)",

Their primary concerns were education and employment opportunities, suffrage, the defense of black female morality, and the condemnation of lynching. The philosophy of black female leaders was that they received their education for the elevation of the race. They believed in the moral superiority of women, that the degraded state of the black race was a result of the degraded state of its women, and that only through the actions of black women would their lot improve. Few white women were supportive of black causes. Even suffragists Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton placed color  above principle in an attempt to gain support of southern white women. Thus, black women either formed organizations such as the National Association of Colored Women or worked independently on behalf of their race, often condemning the actions and attitudes of white women. Although the 20th century saw an increased interracial cooperation among women, distrust of white women still prevailed. (Author/KC)",

Neville Kanakaratne, ambassador to the United States from Sri Lanka, states the case for a new international economic order. He discusses why there is a need to revise the economic order set up after World War II, describes the plight of the ordinary people of the Third World, and suggests three fields of international activity-- international trade, monetary system, and transfer of resources--where there is opportunity to institute a new economic order. Dr. Carol Baumann, of the  University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, discusses four questions: (1) What has provided the sharp conflicts between the developed and the developing world and why do the problems of development necessitate the consideration of a new economic order? (2) What has led to the current pressures to create new worldwide institutions and policies to deal with these problems and conflicts? (3) What are the political, economic, and moral imperatives which face the United States in its dealings with the developing nations? and (4) Why is it crucial that the U.S. public be involved in developing U.S. policies toward the developing world?

The purpose of Project SPAN was to describe and assess the current and recent state of social studies/social science education, designate desired states to which social studies might or should aspire, and shape recommendations as to how those desired states might be approached. There are four sections. The first section, drawn mostly from the conclusion of an extensive report written by Hazel Whitman Hertzberg as historical background for the project, describes efforts to reform social studies during the period 1880-1980. The second section focuses on the current state of five critical elements in social studies programming and instruction:  rationales, goals, and objectives; curriculum patterns; curriculum materials; teachers; and instructional practices. The third section, \"The Future of Social Studies,\" describes in some detail the six major problems that SPAN staff and consultants believe need to be faced in the 1980s, the \"desired states\" toward which social studies educators might strive, and recommendations flowing from a comparison of current states and the problems associated with the desired states. The fourth section describes one of the several major alternatives to the current pattern of social studies considered by the SPAN staff and consultants. The alternative is a social roles approach to social studies. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"Although currently expressed in terms of linear and intuitive halves of the brain, the concept of androgyny (the integration of male and female characteristics within each person) is central to ancient myths and religions. Most accounts concern an initial separation of the sexes and subsequent efforts to unite male and female forces. For example, the Chinese polar halves of Yin and Yang were formed from a single fluid, and the Hindus speak of the splitting of the original creative force called the Supreme Self. In Western myths, the creator remains entire and the split transpires within the creature (e.g., Adam and Eve). The Greek version suggests that the gods split people in half to punish them for their conceit. All of these myths express concern for uniting the separation (or  dual halves of the psyche) through symbols of androgyny. By combining both linear (male) and intuitive (female) qualities within the individual psyche, one unites the polar forces which represent creation and growth. Thus Eastern icons are often hermaphroditic, as are Christian, Persian, and Hindu-Buddhist angels. Traditional rituals such as marriage and alchemy also portray union of polar opposites. An awareness of these ancient archetypes can lend a more complete understanding to current sex role research. (KC)",

Preschool education, which is not compulsory, consists of several types, including day care centers, boarding-care centers, and kindergartens. Elementary education is 8 years and is compulsory for all children between the ages of 7 and 15. Secondary schools, which are not compulsory, include the gymnasia, art schools, technical schools, trade or vocational schools, teachers' schools, and military schools. Higher educational institutions include universities; higher schools, which are intermediate-level institutions between secondary school and a complete university; high schools, which offer complete programs of a  specialized nature and are at a level equivalent to the universities; military academies; theological seminaries; and workers' and people's universities. There are eight levels of vocational education in Yugoslavia and five main types of teacher education programs. Military academies have university rank. There have been new educational reforms in the content and courses of instruction for all educational levels. Because of the decentralized structure of education in Yugoslavia, the introduction of these changes has been uneven throughout the various provinces. A glossary of terms and a bibliography conclude the publication. (RM)",

Therefore, the discipline must develop and disseminate new approaches to teaching geography and must supply current information to faculty. Since the first contact many students have with geography is at the introductory level, these courses should be staffed with the most effective teachers, who should emphasize the nature and scope of geography. Departmental awards should include those for teaching as well as for research and departments should develop more precise mechanisms for measuring the caliber of instruction. Further, geography departments must be open to helping students and be active in campus affairs.  Geographers who are aware of the needs of students, the job market, and the changing orientation of the discipline should look forward to retraining themselves to keep abreast of the times. Thus, with a renewed emphasis on teaching, geographers can impart the skills and knowledge needed to expand the discipline. (KC)",

        "description":"Metaphors influence, in many ways, methods and ways of thinking, including the planning and implementation of inservice teacher education programs. Inservice programs are often not considered successful; writers, developers, producers, and potential adopters of the programs should become aware of their metaphoric stance. Three metaphors commonly found in society are the technological, political, and cultural metaphors, which can be applied to three dominant models (research development and diffusion, problem solving, and social interaction) that are part of the implementation stage of educational innovation. The technological metaphor views the world through the dynamics of industrial change. The political metaphor contends that conflict, competition, compromise, and negotiations  are the basis for change. The relationships of the individual to society and other people form the basis of the cultural metaphor. Each of the three inservice models illuminate one perspective of the innovation process. The research development and diffusion model assumes that solving problems is primarily a matter of attention, applications, and money. The problem solving model is built around the user of the inservice program with the assumption that the program will satisfy identified needs. The social interaction model stresses the importance of interpersonal networks of information, opinion leadership, personal contact, and social integration. Knowing the advantages and problems of each of these models, as they reflect the metaphorical concepts that form their philosophic base, will  help to improve the planning and implementation of inservice teacher education programs.

Program activities include workshops, seminars, practice information interviews, and attendance at local, state, and national professional meetings. Individualized programs of work, study, and writing are developed  for each scholar, and opportunities are provided to refine speaking and presentation skills. Scholars are urged to expand their expectations and goals and to find one or more mentors to assist them in proposal development and in finding employment.

        "description":"Each academic year, a growing number of students with basic deficiencies in skills that are mandatory for successfully achieving the benefits of higher education enter colleges and universities. This problem is not limited to minority and underprivileged populations; these students come from all walks of life, all levels of socioeconomic backgrounds, and all levels of ability. Active student recruitment by institutions or their departments may promote the problem, especially when students have previously benefited from the effects of grade inflation in high school. Many students are unprepared because they did not take the necessary college preparation courses, and some who are oriented toward a career will not be able to meet their goals unless assistance is provided. A survey  was conducted of faculty members to determine their attitudes and opinions regarding the basic academic skill levels of undergraduates. Over half of the respondents felt that student competency in basic skills had decreased, the greatest losses being in the language arts. Many respondents blamed poor high school preparation. Slightly more than 74 percent felt that institutions of higher education should provide corrective services. While faculty members appeared to be very much concerned about the skill levels of undergraduates, most preferred to stay out of what they perceived to be the remedial aspects of education. However, many seemed willing to undergo inservice training and to use supplementary techniques and materials designed to assist the learning of students needing help. To  correct the troubled transition from secondary to postsecondary education, closer working relations between the secondary schools and colleges is needed. (JD)",

In a methods course taught by the authors, education students were confused by the variety of questioning techniques available, and would not adopt effective and efficient approaches to questioning. A three-stage model, to teach students about questioning techniques, consisting of initial training, practice and evaluation, and final evaluation, was used by teacher educators. During initial training, two paradigms of question types were presented: (1) affectively oriented questions for encouraging discussions about pupils' feelings toward reading passages as well as eliciting critical evaluation; and (2) cognitive questions for assessing  comprehensive skills in textual materials at three academic levels. The education students discussed, observed, and analyzed each questioning method. In the second phase, students submitted examples of each question type, and classified and analyzed both their own and their peers' questions. In the final stage of training, students analyzed and evaluated the quality of all their own and their peers' work from the beginning of the semester. (FG)",

        "description":"The concept of student success is open to many interpretations and assumptions. Although teachers strive for student success, success is a relative term, contingent upon the situation in which it arises. Generally, success is judged by prior conceptions and criteria; yet attribution of success can depend on the vantage point of the judge. A student with a \"B\" grade point average may be considered successful in comparison with peers, but unsuccessful in comparison with previous performance or that of a sibling. A standard interpretation of success is salary and job status, but a more valuable concept is an individually determined match of a desired process and result with the actual process and result. Teachers can view student success in two ways: (1) success in the role of  student; and (2) success of individuals who are students. Students who achieve the school's or teacher's goals can be described as successful students. However, if teachers broaden the definition of \"student\" from a restrictive nominative role to persons whom they contact and influence, the concept of student success takes on a more individualized, ambiguous meaning. Teachers should be aware of their standards for success, whether they are societally, systemically, or personally determined. (FG)",

The guide was designed to be used with a filmstrip entitled \"America's Women of Color: Past, Present, and Future\" and to help teachers of secondary and postsecondary students to integrate ethnic group information into existing curricula. The focus of the guide and filmstrip is on the status of American Indian, Asian American, black, and Hispanic women. Among the topics addressed are employment, historical figures, stereotypes, and issues of concern to both minority and nonminority group women. The guide consists of: (1) a discussion guide,  which defines four objectives and provides discussion questions and remarks; (2) a filmstrip script and supplementary information for the 70 frames in the filmstrip; (3) a teacher-developed 5-day lesson plan for seventh through ninth grade students, focusing on similarities and differences among roles of minority group women; and (4) a list of suggested supplementary student activities. Appended are five essays giving background information on the history, stereotypes and myths, economics, and current and future concerns of each of the four minority groups as well as of white women.

        "description":"Over the past decade there has been a growing movement to deinstitutionalize disabled persons, and educational services should be adapted to fit the needs of these persons. There has also been an enormous growth in the prevalence, scope, and diversity of community services that support them and their families. Increasing proportions of fiscal resources are being allocated to community services through sheltered workshops, group homes, early detection programs, public school programs, supervised apartments, and adult education programs. The delivery of these diverse community services has required the participation, cooperation, and collaboration of professionals trained in many different academic disciplines. Multidisciplinary and/or multi-agency approaches are being used in  programming for the handicapped. The ultimate goal of these approaches has been to improve the services and support to the disabled by eliminating the fragmentation of services, increasing the coordination of actions between agencies, and improving communication between professionals. This paper: (1) identifies and articulates a set of generic knowledge and skills that define a core of competency clusters around which a preparation program could be organized; (2) describes several alternative methods for teaching the core competency clusters; and (3) discusses issues and challenges that remain for programs which choose to prepare such professionals.

The survey was designed to tap varying perspectives on the proposed test content and its relationship to teacher education curricula and existing requirements for entry-level teaching positions of elementary and secondary school teachers. The three elements of the proposed test used in the survey were general knowledge, communication skills, and professional knowledge. The nationally sampled populations included deans of education, professional education faculty, English department heads, elementary and secondary level  principals and teachers, student teachers, state and local boards of education, and school-based parent groups. A need for greater clarity in professional education and more weight on the processes than on the context of teaching were indicated. Items in the general education fields were generally acceptable, and communications skills were a high priority. Emphasis for all groups of respondents was on useful and job-related knowledge and skills needed by beginning teachers. Interpersonal skills were stressed in all areas. Responses revealed high expectations regarding teacher literacy and teacher awareness of current real life concerns. Sample questionnaires used in the survey are appended, along with tables containing the demographic and rating statistics of each response group.  (JD)",

        "description":"Emphasis on the traditional approach in educational research has given way to the scientific approach, and, gradually, the focus of research has shifted from the teacher to include student behavior. Many variables previously associated with teacher behavior are recognized as being associated with student behavior. Future research must use previous studies to formulate a clearer pattern for effective teaching. Researchers have relied on a global description of process/product to test the effectiveness of learning experiences, but that research emphasis should also include studies of the relationship between teacher competencies and learning experiences. Since pupil achievement is related to these experiences, they must be controlled to facilitate learning. Certain variables that  have already been proven valid through study may have such strong influence over learning that other variables may be masked. Future studies should attempt to control such variables as management skills to see to what extent other variables may affect learning. Research has been successful in identifying effective teacher behaviors, notably in the early grades, in teaching basic skills. Studies identifying those teaching variables that apply to upper grades and in different context areas need to be developed. (Authors/JD)",

The project was undertaken to create a substantial data file containing multiple measures of learner attainment information that will provide alternatives for modeling teacher preparation effects through regression analysis. The program is a competency based program for secondary level teachers that conceptualizes teaching as a series of events requiring five distinct sets of instructional skills: (1) specifying performance objectives; (2) diagnosing learners; (3) selecting instructional strategies; (4) interacting with learners; and (5) evaluating the effectiveness of instruction. Information from  82 secondary level student teachers and 9,001 learners taught by the student teachers comprised the sample for the data base. The student teachers were supervised by five university supervisors over the course of five semesters. A variety of scales and criterion-referenced instruments were used to gather information from the student teachers and the university supervisors. A set of 452 variables were obtained which permit the individual pupil of the student teacher to be the unit of analysis. Tables provide statistical summaries of classroom observation ratings, weekly morale ratings for student teachers, and performances of individual learners. The data sets are reproduced in the appendix. (JD)",

        "description":"Research was conducted among 82 secondary level student teachers to determine whether teacher candidate effectiveness is related to learners' cognitive attainment levels. The quantitative difference in the number of objectives achieved by over 6,000 learners in 2 units taught by student teachers was examined over 5 semesters. The student teachers were supervised by 5 university supervisors and 57 classroom supervisors from 12 schools. Two rating scales were used by the university supervisors to rate the student teachers: an evaluation profile of instructional skills and a checklist for curriculum context. Student teachers completed two self-evaluation instruments and developed criterion-referenced tests to provide learner achievement data from their pupils. The findings indicated  that there were no sizable differences in the percentage of objectives achieved across the two units taught by the student teachers. Tables are provided giving the percent of total objectives achieved by learners, the number of instructional periods used by student teachers for the two units, and the time devoted to teaching each unit.

Master teachers in this survey included those assigned to supervise student teachers as well as those who may have been chosen for outstanding performance. Items on the survey were: (1) state policies on selecting supervising teachers; (2) state policies on recognition of outstanding teachers; (3) state policies on extra pay for supervising teachers; (4) state policies on extra pay for outstanding performance; (5) certification requirements for supervising teachers; and (6) inservice training of supervising teachers. Fifteen states responded that they have state policies or regulations about how student teacher supervisors are chosen. For the most  part, these requirements were included in the state standards for the approval of teacher education programs. The most frequently mentioned requirement was that the supervising teacher be properly endorsed in the subject or area in which the student teacher is seeking certification. Three states have state policies on recognizing outstanding performance of teachers. One-fifth of the states indicated pay supplements to teachers who are assigned to supervise student teachers. No state had policies regarding extra compensation for outstanding teachers. Fifteen states answered that they do have state requirements as to training that must be completed for a teacher to serve as a supervisor of a student teacher. Responses to the survey are presented in tabular form (alphabetically by state),  and additional explanatory notes on different items are included from states which expanded their comments. Specific provisions relating to selection and requirements of supervising teachers, as found in state standards for approval of teacher education programs, are also quoted. (JD)",

        "description":"The relationship between teachers' statements about classroom tasks and the degree of subsequent student engagement were studied to test the influence of teachers' expectations. Task presentation statements made by teachers in 6 reading and mathematics classes for the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades were classified according to 18 categories of expressed beliefs or expectations. Students' subsequent engagement with each task was coded as: (1) clearly engaged; (2) probably engaged; and (3) clearly not engaged. It was expected that engagement would be highest after positive expectation statements and lowest after negative statements. However, student engagement was generally higher when teachers moved directly into tasks than when they began with any presentation statement.  Although the data suggested that negative task introductions are counterproductive, the parallel data for positive task introduction produced weak and ambiguous associations. The most likely explanation is that the data reflect the effects of situational factors of each task assignment, rather than the effects of the statements themselves or student motivation. Other factors for consideration in future research include the frequency of motivation attempts, task variables, and the size and design of research studies. (FG)",

Research studies and other literature on this topic are examined, including case studies, surveys and evaluations, studies of program implementations, and organizational theories of schools and other institutions. Emphasis is given to organizational theories and findings concerning small organizations and program implementation, which suggest ways of approaching and understanding efforts to change schools. Attention is also given to identifiable characteristics of schools and school personnel and the way that schools actually operate and change. Effective schools are seen to be characterized by order, structure, purposefulness, a humane atmosphere, and the use of appropriate instructional techniques. It is  noted that what appears to be lacking from the literature are suggestions on how to develop these characteristics in the schools. A different approach to school improvement is offered, involving the concept of a school cultural perspective in which schools are viewed as dynamic social systems made up of interrelated factors. In a portrait of an effective school, a description is given of the sustaining characteristics of such a school, including collaborative planning and collegial relationships, sense of community, clear goals and high expectations commonly shared, and order and discipline. A proposed strategy for change is outlined. (JD)",

        "description":"In an examination of the implementation of educational change, a discussion is presented on the purpose, meaning, and context of change. Consideration is given to the value of change, its benefits and feasibility, and the capacity for implementation. In the second section of the paper, 14 factors related to the implementation of change in schools are summarized, and corresponding research on these factors is cited. In discussing the characteristics of the change itself, the factors of need, clarity, complexity, quality, and practicality are examined. Six factors influencing the characteristics of change at the school district level are discussed: (1) the district's history of innovative attempts; (2) the adoption process; (3) district administrative support; (4) staff development  and participation; (5) time-line and information systems; and (6) community characteristics. In discussing the school level factors relating to change, the role of the principal, teacher-teacher relationships, and teacher characteristics and orientations are singled out as factors for consideration. The last set of factors are considered under the label of assistance external to the school district. Six types of outcomes of change are identified: (1) degree of organizational change; (2) scope of implementation; (3) incorporation of the product; (4) incorporation of a problem-solving process; (5) problem resolution; and (6) personal impacts. The final section of the paper addresses implications, unresolved issues, and the question of deriving practical lessons for integrating the theory  and practice of educational change. (JD)",

        "description":"The characteristics of the talent pool that will be available to the teaching profession is largely controlled by institutions and agencies that either have only a passing interest in the education of teachers (major universities) or by those that have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo (schools of education that are dependent on filling their classes with students). The public schools have been encouraged to develop reward systems aimed more at recruiting new teachers than at maintaining or motivating them. Given the perception that many teachers are marginally qualified, administrators receive more status and rewards than teachers. The organizational structure of schools provides few meaningful ways of promotion and advancement, other than by renouncing teaching  and becoming an administrator. Sex stereotyping has encouraged administrators to believe that teachers generally are inadequate managers and has encouraged teachers to believe that administrators are bosses rather than colleagues. The net effect is to discourage entrance into teaching and to encourage bureaucratic solutions, cynicism, and a lack of intellectual leadership in schools of education and in the public schools. By conceptualizing schools as workplaces and students as the primary workers, the role of oridinary classroom teachers becomes that of a first-line supervisor as opposed to a low-level employee. Responsibility for the professional training of teachers should be divorced from institutions of higher education and teacher education should once again be placed where it in  fact occurs: in the public schools.

To test this assumption, 125 high school students were randomly assigned to read concept materials containing adjunct elaborations that varied by elaboration type (mnemonics, schematics, or metaphors) and presentation mode (verbal or visual). To permit generalizibility, elaborations were constructed using domain specifications, and treatments were repeated across three subject categories. Post tests revealed that visual mnemonic elaborations are the most effective for higher order comprehension.

Slopes are proposed as outcome measures which may reflect within-group processes in between-group analyses of multilevel data. Research on aptitude x treatment interactions, contextual effects and school effects provide a theoretical rationale for the proposed methodology. Science data (Comber and Keeves, 1973) on 14-year-olds is used as an empirical example to illustrate a group-level analysis with slopes. In this example, a school-level analysis (N=107 schools) of factors affecting science test performance is considered. The findings of steeper within-group slopes related to greater opportunities for exposure to science  instruction and with greater emphasis on individual exploration are consistent with results from research on informal/open, individually guided/less structured instruction. Further study is needed for schools with specific combinations of discovery approach to instruction, amount of science instruction and verbal ability. Despite their theoretical and empirical appeal, the use of within-group slopes as outcomes is fraught with problems. The statistical, empirical, substantive, and communication problems that arise from the use of slopes as outcomes are discussed. (Author/PN)",

Evaluation activities and the range of methodological issues considered are: field-based investigations of large-scale programs; evaluation of on-going programs and of various forms of social experiments; and both well-defined and broad-based educational programs. Both  analytical procedures employ explicit models of the phenomena believed to be responsible for the difficulties in estimating program effects.

The paper begins with a discussion of the general question of choice of unit of analysis, or what may be the more appropriate question of choice of analytical model. It then provides empirical illustrations of the importance of knowing the question of interest. Two additional topics are considered: the use of within-group slopes as indices in between-group analyses, and the estimation of within-group dependency and its role in analysis of multilevel data. These topics reflect substantive concerns in school-based non-experimental investigations. It is proposed that, in addition to the studies of the variation  in analytical properties across approaches with hypothetical data, alternative approaches should be applied to a wide variety and sizeable number of actual data sets, each with a potentially differing set of inadequacies. In this way, more could be learned about both the methods and the influences of data limitations on methods. (Author/PN)",

A theoretical rationale for examining multilevel characteristics is presented. It can be used as an aid to understand why program and instructional effects on measures constructed from individual-level psychometric data are weak, to improve instructional sensitivity and program relevance of tests, and to indicate what features of a test will increase the sensitivity of the test to instructional program variables. An empirical example form the International Evaluation of Education Achievement study and an analysis of one test from the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study are examined to better understand how multilevel analysis can lead  to more informed use of item data. It was found that between-student analysis fails to take into account the instructional context and its effect on student item response. This failure has two effects. First, the relationship between item response and other variables cannot be explained since it is a conglomerate of two different processes. Second, the between-student analysis may give a distorted view of whether an effect does or does not exist. (Author/PN)",

Psychometric and multilevel educational data considerations are of particular concern. Two general approaches to investigation of between-group (classroom, school, program) differences in test performance can be used to detect differences in content, sequence and quality of instruction. Patterns of data responses from a standardized testing program conducted within a school district in the Beginning Teacher Evaluation Study (BTES) were  examined. Between-group indices of the distribution of performance by class, school and ethnic background were generated under alternate rules for content classification. The subsets of group sensitive items and between-class correlation of items with instructional variables were used to build a scale sensitive to the variable used to select items. Item response patterns were related to group membership and instructional coverage. The results supported the argument that tests can be constructed in multilevel approaches sensitive to desired group characteristics for information about instructional experience differences. (CM)",

FTCE has four subtests: Mathematics, Reading, Writing, and Professional Education. Rasch calibrated item banks have been developed for all subtests except Writing. The methods used to evaluate the stability of the score scale as it relates to a cut score based upon a logit value are explained. Cut off levels were established in terms of a logit ability scale based on field test data. Linking items were chosen so that difficulty levels were centered at the cut score. Item selection was based upon closeness of fit to the Rasch Model and item difficulty. The linking items for the Professional Education subtest were of  primary concern. Results showed no bias in the test due to differences in curriculum. (DWH)",

        "description":"Traditional sex difference research ignores the impact of social forces on the research process. It characteristically interprets sex differences as female deficiencies, also emphasizing the view of sex differences as determined by personal characteristics rather than situational contexts. Since research is a social process with a potentially powerful social impact, an awareness of the impact of cultural values on the process and an understanding of the political nature of research work are essential. Values too often bias the research product. A statement of the research problem is often restricted by social context and past theory. Researchers must reject the &quot;deficit hypothesis&quot; as a guide to research questions and must emphasize, when appropriate, situation-centered  orientations to research, as opposed to person-centered activities. Cultural biases often result in the use of improper methods which support the false findings of sex differences. Research design must show an awareness of the impact of sex-related situational factors within the experiment. Most impact from research stems from the researcher's results, discussion, and/or conclusions, with little attention paid to methods which are of primary importance in assessing accuracy of findings. Researchers can minimize misinterpretation by careful presentations and by monitoring and correcting misinterpretations of their work. (PN)",

These surveys were undertaken to remedy the lack of specific information on sex and ethnic differences. The first survey of research organizations found both women and minorities underrepresented, with women more apt to be part time workers or clustered in lower level full time jobs. Minorities were clustered at lower levels as well, but in the private nonteaching sector whereas women were in the public education sector. The survey of individual researchers found strong sex differences on most  variables, with the differences always favoring men. Complex racial differences favored whites, but not with the consistency or degree shown in sex differences. Researchers' uses of work time and research funding showed no racial differences. Most inequitable treatment mentioned by minorities and women related to employment rather than professional activity. Self-selected individuals in the telephone survey indicated negative inequitable treatment but made few effective responses to the treatment. In their suggestions to increase equity, few had much hope of its effective achievement. (Author/CM)",

Sherry Rubinstein, and others, characterize the changes of teacher certification programs and reflect on the factors propelling and influencing the direction of those changes such as increased emphasis on the description and testing of the skills and knowledge of prospective teachers, and the adoption of criterion-referenced measures to assess teacher skills and knowledge. Katherine Vorwerk and William Gorth present a general model for developing the formal testing component of a certification program. The model includes: (1) developing certification requirements; (2) deciding how to assess requirements; (3) defining measurement strategies and instruments; (4) handling logistical issues of assessment; and, (5) communicating and using  assessment results. Michael Priestley explores various approaches to assessment for initial teacher certification. Conceptual issues are considered in relation to test design, assessment for entry to a teacher education program, exit credentialing, and classroom performance assessment. Paula Nassif reviews technical issues of teacher certification testing, focusing on standard setting and equating, and validity and job analysis. Scott Elliot presents current applications of job analysis methodology to teacher certification testing. (PN)",

The project provided a comprehensive set of educational and diagnostic services to families and children from birth up until entry into kindergarten. Teacher ratings and independent observers recorded the classroom behavior of program participants as well as a group of comparison children. The analyses focused on identifying children who did not reach minimum standards in school social and mastery skills. Classroom observations indicated that fewer children who participated in the project were having difficulty. The results favored the BEEP participants, particularly in the area of social skills. These results were consistent regardless of the family background characteristics that were considered.  On the teacher ratings there were no overall effects, but significant interactions between program participation and family background characteristics indicated that participating children generally had fewer problems than comparison children in those subgroups where problems would ordinarily be expected to be more prevalent. The study reported here is still in progress. Important future steps will be to look for program impact in other areas in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of school competence, including health, parent involvement and developmental status.

The ITBS, CAT, Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT), and SRA Achievement Series were reviewed and evaluated on 18 criteria, the foremost being compatibility with the APS curriculum. The CAT was selected. An equating study using the method of equi-percentile equating of scores was utilized to determine the relationship of scores between the 1971 edition of ITBS and the 1978 edition of CAT. It was found that  correlations for the two tests were higher for the on-level cells, and that the correlations for Mathematics were higher than those for Reading Comprehension. In 1980 the CAT test battery and the ITBS Reading Comprehension subtest were administered. Score conversions produced equivalent results only for the second grade. The first grade CAT scores were equivalent to the national norm; other grades scored below the national norm. Reading Vocabulary scores were particularly low. The highest scores occurred in Spelling.

Detailed individual descriptions of desegregation processes were yielded but the failure of summary attempts is attributed to the lack of a theory of social explanation appropriate to interpretive social science, and a lack of understanding of the relationship of social research to practice. A policy-relevant method of ethnographic synthesis considering the nature of explanation is presented. The essay summary and full report summary formats were aggregate result approaches placing aggregation above understanding. Context became the confounding variable in the search for common findings. A truly adequate explanation is much more involved and requires a  comparative understanding by defining a &quot;puzzle&quot; of conjunctions of hypotheses for an explanation that &quot;translates&quot; the practices and conditions within the schools to each other, lessening the research contraints of policy. Both the hypotheses and the explicit comparison are maintained to guard against the threat of utilitarian culture on ethnographic syntheses. Utilitarian culture seeks to explain struggle, power and emotion as technical problems in prediction and control. (CM)",

A job analysis of clerical and administrative positions in the Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands was accomplished by means of a single questionnaire comprised of 264 items of the following types: 31 knowledge, 104 skill or ability, 99 activity, 15 job evaluation, and 15 biographical. A quantitative procedure utilizing activity data was developed to assure that positions are properly assigned to classes. Factor analysis of skill and ability ratings identified seven job domains that can be readily operationalized in the form of written or performance tests. The inferential leap from job analysis data to test content was  minimized by including statements of test behavior in the questionnaire; moreover, the validity of subject-matter-expert ratings of skills and abilities was demonstrated by correlating them with time-spent ratings of work activities. A factor analysis of 15 job evaluation scales produced 2 factors (Scope and Complexity) that can be used to predict the grades of these types of positions. Selection and classification recommendations for the Virgin Islands and potential usefulness of the methodology for other jurisdictions are discussed. (Author)",

This paper traces the development of the methodology for documenting interventions used in the PTI. Nine elementary school principals (three each from Colorado, Florida and California) served as the primary subjects and informants on intervention in this study. The study sites varied by principal's concerns, year of implementation, and innovation being implemented, as well as by school district. Procedures included: bi-weekly telephone calls, interviews,  logging, document collections and field notes by researchers; and multiple perspectives and sources of data. In all three studies, the informants provided data on the interventions in which they themselves, as well as others or events, were the sources of action. The methodology employed for the PTI study is as effective and efficient a self-reporting technique in developing the total picture as are the more expensive ethnographic methodologies. (PN)",

Defining the CFSoCQ required a combination of innovation-related items and change facilitator role-related items. Analyses of descriptive concerns data identified a set of seven Change Facilitator Stages of Concern. In 1979, a questionnaire was developed to measure these concerns. Pilot studies were conducted with factor analyses and item analyses selecting five items for each stage resulting in a measure that has independent scales  and high internal reliability. The CFSoCQ provides a means for measuring the concerns of leaders which have a significant influence on their leadership behavior and in turn makes it possible to study the influence of those concerns on facilitator behavior. Briefly, a relatively high score indicates intense concerns on that stage; low scores indicate low intensity or absence of concern. An interpretation procedures manual is under development. (PN)",

        "description":"Cross-cultural orientation programs are generally intended to help sojourners in countries with cultures that are different from their own to make practical preparations for living abroad; communicate with people in the host country; avoid social errors; refrain from judging the host culture against their own cultural norms; and cope with culture shock. Many of such programs have merit in that they are well planned and well implemented; however, a more important concern should be whether these programs have worth in improving sojourners' abilities to learn about other cultures on their own. In considering the worth of orientation programs, issues often emerge concerning who should be included in training; the emphasis of programs; orientation approaches to use; and the need to  train returnees to the home culture. Theory and past experience suggest that program worth may be enhanced by (1) providing training not only for participants but also for their host families and natural families; (2) emphasizing post-arrival (in the host country) orientation while retaining pre-departure orientation; (3) increasing knowledge of the home culture along with training oriented toward the host culture; (4) employing both culture-general and culture-specific approaches; (5) providing reorientation programs for returnees to the home culture; and (6) utilizing both experiential and intellectual approaches in training.

Five interns from minority backgrounds participated in the program in 1980-81, during which they engaged in a variety of ERD experiences while simultaneously pursuing the requirements for the doctorate in their respective areas of specialization. The program consisted of three components: (1) personal development, which provided technical knowledge, skills, and practical experience in ERD inside and outside the traditional educational system, and provided opportunities for interns to complete their degree programs; (2)  institutional liaison, which placed the interns in individual projects and maintained liaison with current and prospective institutional employers of the interns; and (3) documentation of each intern's progress. At the end of the year-long program, the interns assessed their program experiences using evaluation instruments on which they indicated (1) the extent to which they perceived their individual program goals as having been accomplished; (2) the extent to which they felt stated SEDL program objectives were attained; and (3) the specific ERD skills that they felt they needed to develop further after having participated in the program.

        "description":"Observations of children's daily activities and interviews with the children's caretakers provided information on preschool children's informal home education in Utuado, Puerto Rico. Three kinds of skills were examined: literacy, chores, and rule-bound games. The unit of analysis was the &quot;Potential Learning Activity&quot; (PLA), a behavior/sequence of behaviors that can result in learning on a specific topic. PLAs were identified as involving observation, imitation, or performance. Literacy PLAs (reading, writing, counting, and preliteracy) were the most frequent skills observed, and games were the least frequent. Activities involved performance more often than observation and imitation. About half of the literacy and the chore PLAs were done alone, while all game PLAs were done with  others. Children initiated performance and participation in literacy and game PLAs more than in chore PLAs. The PLA interactions involved the initiation-reply-evaluation sequence of formal education, but unlike formal instructor-initiated education processes, PLA interactions were responses to children's behavior and speech and dealt more with process than with facts. In urban Utuado, children's informal education, like that in unindustrialized countries, emphasizes participatory learning and learner-initiated learning opportunities, but places less emphasis on observation, imitation, and demonstration as learning methods.

The support provided by the project helped seven participants to complete the doctorate degree and encouraged other participants to pursue further educational research activities. Other project outcomes included a questionnaire on support systems for Hispanic graduate students; a study on predictable characteristics of children's literature books in Spanish; a library collection of materials on women and minorities in educational research; and published reports on specific projects. The model was found viable for implementation, with appropriate modifications, in other institutions. (MJL)",

        "description":"Three magnet middle schools which were established as part of a voluntary desegregation plan in a school system in a large, American city are described in this report. The schools are examined as organizations that differed in their innovative educational approaches to bring about desegregation. One school offered a system of open education, in which students planned their own daily programs of activities in consultation with their teachers, and implemented these programs individually. The second school provided Individually Guided Instruction (IGE), which involved breaking the school population down into units, each with a common group of teachers, to create smaller social contexts within the whole school environment. The third school emphasized education for the gifted and  talented, and was distinctive more for the character of its students than for any special teaching approach. The report focuses on the historical and political context within which the schools developed; the educational patterns that each school employed; organizational processes (such as leadership styles, school history, student composition, and interpersonal relationships) through which each school developed a distinctive character; and the effects that the schools had on interpersonal/interracial relationships and on attitudes toward school. Concluding observations about organizational processes in schools in general and in magnet schools in particular are presented. (Author/MJL)",

Based upon a study conducted among seventh graders of five different ethnic groups in several schools in Boston, Massachusetts, it is concluded that: (1) outcomes vary among different ethnic groups within the same school; (2) some schools are more equitable than others; (3) schools vary more than homes; and (4) higher ratings of school climates than home climates on a number of factors often lead to positive school outcomes (higher  achievement and higher attendance). Use of a survey questionnaire developed for the study is suggested for educators who wish to determine general school climate and to measure the extent of equity in schools. Indicators of school outcomes and school climate are described, and ways in which selected school climate characteristics might be improved are discussed. A procedure presented for improving equity in multicultural schools considers such steps as initiative-taking; forming school improvement teams; developing a team work plan; setting clear purposes; collecting assessment data; analyzing data; developing a school improvement plan; implementing the plan; and evaluating results.

Results indicated that, compared to advantaged students, disadvantaged students tended to be older; spent more of their early years in small villages; indicated that relationships in their families showed more negative characteristics; indicated lower levels of education considered necessary for success in life; expressed less satisfaction with instructional methods but had similar opinions as advantaged students about teachers and schools; demonstrated lower self-esteem but similar educational  aspiration levels; preferred humanities courses (versus advantaged students' preference for science); had lower morale and less positive attitudes toward the future; and demonstrated lower levels of academic achievement. The data suggest the need to provide compensatory education and other educational opportunities to help to bring disadvantaged students up to the cultural levels of the advantaged before requiring them to attain satisfactory levels of school achievement. Some possibilities for such opportunities are presented and discussed under five categories, as defined by issues relating to: (1) curricula; (2) teachers; (3) schools and school administrators; (4) guidance specialists; and (5) families and communities.

        "description":"Previous research suggests that most Puerto Rican students who have spent some years in the United States and then returned to Puerto Rico generally experience cultural adjustment problems, language difficulties, low self-esteem, and identity crises. This study compared attitudes of Puerto Rican return migrant students (those who have returned to Puerto Rico after living for 3 or more years in the United States) with attitudes of Puerto Rican circulatory migrant students (those who constantly move back and forth between Puerto Rico and the United States) concerning school, teachers, and self-concept in Puerto Rico and in the United States. The Inventario de Percepcion al Ambiente Escolar, an attitude questionnaire, was used to elicit responses from 117 migrant students. The  research results indicated that return migrants had more positive feelings toward school, teachers, and self in Puerto Rico than in the United States, while the converse was true of circulatory migrants, who demonstrated more positive attitudes toward school, teachers, and self in the United States.

        "description":"This review of research on Asian American performance on cognitive measures (especially in comparison with the performance of whites) covers studies of intelligence test performance, academic ability, aptitude and achievement, cognitive style, and career paths (as influenced by cognitive abilities) among young children, elementary and secondary school students, applicants for admission to higher education, and college and graduate students since 1960. The review reveals that on intelligence and aptitude tests, Asian Americans have consistently scored higher in mathematics and lower in verbal sections than the United States population as a whole. Studies of cognitive style suggest that Asian Americans lean toward field independence and tend to do better in cognitive analysis and  restructuring tasks than in activities that require greater social sensitivity. Examination of career paths indicates that Asian Americans are overrepresented in higher education institutions and in academic fields that require aptitudes for mathematics, spatial conceptualization, and reasoning, but are underrepresented in humanities and the social sciences. The review is said to demonstrate that widely-used, standardized individual and group assessment instruments have provided valid, consistent, and educationally useful information about the mental abilities of Asian Americans. Future directions in assessing academic potential and evaluating achievement among bilingual and limited-English-speaking students are presented. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"United States population trends in 1960 suggested that the growing socioeconomic status of blacks would result in increasingly similar migration patterns among blacks and whites. Analysis of 1950 to 1980 census data was conducted to test that prediction. The analysis showed that in general, recent population trends have differed greatly from past trends, and are characterized by a shift toward nonmetropolitan growth (versus earlier movements toward large cities) and a resurgence of Southern growth. Examination of movements between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties showed that blacks are participating in the same redistribution trends that characterized the American population as a whole in the 1970-1980 decade. The greater black (versus white) growth rates in fringe  counties, the resurgence of black growth in nonmetropolitan areas, and the decline in racial growth differentials between the South and non-South in the 1970s suggest that blacks are increasingly affected by social forces that determine white population redistribution. However, growth rates have not completely converged: the narrowing of the gap between percentages of blacks and whites is marked only in fringe counties of large metropolitan counties. Given the magnitude of change in the last decade, the uneven distribution of blacks and whites will probably remain despite recent evidence of convergence. (Author/MJL)",

        "description":"This literature review of patterns of interpersonal communication in children of the Pacific Islands is based on the assumption that the communicative conventions in these children's homes are very different from those that they encounter in their Euro-American classrooms. Reviewed are studies of communicative interaction in children's peer relationships and with adults, and in teaching/learning situations which indicate how cultural patterns may conflict with some common classroom practices. It is suggested that while Pacific Islanders' teaching/learning patterns involve observation and imitation and teach operations that are related to the final goal, classroom instruction often involves teacher-centered verbal directions and presents tasks outside the context of overall  performance goals. It is maintained that differences between Pacific Islanders' cultural norms and norms commonly represented in schools reduce the benefits that children may get from schooling. On the other hand, ways of avoiding classroom practices which engender cultural conflict and of selecting appropriate practices which are consistent with home-learned conventions are presented. The experience of the Kamehameha Educational Research Institute is described to demonstrate a program which has capitalized on Polynesian-Hawaiian children's existing skills to improve academic performance.

        "description":"Existing research knowledge concerning the self-concept of Asian American children, particularly in relation to bilingual education, is explored in this paper. The significance of the literature review is considered to rest on the assumption that Asian Americans' physical characteristics, language, and cultural orientation make their self-concept highly vulnerable to the potentially adverse effects of the English-dominant school. The literature review, however, is said to reveal a paucity of relevant research on these children's self-concept. Due to the scarcity of empirical data, no generalizations are made in the report about self-concept among the different Asian American populations, either separately or as one group. However, observations included about the available data  point out problems in definition, measurement, and interpretation, especially concerning the nondifferentiation of different groups of Asian Americans; nonstandardization and nonequivalency of translations in self-concept test instruments; demand characteristics of the testing situation (such as linguistic ability); and construct validity of tests. The importance of further research inquiry along these lines is emphasized, and recommendations for future research on self-concept among bilingual Asian American children are presented.

To meet these students' linguistic needs, the Puerto Rican Department of Education has developed several bilingual education programs. Some studies indicate that, compared to non-migrant students, return migrant students are more poorly adjusted to school, lack confidence, feel inferior, have low self-esteem, and are often described by teachers as low achievers, troublemakers, aggressive, undisciplined, disrespectful, lacking identity, and unable to speak either English or Spanish well. However, some teachers believe that return migrants will react  positively when they feel that teachers and their non-migrant peers are trying to understand them. The problem of the return migrant student should be regarded not only as a linguistic problem, but also as one of adjustment to two cultures. (Author/MJL)",

According to the final report of this phase of the project, input was solicited from both vocational teachers and vocational teacher educators in the 50 states and Puerto Rico. Two national needs assessment surveys were used to identify the training needs with little difference found in the perceived training needs of vocational education teachers and vocational teacher educators. Top priorities assigned to training needs were derived from the knowledge, rather than the competency statements on the 96-item survey. The majority of these needs related to  assessment of students and interpretation of the results; characteristics and capabilities of students; job placement; and legislative requirements. The greatest training need perceived by the teachers was how to interpret the reports of other professionals. Teacher educators identified long-range planning needs, using appropriate materials and determining appropriate student performance as priority needs; the highest need perceived by the teacher educators was orienting potential employers of handicapped students. It was concluded that the 96-item survey was a reliable document for surveying training needs of vocational education personnel working with handicapped students, and that future teacher education programs should be based on the findings of this and similar surveys.

To help schools design and operate more effective youth employability programs through the use of EBCE strategies, the guide has four main purposes: (1) to identify and define some major issues that influence program success; (2) to share some ideas from around the country; (3) to alert readers to some potential problems; and (4) to offer some suggestions and potential  solutions. The first section of the guide describes five projects with EBCE and Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) connections. Based on these 5 projects, 13 issues are identified and explored in the second section of the report. These issues are collaboration, career awareness, job exploration, sex-role stereotyping, career development plans, academic credit, community involvement, survival skills, employer recruitment and development, student recruitment, staffing, staff development, and increasing institutional commitment.

Also examined were various issues relating to developing a functional network, including coordination and management, key leadership features, institutional support for EBCE, and communication and linkages. Data showed that the state networks studied were clearly successful in increasing educators' awareness and interest in EBCE  learning approaches. However, they were less successful in setting up a long-term EBCE state training capability. Analysis of networks in the five states resulted in recommendations calling for development of a simple training model that provides a way to bring new trainers into the system as experienced ones leave as well as for development of a system of recognition and reward to provide incentives for individual participation. Network designers were also urged to strongly advocate EBCE in the districts augmented by active state coordinators. (MN)",

Chosen as subjects for the investigation were the following three programs: Experience Based Career Education (a high school level program providing fully accredited community-based instruction in basic and life skills as well as in career development); Foxfire (a cultural journalism program reflecting the uniqueness of the local community); and Outward Bound (a wilderness experience designed to help students find meaning through group and individual encounters with unfamiliar environments that provide physical stress). After reviewing pertinent literature and interviewing staff of all three projects, researchers isolated what they believed to be the  essential characteristics exhibited by the programs in nine dimensions. These were purposes, setting, characteristics of participants, learning strategies, student roles, instructor roles, products of learning activities, management and support factors, and project outcomes. Based on their findings, the researchers proposed 33 essential elements within the above-mentioned 9 dimensions of experiential education. Included among these were a realistic, non-contrived setting; provision of learning experiences that are individualized, sequential, and developmental; active student participation in planning and implementing activities; and formation of positive relationships with external agencies.

        "description":"A study examined the effectiveness of secondary level vocational education in Oregon. Using the five project-developed survey instruments, researchers collected data from the following population: 1,609 10th and 12th grade students from 10 high schools throughout Oregon, 13 coordinators/administrators, 36 teachers, 140 parents of 12th grade vocational education students, and 56 local advisory committee members. Included among those areas addressed by the study were the following: program goals and objectives, curriculum, instructor qualifications, inservice, facilities and equipment, student support services, funding, safety, vocationally-related youth organizations, use of employer and community resources, and the role of advisory committees. A majority of the students and  parents surveyed were satisfied with the quality and type of instruction provided in the vocational programs. However, parents, students, vocational teachers, and vocational counselors all gave relatively low ratings to vocational counseling and job placement assistance. Recommendations for improving existing vocational programs called for increased communication with employers and better in-house coordination of cluster curriculum activities, improved counseling and job placement activities, more emphasis on reading and mathematics skills, and further research to secure program evaluation and student achievement and placement data.

        "description":"A study identified and verified the professional education competencies needed and presently held by beginning teachers of vocational agriculture in Tennessee. To obtain these data researchers designed a survey instrument that listed 99 competencies under the following areas: program planning, development, and evaluation; planning of instruction; execution of instruction; evaluation of instruction; advising student vocational organization; and supervising student occupational experience. The 30 beginning teachers who completed the survey rated the level that each competency was held by and needed by beginning teachers. After determining measures of central tendency for both the competency levels needed by and held by beginning teachers, researchers calculated the difference  between the two means and, thereby, determined the need for inservice competency-based activities. Ninety-six of the 99 competencies needed by beginning teachers received mean ratings of 3.00 or higher, and 93 of the 99 competencies presently held by the beginning teachers received mean ratings of less than 3.00. Recommendations included calls for incorporating the 96 competencies rated 3.00 or higher into the agricultural education curriculum at Tennessee Technological University and for using the results of the study to design and develop inservice teacher training programs.

        "description":"A model for evaluation planning of post-literacy programs involves listing possible evaluation needs, administration of evaluation, and dissemination of evaluation results for utilization by all potential users. Questions that should be pursued in evaluating post-literacy can be divided into these categories: (1) questions at the interface regarding literacy programs, literates, and aspirations of illiterate and new literate; (2) questions on literacy retention; (3) questions on second chance education programs; (4) questions on the systemic integration theme (social integration of new literates); and (5) questions on the socialization of individuals by post-literacy programs. Those working with post-literacy programs should choose questions from these lists to meet their  priority needs. The tasks in the administration of evaluation include the development of an evaluation system; linkage of this system with the program system as well as with outside support institutions; recruitment and training of evaluators; resource generation and allocation; and provision of logistical support, quality control, and time budgeting of the enterprise. The information collected must then be synthesized. From the syntheses of the evaluative information can be drawn practical operational conclusions that should be disseminated throughout the system among evaluators and program specialists. (YLB)",

Section 2 describes past trends and predicts future trends in vocational education curriculum and instructional research. Reviewer Curtis Finch summarizes research of the 1960s and early 1970s as overly simplistic, while recent research has been more comprehensive and specific. In section 3, research for special needs populations is reviewed by L. Allen Phelps. Four major special populations are addressed: limited  English-speaking, handicapped, incarcerated, and disadvantaged learners. Included in this section are four lighthouse studies. Richard W. Feller and David V. Tiedeman examine research related to career development theory in section 4. They first outline the sturcture of career development theory as it has evolved over the past 30 years and then summarize examples of current research in career development theory. In section 5.

In chapters 4-7 this framework is used for a comparative analysis of four major systems. The four CACGS reviewed in the manual were selected because they illustrate variety and are among the oldest, best researched CACGS in use today. (Other CACGS are mentioned in the appendices.) Chapter 8 provides an explanation of how to integrate the CACGS into  the counseling process. Chapter 9 focuses on the future of computerized guidance in an effort to direct the user's thoughts to the improvements and advances desired in future systems. Appendices to the manual are designed for quick reference. Appendix A contains a glossary. Appendix B contains a brief review of the major systems available today, while appendix C describes a condensed procedure for evaluating CACGS. Appendix D lists addresses of persons to contact for assistance in planning a CACGS. (KC)",

        "description":"A study analyzed the changing nature of older persons in the labor force, factors that may affect their work decisions, and policy changes that could facilitate their continuation or reentry into the work force beyond the normal retirement age. Data examined during the survey indicate that while the number of people aged 65 and older is continuing to increase as a share of the total population, the fraction of older persons in the labor force is declining. The declining number of older persons who choose to remain in the work force could reduce the amount of goods and services produced in the economy, reduce personal incomes, and put upward pressure on prices and inflation. Therefore, Congress might want to consider policy changes that would encourage older persons to continue  in, or reenter, the work force. Included among such potential policy changes are altering the Social Security age benefit structure, changing the Social Security earnings test, requiring continued accrual of private pension plans, increasing allowable retirement under private pensions, eliminating the mandatory retirement age, providing employment tax credits to firms employing older workers, and helping both experienced and inexperienced older workers find jobs.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine what secretaries perceive their training needs to be, and to determine how those training needs might be related to various demographic variables of the individual secretary. A questionnaire was developed that included the majority of skills that could be taught in a training session for secretaries. Thirty-six university and private industry secretaries ranked the items as being of \"no benefit\" to \"highly beneficial\" on a scale of 1 to 4 and also included their experience, tenure, job training, education, age, and job types. It was found that only a few secretaries believed that training in typing or shorthand would be beneficial, probably because these skills are prerequisites for being hired. Training on a word processor was viewed by most as  a highly important training need, followed in rankings by interpersonal communication, grammar, and business correspondence. It was also found that secretaries did not want to interrupt their personal time to attend training programs. Several relationships between demographic variables and perceived training needs were found to be negatively correlated. For example, the more education secretaries had, the less they saw a need for training in most of the basic components. Length of experience was found to be negatively correlated with perceived training needs for dictaphone machine or copying equipment. It was recommended that a larger and more diverse sample of secretaries be used in further studies of secretaries' training needs. (KC)",

The state was divided into three regions for administrative purposes. A needs assessment instrument was developed and mailed to each industrial arts teacher in the state (as of 1979), with a 50 percent return rate. The questionnaire gathered data relative to three areas of the program: profile of industrial arts teachers in Louisiana; examination of program status and need by grade level and subject area; and provision of selected information relative to the role of industrial arts in the public schools of Louisiana. As a result of examination of data gathered through the questionnaire, a rationale for industrial arts in Louisiana,  goals for industrial arts on each grade level, course titles, a program model and a flowchart for industrial arts course sequencing were developed. In addition, basic outlines of selected courses were developed by regional centers; work on this phase of the project is continuing. (The bulk of this document contains course outlines, including course descriptions, target grade level, prerequisites, and course content for industrial arts courses.) (KC)",

Concepts and sub-concepts related to housing as it might be taught in home economics programs are arranged at the beginning of the guide into a conceptual framework to show the relationships among them. Five major conceptual areas are covered in the guide: housing choices, economics of housing, housing management, home planning, and housing trends. These concepts are arranged to be taught on five levels: beginning housing (grades  6-9); housing--home economics I (grades 9-10); housing--home economics II (grades 10-11); housing--semester course (grades 11-12); and housing--modules (grades 12 and adult). From this conceptual framework, a scope and sequence outline is provided for each level. For the concepts on each level, topics, objectives, content areas, learning activities, evaluation experiences, and teaching resources are suggested.

The suggestions and information presented are intended for use in an ongoing safety program, not a short unit presented at the beginning of the school year. Following an introduction in unit 1, the material has been broken into eight additional units that address specific considerations necessary to safety in programs. Unit 2 discusses the responsibilities of various persons as they relate to safety, while unit 3 offers suggestions for the development of a safety program that meets the needs of the unique situation in every industrial arts-vocational education laboratory. In unit 4, the instructor's responsibility for teaching students the safe way to  perform the various activities in the different industrial and vocational curriculum areas is addressed. Most commonly recommended safety regulations are outlined in unit 5, while unit 6 is devoted to procedures for making safety inspections designed to ascertain if the laboratory is as hazard-free as possible. Recommendations for making advanced preparations for emergencies are the focal point of unit 7. Finally, units 8 and 9 provide a system for recordkeeping and present sample tests for general safety understanding. Transparency masters are provided with many of the units. Appendixes contain signs and safety instructions for machines, a list of resources, and supplemental safety instruction packets for automotive, carpentry/woodworking, electricity/electronics, machine shop, small  engines, and welding courses.

The sessions--which were held in Bogota, Columbia; Quito, Ecuador; and Recife, Brazil--involved a total of 75 participants from 27 organizations. Addressed during the seminars were development, leadership, mobilization, and learning in the context of community. The findings derived from the seminars suggested the following: (1) the paramount challenge faced by change agents is the human problems resulting from the migration flood that is presently being experienced throughout Latin America; (2) no one mobilization strategy is effective in achieving collective behavior change; (3) change agents must develop a repertoire of tactics derived from several strategies and combine them as is  appropriate to the particular circumstance; and (4) change agents must work cooperatively with community leaders in evoking a change in people's attitudes and behavior.

In addition, designers of the study sought to determine the learning approaches that are most appropriate in obtaining the identified knowledge and skills. Using a modified Delphi technique, researchers administered four questionnaires to 127 members of the American Society of Health, Manpower, Education, and Training. Based on the responses to the questionnaires, researchers offered the following suggestions: (1) Hospital education directors should prepare now for the many technological changes that will affect the role of the educator or the education department. (2) Particularly needed by the  directors are competence in diplomacy; skills to integrate the educational and institutional goals of the hospital; and knowledge of institutional, attitudinal, and behavioral change processes. (3) Training approaches designed to teach the recommended knowledge and skills should be practical, involve internships and other on-the-job experiences, and stress human relations skills as well as individual and group counseling techniques. Appended to the report are the survey instruments and responses. (MN)",

To investigate the relationship between an individual's age, sex, and degree of subscription to each of Albert Ellis' 10 irrational beliefs and their frequency and type of illness, 122 adults completed the Irrational Beliefs Test and an illness questionnaire. In general, the older subject with a high need for approval, competency, and achievement, a low need to find the perfect solution to every problem, and, to a lesser extent, a high dependency on other stronger persons correlated with more organ systems being affected by illness, more chronic illnesses, and, to some extent, a greater total frequency of illness. This was true more often in females  than in males. The findings suggest that subscription to irrational beliefs in combination with age and sex tends to account for some of the variance in the selective process of illness not accounted for by natural environmental factors.

A nationwide survey of school psychologist practitioners, trainers, and state coordinators (N=194) was conducted to address these problems. Results showed that 92% of the total sample expressed positive attitudes toward the application of computer technology in school psychology. Those who expressed negative attitudes generally had no access to computers. Coordinators emerged as the most experienced in programming skills and also reported the greatest access to  computers. Computer literacy courses were offered by 22% of the responding training institutions. Apple microcomputers were the most popular choice of school psychologists.

To explore role taking in the relatively overlooked population of young adults, a sociometric instrument, the Peer Role-Taking Questionnaire (PRTQ), was developed and used to measure perceived role-taking behaviors. The results were compared to those of a projective role-taking measure, the Role-Taking Task (RTT). The final sample consisted of 78 fraternity and sorority members, who also completed the Personality Research Form (PRF). Results showed that PRTQ scores correlated with sociometric/demographic measures of friendship, cooperation, class year, and group status. In contrast, RTT scores correlated with personality measures and college grade point average. Furthermore,  the PRTQ and RTT were not shown to correlate.

Results indicated that perception of an event, as influenced in some events by locus of control, influenced the response to the event to a certain extent. In addition, though, it was likely that locus of control may have influenced the  response of an individual to certain events, the ratings of which showed no influence from locus of control. The relationship between event-ratings and the response-to-threat construct of repression-sensitization was only partially upheld.

To provide a preliminary appraisal of this interaction hypothesis by examining the relationship between client and treatment loci of control as a predictor of success in weight control programs, questionnaires were administered to 23 college student subjects during individual interviews in which their prior experiences in weight control programs (a prerequisite for participation) were also evaluated. The obtained information permitted classification of subjects and their prior weight control programs as being primarily either internally-oriented or externally-oriented. Analysis  of weight loss data revealed a significant interaction between subject and treatment loci of control. The mean weight loss per week by the 11 subjects whose internality-externality orientation was similar to that of their treatment was 2.52 pounds, more than 2 1/2 times the 0.97 pounds per week lost by the 12 subjects whose orientation contrasted with that of their treatment.

        "description":"Growing interest in self-presentation has spawned several examinations of individual differences in the tendency to manage one's impressions, notably Snyder's attempt to identify skilled impression managers through self-monitoring and an associated monitoring device, the Self-Monitoring Scale (SMS). To further examine the SMS, factor analyses were conducted and revealed a factor that could be interpreted as tapping social anxiety. This factor caused persons identified as high or low self-monitors on the basis of extreme score selection criteria to be low and high, respectively, in social anxiety. Four experiments demonstrated that social anxiety may account for low self-monitors' self presentational behaviors in highly socially evaluative situations. These findings indicate that  the confounding of self-monitoring and social anxiety in the SMS may lead to ambiguous interpretations of research findings. (Author/JAC)",

Some of these problems include an emphasis of research on opiate use, methodological hindrances, and lack of a constituency. A review of two concurrent national processes, the White House Conference on the Family and the National Federation of Parents for Drug Free Youth, demonstrates the growing concern of families with the drug abuse problem. Increasing governmental interest in viewing drug abuse from a family perspective and a growing literature base indicate that philosophies, values, methodologies, and even bureaucracies may now be contributing to the emerging acceptance of the family and drug field as a  legitimate and essential area of research.

If psychology is to exert a constructive force towards the optimization of mental health of older women, it is essential for psychologists to be aware of the limits of current knowledge and the role of stereotypes in shaping both knowledge and the lives of older women. Typical myths about older women focus on those dealing with financial status, institutionalization, mental and physical health, and sexuality. Individual differences among these women reveal the need for more diversity in intervention programs and more attention to individual needs. (JAC)",

The overwhelming majority preferred the traditional role distinction in their own future marriages. Larger proportions of females favored complete equality in vocational and educational opportunities, while more males favored traditional sex roles; however, there were more similarities than  differences between male and female responses. There were also few differences between the educational plans of male and female students; females seemed to take work as seriously as did males.

Two recent investigations were designed to correct for earlier problems in archival research, and a third was designed to correct for the analogue problem of using pseudo-case histories rather than actual working therapist-client pairs. Findings on the treatment plans of experienced therapists from data analyses of the three studies revealed that therapists responded to their perceptions of their client's presenting problems rather than client gender in formulating treatment plans. Therapists tended to focus on specific problem remediators rather than on the less specific cultural traits involving sex  roles. The results suggest that in the early stages of therapy, feminine themes such as self-awareness and the ability to communicate may be vital to the creation of a workable therapeutic environment and that these themes are probably more an expression of therapy stage and only incidentally related to gender role.

Specifically, 98 seventh and eighth grade students were given a questionnaire developed to ascertain students' perceptions of their ability to complete essay and multiple-choice tests. Subjects then read one of two folk tales, took the appropriate test, retrospectively reported on the strategies they used, and freely recalled the folk tale  read. Results indicated that when the scores on the essay and free recall measures were adjusted for prior reading achievement, the self-perceived high proficiency group performed significantly better than the self-perceived low proficiency group. There was also some evidence to suggest that students' perceptions of proficiency affected their choice of strategic activity. Namely, students who perceived themselves as having low proficiency in dealing with the criterial tasks reported &quot;reading carefully/slowly&quot; siqnificantly more often than those who perceived themselves as having high proficiency. Finally, an analysis of the effect of criterial task on strategy selection revealed that students who read and studied for an essay test &quot;reread&quot; more frequently than students who prepared for a  multiple-choice test.

Sixty college students divided evenly into six experimental and control groups were asked to read one of two versions of a story: one in which a couple happily agreed not to have children, the other in which the man's desire to remain childless greatly upset the woman. Those in the experimental groups were then asked to write their impressions of the story. Subjects who had read about the disagreeing couple were then told they had gotten married, and those who read about the agreeing couple were told they had split up. Those in the control groups either received the biasing information before writing their impressions or did not write any impressions. At the second  session, either 2 days or 2 weeks later, subjects were asked to recall the story they had read during the first session and to avoid adding their own impressions or thoughts to the account. The primary dependent measure was the number of reorganizing errors in the subjects' recall. Subjects who were tested after 2 days were more accurate in their overall recall than those tested after 2 weeks. There were no other differences in overall recall between groups. Contrary to prediction, those who learned the marriage outcome before writing their impressions did not commit a greater number of reorganizing errors than those who wrote no impression. They did, however, commit more errors than those who wrote an impression before receiving the biasing information, although the effect was only  marginal. (HTH)",

In the first experiment, 88 fourth and fifth grade students were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental conditions to learn the capitals of 14 states. Students in the control group used their own &quot;best method&quot; for learning the capitals, those in the second group used the complex key word device, and those in the third and fourth groups used a one-stage (similar to the complex device) and a three-stage version of the simple key word device. Students were tested for immediate recall  after the session and again the following day for delayed recall. In the second experiment, 59 fourth grade students were assigned to control, simple key word, or complex key word groups. The procedures paralleled those in experiment 1 except that in both experimental groups the capital key word learning stage contained an additional trial to raise the level of subsequent recall. Students were tested immediately and 2 days later. The results of both experiments indicated that the purportedly effective complex key word method was no more effective than students' own devices when subject to controlled experimentation.

To achieve these purposes, four experimental studies of middle school students tested (1) 27 passages scaled for external links, imagery, interest, reading ease, and word frequency; (2) the role of prior knowledge in  retrieval process; (3) the effects of text familiarity and cohesion on retrieval of information learned from text; and (4) methods of training seventh graders to elaborate. The results of these studies validated the theoretical point that elaborative processing of prose material enhances its later retrievability. The studies also showed that two practical ways of encouraging elaboration processing are direct teaching of elaborative processing strategies and selection of new information for which learners may have some prior related knowledge.

The paper first discusses the immediacy assumption, which holds that a reader tries to interpret each word of a text immediately upon encountering it, and the eye-mind assumption, which posits that the reader continues to fixate a word until all the cognitive processes initiated by that word have been completed to some criterion. It then reviews several global features of eye fixations in reading that provide  support for these assumptions, noting that several run counter to common conceptions of reading. The paper next describes a general model of language comprehension based on a computer simulation that was developed both to formalize models of specific processes and to make the processes function collaboratively in an interactive system. This discussion is followed by a review of research on specific comprehension processes and an evaluation of the model. (FL)",

What research has been done indicates that literacy instruction that not only stresses the importance of social interaction, but also allows elders to participate in the actual program planning--which gives them control over the situations that affect their lives--has demonstrated that the \"diminished view\" elders often have of themselves can change dramatically. The little empirical data available also point to the fact that reading interests of the elderly vary just as they do in the general population,  but few commercial publishers seem to be interested in developing reading materials for this group. Thus, the literature illustrates a need for further empirical research into the perceptions of reading and writing held by the elderly. Such research should not assume that elders are \"old children\" who need \"back to basics\" instruction, or that elders share the same needs, beliefs, and interests with a college-educated public. Rather, this research should investigate the elderly's concepts of the purpose of reading and writing, assess their reading needs as well as their reading interests, and examine the effect of societal expectations of the abilities of the elderly on their reading behaviors and interests.

The first section explains how the development of automatic word recognition as a function of reading skill was investigated in seven experiments using Stroop-like tasks. It describes a longitudinal study of the development of automatic word recognition and how this skill is used by adults. It comments on the semantics effects in the development of this skill and examines the dimensions of lexical coding in Chinese and English. The second section reports on  studies that examined the comprehension of brief passages, especially the forward and backward search processes in sentence integration. The third section reports on studies that present text in a rapid, serial, visual presentation format. The section emphasises (1) visual search and the reading of rapid, serial presentations of letter strings, words, and text; (2) such reading with and without eye movements; and (3) the role of comprehension and memory in reading rapid, serial presentations of text. Summaries and conclusions are provided in the final section. (HOD)",

        "description":"Two experiments using the same design and subjects drawn from the same populations tested two accounts of schema-directed text processing, the selective attention hypothesis that suggests readers identify text elements as important or unimportant on the basis of an engaged, operative, or subsuming schema; and the slot-filling hypothesis that states that important elements are learned simply because the subsuming schema provides a slot for them. In the first experiment, 16 policemen, 20 real estate students, and 19 education undergraduates rated the relative importance of sentences in a story after being randomly assigned to one of three perspectives: burglar, prospective homebuyer, and no specified perspective. Results revealed that reader perspective is a powerful determinant of  perceived importance. In the second experiment, subjects, divided equally among the three perspectives, read the passage on a PLATO screen, one sentence at a time, with the reading times for all sentences being automatically recorded. Their recall was also tested by means of a free-recall protocol. Results once again confirmed the importance of perspective, with readers spending more time on those portions of the text relevant to their assigned perspectives. Although not conclusive, these results support the selective attention hypothesis, while providing no support for the slot-filling hypothesis. (JL)",

        "description":"The grammatical subject of sentences in English is regularly but not invariably perceived as the sentence topic. Attempts to express this regularity as a rule of grammar are frustrated by the numerous cases in which there is no topic or some other referring expression is the topic. An alternative account is one in which sentence topic is inferred on the basis of properties along two linguistic dimensions. The first is syntactic markedness: the more marked the syntactic structure, the more strongly the subject or other salient noun phrase (NP) is perceived as the topic. The second scale involves the referential explicitness of a possible topic NP. The NP types most compatible with being sentence topics are the ones which identify the most clearly their intended referent. In both  cases, the definition of topic is based on the paradigmatic opposition of elements in English, serving as a &quot;context&quot; for all utterances. More marked structures and most explicit NPs have a communicative function of identifying what the sentence is about, relevant to the processing of syntactic-semantic structures in discourse.

This section also illustrates how an i-map succinctly represents the structure of a text, such as description, comparison and contrast, or definition and characteristics. The idea of frames and their corresponding frame i-maps are introduced as a way of representing repeating patterns of information in particular content areas: static frames capture the information  associated with the general concepts of a subject matter area while dynamic frames represent repeated patterns of behavior or sequences of actions. The second section of the document discusses why i-mapping might be a useful instructional technique in reading as well as how teachers might implement the technique in the classroom.

In his essay, &quot;The Function of Criticism at the Present Time,&quot; the &quot;blocs&quot; of his thought are in sets of two, three, or even four sentences: in effect, he writes much like a poet, in couplets, triplets, and quatrains. He also uses a variety of devices to combine his blocs into larger discourse units. His high level of redundancy helps readers integrate and process his difficult text. He manipulates structure to attain parallelism, and characteristically puts the most important information in subordinate clauses and phrases. On the semantic level, he does not use many synonyms, preferring repetition of key words to achieve cohesion. This  repetition slows the presentation of new information and leads to greater ease of processing. Arnold's discourse blocs, surface form manipulations, foregrounding, and redundancy all serve to help him develop his ideas while keeping his sentences intermeshed and his prose coherent. (JL)",

Students from three third grade elementary school classrooms were screened using a battery of selected language and cognitive assessment devices. Ten children referred for having school-related difficulties were tested and found to have significant language delays. Five of these children were assigned to an experimental group and given language therapy as part of their reading program. Five were assigned to a control group and taught traditional reading. Guidelines for the teacher in the experimental  condition included using simplified instructions, providing moral support and verbal cues, and providing children with plenty of opportunities for achieving success. At the end of one semester, both groups were tested using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the Test of Auditory Comprehension of Language. The results indicated that students exposed to language therapy via their reading lessons improved their scores significantly on the two language comprehension tests. Students who received traditional reading and language intervention had less significant gains on these two measures. (HTH)",

Scene content for the four items in each scene, either high or low probability, was varied within subjects. In experiment 1, subjects were asked to recognize target components on an immediate recognition test containing equal numbers of high and low probability targets and distractors. In experiment 2, subjects were asked to recall the target item when the three  items accompanying it during acquisition were represented in their original structural form during cued recall. Experiment 3 examined free recall. Results of all three studies showed developmental improvements in recognition. The effects of form and content did not vary developmentally when memory was tested by recognition or free recall. Naturalistic forms facilitated recall but not recognition at all ages. Age and content interacted when memory was tested by cued recall. (Test items are included.) (JL)",

Thirty-three undergraduate students listened to 96 test sentences (including 48 fillers) that expressed 1 meaning in either a novel or frozen metaphorical or literal form: \"The old couch was in love with its new slipcover\" (novel), \"The old couch was at home in its new slipcover\" (frozen), \"The old couch looked good in its new slipcover\" (literal). The subjects were instructed that their primary task was to comprehend the meaning of each sentence, and they were told that they would have to make a yes/no \"meaningfulness\" judgment for each sentence. As a secondary task, subjects were asked to press a key in response to a light presented 250 msec after the last word in each sentence, with the  response times recorded. Following presentation of the sentences, the subjects were given a forced-choice recognition test in which they were to determine which of two metaphorical and literal versions of a sentence had been presented in the trials. Performance on the secondary procedure indicated that metaphors required greater attention for comprehension. Performance on the \"meaningfulness\" judgment task showed that the subjects comprehended the meaning of the four sentence types equally well. Finally, in a result possibly related to the increased attention required to comprehend figurative language, both novel and frozen metaphors were remembered significantly better than literal sentences.

A modified version of a graphic organizer contains empty slots that represent missing information and actively involves students during the reading process as opposed to before or after. This modified graphic organizer can provide both the motivation and the structure necessary to turn inactive readers into active readers. It is motivating because it contains very few words, and those that are included serve as cues to information the student will be expected to search for, read, and write in. Retention is improved because the imposed structure also acts as a cuing device. Finally, it is useful in letting students in on what the teacher considers important in the textbook. Eight  steps involved in its use include (1) selecting a portion of the textbook which discusses the concept being taught, (2) listing on index cards all the words that are representative of the concept, (3) arranging the words to show a relationship, (4) transferring that arrangement to paper but substituting empty slots for certain words, (5) copying the completed graphic organizer on the board or overhead transparency, (6) discussing with students the purpose of the organizer, (7) assigning pages in the textbook while reminding students that they are reading to locate the missing information, and (8) discussing the completed organizer with the students.

Although scores on the major intellectually oriented standardized aptitude tests are often useful predictors of introductory psychology grades, these scores are frequently unavailable. When major standardized measures of general intellectual aptitude cannot be used, it has been found that the Nelson Denny Reading Test (NDRT) predicts semester grades equally well. Still, in order to enhance the predictability of success in these courses, an intellectually oriented instrument, the Discourse Comprehension Abilities Test (DCAT) was constructed. Part 1 of the DCAT, the Language Usage Test (LUT), is a 20-minute paper and pencil test consisting of three subtests. Part 2 of the  DCAT, Listening Comprehension (LC), consists of three taped subtests totalling 25 minutes. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent of correlation between scores on the DCAT and the criterion measure, semester point totals, in introductory psychology classes for which entrance tests were largely unavailable, and to determine if the DCAT scores are comparable or superior to NDRT scores as predictors of academic performance. Results indicate that although the DCAT and NDRT both appear to be useful predictors of classroom performance, the DCAT is apparently the stronger predictor. (HOD)",

His use of demonstrative pronouns makes it difficult to identify antecedents precisely and quickly. For example, in one case a reader must go back over 400 words to find an antecedent. His use of relative pronouns produces the same confusing effect, requiring a time consuming, problem solving approach. Besides the same kind of processing problems caused by his use of demonstrative pronouns--remoteness of antecedent from pronoun, vagueness resulting from reference to a general idea of a preceding sentence, and reference to nouns that were not expressed but merely implied--his use of relative pronouns produces additional problems of placement and  shifting. To readers lacking adequate knowledge or schemata of 17th century vocabulary, grammar, and oratory, Milton's formal style, long periodic sentences, unusual word order, ungrammatical sentences, and frequent coordination of phrases and clauses lead to difficulties of processing and require new strategies for decoding.

        "description":"To address the question of why newspapers tend to become more and more fragmented internally and to propose a model of the interrelationships between the newspaper and its \"operating environment,\" this paper draws on recent work by organizational theorists. Beginning by examining the central goal of newspapers, the first section suggests that the difficulty of integrating newspapers may stem, in part, from the need to identify central, unifying goals of newspapers and the critical tasks of each of their departments. From there the paper proceeds to examine newspapers as boundary-spanning organizations, including external and internal boundaries. A typology of boundary spanning is provided that takes into account the routine ways newspapers deal with the uncertainty in news work,  the roles of proximity and impact in determing how events are processed as news, the stories outside the predictable range of probabilities, the trends and incidents in news stories--especially \"what-a-story\" events, and the deadlines and other work flow decisions in newspaper organizations. The paper concludes with the suggestions that the application of the boundary-spanning model may be prescriptive rather than descriptive, a delineation of what \"ought to be\" rather than what \"is.\" Nevertheless, the paper suggests the model may come closer to directing attention to remedies than the critical descriptions of news and news work offered by other recent research.

Satisfying composition and philosophy requirements, this experimental six credit course will be offered to allied health care and business students to help them utilize writing, philosophical inquiry, and literature to explore the processes human beings must undergo to make responsible choices. The first unit of the course, \"Efficiency,\" reflects the values of the students who are going to take it. The second unit, \"Alienation and Invisibility.\" examines the implication of a value system that stresses efficiency through the study of literature and  philosophy. The next unit, \"Death: Loss, Limit, and Vulnerability,\" explores the way in which alienated individuals try to cope with death. The final unit, \"Hope and Choosing,\" stresses the vast range of choices that exist on the continuum between freedom and determinism. (Detailed lesson plans and model exercises are included.) (JL)",

Students from three United States high schools and a comparable Australian school were asked to write a letter of advice to a younger student on how to write a composition on community improvement. A content analysis was performed on the letters, individual pieces of advice and their topics were listed, and a classification scheme was constructed based on the topics. The advice came under four major categories: (1) task demands, (2) reader  impact, (3) writer demands, and (4) composition demands. The results indicated that the average number of pieces of advice per letter was higher for the advanced classes than for the intermediate or the introductory classes. Most of the advice and hints given by the advanced classes were about the composition itself, and task advice was mentioned least often. Surprisingly, there was little advice devoted to unity and coherence, especially in the U.S. schools. While there were many differences between schools across subcategories, when the U.S. classes were all combined and compared to the Australian class, there were striking similarities.

        "description":"Whereas previous research on writing focused on measurable aspects of written products, more recent research has focused on the processes of writing, using such research methodologies as laboratory case studies, naturalistic studies, quasiproduct studies that interpret results in terms of process, and studies that have unique procedures as a focus. In laboratory case studies, participants most frequently compose alone in a writing area theoretically free from distraction while researchers make notes about the writers' behavior during composing. Naturalistic studies take place within an ordinary setting for writing with the investigator as a participant-observer. Quasiproduct studies deal with revising activities. Drafts of compositions are collected, photocopied, and analyzed.  Unique procedures are used to investigate a particular facet of the composing process such as the use of a particular writing implement. Information derived from using these new methodologies has discredited the strict linear model of the composing process: prewriting, writing, and postwriting. Rather, the information has verified what most competent writers know intuitively about the recursiveness of the writing process and about the subprocesses of composing: planning (setting goals and generating and/or organizing ideas), translating (transforming thought into its graphic representation), reviewing (appraising what has been done and what needs to be done), and revising (mentally changing the content and structure of the discourse as well as changing the actual text).

The newspaper's stock in trade is the relevant, timely issue--just what is missing from all too many social studies classrooms. In dealing with issues in social studies classrooms, teachers are only limited by their imaginations. For example, three specific issues that can be explored through the use of the newspaper are gun control, capital punishment, and societal roles. Each issue can become an activity unit that would be approximately 1 to 2 weeks in length. A collection of news articles, editorials, letters to the editor, syndicated columns, editorial cartoons, and even advertisements would be useful to a  discussion of gun control. The controversy surrounding capital punishment can be explored through a study of editorial pages. The advertising media of newspapers is a good place to examine how societal roles are changed or perpetuated. (Discussion questions and sequential activities are suggested for each topic issue.)

By contrast, there were not enough items from the negative clusters to warrant inclusion.

The course was later modified by Auburn University. A study investigated the effectiveness of the techniques used in this course--systematic desensitization and cognitive restructuring. Desensitization involves a program of deep muscular relaxation, while cognitive restructuring involves getting people to realize that they have been conditioned to think negatively about themselves and then getting them to think positively. The 60 students enrolled in the 15-week course were each administered a communication apprehension  measure. Based upon their scores, they were placed into one of three sections. Those students in the two sections reserved for high communication apprehensives received instruction in assertiveness, as well as in desensitization and cognitive restructuring, while students in the section for low apprehensives participated in role playing activities. At the end of the course, all students were again tested for CA. Results showed that systematic desensitization, in conjunction with cognitive restructuring and assertiveness training, appeared to be effective in reducing CA. (A course outline is included.) (FL)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine if the speech communication programs in Texas colleges and universities were providing the skills needed by industry. A survey of current business journals revealed seven skills needed by college graduates seeking employment in business: (1) public speaking skills, (2) knowledge of communication theory and flow of messages through organizations, (3) interviewing skills, (4) small group meeting skills, (5) dyadic communication skills, (6) listening skills, and (7) leadership skills. Forty-one 1982 undergraduate and 16 graduate college catalogs were examined to discover the number and percentages of Texas degree programs offering business communication-related courses and to compare the description of the skills focused upon in the  business-related communication courses to the seven skills listed as needed by the journal review. Except for courses in persuasion/sales presentations and small group discussion and for skills in business-related oral reports and group meeting, all results showed that Texas college speech programs were not meeting the stated communication training needs of business and industry. It would appear that these programs need curriculum additions. (JL)",

        "description":"The seeds of mass communication research in broadcasting were extracurricular, not academic, inspired by experimental campus radio stations. Prior to the mid-1930s, radio research was scarce. Until World War II, radio speech was the most important topic, followed by articles on how to use radio for improving instruction. There are three increasingly likely explanations for this narrowness of scope: (1) teachers viewed broadcasting in terms of public address rather than from a theory of behavior, (2) speech was just establishing itself as a legitimate field, and (3) the idea of programatic research was alien to departments of speech. As a result, most early scholarship on broadcasting and communication was done in other departments. Paul Lazarsfeld's development of panel analysis  and uses and gratifications studies and Robert Park's and George Gallup's work in public opinion research were especially important early influences. Motion picture research lagged well behind broadcasting research, but it too was influenced by earlier work outside the field, particularly literary and art theory. The disillusionment with mass communication research in the 1950s mirrors the disillusionment with the power of mass media itself. Marshall McLuhan's controversial work in the 1960s rekindled widespread interest in broadcasting research. (JL)",

        "description":"The development of behaviorally-anchored rating scales (BARS) will permit researchers measuring the effectiveness of school administrators to utilize sound, ethnographic methods instead of relying on traditional, theory-based rating systems. In this document the author describes his own modified process for developing BARS and explains the strengths and weaknesses of the BARS approach. The author asked five school principals to develop lists of essential administrative tasks and to describe in their own terms practical behaviors that were effective and ineffective in performing those tasks. The author compiled the results and is currently testing their validity with a second group of principals. When his project is concluded, the author will have a list of 14 tasks, with related  behaviors ranging from the effective to the ineffective. The BARS approach is cited as encouraging descriptive validity, providing for adequate descriptive language, and taking into account the social meaning of behaviors, three factors that empirical behavior measures tend to overlook. Shortcomings of BARS, according to the author, include its dependence on multiple criteria, the complexity and time-consuming nature of the scale-developing process, and the subjectivity involved in interpreting measurement results.

The conference viewed collective bargaining and administrative leadership from the perspective of the researcher, the teacher union representative, the administrator, and the teacher. The 2-day conference was divided into four sessions. Speakers in the first session addressed the historical development of bargaining and the impact of bargaining on educational policy. Presentations made during the  second session focused on the effects of bargaining on personnel relationships at the school and district levels. Bargaining's impact on the allocation of teacher time, teacher salaries, and perceptions of teacher work were discussed in the third session. The final session consisted of a review of the role of collective bargaining in education and suggestions for future research. (Author/LL)",

Several approaches to classroom management are covered in chapter 5. Chapters 6 and 7 treat behavior modification and student behavior contracts. The value of eye  contact is emphasized in chapter 8. The 9th and 10th chapters cover detention and suspension. A system of merits and demerits is proposed in the next chapter. Disciplining the angry child is pondered in chapter 12. Chapter 13 deals with corporal punishment. Chapter 14 contemplates the relationship between school climate and discipline.

Over 200 references are cited, with an emphasis on research findings from the last 10 to 15 years. The first two chapters are on teacher and administrator selection, respectively. The third chapter concerns documents dealing directly with women and minorities in education professions. Among the major findings of the report are that most school districts lack an established policy for the selection of teachers or administrators. In addition, the author found that the personal interview is the most utilized selection technique, although  hiring officials have seldom had any training in interview techniques. Finally, there is overwhelming evidence that the effectiveness of different selection criteria depends largely on the nature of the local environment. Among the recommendations are that school districts develop a systematic research-based selection program; conduct extensive, planned interviews; continuously monitor the effectiveness of the selection process; and actively recruit members of groups that are underrepresented.

This report reviews the relevant literature on organizational theory and role theory, applies these theories to the school setting, and presents the findings of the research based on these theoretical approaches. The first of two sets of findings centers on the character of the school as a workplace in which teachers' role expectations inhibit or encourage collegiality and openness to innovation. The character of the school is explored in terms of the kinds of work practices  followed; the degree, location, frequency, practicality, relevance, reciprocity, and inclusivity of staff interactions; the status, knowledge levels, and role competence of the individual staff members; and the general and specific influence of the principal. The second set of findings focuses on characteristics of influential staff development efforts, notably the degrees of collaboration, collective participation, focus, and time involved. The relationship between school effectiveness and each characteristic considered in both sets of findings is explored as each characteristic is discussed. (PGD)",

Part 1's three chapters discuss social structure and classroom knowledge, review previous research, set forth the research design, and  describe administrators' and teachers' patterns of control of the classroom and curriculum planning. In part 2, four chapters describe each school, its structure, community, and administrative context, and individual teachers' methods of classroom and knowledge control. Comparative analysis of the data is presented in part 3, which considers the locus of authority in the school and the classroom, methods of &quot;defensive teaching&quot; to maintain control of knowledge, and the effects of these teaching methods on the economics knowledge presented in class.

Approximately 240 persons were interviewed and a total of 1,038 usable questionnaires returned. The authors conclude that (1) public sector labor relations have changed the nature of school governance and the patterns of participation of lay persons in the schools; (2) three distinct generations and two highly conflict-ridden  intergenerational periods exist in school labor relations; and (3) there have been important changes in school operations and in the nature of work within schools.

An introduction to the directory analyzes this data and financial data on the schools as well.  Turning to enrollment trends, this overview notes that in every year from 1976 to 1980 Catholic schools have enrolled 6.7 percent of the total number of public and nonpublic school children in the U.S. Enrollment trends in Catholic schools show an increase in minority and non-Catholic students and, regionally, an increase in the Southwest and West. Projections by the National Center for Education Statistics show enrollment in nonpublic schools will increase from 11 percent in 1982 to 12 percent in 1989.

These findings support hypotheses based on the theory that collective bargaining will make a difference in resource allocation when the preferences of teachers and management do not coincide. The hypotheses state that, without collective bargaining, management responds to the preferences of marginal teachers (those mobile enough to quit if dissatisfied) because inframarginal teachers (those less mobile) pose less of a threat to district stability. Moreover, inframarginal preferences are more effectively represented when teachers are unionized, and  strong unions can significantly alter the outcomes of contract negotiations, affecting teacher control over instructional spending. The research examines relationships among the following factors: union affiliation, district characteristics, kinds of contract provisions, and numbers of contract provisions. Special attention is paid to the impact of enrollment decline on union intersts in collective bargaining. The study found that the stronger the union, the more items covered in the contract, the more resources allocated to instruction, and the more control exercised by teachers in district decision-making.

Explored next are effects, costs, and benefits of seniority policies on teacher layoff, transfer, and bumping in the four districts where educators were interviewed. The role of seniority in  industry's employment practices is considered next, for purposes of comparison. The report then identifies the major elements of contract provisions relating to seniority, including criteria for layoffs, layoff units, bumping rights, and other relevant educational factors. The document closes with a clarification of the differences between unions' and teachers' views on seniority rules and an assertion that it is possible to design seniority provisions that do not conflict with the interests of education.

None of the other 12 topic areas accounted for more than 5 percent of the articles. Of the 2,500 authors represented, 41 percent were  affiliated with colleges and universities and only 24 percent were actually secondary school principals. Females constituted 14 percent of the authors. The researcher concludes that this analysis reveals a number of biases in the content and authorship of the NASSP Bulletin, and that several pertinent topic areas have been neglected. (PGD)",

Section 1 describes the extent of enrollment decline; analyzes its causes, including changes in birth rates, women's work roles, and migration and housing patterns; and explores its effects, including reduced school budgets and staffs, restricted class offerings, and increased class size. Special attention is paid to the problems associated with school closing, particularly when urban schools are affected. Section 2 presents suggestions for coping with declining enrollment. These include guidelines for enrollment prediction; plans for involving the community in the strengthening of programs through needs assessment, goal setting, strategy determination, and evaluation  of the results of changes; suggestions for staff involvement in retrenchment planning; strategies for reducing the professional staff; and recommendations for using a task force approach to ensure community involvement and communication. Section 3 notes contributions that state education agencies can make to combat enrollment decline problems. Among these are improving forecasting methods, providing planning assistance and special services, and developing more flexible staffing policies. (Author/PGD)",

Part 1 of this two-part report presents the results of an analysis of 34 documents, available through the ERIC system, on curricular development. Each of several factors involved in successful curricular development (including curriculum planning, the roles played by individuals in the process, the classroom environment, the curriculum change concerned, and the evaluation strategy) is broken down into several topic areas, and the documents addressing these topics are identified. From this review the author concludes that successful innovations involve child-centered, individualized curricula as well as  teachers as primary \"change agents,\" continuous parent and community involvement, inservice activities building teacher competencies, basic skills and career awareness components, systematic planning for change, awareness of staff roles, and good evaluation and monitoring systems. Part 2 of the report offers a linear process model, based particularly on the work of Ronald Doll, for defining collective and individual roles in the curriculum development process. Special attention is paid to the role played by the central office staff. Relevant documents from the 34 listed are again noted. (PGD)",

        "description":"According to the author of this report, enthusiasm for inservice programs has been lacking, partly due to disagreement over program control and partly due to a perceived lack of relevance in the programs. This overview of a number of research and development projects suggests that the programs' relevance is the more important of these factors and that even mandatory programs may eventually be accepted by teachers when the classroom outcomes of the new approaches are sufficiently effective. On the other hand, the participation of inservice trainees in defining the needs and goals to be addressed by inservice programs is also important, and a number of the projects discussed in this report emphasize collegial approaches to program selection as well as to the implementation of new  practices. Among the concepts described are peer coaching by teachers, the use of teacher cadres, and collaboration between administrators and teachers. One of the programs noted, the Teacher Center Project, differs from the other projects in that its programs are teacher-initiated and tend to be oriented toward individual training needs rather than institutional goals. The success of this project underscores the necessity of considering individual development needs when planning inservice education and staff development programs. (Author/PGD)",

The document describes the evaluation requirements contained in the three chapters of the federal Education Consolidation and Improvement Act and asserts upon analysis of the law that needs assessemnt, program implementation evaluation, descriptive evaluation, management evaluation, cost effectiveness, outcome evaluation, and sustained gain evaluation components should be incorporated into state and local education agencies' programs. Assuming that the costs and information yields of these processes will determine their  value, the authors assess the likelihood of their adoption under various conditions. After noting some major trends in evaluation, including increased utilization of evaluation and qualitative methodology, and a tendency to adapt methods from such disciplines as journalism, philosophy, and business, the document concludes with predictions regarding evaluation policy and practice during the 1980's. These predictions include reduced emphasis on large-scale summative evaluations and program evaluations, failure of the trend toward qualitative evaluation, increased use of auditing methods, and a growing emphasis on new electronic technology.

        "description":"Assuming that today's school administrator must manage the organizational contraction associated with declining resources, the authors of this research report investigated the causes of contraction and its effects on school systems in terms of demographic changes, economic changes, and political considerations. The researchers examined the policy alternatives of closure, consolidation, and shared use by analyzing the impact of closure on three school sites and of consolidation and shared use on one site each. Six variables relating to the size of the general and student populations within each school's service area were considered for the years 1960-80, using U.S. census and 1974 Polk Profile survey data. The research results showed that school closure as a policy choice had a  neutral effect on most variables. When there were immediate impacts, they tended to be negative. However, in one case school closure was related positively to increases in the school-age and younger populations. Shared use was related negatively to most demographic variables. When assessment of the relationship between the intervention and the demographic variables was possible, there tended to be a balance between the neutral and positive trends. Consolidation showed little relationship to changes already in progress. The author concludes that the contraction policy chosen has an impact on neighborhoods where environmental forces converge and resource scarcity increases competition. (Author/PGD)",

Chapters 3 to 5 examine in detail the various change attempts and assess their effectiveness. These include efforts to raise individuals' awareness of sex inequities in education and to encourage individual women to aspire to administrative  careers; activities designed to alter the organizational practices and procedures that have helped maintain the sex imbalance in administration; and attempts to deal with the hiring process. The last two chapters explore the legacy left by SEEL for possible future change and develop recommendations for others.

Composed of eight regional exchanges (each representing several R&amp;D laboratories and university-based centers), four central services, and a coordinating committee, the RDx has four major goals: to provide information, technical assistance, and training for school improvement programs; to promote the use of R&amp;D outcomes; to promote coordination among dissemination and school improvement programs; and to  increase shared understanding and use of information about client needs in order to influence future R&amp;D efforts. In addition to describing the RDx mission and basic structure, this document briefly highlights two areas in which the RDx has achieved significant success: working with state departments of education in the design, development, and implementation of state-wide school improvement programs; and disseminating and promoting the use of R&amp;D outcomes as they support local, state, and regional school improvement initiatives.

The block grants reviewed were established before 1981 under the Partnership for Health Act, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, the Community Development Block Grant program, and Title XX of the Social Security Act. The GAO found that accountability requirements and local autonomy under the grants varied but that the requirements tended to increase in number and complexity over time. Groups targeted for assistance under the earlier categorical programs tended to received comparable assistance under the block grants. Consolidation had  mixed effects on administrative costs but further reductions in federal requirements could result in economy. Less program evaluation material has been available to Congress than under categorical programs, largely because many programs were made accountable at the state rather than the federal level. The GAO notes that these findings may not apply to newer block grant programs because of substantial changes in program structures and intentions. The reactions of other government agencies to the GAO conclusions are also provided. (PGD)",

Noting that participants found fewer than half of 52 selected workshops both necessary and desirable, the authors propose the use of a standard form and personal contacts to learn what teachers want to study. When teachers fail to see the need for workshops deemed necessary by administrators, it may prove more useful to convince the teachers of the need than to schedule a workshop and require uninterested teachers to attend. Application of the &quot;Levels of Use&quot; interview technique can inform administrators of the effectiveness of  the inservice programs. In personal interviews with workshop participants, interviewers can collect information concerning the number of teachers implementing the new program, the level of implementation, modifications made in the program, and problems encountered using the program. The interviews also reveal teacher attitudes about the effectiveness of various aspects of the workshops and permit future inservice programs to be altered. Three cases in which this interview technique was employed are described to illustrate the concept's usefulness. (PGD)",

        "description":"A three-part study of social studies curricula in four Wisconsin high schools revealed how teachers use the ways they present course content to maintain discipline and control in the classroom. Called &quot;defensive teaching&quot; by the author, the methods involve simplifying the content and reducing demands made on students. The three parts of the research included an intensive ethnographic analysis of the presentation of economics information in one high school's social studies classes; the extension of this analysis to three other schools; and a survey of student attitudes and employment outside school and of their effects on student school work. Analyzed in terms of the concept of school knowledge and the school's role in society, the study data showed how teachers use the forms of  knowledge--namely, teaching techniques involving the fragmentation, mystification, omission, or simplification of economics knowledge--to control the knowledge and thereby control students. These &quot;defensive&quot; techniques were used by teachers from all the political perspectives and teaching philosophies encountered, working in classes with all variations in student ability. The author concludes that it is teachers' accommodation to the school priorities of control and efficiency that leads to the limiting of student access to human knowledge. (Author/RW)",

The author notes the government's responsibility in the growth of unionization and describes the concepts and purposes of unionization in the private and public sectors. Arguing that government's statutory responsibility to provide services and its monopolistic control of those services give unions unfair advantages and deny the public its rightful control over government activities, the author proposes methods for resisting unionization. The document next discusses the handling of employee complaints and  describes managers' rights to unionize and to bargain collectively.

        "description":"The final report describes the Comprehensive Communication Curriculum (CCC), a 4-year program involving the communication skills of severely and multiply handicapped students with very little spontaneous communication skills. The program was designed to teach the students appropriate easily learned responses for requesting objects and initiating social interactions. The first section describes the CCC program and its application in Kansas. Five program components are discussed: (1) the caregiver interview; (2) identification of wants and needs; (3) request training; (4) initiation of communication; and (5) environmental manipulations to facilitate spontaneous use. Seven case studies illustrate such procedures as systematic reinforcer sampling, diagnostic teaching, requesting  more, use of a communication board, and requests through sign language. Part 2 describes the project's family involvement component. Two phases are considered for the teacher in implementing a parent involvement approach: initiating strategies (such as an initial contact letter and followup telephone calls) and ways to continue and increase involvement (such as classroom observation or volunteering). A hierarchy of services for parental participation in the education of their child is charted. The bulk of the document consists of five lengthy appendixes, including examination of the CCC model development and replication, and bibliographies related to the communication curriculum and the family involvement component.

Techniques for compensatory instruction are discussed for language arts, mathematics, and vocabulary. Sample techniques include using a typewriter, organizing the notebook, making a multiplication aid, and using a  keyword mnemonic method to recall vocabulary. Provided for remedial instruction are games appropriate for various subject areas (such as crossword math and a see through study sheet), techniques and materials for written expression, remedial reading activities, and spelling techniques. The final section covers survival skills with suggestions for teaching study skills, flowcharting arithmetic tasks, and learning to fill out forms. The appendix consists of suggested forms used for a mainstreaming program including a report form from the regular class to the learning disability resource room, a mainstreaming progress report, and a weekly assignment sheet.

IEPs in 20 elementary sites were reviewed in phase 1, 59 elementary teachers were surveyed in phase 2, and 16 of those surveyed participated in interviews in phase 3. Five major research issues were addressed in the study: role specification of the IEP document, characteristics of the IEP implementer, environmental characteristics, and child characteristics. Findings from the three data sources were highly consistent, suggesting that regular class teachers were basically uninvolved in the formal aspects of IEP development and implementation (they typically did not attend IEP meetings, did not receive a  personal copy of the completed IEP, and rarely referred to one when they did have it). Teachers with more skills, training, and experience in special education, and those who had students from resource specialist programs, were likely to be more involved in the formal IEP process. Informal involvement in the process was noted through meetings with special education teachers. It was concluded that regular class teachers should be included in IEP meetings whenever possible, should be provided with a personal copy of the IEP, and should be given training in diagnostic/prescriptive teaching, special education techniques, collaboration skills, available special education services, and relevant legislative requirements.

Ways of assessing parents' needs are reviewed, as are four types of services to meet the identified needs: parent education, direct participation, parent counseling, and parent provided programs. Materials and approaches are recommended for each of the four delivery types. The parent education approach is considered in terms of teaching parents to participate in individualized education program planning, and providing information on such topics as normal growth and development and special skills needed to provide care for their child. The description of the direct participation approach focuses on work with fathers, and new approaches such as  the Portage Project. Parent counseling emphasizes coping patterns and lists criteria for successful counseling. Parent organizations and parent to parent programs are sources of parent provided programs. A section on evaluation of parent involvement programs touches on ways to measure parent satisfaction; program effectiveness; changes in parent knowledge, skills, and attitudes; and the degree to which services are used.

Sixteen Ss were matched with a comparison group who performed as well over all, but whose scores did not show such differences. The two groups completed four listening and reading tasks dealing with inductively and deductively styled paragraphs. Results showed that Ss whose screening scores had large differences performed on all tasks as if they were using perseverative strategies. Analyses of the timed tests indicated that these students were reading the  entire text, not processing only the beginning information and omitting the rest. Recall task results indicated equal total recall by the two groups, but the comparison group used more of the signalling terms from the texts. The perseverative group scored low on the inductively structured items on the oral word finding task. (Author/CL)",

Among conclusions reached by panel members (who included representatives of biomedical research, psychiatry, pharmacy, education, and environmental law) were that the cluster of symptoms known as hyperactivity does not represent a single disease; research evidence is not adequate;  and a defined diet should not be initiated until thorough diagnosis and evaluation and a consideration of all options have taken place.

The program's purpose is fourfold: (1) to develop an increasing awareness of the professionalism of the paraprofessional in the total educational system; (2) to present an overview of P.L. 94-142 (the Education for All Handicapped Children Act) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504 regulations; (3) to discuss legal implications of the role of the special education paraprofessional; and (4) to provide an opportunity for special education paraprofessionals to attend miniworkshop sessions on a variety of special education topics. Findings for each of the three evaluation reports are presented in terms of project objectives. Among third year  results are that workshops were well received; were effective in training paraprofessionals, teachers, and facilitators; and were viewed in a very positive way. Attachments to the third year report include a sample registration form, a conference agenda, and a table of paraprofessional training materials. The second year report also cites the success of the program, based on the process and performance objectives. A first year report makes up more than half the document and contains separate sections on process objectives (such as the development of a training package for facilitators based on paraprofessional training needs); performance objectives (such as demonstration by trained paraprofessionals of understanding the characteristics of the special education student); and formative  evaluations of seven workshops.

        "description":"The Outdoor Activity Center (Atlanta, Georgia) provides enriched experiences in a natural environment for economically disadvantaged gifted primary grade students and has developed materials incorporating creative activities used at the Center to expand the elementary science curriculum of the Atlanta Public Schools. Fifty-eight gifted students went to the Center for planned creative onsite experiences related to environmental science instruction for 90-minute sessions once a week for 15 weeks. Teachers accompanied the students, observed the instruction presented to the students, and utilized learning units at their local school to followup instruction provided at the Center. Two other groups of gifted Ss in the first control group were given the learning units within their own  school with no Center experience. Project staff provided orientation to the teachers of student participants and to teachers from the control schools. The Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT) were used as pre-post test measures. After completion of all 15 sessions, project teachers and staff used materials and experiences to write and compile model science units. Each curriculum unit contained student objectives (cognitive and affective), thought processes/skills to be developed, instructional materials needed, content, questions to be considered by students, activities and strategies, and evaluation procedures. Among findings were that the students who received the special, environmental education instruction within their home school (control 1) demonstrated better performance than  either the students who attended the Center for the instruction or those who did not participate in the project (control 2). Included is a copy of \"A Challenge in Science,\" an elementary science curriculum guide with units covering such topics as food stuff, time, physical matters, classification, the earth in regions, planets on the move, and weather. Appended materials include guidelines for keeping a journal, a table on measuring wind velocity, things to look for in identifying birds, a guide of things to make from old milk cartons, and instructions for decorating bottles.

        "description":"The document consists of a program manager's manual for the Parent Infant Program (PIP), an early intervention program designed to foster effective parenting of infants with developmental disabilities and delays. Section 1 provides a program overview. Three program goals are: to build parental confidence as primary teachers/facilitators of their infant's development; to foster effective interactions between parent and infant which promote mutual feelings of competence and enjoyment; and to provide information, support, and assistance to parents in dealing with needs associated with having a developmentally delayed infant. An individualized developmental program geared toward the needs of the infant and the family is developed, implemented, and monitored by program staff. The  model involves an initial assessment, program planning, ongoing home programing and monitoring, and periodic review and evaluation phases. Section 2 focuses on the role of the team in the PIP model. The multidisciplinary team provides the vehicle through which program managers can enhance or develop their skills in the areas of infant programing and working with parents. A third section describes the purpose and procedures for initial assessment in the areas of gross motor, fine motor, cognitive development, language development, and social development. Section 4 presents the second phase of the program--program planning--which involves developing a treatment program by synthesizing and integrating information obtained during the initial assessment, obtaining parental priorities and  concerns for their infant's programing, developing an individualized program plan, and summarizing initial assessment results and plans in a report. A fifth section on ongoing home activities covers guidelines for writing home activities, considerations in developing a home program, and resources used in development. A final section addresses the purpose and procedures for periodic review and evaluation. Among appendixes are self evaluation questions for the professional working with parents, a report on child development, and an annotated bibliography. (SW)",

Handicaps for which help is available through current federal funds are listed and include deaf, deaf/blind, mentally retarded, hard of hearing, multihandicapped, orthopedically impaired, other health impaired, seriously emotionally disturbed, specific learning disabled, speech  impaired, and visually handicapped. It is reported that services paid for by the federal government are delivered to the public through center based, home based, combination home and center based, and hospital based methods. Characteristics of successful programs are identified and include individualized education programs, parent involvement, ongoing training for staff and parents, a sound theoretical base, clearly stated philosophy and goals, and identification and intervention activities that occur as early as possible.

Three philosophical positions regarding the culturally different are separatism (which maintains that children should be separated from one another on the basis of their ethnic gackground), the melting pot approach (which states that culture traits from distinct cultural groups should be allowed to merge), and cultural pluralism (which proposes that values, standards, and worth of all cultures must be allowed to exist within one society). Cultural pluralism is probably the most compatible with the national trend toward individualized programs for special preschoolers. Ten special  needs in programs for culturally diverse children include the need to acknowledge whites from low socioeconomic backgrounds as culturally different, the need to expand program content to reflect the cultural variety of the population, and the need to involve parents in educating their children. In working with special preschoolers from minority backgrounds, it is important to keep in mind the fact that curriculums in special education have been systems of highly varied learning experiences with clearly articulated goals and objectives with the purpose of helping each child function better in the environment. Among the criteria for selecting curriculums are relevancy of goals, comprehensiveness, provisions for individualized and group instruction, remedial focus, validity and reliability,  appropriateness, functional purpose, and the child's home, community and language. In modifying curriculums for culturally different children, different materials and languages, styles, and expectations need to be explored.

The document is divided into two major sections. Section 1 (three chapters) contains the overview, theoretical base, and a framework for planning; Section 2 contains a series of detailed abstracts from eight selected HCEEP (Handicapped Children's Early Childhood Education Program) demonstration, outreach, and state planning projects. &quot;A General Overview&quot; by J.

Six phases for putting coordination into practice are outlined, and elements crucial for successful coordination activities are pointed out. Chapter 2, &quot;Interagency Coordination for Young Handicapped Children&quot; by J. Elder, discusses the advantages for coordination, examines its essential characteristics, describes roadblocks, considers some critical factors for coordination, and offers ideas for programs serving young handicapped children and their families. The third chapter (&quot;A Framework for Planning&quot; by M. Woodard, et al.) explores a general planning framework in three phases--preplanning, plan development, and plan implementation.  Section 2 describes the following eight programs: Project SCOOTER for Hearing Impaired Children; Massachusetts State Implementation Grant; Family, Infant and Toddler Project; Williamsburg Area Child Development Resources, Inc.; Maine State Implementation Grant; Connecticut State Implementation Grant; Infant Stimulation/Mother Training Program; and Regional Demonstration Program for Preschool Handicapped Children.

Section 1 considers theoretical bases of parenting and normal development; biological, psychological, and social factors in the genesis of handicaps; parent adaptation of disability; the role of parents toward the disabled child; and children in families with disabled parents. A second section addresses the psychological trauma experienced by parents when informed of their child's disability, repercussions of the disability on the lives of mothers and the couple, the clinical importance of grandparents in family dynamics around the disabled child, siblings of the disabled child, and  repercussions to the family in view of the sociocultural context. A final section focuses on parental guidance in outpatient clinics and in the home environment, the relationship between parents and professionals (both in terms of conflict and mutual help), family therapy and parents' groups, the role of parents' organizations, and fields of future research. Noted among findings are that there is a need for a \"third person\" as mediator in order to fight isolation of families with handicapped children. Other findings are that social class does not influence psychological adaptation to disability but does play a role in social adaptation, and that parents' associations seem to perform a regulatory role in the system of help to disabled persons.

        "description":"The Rehabilitation Engineering Center (Palo Alto, California) has developed a wide range of patient services which provide assistance to the disabled community in northern California and various research activities which have had impact on the disabled population nationally. The Center has three philosophical goals: to assist each child toward as normal growth and development as possible, to assist each adolescent to bridge the transition between childhood and adulthood, and to assist each adult to develop a life style which maximizes his/her potential and quality of life. Patient service activities involve the areas of orthotics (plastic, vacuum formed, custom systems); seating and mobility; prosthetics; communicaton and controls; prevention of tissue trauma; and special  projects (such as occupational and physical therapy). Other reseach activities focus on seating systems for body support and prevention of tissue trauma, versatile portable speech prosthesis, and control and display design principles. NIHR (National Institute for Handicapped Research) research activities are divided into five categories: research and development activities, clinical evaluation activities, interaction with industry activities, education and training activities, and dissemination of information and research utilization activities. Activities are usually described in terms of the objective, impact, personnel involved, progress to date, dissemination of information, and utilization of the research. Appendixes contain assessment forms for evaluation of clients' control  abilities, an assessment form for evaluation of clients' need for and use of rehabilitation engineering services, a report on a followup study on communication aids, a description of the rehabilitation engineering clinical internship, a list of inservice programs, a table of miscellaneous projects, and a mobility device evaluation form.

Objectives of the project were: to identify competencies needed by paraprofessionals in working with young, handicapped children; to identify the needs of employed paraprofessionals; and to develop and conduct field based inservice training for paraprofessionals from day care settings, Head Start settings, public and private special education classroom settings, and public and private regular classroom settings. The need for training paraprofessionals was delineated in relation to state needs; regional/national needs; and other needs, such as the need to train day care workers and preschool  teachers. Multiple teaching strategies such as role play, filmstrips, and simulation were used throughout training. The project design contained the following components: a completed description of competency aeas, work sessions focusing on a single topic area which lasted approximately 3 hours each, field based training, evaluation of training sessions, and dissemination activities. Issues or problems having an impact on the APT project were scheduling, credentialling, motivation, participation, and evaluation.

Previous research revealed that many countries in Europe appeared to be far ahead of the United States in the development of organizations of the disabled. Forty-four leaders of handicapped organizations in the United Kingdom and Sweden were identified and interviewed. Interview notes were made during discussions and, while each interview was open ended, care was taken to cover several points, including history of the organization, the individual's role in it, goals, problems, tactics utilized, assessment of success, factors contributing to success, degree of formal and  informal representation in government agencies and societal institutions that impact the lives of disabled persons, leadership and its development, philosophy of disablement, and advice for the United States. Among the 17 conclusions reached were the following: (1) organizations involving disabled persons tend to evolve, beginning with control by able-bodied individuals in voluntary groups for the disabled and concluding in groups of the disabled under their own control; (2) early aspirations of disabled groups tend to focus on urgent practical problems such as mobility, access, housing, income, and employment but later move into cultural and societal participative goals; (3) the degree of success in evolution of disabled groups depends upon availability of resources to supply group  maintenance needs and employ salaried staff; and (4) several problems typically manifest themselves including the need for strong, realistic leadership; overcoming apathy; avoiding personality conflicts and explorations; avoiding self defeating, short term goals; and using power gained in a mature, responsible nature.

        "description":"The study investigated the effect of instruction on basic number fact mastery of 123 learning disabled (LD) students, 8 to 13 years old. Mastery of basic addition, subtraction, and multiplication facts was seen as an important component of overall arithmetic competence and represents a particular area of performance deficit among LD students. The intervention study compared two treatment approaches containing parallel program features, but with differences in the sequential clusters of facts taught. Instruction on each cluster of facts involved four phases: (1) presentation of activities (during group lessons the number facts in the cluster were explored using concrete materials and/or graphic representations); (2) developmental activities (active practice of fact clusters  emphasized accuracy without regard to speed with teachers supervising pairs or small groups of students playing one or more games, performing oral or blackboard reviews, or individuals working on activity sheets); (3) mastery activities (practice of fact clusters emphasizing rapid, automatic responses); and (4) criterion testing (students had to meet a preestablished criterion before moving from one cluster of facts to another). Basic Fact Sequence 1 followed traditional grouping and sequencing, while Basic Fact Sequence 2 grouped and ordered related facts according to &quot;thinking&quot; strategies. Results of pre-, post-, and retention tests, each 3-minute written power tests of basic fact proficiency were analyzed. Significant gains were made on post-tests; these gains were maintained during a  6-week uninstructed period. No effect was found for Basic Fact Sequences, leading to the conclusion that either sequence is effective in promoting mastery of basic facts under the instructional conditions utilized.

Davis which suggests the following methods and techniques: (1) reinforce coping techniques the students have already developed; (2) provide help with reading tasks through summaries of vocabulary; (3) allow taping of classes (to overcome notetaking problems); (4) allow oral compositions and tests; and (4) permit aid of a reader (as a visually impaired student might use). Cited is literature which categorizes learning disability into three areas (general, visual, and auditory) and which suggests classroom methods for circumventing these problems such as encouraging use of the typewriter. Considered are three areas of intervention (identification, individualized  education, and remediation of associated disorders) needed by LD adults, according to S. Cox. The more theoretical study, by R. Mosby, suggests a de-emphasis of remediation skills and use of whatever instructional strategy works to give the student needed life skills. Cited is research which points out the need to modify overall test procedures for LD students, such as limiting the number of alternative responses. Also noted is case study research (conducted by C. Miller) which provides a description of writing related problems to be expected in working with college LD students, and other case study research which provides insight into stress experiences of adults with severe reading deficiencies. Literature on various programs, including the Learning Opportunities Center (Brooklyn, New  York), is also reviewed. It is concluded that the absence of extensive literature dealing with the college English teacher and the LD student may prove that awareness of learning disabilities, especially in higher education, is a recent phenomenon.

The ultimate goal of the project is the assimilation and overt application of a variety of psychoeducational techniques and curricular approaches, which would provide a supportive learning environment for the exceptional child. &quot;Assessing the Impact of an Intensive Inservice Training Model on Regular Teachers and Mainstreamed Students&quot; is a research report on the effectiveness of Project RETAP in terms of affective and cognitive student outcomes and attitudinal and behavioral teacher outcomes. Findings from data on 27  kindergarten through sixth grade regular classroom teachers show that teachers receiving comprehensive training were able to bring about positive growth for mainstreamed students while simultaneously accomplishing similar gains for all their students. Seventy competencies important for teaching special needs students are identified in &quot;Identifying Effective Teaching Behaviors for Mainstreaming.&quot; The instruments used to obtain the 70 variables are explained and samples are offered in &quot;Instrumentation for Data Collection.&quot; It is noted that from classroom observation instruments, teacher daily record instruments, teacher self report instruments, and interview instruments, variables were identified and conceptualized within a framework of seven categories: classroom management, questioning  style, academic learning time, individualization, teaching style, classroom climate, and attitudinal variables. Results of two more studies are reported in &quot;A Comparison of Academic Learning Time (ALT) for Mainstreamed, Low, Average, and High Ability Students&quot; and &quot;Identifying Teachers Effective with Special Needs Students in the Regular Classroom Setting.&quot; Another document contains &quot;Descriptive Tables for Specified Teaching Behaviors of Selected Effective Teachers.&quot; Two additional research reports are included which are entitled &quot;Data Summary for the Identified Effective Teaching Behaviors for Mainstreaming&quot; and &quot;Effective Teaching Behaviors for Mainstreaming--A Descriptive Teacher Profile.&quot; A final performance report is offered for the validation phase of Project RETAP. Tables with  statistical data are given. (SW)",

        "description":"The study investigated social processes and sex differences that might inhibit or enhance the development of interest, self confidence, and competence in the study of mathematics and in the pursuit of careers which require advanced mathematical knowledge and skill among 120 seventh graders, all identified as having superior mathematical ability by the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth at Johns Hopkins University. A student questionnaire and a parent questionnaire were developed. The Vocational Preference Inventory was administered to students. Questions investigated covered the following areas: characteristics related to family background and aptitude, attitudinal characteristics, support from significant others, home learning, interrelationships between variables, and  teacher characteristics. Ss were divided into five groups: A-1 consisted of girls considered to be highly motivated on the basis of their having accelerated their study of mathematics; A-2 included girls who were considered to be not as highly motivated as A-1; B-1 was a sample of boys considered to be highly motivated; B-2 was a sample of boys considered to be not highly motivated; and C was a sample of girls who appeared to have low interest in mathematics and high interest in the humanities. Among findings were the following: no significant differences were found among the five groups on measures of socioeconomic and family constellation variables; A-1 girls had lower levels of self confidence in mathematics than B-1 boys; mothers of boys noticed ability in their sons at a much earlier  age than mothers of girls; and most parents of girls felt careers would need to be interrupted for child bearing purposes. Although all the girls were extremely talented in mathematics, they had not been viewed as unusually gifted or unique by the teachers. (SW)",

        "description":"The implementation of Alaska's bilingual-bicultural education policy in the Lower Kuskokwim School District, which serves a predominantly Eskimo population, was investigated. The research objectives were to describe policy implementation, analyze problems with implementation, and explain why the local programs diverged from the intent of state policy. Participants' views of the implementation process were determined through interviews, observation, and document analysis. The interviews were conducted among school administrators, bilingual teachers, school personnel, school board members, high school students, and parents. Based on examination of 10 local programs, state policy appears to have fostered 3 basic approaches to bilingual program development: transitional enrichment,  enrichment maintenance, and enrichment restoration. Each approach suffers from four major implementation problems: vague goals, lack of state personnel to monitor enforcement, inadequately trained personnel, and lack of guidelines for evaluating program outcomes. Broad policy guidelines such as those of Alaska provide flexibility for local implementers to develop programs according to local needs. Thus, variations among local programs occur which may be inconsistent with federal policy goals. Alaska bilingual education regulations and a bibliography are appended. (Author/RW)",

        "description":"The role of such affective variables as integrative motivation in successful adult second language learning is explored. It is argued that the myth of the melting pot is based on commitment to integration, and that integrative motivation is thus viewed as desirable in minority group members. Studies of affective variables in second language learning have proposed models that state that successful learners of English must have positive attitudes toward English speakers. These models are based on belief in the superiority of the integrative motive over an instrumental motive. The acculturation model for second language acquisition and seven studies linking attitudes to language learning are reviewed. These studies assume a casual link between acculturation and language learning  success. In order to test this assumption, a language attitude questionnaire was administered to 84 foreign students at a U.S. university who were considered successful English learners, and in-depth interviews were conducted with nine of the students. Little evidence of an integrative orientation was found among these successful English learners. In conclusion, English as a second language teachers should recognize that their students may not have an integrative orientation toward American culture. (RW)",
