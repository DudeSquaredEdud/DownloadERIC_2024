The list does not attempt to be comprehensive, and is intended as an aid and reference guide to teachers and students to broaden their background of information about Negro Americans. Books listed range from fiction suitable for seventh-graders to those books dealing with basic problems in American society of interest to college-bound senior high school students. For each of the approximately 330 titles listed, the following information is provided: author, title, publisher, copyright date, cost, a brief annotation, and a rating as to whether the item in question is suitable for high school students, junior  high school students, or for both. A directory of the publishers of the items listed is also provided separately. (RJ)",

About 75 percent of the children were black, 20 percent white and 5 percent Puerto Rican. Remedial instruction was offered in reading and mathematics. Average class size was six pupils; these small groups allowed for better diagnosis of needs and individualized instruction. Enrichment teachers taught classes in art, music, industrial arts, and physical education.

The curriculum, based on skills and concepts required for success in elementary school, included language arts, reading readiness, mathematical concepts, science, and social studies. Small instructional groups of five pupils allowed the teacher to correct or reinforce verbal responses immediately. Directed play periods stressed visual-motor activities such as puzzles, blocks, clay, nesting and stacking toys, and pounding sets. Drawn from economically depressed neighborhoods, two-thirds of the pupils were black and the remainder Caucasian. The results of six standardized tests administered at the end of the first  grade showed that project pupils performed better than comparable pupils who had attended a traditional preschool. The program pupils, furthermore, scored well above grade level on the California Achievement Tests in reading, language, and arithmetic.

The pupils in both experimental and control groups were from a low income black neighborhood. The program was organized around a carefully planned sequence of language and mathematical games and game-like activities; special teaching methods guaranteed success to each child. Through a sequence of planned experiences, the curriculum allowed children to move from motor manipulation to the building of perceptual imagery to symbolic experiences through the medium of interesting and challenging games and game-like activities. Teachers and teacher aides were trained in an intensive in-service training program to become child-oriented rather than  content-oriented. Flexibility in grouping and parent participation were important factors. Sequence charts for language and mathematical games along with related activities are included.

There is no indication reported of these institutions admitting large numbers of black atypical students. In the education of the black atypical student institutions appear to be taking a conservative approach, despite the data that has tended to indicate that the dropout rate has generally been higher for regular students than for atypical students. Institutions of higher education have several options for admission policies. An institution can justify its right to select students on any criteria thought acceptable by its trustees, faculty, and  administration without regard to race, religion, creed, or nationality. The institution can also choose to use a random method of selecting students. Or, the institution may choose selectively to extend its educational offerings to varying students under varying criteria. Somewhere within these three options the various institutions are choosing their course. But their response to the black atypical student is still in doubt. It is the conclusion of this paper that the response itself can only be made within a consideration of what it is that a particular institution is and would be. (RJ)",

        "description":"The major thrust of this program was the establishment of Quality Incentive Grants for urban school districts with a high concentration of disadvantaged youth qualifying under the provisions of ESEA Title I. Two new units, the Office of Urban Education and the Bureau of Urban Programs Evaluation, were established within the State Department of Education to supervise the monitoring of project operation and the evaluation of project effectiveness. In the 1968-69 fiscal year, despite the difficulties encountered relating to lateness of funding allocations, problems centered around the membership of the Community Advisory Boards, and the teacher strike in the case of New York City, the Quality Incentive Projects administered by Central Board authorities were successfully implemented.  Some of the recommendations suggested are: (1) that commitments for funding should be made at least a year in advance of the anticipated initiation of project operations; (2) that in New York City, procedures should be established to provide adequate notice of fund allocation to decentralized district projects; (3) that the community advisory board role should be more carefully delineated; and, (4) that additional funds be allocated to the State Education Department for inservice training of Urban Education Project planning personnel. Tables appended provide statistical data for the school districts throughout the State. (RJ)",

        "description":"The purposes of this study were to determine which dialect features associated with particular classes and ethnic groups are unacceptable by the dominant culture in an urban community (Fort Wayne, Indiana) and to suggest implications of the findings for teaching of English language arts and skills. Phonological and inflectional features in the speech of representative informants from three ethnic groups (Anglo, Black, and Latin American) and four social classes (upper middle class, lower middle class, working class, and lower class) were tape-recorded and analyzed. The second phase of the study identified the dialect features which function as social markers and which tend to limit the life possibilities of speakers who use them. The overall pattern of subjective responses  indicated an awareness by all three ethnic groups of the value of standard forms. The study, it is held, basically showed that individuals who have not mastered certain standard pronunciation and grammatical conventions may remain seriously handicapped in their chances for socioeconomic and cultural advancement. Therefore, it is suggested that in the education of teachers for the disadvantaged greater emphasis should be given to nature of usage and study of social dialects, problems of motivating students to learn a second dialect, and the techniques of developing two dialectal skills.

Described principally are: the productive activities of counselors staffing these programs and the supervisory rationale stated. A counseling program designed to meet the needs of the urban poor, it is held, must provide a way for people to make sense of their total experiences; a logical and economical way to do this is to assume responsibility for coordinating activities and providing many needed services. The use of an organization which is flexible as to size of groups as needed is contended as being able to provide more service and more intensive service than is now available; counselors assuming these  responsibilities will need opportunities of examining and working with alternative ideas and solutions. A comprehensive program of staff development including counselor-supervisor meetings, extensive use of tapes, group conferences, monthly regional conferences, annual conferences, and a thirty-hour inservice training course is suggested in the counselor-supervisor helping relationship. The goal of developing a counseling organization by the supervisor integrated and responsive to its clients is held to be imperative of final achievement in facing the challenge of serving the poor.

Its primary purpose is to determine how the rules and conditions of apprenticeship have been and are likely to be influenced by rapid technical development and how training has been adapted to changing conditions of work. The basic patterns of the institutions of apprenticeship in these countries are all highly traditional in their general structure. Some of the laws and regulations which today govern the relationship between master and apprentice date back to the second half of the 19th century. However, some of the  changes introduced may have been revolutionary in the country concerned. The adoption of day-time related instruction in Denmark, the extension of apprenticeship to the industrial and commercial fields in the Netherlands, the new powers given to public authorities and the introduction of a levy system in the United Kingdom have all constituted profound changes in the national pattern of training.

Four null hypotheses were tested: (1) The hypothesis that senstivity training has no effect on the quality of nursing care was rejected by three of four comparisons which showed statistically significant results, (2) The hypothesis that the interpersonal relations of students with patients, teachers, and peers are not affected by sensitivity training was rejected on seven comparisons which showed statistically significant results, (3) The hypothesis  that grades attained by students in nursing courses are not influenced by sensitivity training was accepted, (4) The hypothesis that the attrition rate of students in the first year of their associate degree program in nursing education is not affected by sensitivity training was accepted although the trend was in favor of the experimental group in all comparisons.

In May 1969, there were 79,621,000 persons in the labor force and the unemployment rate was 3.2 percent. Adult men recorded the lowest unemployment with 2.0 percent, while young workers 16-19 had the highest with 10.8 percent. In 1968 unemployment was unevenly distributed with the North Central Area having a rate of 3.0 percent and the West a rate of 4.9 percent. The composition of the labor force has changed drastically in  the last few years. In March 1967, there were 30 million secondary wage earners who supplemented incomes of primary family wage earners. In addition there has been a long term trend toward employment stability and expansion in services and government. These factors, along with the wide acceptance of unemployment insurance and supplemental unemployment benefits, have created more stability in the labor force. (BC)",

Data were obtained by questionnaire from 2,012 seniors enrolled in 18 high schools during the second semester of the school year, 1963-1964. The unrealistic occupational aspirations of many students are evidenced by the following: (1) Of 188 possible occupational categories, 66.2 percent of the senior selected professional and managerial occupations, although parental employment in professional and managerial occupations was low: 15 percent for fathers; 12.1 percent for mothers, (2) Although only 20 percent of all students on a national basis go to college, 72.5 percent of the respondents planned to  continue their formal education, and (3) Of the 20 reasons students gave for the above choices, 66.7 percent were influenced by admiration for successful people in the occupation.

In Egypt, Greece, Rome, Europe, and finally in the United States apprenticeships became an accepted practice. In the United States in the 1700's poor boys 14 years or younger were often indentured to masters who agreed to teach them a trade. They were usually bound to their masters until they were 21 years old, and received training in crafts such as leather work and carpentry. After the time of the industrial revolution, domestic apprenticeships disappeared and wages were paid to employers in growing industries such as iron foundries, ship building, and printing shops. Laws passed in the 1920's and 30's regulate apprenticeships. Today the apprentice is part of a production  force, trains on the job and in a classroom, and is paid wages. Apprenticeship is and will continue to be one of the best ways of training skilled craftsmen. Various programs have been set up to aid the disadvantaged in obtaining apprentice training, including information centers, preparatory courses, and prejob programs. (BC)",

        "description":"This preliminary report examines eight vocational and technical education programs for disadvantaged youth both in the state of Massachusetts and in other states. After reviewing the literature, the staff selected schools to be sampled in this present exploratory survey and developed and evaluated a comprehensive data form. The study showed that special programs for the disadvantaged in vocational education are seriously limited in that experimental design, efficient data collection, and evaluation procedures are lacking. The national trend is a movement away from specialized vocational-technical schools to comprehensive high school programs which include vocational training in the curriculum. Most of the innovative techniques developed for vocational education are found outside  the parameters of the public schools in special programs organized for dropouts. One of the key factors to program success is the selection of a dynamic administrator. Two additional phases of the program are planned for the future to provide a formal and continuous evaluation of experimental programs. (BC)",

The program was organized to: (1) provide in-depth courses in technical areas, (2) provide short-term intensive field experiences, (3) extend learning processes, (4) provide familiarity with sociological factors, (5) develop course materials, (6) evaluate the adequacy and quality of preparation, (7) experiment with and field test innovative methods, and (8) provide full-time summer industrial experience. The group of 24 fellows was divided into two equal groups, one to study industrial materials and processes, while the other group concentrated on  energy and propulsion systems. Evaluation instruments at the end of each term indicated a strongly positive reaction from faculty and participants. A follow-up evaluation will place special emphasis on their curriculum development, increased leadership activities within the school and state, and any change in position. (GR)",

Part I examines significant changes which have occurred in enrollments, teacher supply, pupil retention and achievement, and financial support. In 1967, education was the primary occupation of 60 million Americans. About 57 million of these were students and 3 million were teachers, principals, supervisors, and superintendents. Only 2.4 percent of the persons 14 years of age or older were illiterate in 1960 compared to 3.3 percent in 1950 and 11.3 percent in 1900. In the 1965-66 school year, 53 percent of the revenues came from local sources, 39 percent from State governments, and 8 percent from the Federal Government. Part II focuses on programs and changes in vocational and  technical education. Since the passage of the first vocational education act in 1918, enrollment in vocational education programs has risen from 164,200 to 7,800,000 in 1968. Although some vocational education is provided in secondary schools, the number of area vocational schools has increased rapidly. In 1967, there were 1,100 area schools and 1,000 more are expected to be constructed during the next 10 years. (BC)",

The study was further limited to students in vocational agriculture, trades and industry, and distributive education. Some major conclusions and recommendations were: (1) Within limits, students going to work or to vocational-technical schools can be identified, (2) There is a trend in secondary schools to provide more vocational orientation classes and fewer classes for job entry, (3) There is little that can be done in small schools to provide vocational programs in depth to meet the needs of their students, (4) There is a need to redirect almost half of the students who say they plan to go to college and  enter a profession into the occupations that require less than a college degree, (5) Parental influence is hard to measure, (6) There needs to be further study of ways and means to determine which students can profit most from vocational classes, and (7) There must be a greater emphasis on providing more adequate postsecondary programs to provide depth of training necessary for job entry.

Three variables--social problem, social task, and service system--determine the nature of a field of social work practice. Teaching Unit I, The Problem in Social Functioning, focuses on the social problem variable, while Teaching Unit II, The Role of the Person to be Served, and Teaching Unit III, Treatment Decision-Making, focus on aspects of the service system variable. Each teaching unit contains an introduction detailing the concepts illustrated in that unit and the propositions that relate those concepts, followed by an annotation of selected references and several case studies illustrating the concepts.  Appended are a report and summary of the Arrowhead Conference, which brought together 25 social work educators to review provisional versions of the three teaching units. (SB)",

The relevant characteristics are: contradictory attitudes toward self; higher incidence of utilitarian or materialistic attitudes than in more privileged groups; low level of aspiration or motivation in relation to academics as well as to some social norms; differences in learning styles, modes of perception, perceptual habits, and temperamental traits; and, hypermobility, family instability, distorted model relationships, economic insufficiency, housing  inadequacy, repeated subjugation to discriminatory treatment, and similar socio-cultural patterns in the life of these children. The areas of activity considered important for an effective guidance program are: appraisal, a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis of individual functioning and environment; prescription, the planning and design of appropriate learning experiences; support, for development and learning; orientation and interpretation; socialization and politicalization; pupil advocacy, the protection of the best interests of the pupil; and, counseling relative to role choice and implementation.

The research reviewed is grouped according to the standard categories used by the ERIC Science and Mathematics Education Information Analysis Center: Instructional procedures, teacher education, equipment and facilities, the curriculum, status of science programs, evaluation, and learning. Altogether 120 studies were reviewed. Investigations comparing the relative merits of two or more teaching methods were the most common studies on instructional procedures. Several studies on the characteristics of children and the relationship of these  characteristics to science teaching were reviewed. Some of the other studies reviewed related to: various practices in the preparation of teachers, teachers' understandings of subject matter, survey of science programs, and patterns of intellectual growth, concept formation, and cognitive styles.

        "description":"This paper examines the conflicts between and the inequities inherent in practically all present day social systems and suggests strategies for building a socially supportive environment. The study focuses on the practical implications of the nature-nurture controversy and contends that greater attention must be given to extrinsic factors in development and learning. Areas of ecological balance or personal-politico-social homeostasis and the problems involved therein are treated. Emphasis is laid on the regression noted in the implementation of programs to satisfy basic human rights and needs. In the context of the present state of political development in this country, abandonment of parliamentary democracy and movement toward realization of a truly pluralistic society is  strongly advocated. In the attainment of the latter objective, a rededication to the purposes and goals of education is suggested, stressing on assisting the student in his development, refining that development, and preparing him to live a satisfying life; basic changes in the concept of the school's physical structure by decentralization into homes, farms, store fronts, etc. and by creating educational parks, shifts in staff to attune to the concept of individualization, and the building up of basic skills and self concept toward achieving affective, social cognitive, and political competence are recommended for reaching these educational goals.

A company will need to tap community resources such as state employment services, Office of Economic Opportunity agencies, the Urban League, and vocational rehabilitation agencies.

Private firms, which can be located with help of local Chamber of Commerce or National Association of Businessmen, specialize in training the hard-core; they also do the recruiting.

Some of the major findings were: (1) high task performance leaders were more likely to be females, to be teachers, housewives, laborers, or professionals; (2) leaders with more leadership experience and training were more likely to be in the high task performance groups than leaders with little or no leadership experience or leadership training;  (3) leaders with more training more often felt qualified to perform more tasks; (4) how often extension agents had given leaders information did not significantly affect the percentage of high task performance leaders per agent. Recommendations stressed further studies on the information provided to leaders and on teaching methods used. (The document includes 23 references.) (LY)",

        "description":"Volume 1 of a final report in three volumes, this is an overall narrative account of a correctional staff training project in Illinois. The rationale of the project, methods and activities involved, findings, and evaluations are summarized and synthesized. Initial objectives were to survey training practices and needs; determine resources available for present and future staff training; design programs of training in terms of individual and agency needs; and stimulate conditions conducive to correctional staff training. A literature review, a questionnaire survey of correctional personnel, and solicitation of information from resource persons and agencies, were among the procedures used. Reports on relevant topics were distributed to those involved in or concerned with Illinois  corrections. Based on findings, a much stronger state level commitment to correctional staff training was urged. Recommendations were also made on general planning and administration, and concerning the six penal institutions, the Illinois Youth Commission, and various other state and local correctional personnel. Finally, objectives and prospects for the immediate future were discussed. (See also AC 006 761 and AC 006 762. (LY)",

The subject was the assessment of needs and evaluation of results. The purpose was to compare, at a European level, the methods already developed in these two fields, pool experience, and promote coordination between educational authorities and radio and television experts. Many kinds of research can be useful to the assessment of needs, but special stress should be put on the study of society, culture, and personality in one system of interdependent relations, functions, and values. Research into evaluation of radio and television programs must have as its  aim to make sure that the needs met have been correctly assessed, that the means employed for meeting needs are the best, that targets have been reached, and that the operation is warranted in terms of cost-effectiveness. There is need for a pilot project, at national and international levels, on evaluation of the results of a series of experimental educational television programs. (EB)",

Training is  also provided by corporative bodies and by firms, either through their own facilities or through those of professional or private activities.

A principal consideration is the possibility of changing the allocation of resources to education to provide greater support for adult education.

Most of the present labor force had only six or seven years of old-fashioned primary education, but 80%-85% of the younger generation receive an education lasting 11 or 12 years. A system of &quot;recurrent education&quot; -- education that could occur at periodic intervals after the individual has  completed his compulsory intermediate schooling and begun work -- is suggested as a possible addition to the youth-oriented educational system.

The occupational period will be characterized by leisure time, some of which will have to be devoted to occupational adjustment and to keeping abreast of knowledge. Retirement at 65 will be a thing of the past. The structure, objectives, and methods of the traditional school will be wholly changed; it will give way to a new system which will provide for study levels independent of pupils' age.

The formal educational system would have four functions: occupational training; providing basic education; teaching how to take advantage of out-of-school possibilities; and motivating the future adult to continue to educate himself. Reforms would be required: time must be allowed for experience to be extended through visits or work; choice of subjects will have to be diversified; and teaching must be linked to the learner's experiences. Information and guidance will have a capital role to play. This educational transformation would require a year of study, several years of experimentation, and a stage of  systematization which will allow for constant critical appraisal. (NL)",

        "author":["Moelono, M."],
        "description":"The modern view suggests language be approached through speech. It is therefore customary that the first stages of language learning are spent on oral drills in order to make the sound system and the basic structures automatic habits. In countries where classes are big and the time spent on foreign language learning is limited, spending too long a time on oral drills is not very effective. The non-English environment does not offer a chance of any repetition of classroom drills. The case illustrated in this paper is taken from Indonesian schools where English teaching is begun in high school and the students are bilingual in the sense that they speak their vernaculars and the national language with great ease. Oral drills in the classroom have to be kept to the minimum. Since the  students can already read and write well and books are the privilege of only the very few, reading is proposed to be given early. Therefore, proposals have arisen to modify the Oral Approach, especially because the ultimate aim of the average student is reading ability and not the spoken language. This report considers the following points: (1) the ultimate aims of teaching English in Indonesian schools, (2) the Oral Approach, and (3) proposals for supplementary materials and future course design.

        "description":"Experiments in language teaching have indicated that, especially in the case of teaching English as a foreign language, no pronunciation of English sounds natural unless the intonation (prosodic features) is fairly acceptable. Even with satisfactory consonants and vowels, a phrase with incorrect melody still sounds foreign. On the other hand, when brief phrases are given proper pitch pattern, large errors in consonants and vowels seem much less important. English is spoken with a stress-time rhythm; the everyday speech of Chinese tends to be a polysyllabic language which often combines two or more syllables. The rate of utterance of a succession of syllables, unlike that of English is syllable-timed, the length of each syllable remaining approximately the same. Therefore, in  teaching Chinese speakers to learn English, the shift from their tendency toward a syllable-timing rhythm to a stress-timing rhythm is very necessary. Consquently, syllable analysis in both languages must become a basic step in the learning process. This contrastive study of American English and Mandarin Chinese examines the syllable structure and prosodic features of both languages and relates this analysis to language teaching. (AMM)",

Its experimental program, to be ready for the 1970-71 school year, is intended to be a rigorous and carefully controlled comparison of three  approaches to educating the Spanish-speaking Mexican American children in Texas: (1) the traditional approach, in which the non-English speaking child is thrown in midstream to sink or swim; (2) the English as a second language approach, which makes concessions in the form and rate of teaching, but little or no use of the home language; and (3) the bilingual approach, in which 75 percent of the teaching, including readiness and reading, will be in Spanish, and 25 percent in English as a second language. All of the teachers will be Mexican American; those in the bilingual approach will be bilingual. (AMM)",

Since the \"Second Dialect\" student's everyday speech is further removed than other dialects from the language of public life, his reading problems may best be solved by classroom activities that focus his attention on features that characterize the kind of English customarily presented to the public eye. The teacher should ask to what extent the student has (1) grasped the relationship between speech and writing in English, (2) developed decoding  skills that enable him to recognize known words when he sees them, (3) adjusted to the many instances of mismatch between sounds and spelling, and (4) learned to compensate for the absence in print of aids to comprehension which are supplied by the voice in speech. Such questions, with answers in terms of classroom activities (illustrated briefly in this paper), deserve special attention when teachers help students read the language of public life. (AMM)",

The control group was taught with standard instructional procedures and no dialect study. The Business Speech students were \"generally pleased\" with taking dictation, role-playing, and discussion, but responded  negatively to the taped lessons once the novelty interval had passed. They did not relate their change in speech production to the language laboratory lessons despite the fact that they could hear differences and see their grammatical error count go down in business letters.

A number of investigators have described the acquisition and use of connectives by pupils and have indicated the importance of connectives in the development of abstract logical thinking. (Teachers often consider these words too simple to teach in reading classes except as sight words.) One of the author's concerns was the identification of connectives in three series of basal readers widely used in Canada at the upper elementary school level and an investigation of the understanding children have of them in reading. The amount of subordination produced by children eight to 12 years of age ranges from 10 to 30 percent of their total sentences with the amount increasing from  year to year, but their basal readers use connectives in about 37 percent of the sentences and the amount is almost constant from grade to grade. (Forty two connectives were identified.) As important as this task of description and explanation of oral and written English language patterning may be to educators, the investigations cannot be restricted to language matters only but must encompass the interaction between reading and the logical development of pupils.

ESL (English as a Second Language) and ESD(English as a Standard Dialect) teachers have practical reasons for attempting to broaden the linguistic repertoire of their students: they will have greater social acceptance and mobility, a broader range of options, and greater ability to compete on an equal footing with other members of the mainstream society. However, for many students, long-term goals and such middle class  rewards as academic grades, teacher approval or parental support seem ineffective motivation. While the author does not suggest that role playing and sociodrama should replace patterned language drill, he stresses that language, to be usable, must be spontaneous in a specific situational context, and vary in style from context to context. As natural behavior, role playing can provide the bridge between classroom drill and real life. Some Eskimo and Hawaiian classes are described. (AMM)",

Also, the deficit in language is usally associated with a relatively lower mean IQ for bilinguals when tested orally. Bilinguals have also been found weaker than monolinguals in problem arithmetic, but not in mechanical arithmetic. The author does not imply that bilingualism is necessarily connected with a language or intellectual deficit; he attempts, rather, to explain such deficits when they occur. In his studies of reading speed and problem solving in English and Irish, carried out with fifth and sixth grade children in Dublin and Dundalk primary schools, significant differences  between languages were found in the speed at which subjects interpreted the meaning of individual words and sentences, in the speed at which subjects could pronounce words, and in ability to anticipate the sequence of words in continous prose. The implications concerning these differences for bilingual students are discussed. (AMM)",

The ESL teacher should find out what the student's social and economic expectations are, and aim at equipping the student with the particular language skills he will need to reach them. The teacher should also distinguish between critical and non-critical phonological and syntactical errors. Critical errors should be stamped out as ruthlessly as circumstances permit, while non-critical errors may be handled with less severity. The teacher must also be constantly on guard against developing a type  of immunity to unintelligibility by association: he may be unaware that he is automatically interpreting the students' utterances.

A special listening test of  teachers' reactions was devised and carried out; results showed that degree of linguistic deviation is judged in terms of degree of education, which in turn is linked to two important aspects of the teacher aide relationship: cooperation participation and honesty dependability.

Because they differ in more ways than they agree, their teaching methodologies should not be the same. A modified ESOL approach is suggested for teaching Standard English to speakers of Black English: this teaching should be based on a cross-disciplinary approach that helps the learner overcome the barriers resulting from sources other than linguistic ones.  Major emphasis should be placed on the fact that the speaker of non-standard English is a native speaker of the language; rather than seeking competence in a language unknown to him, he wishes to acquire new ways of performing in the same language. Discussed is the State University of New York College at Cortland's graduate program in English sociolinguistics for prospective and experienced English teachers, which offers training in both English for speakers of other languages and Standard English for speakers of a non-standard dialect, with special attention on the latter.

The first curriculum is the least ambitious; the second, based on assumptions described by Skinner and by Macnamara concerning problems of interference and conceptual development, adopts the approach that the concepts developed in one language will more likely be transferred into the second language if the transfer is done as soon as  possible--within the same day, if possible. This approach is considered \"feasible and promising\" because the problem of transfer, or changing language, is believed to be almost as simple as changing clothes. The author discusses \"thinking\" in a language and defines it as having a direct rule-organized system between thought and a particular language--in contradistinction to having two indirect and distinct rule-governed systems between thought and another language (e.g., one's native language) and another between the native language and the language of instruction.

It exists in strong and weak versions, the strong one arising from evidence from the availability of some kind of metatheory of contrastive analysis and the weak from evidence from language interference. The strong version of the hypothesis is untenable and even the weak version creates difficulties for the linguist. Recent advances in linguistic theory have led some people to claim that the hypothesis is no longer useful in either the strong or the weak version. Such a claim is perhaps unwarranted, but a period of quiescence is probable for contrastive analysis itself. (Author/AMM)",

(2) At  what age does the use of one-word utterances begin? (3) What are the characteristics of the one-word stage? (4) When does the two-word stage begin, and what are its characteristics? (5) What are the features of subsequent grammatical development?

Three linguistics students trained in phonetic transcription listened to the same tapes of Midwestern kindergarteners pronouncing lists of common words. Transcription task varied with order of listening; the first transcriber listened for errors of articulation and transcribed them in broad phonetic notation. The other two transcribers served as checkers of the first transcription. Disagreements between the first transcriber and first checker varied as a function of task and judgment but not as a function of the individuals' linguistic backgrounds. The first transcriber adopted the stricter criterion of  correct pronunciation; the first checker appeared to expect an error in each word heard, with a consequently greater disagreement rate for sounds judged correct by the first transcriber when they appeared in words judged correct. The judgment of whether or not a sound in a word was mispronounced produced, at most, only half as many disagreements as the selection of a particular transcription for a sound thought to be in error by both transcribers. A correction procedure for transcription seems necessary for any study of articulation assessing the nature of the errors. (Author/AMM)",

Such a student, however, is still not ready for university-level reading. The major problem for the teacher is not teaching English words but English structures. Most foreign students are word-by-word readers, whereas good comprehension entails reading by structures. The syntax of unsimplified written English typically exhibits a degree of complexity much greater than that of the spoken language, and far too difficult for most students at this level. It seems unlikely that they can be taught to read by structures, using such mechanical means as reading against time through simplified sentences  physically divided into simplified constituents. The author describes a sample lesson designed to help the student work his own way up from the simple structures he already knows to new and more complex constructions. Real mastery of the more complex constructions, the author points out, can only follow from extensive reading; but the student who has worked his way through these lessons will \"have the one great advantage of knowing what he is doing.\" (AMM)",

He briefly discusses which drugs are used, by whom, and for what purposes. Drug abuse is seen as an old problem with contemporary manifestations which are spelled out. Two approaches for dealing with the problem are considered: (1) treatment of those already drug-dependent, and (2) prevention of others from becoming drug-dependent. The primary focus is on prevention, which is considered a total community problem because it necessarily involves youth and adults. The thrust of prevention should be: (1) making nonusers aware of the potential dangers of drug abuse, and (2)  enlisting them to help peer group members who are users. The author encourages classroom drug education, effective law enforcement, dissemination of information concerning the legal penalties for selling or possessing dangerous drugs, and community-wide coordinating committees for planning programs and avoiding duplication of services.

An interview was conducted to obtain information of each subject's criminality, occupation, hospitalization and drug history. The report contains an index which measures the degree of involvement in a drug subculture. The  study also indicated whether or not the patients were cured following a period of treatment.

Such a plan was effected when Jones Elementary School, with an 80% black enrollment, was closed and pupils were reassigned to six predominately white receiving schools. Non-transfer students from a racially mixed school and comparable socioeconomically and academically to the children from Jones School were used as a control group. The data included information on a variety of behavioral and attitudinal characteristics such as IQ, reading achievement, self-esteem and social acceptance. The findings indicated that these characteristics were initially poorest in the black transfer group and there was no evidence that established patterns were altered  appreciably by a year of desegregated schooling. Black children tended to be more similar to one another across the three populations than to white children within the same population and the black-white differences tended to favor the whites. When some interruption in this pattern was observed, positive changes occurred among the black transfer group and generally the greatest positive changes occurred in children with relatively low initial status on that characteristic. It is concluded that desegregation is no panacea for the ills of the minority group child. (Author/RSM)",

The program was based on Charm's theory of personal causation which postulates that \"Man's primary motivation is to be effective in causing changes in his environment.\" When a person feels he is in control of his fate he is positively motivated and confident and acts like an Origin. When his is controlled he is relatively powerless and acts like a Pawn. In order to facilitate the motivation of others teachers must treat pupils like Origins and not Pawns and thus activities were planned that would help children learn more about their motives and how to reach their goals. The trained pupils felt more like Origins than those in an untrained control group. The training helped improve  academic performance and helped pupils set more realistic goals and be more successful in reaching them. It appears that goal-setting strategy is related to academic performance because children who set unrealistically high goals tended to perform poorly in school work. It also appears that one's feeling of potency is related to goal-setting because more potent subjects tended to set realistic goals while powerless subjects tended to set very high goals. (RSM)",

The following conclusions were drawn: (1) the hypothesized results were obtained only when originality was used; (2) need for approval was found to be negatively related  to originality; (3) the relationship between anxiety and originality approached significance in the direction predicted; (4) the need to measure originality was identified and discussed; and (5) the possibility that anxiety might be curvilinearly related to divergent thinking was suggested.

Four main problems are discussed: (1) no single widely accepted theory of creativity exists; (2) there is a lack of understanding of the implications of the differences in assessment procedures; (3) researchers, on the one hand, view creativity as entirely a cognitive process or, on the other hand, entirely as a complex set of personality traits; and (4) some difficulties of assessing creative problem solving relate to the heterogeniety of the tasks that have been employed. Also listed are a number of practical problems, such as: (1) how do we know that what we consider creative tasks are creative? and (2) maybe our most unusual tasks are boring, unexciting and trivial for the most imaginative examinee.

        "description":"The study focuses on the possibility that the tendency of academic underachievers to respond in terms of all inclusive language is indicative of their incapacity to discriminate the uniquely meaningful aspects of their environment. The authors hypothesize that academic achievers would differ significantly from academic underachievers in their capacity to discriminate between verbal stimuli of differing levels of meaningfulness. Also predicted was that such a difference would depend on how the verbal differentiations were arranged and which semantic dimensions were used to measure the discrimination. Subjects consisted of 50 college students divided into two groups matched on sex, class year, and predicted grade point average. The two groups differed significantly in current grade  point averages. The subjects were exposed to high and low stimulus words in various treatment conditions so that 27 scores were obtained from each subject. When presented with verbal stimuli of differing levels of meaningfulness, academic achievers discriminated much more finely than did the academic underachievers. The hypothesized tendency was established and implications discussed. Also mentioned were treatment problems.

One group was instructed to use the long checklist consisting of seven category names followed by an extensive listing of specific values in thinking of physical changes in the product improvement problem. Another group was instructed to use the short checklist consisting of only seven category labels from the long checklist. The third group did not receive any checklist.

Specifically, the possibilities for therapeutic synthetic (artificial) counseling encounters are discussed. Two propositions are significant: (1) the human nervous system can not tell the difference between an actual experience and one imagined vividly and in detail; and (2) it is impossible not to communicate. Behavior in interactional situations, even synthetic ones, communicates. Three patterns of behavior (from Karen Horney) are selected as parameters: (1) moving toward people; (2) moving against people; and (3) moving away from people. These provide three global and highly  generalized nails on which to hang thoughts on the topic. Propositions considered are: (1) communicative relationships between human beings and extra-human entities continually exist; (2) such synthetic relationships can be therapeutic in effect; and (3) there are dimensions of the personality which may make such relationships possible with a computer. The paper, having only broached the possibility of therapeutic synthetic relationships and having only briefly suggested their application using the selected behavioral parameters, concludes that here indeed is a fertile area for imaginative research.

In addition to necessary procedural refinement in prediction, future developments in computer-based educational and career predictions will probably see the extension of biographical data inputs as well as inputs from various measurement instruments administered inactively by the computer. These will greatly extend the data base on the individual student and consequently increase the capacity for generating more significant predictions. Diagnosis or the detection of patterns of organization of surface behaviors is not being used presently. The computer could monitor  such patterns and the counselor could make a clinical-type judgement regarding its meaning in specific cases. Another analysis could be the detection of population trends and characteristics. The problems associated with such computer use include: (1) cost; (2) loss of humaneness; (3) fitting the individual into the population; (4) misuse; and (5) sharing results. (KJ)",

        "description":"The study dealt with the personality structure of Puerto Rican junior and senior high school students examined in one school district in Puerto Rico. The instrument used was a translated and adapted form of the HSPQ, Form A. From a scree test, more than 14 factors, probably 16 factors were to be found in the data. Rotating 14 factors to an oblique promax solution allows four HSPQ Factors (B, D, H, and I) to be matched to promax factors. Using a factor mandate it was possible to rotate to a moderately good fit of the 14 HSPQ factors. In only one case (Factor O) was the Coefficient of Congruence higher off the major diagonal than on it. Factors B, Intelligence and I, Esthetic Sensitivity were especially well matched. However, when the correlations among these oblique factors were  examined, essentially no similarity appeared between the Puerto Rican date and the factor intercorrelations appearing in the HSPQ Handbook. Examination of the mean raw scores for the Puerto Rican students as contrasted to the Handbook reports for American and British students indicates that Puerto Ricans are more like the Americans than like the British, and are generally less Excitable, less Dominant, Less Enthusiastic, more Esthetically Sensitive, less Individualistic, less Guilt-Prone, and have greater Will-power than either the American or the British samples.

The use of criterion-referenced measurements can not be expected to improve significantly our evaluations of educational achievement. The major limitations of criterion-referenced measurements are: (1) they do not tell us all we need to know about achievement; (2) they are difficult to obtain on any sound basis; and (3) they are necessary for only a small fraction of important educational achievements. It is true that norm-referenced measurements of educational achievement need to have content meaning as well as relative meaning. We need to understand not just that a student excells  or is deficient, but what it is that he does well or poorly. However, these meanings and understandings are seldom wholly absent when norm-referenced measures are used. They can be made more obviously present and useful it we choose to do so. (KJ)",

Of the 72, 11 include responses which suggest possible alienation of this age group. Each school's pupils produced a unique pattern of responses to the 11 items, which suggests that the immediate school environment is one contributing factor to the amount of alienation and the topics which generate feelings of alienation. On the item concerning autonomy-authority, about one-third indicated that they avoid thinking about their chances for success as an adult. About 25% felt that school had little relationship to life outside school. Approximately one child in six rejected the teacher in situations in which the teacher disapproves of what the student has done. About 26%  reported that their parents never visited school. About 47% felt adults would not always do what they say they will do.

The four measures were administered to 738 freshmen. A group of 140 cases were then selected, 50 for cross validation purposes and 90 to develop the necessary regression equations. Results showed that neither the factor scores nor the raw scores from the measures proved to be strong predictors of academic performance as represented by grade point average.

This research was limited to three of the seven subtests of the TTCT. Subjects' responses to each of the activities are scored for fluency, flexibility, and originality. The fluency score is defined as the total number of relevant responses given; flexibility as the number of different clusters of responses, originality was scored based on three dictionaries, with originality weights of zero, one, and two. The step-wise multiple regression technique  was employed to maximize the prediction of each subject's score for each activity of the TTCT. The prediction of fluency was the most accurate. However, with some corrections, both flexibility and originality results were improved. It appears that creativity, as defined by Torrance can be judged accurately by a computer. (KJ)",

Objectives of the course were sent to the students before the spring session began. One objective required the students to do a detailed analysis of several common supervisory/curriculum problems representative of real problems they were facing in their job situations. Simulation techniques were used, and examination of their own performance in simulation allowed students to approach affective and process learning objectives. Students were required to \"build in\" the facets of a community and then to select a suitable table of organization (TO) for the school district of that community. The district was then populated with a  board, superintendent, etc. through mock applications and personal history forms. The final evaluations of the course by students showed that the simulation experiences were important, meaningful, and useful for achieving the objectives of the course as perceived by the students. Some felt these experiences should have had more depth. More role playing, clearer directions and parameters for each experience were also suggested. (KJ)",

This study was first carried out on data collected in the Fall, 1967 and replicated in the Fall, 1968. Children in grades four through six, classified into social class groupings according to their fathers' occupations, were given the Otis Quick Scoring Mental Abilities Test. A total of 300 students were matched. The second study differed by classifying fathers' jobs according to the Dictionary of Occupation Studies, rather than according to Warner's classification. A total of 320 children were matched. Results of both  studies showed that children from the middle class did not get their scores on the intelligence test by responding to items in a different set than did the matched group from the lower class.

While applications of the concept have been suggested mainly for programs of individualization, there is no reason to limit the ideas of criterion-referenced measurement to such application. There needs to be some thought given to how the criterion-referenced concept can be applied to the typical teacher-made test as well as to standardized tests.

Two groups were administered the Davitz Tape. The experimental group had participated in sensitivity training, whereas the control group had not. First the tape was played through a band-pass filter so that the words were unintelligible, but most of the voice qualities were distinguishable. Following this, a tape without band-pass filtering and with a different item order was played. The subjects' tasks were to identify the emotional meaning  expressed in each item on the tapes and to judge how \"positive-negative\" the affect of each item was on a seven step scale. Subjects in both groups significantly identified more vocally expressed meanings without band-pass filtering than with filtering. The experimental group showed a significant gain in terms of identifying negative emotional meanings with filtering. There were no significant differences between the experimental and control group subjects in terms of affective rating. (KJ)",

A simple inexpensive technique was designed to raise achievement in those children whose primary problem was low motivation. Its adoption could be initiated by either parents or teachers, since no specialized knowledge and very little effort was required of either party. The technique involved daily dispensing of dittoed notes to the child at school regarding his performance in the area of interest. These notes were taken home and parents arranged reinforcing consequences there. Single-subject  design was used. Dependent variables, chosen on basis of individual subject's achievement problems, talking out of turn, and inattentiveness. Six of the seven cases showed significant improvement resulting from application of technique. Four of the cases are presented. Variations of this simple technique should be tried in many schools to determine its general effectiveness. It can be initiated by counselors, psychologists, social workers and principals as well as teachers and parents. It should be applicable to most grade levels, but this remains to be determined.

The system may then be used by students or counselors in any of three modes: (1) exploration, (2) index, or (3) guidance.

A total of eighty Negro children drawn from grades one through four in low and middle socioeconomic level schools, were tested individually on a total of six tests. It was hypothesized that there is a high correlation among three types of egocentrism tasks: space, communication, and role-taking (convergent validity), and a similar relation exists between each task and \"decentering\" ability. It was further predicted that egocentric performance is not related to oral reading ability (discriminant validity), but is related to two peer-status variables of popularity and leadership (predictive  validity). Individual differences associated with egocentrism were also explored. None of the major hypotheses were fully supported in preliminary analyses. The correlations among the three egocentrism tasks in the total sample were negligible. Egocentric performance does not vary significantly as a function of sex, socioeconomic status, or intelligence. With one exception, egocentrism is significantly but only moderately related to chronological age and mental age. (Author)",

However, today there are several problems associated with drug usage: (1) ignorance, (2) semantics, (3) communication, and (4) change as a constant in the world. The reasons for student drug use are discussed. Students use drugs because: (1) they are preconditioned to the legitimacy of drug usage; (2) they want to rebel; (3) they want to escape; (4) they are encouraged by peer group influence; and (5) they are searching for spiritual discovery. Some of the cultural contextual factors include: (1) the generation gap; (2) the educational level of students; (3) the effect of mass communication media; and (4) the awareness of poverty and injustice. Recognizing the various factors,  institutions can respond by: (1) creating a climate of openness and trust; (2) making sure information is available; (3) providing source credibility; (4) assisting in the dessemination of alternatives; and (5) attacking the basic problem.

Subjects were students and teachers in third through sixth grade in two schools, one white and one black, in the same rural county in Georgia. Median family incomes were compared. The findings, although incomplete due to poor student attendance, show that black students are lower achievers than white students and are two and a half years behind grade placement  while white students are one half year ahead on grade placement. White teachers and pupils function at higher cognitive levels than black pupils and teachers. Teacher and student verbal behavior in questioning and answering was tabulated by thought level and classroom interaction patterns.

It was concerned specifically with the effects of two levels of penalty on the unwarranted expression of confidence, the personality correlates of confidence-weighting and the effects on test statistics of confidence-weighting. Seventy-two subjects were administered a 130 item multiple choice test under confidence-weighting instructions. All subjects completed the California Psychological Inventory. Results included: (1) no significant effects or interaction attributable to level of penalty or sex; (2) the expression of confidence in one's objective test responses is  contaminated by a general personality factor; and (3) no significant increase in test reliability as a result of confidence-weighting.

Subjects were administered a dominance scale and extreme scorers randomly assigned to one of the types of directions, then randomly assigned to complete an anxiety scale either before or after a multiple choice vocabulary test. In the initial study, dominant individuals scored significantly higher than submissive subjects under CT and AEI directions. Low anxious subjects scored significantly higher under DNG and AEI directions, while differences under CT instructions were nonsignificant. Level of anxiety was significantly lower after the vocabulary test under AEI and CT directions, but  remained the same under DNG directions. The results were less clear-cut in the replication, but relationships among variables were, for the most part, consistent with the initial study. It appears submissive, anxious individuals operate at a disadvantage in testing situations which allow some freedom in responding. (Author)",

Parents completed the College and University Environment Scales and the Adjective Check List on which they described their children. There were wide discrepancies between the environmental perceptions of parents and students, but few differences between parents of entering freshmen and upperclassmen. There were a number of significant relationships between campus perceptions and college son or daughter  characterizations for parents of upperclassmen, but only one for freshmen parents. A number of possible reasons are suggested for these results, including selective reporting by students to parents, and reduction of cognitive dissonance on the part of parents. (Author)",

The Learning Environment Inventory was used to ascertain the students' perceptions of the classroom climate along fifteen dimensions that reflected the pupils' relationship to one another, to the organizational properties of the class, to the physical environment and the class activities. The  findings imply that the students' perceptions of the classroom climate differed according to the nature of the subject but that sex of the teacher was unrelated to these perceptions. (RSM)",

If counselors are to become a part of the linkage system between school and work, they will have to change their posture from \"neutral\" sources of occupational and job information to active developers of information and to participants in the job seeking process. Presently, many of the hiring requirements based on education, aptitude testing, age, and appearance are questionable and unrealistic and contribute to the unemployment of young men and women. The only true measure of the effectiveness of a worker is his performance on the job. Yet hiring standards are rarely validated in relation to job performance. In order to bring about fairer hiring practices, counselors must act  as \"Change agents\" and recommend to employers whose hiring standards are not valid that they should be modified. This proposition calls for a socially responsible activist role for counselors. (RSM)",

The trend has become, therefore, toward either random selection or an open door policy. No matter what the process of selection may be, if black students differ socially and culturally from traditional students, they will continue to have difficulties once admitted to a traditional collegiate program. Therefore, if new criteria can be developed to select those who have the greatest chance to succeed in the hostile environment, chances for academic success would increase. Oberlin College has set about developing such criteria. They interviewed black  applicants and in addition to regular admissions criteria, the students were rated on \"hipness.\" This concept includes competitiveness, high motivation, and self reliance. A total of three groups were admitted: 18 were not \"hip\" but met regular criteria; 14 were both \"hip\" and met regular criteria; and seven were \"hip\" but did not meet regular criteria.

However a great majority of these projects have never been transplanted for field testing. Field implementation is essential in order to evaluate the systems and to provide information services which are lacking in many traditional noncomputer oriented guidance systems. The insufficiency of field deployment is due to the fact that the process is filled with major economic, operational, and psychological problems. Strategies for conquering the economic barriers include a search for funding of developmental research by private rather than by federal agencies, time-shared computer use with industrial computer users and other school districts, and the fostering of computer  usage in other aspects in the life of the school district. To attempt alleviation of the operational problems an effort should be made to design computer based guidance around the more reliable types of hardware. To reduce psychological barriers students and counselors must be trained in the use of computers. Counselors must be informed of the capabilities of the computer guidance system and should be assisted in understanding the relationship between computer guidance and the schools' current guidance system. The principle means of overcoming fear and distrust however seems to be in increased use. (RSM)",

The unity underlying the multiplicity of ways of growth (150 educational methods or systems) is a recurrent theme. This unity transcends the seemingly diverse intentions of education, psychiatry, and religion. The author contends that close scrutiny may uncover enough of a meeting ground to warrant the ambition of a unified science and art of human change. Indeed, a consistent view of man's development will fuse the three currently separated disciplines. The author suggests a phenomenological approach to practical ways of personal growth which provides an experiential meeting ground for diverse techniques, exercises and procedures that would  contribute to the unfolding of man. His approach is intended to elucidate two things: (1) the unity of secular and and religious views concerning the process of the unfolding of man; and (2) the unity of various methods of achieving human growth from the standpoint of experiences these methods elicit, rather than from their external descriptions.

        "description":"The need for adequate knowledge of the personality patterns associated with professional competence, especially that of women professionals, spurred the authors to study this relationship, using 221 professional woman as subjects. The subjects, professionals from nine different occupations, were administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) from which the patterning of subtest scores provides the basis for the Gittinger Personality Assessment System (PAS). Primary emphasis was placed on the development of stable reference groups based on the complex interaction of PAS variables. A \"good\" reference group is defined as a set of individuals subject to similar psychodynamic mechanisms which encompasses a large number of persons within its defined limits. But it must be  narrow enough to allow prediction of behavior on a within-group basis. Of the sampled professions, only realtors and social workers failed to contribute any members to the three established reference groups. Meaningful reference groups within these two professions were found, however. It is suggested that the pattern derived from the largest reference group, the Professional Generalists, could prove advantageous in university career counseling for women. (TL)",

Suggestions about what can be done are offered: (1) develop a preventive program of crisis  intervention and conflict management; (2) deal decisively with disruption; (3) when necessary, act quickly and decisively; and (4) develop orderly disciplinary procedures and processes.

The characteristics of those who do become active in campus political protests are listed, as well as the types of protest activities in which these students are likely to participate, and the types in which they have participated. From the evidence, it is concluded that most student protesters remain within the limits of the law. The scope of the paper also includes those who do not remain within the legal limits. The authors concern themselves with one dimension of the problem, namely, the relationship between liberalism-conservatism and law-abidingness. The study upon which the paper was based  examined a specific hypothesis: conservatives given their greater propensity toward reigidity and conformity, are likely to be more law-abiding than liberals. Two instruments were used to collect data from the sample of 128 students at a California state college: (1) Lentz's Conservatism-Radicalism (C-R) Opinionnaire; and (2) Gregory's Law-Abidingness Scale. The results clearly indicated that attitudes of conservative and liberal students toward the law were not significantly different. The correlates of law-abidingness and law violation are discussed.

A sociometric device was constructed and administered to obtain ratings on both peer acceptance and peer rejection by each child for his classmates. Sociometric consistency behavior was defined by a consistency matrix that was generated for each child, from which a consistency index was assigned him. Consistency comparisons were made over grade levels. A high incidence of inconsistent behavers was found in grade four, with fewer in grade five. The exact construct equivalent of peer rejection could not be  derived from the peer acceptance rankings, although a 67% correct detection was possible of peer rejecteds.

Data were collected from four centers in a large urban area over a period of two years. The centers were scrutinized with respect to the functions of their Interviewing and Counseling Units: (1) Information/Reception; (2) Intake; (3) Referral; and (4) Followup. In addition, research involved observation of counselor/client transactions, abstraction of information from case files, and surveying of counselor  perspectives. Deficiencies were found in: (1) information and decision making systems; (2) operational patterns; and (3) relationships of the centers to their external environment.

The major objective was to determine their attitudes toward junior colleges.

        "description":"This study obtains evidence for the effect of time of day on learning in a stressful situation. A series of five experiments were performed to assess the effects of this variable on learning using albino rat subjects. None of the experiments provide overwhelming evidence for the effect of time of day when taken alone and each leaves questions which can only be answered by empirical test. However, as a group they seem to indicate that time of day does play an important role in learning in a stressful situation. Most forms of motivation such as fear of failure in a classroom or fear of shock in the laboratory are aversive or stressful in the Thorndikian sense of an annoying state of affairs which the organism will avoid or minimize. If the comparison holds, then although the effect  would vary in its specifics, time of day might also influence human learning under stress. (Author)",

The rationale for the creation of elementary school counseling programs lies in the knowledge that growth and development during the formative years of childhood and preadolescence are crucial for children to develop into fully functioning adults. The program should adhere to a developmental approach to working with youngsters and thus should: (1) be preventive in that assessment of needs should be an ongoing and evolving process with each child; (2) recognize the importance of the school, home, and social milieu for the child and operate across the breadth of these environments to provide necessary help; (3) enable the child to cope successfully  with the demands of each developmental level; and (4) be an integral part of the educational process which is provided for all children. Based on these concepts the various facets of an elementary school guidance program are presented along with guidelines for the development and evaluation of a program. (Author/RSM)",

        "description":"This study concerns the development of a measure of educational need and its use in a State school support formula in New York. The study assumes that public schools should operate positively to further equality of opportunity and that schools are able to affect achievement levels and rates of learning. The present State-aid formula is not sufficient because it recognizes differences in fiscal need but not in educational need. Noting that educational costs for children with special needs are relatively high compared with costs for normal children, the present formula discriminates against districts having a high proportion of special problem students. The research in this study, based on a sample of 45 school districts, suggests using the following variables: (1) The ratio of  Negro and Puerto Rican students in the school, (2) the percentage of children from broken homes, (3) the average number of different schools the students have attended in the past 3 years, and (4) the average number of years of schooling the parents have completed. These measures predict 71% of the variation in educational achievement in both reading and arithmetic and, therefore, can establish educational need consistent with the stated assumptions.

A strong opinion among educators suggests that students can learn faster if the educational forces are applied systematically. To achieve this goal, learning objectives for students should be primary and must be communicated in the classroom. Activity that does not involve students is considered secondary or supportive. It is important that the learning objectives be related to the concerns of the consumers of the educational product. The student should understand the learning objectives, perceive their relevance to him personally, and feel that they are attainable. For the educational system to work  well, the student and prospective consumer of the educational product should agree on the learning objectives. It is felt that this model will generate useful data for each decision-making level in the educational system. Any internal breakdown of the above outline will indicate an educational need or perceived deficiency in the level of student benefits which decision makers can correct using a consistent base of information.

Program budgeting is practiced differently, depending on the mission of an organization or school district. With regard to schools, literature on the subject is mainly limited to the actual working budget and its reporting documents, which provide the most current information. However, writings by program budgeting authorities in other fields have general application for schools. In industry, program budgeting essentially is comprehensive long-range planning, which is related to departmental plans. Cost-benefit analysis is used to analyze the investment returns on expenditure choices. When applied to  traditional budgeting in the schools, program budgeting focuses on end-product activities based on expenditure choices. This method involves long-range planning rather than the examination of minute object-of-expenditure details. A 126-entry bibliography is appended. (Author/DE)",

The study is one in a series of needs assessment reports for PROJECT DESIGN, an ESEA Title III project administered by the Fresno City Unified School District. Theoretical concepts, rather than computational drill, would be emphasized in the proposed mathematics programs. To offset any decline in computational skills, the new program plans to maintain the skill level, yet find time to introduce the new concepts of modern mathematics. The experimental design of this study tabulates a matrix of school system needs. The following needs are summarized: (1) Societal standards, (2) assessment data, (3) strengths and weaknesses, (4) learner needs, (5) instructional needs, (6) administrative  and district needs, and (7) a general category of needs. In addition, 37 suggested solutions and 16 major conclusions are contained at the end of the report. (LN)",

        "description":"The evaluation of future needs for the K-12 science program in the Fresno City Unified School District used four goals for science education published in the Science Framework for California Public Schools. These goals are (1) to develop attitudes that underlie the personal involvement of the individual with his environment, (2) to develop a scientific mode of inquiry, (3) to develop fundamental skills for scientific inquiry, and (4) to develop the knowledge of a body of facts and concepts necessary for further interpretation of the natural world. The experimental design consisted of site visits to 73 schools at the elementary, junior high, and senior high levels. In the elementary and junior high schools, an understanding of these goals by teachers and administrators was highly  recommended. The report suggested that the junior high program could be upgraded by providing more science experiences, although more laboratory equipment must be acquired. The senior high program should provide more introductory courses in the physical sciences that are relevant to the noncollege-bound student. A detailed matrix of educational needs for each grade level is contained in the report. The research was conducted as part of PROJECT DESIGN, funded under ESEA Title III. (LN)",

Authorities on present practices were consulted to establish the comparative standard, which was then classified into the biogenic needs, sociogenic needs, and educational needs of the learner. Site visits provided opportunities to interview district and school administrative personnel and physical education teachers about program curriculum and course content. This method of inquiry provided  information to establish a matrix of educational needs.

        "description":"A theoretical framework of the learning process is presented and then used to evaluate the total educational program in the Fresno City Unified School District as part of PROJECT DESIGN, funded under ESEA Title III. According to this framework, the learner must develop a self-concept by which he feels he can learn. From this self-concept the learner must experience alternatives, that is, become actively involved in selecting what he wants to learn and how and when he wants to learn it. By being allowed to explore and search for meaning, an inquiring process is developed. The power of learning resides in the ability to keep a question open, lending to a concept of education as continuous or open ended. It is felt that, in Fresno, the teaching staff is biased toward keeping the  student passive in the educational process. The above theoretical base should be used to change teachers' attitudes toward students. It is strongly suggested that a staff development program be instituted to provide detail on this learning theory and to promote desirable changes in the educational program. (LN)",

However, programs for the partially sighted, hard of hearing, speech impaired, crippled, and educationally handicapped fell below the enrollment trends nationally. It is suggested that more thorough screening methods in these areas would raise enrollments closer to the national rates. Classroom quality is adequate in most cases, with the exception that classes for the  educationally handicapped are on double session. An additional suggestion is that the staff become more involved in budget preparation and admission procedures. (LN)",

In the construction of the model, answers were sought to three basic questions: When are guidance services rendered, for whom are they normally provided, and how are they provided. It is essential that the prevention of problems be stressed, and, if problems do arise, that they be diagnosed and treated at the earliest possible time. Data were collected through questionnaires given to students and guidance personnel. Major conclusions at the  elementary level are as follows: Guidance services are rarely present; when they are performed, it is solely for academic placement; and prevention of potential problems is deemphasized. At the secondary level, guidance services focus on a restricted number of students, treatment rather than prevention is emphasized, and guidance personnel spend too much time on routine clerical work. At both levels a reordering of emphasis toward the preventive model is highly recommended. (LN)",

More contact with pupils, parents, and teachers is needed to alleviate health problems before they arise.  Also, records from community physicians would be invaluable in dispensing health services. Finally, in health instruction, with yearly changes of emphasis among such subjects as smoking hazards, venereal disease, drugs, family life, and sex education, a separate curriculum unit would be better able to provide systematic treatment of the various subjects.

Such a program includes student control, student body organizations, student council, club programs, social activities, and athletics. Elementary, intermediate, and high school levels were investigated to determine if students had motivational opportunities for self-direction and development with guidance and assistance. Student surveys were made at all three grade levels. Oral interviews were conducted with the Director of Activities  at each school.

The present program's administrative effectiveness was examined and site visits to facilities were made to assess their adequacy, availability, and location. Externally, a cross-section of informed citizens from the community were interviewed. The study concludes that the major curriculum  need is to expand into areas serving the Mexican-American, the Negro, and the disadvantaged white segments of the population. In addition, a demand for such courses must be stimulated among the designated users and facilities should be in geographical areas where the users are housed.

        "description":"Educational needs of Mexican-Americans in the Fresno City Unified School District are assessed as part of PROJECT DESIGN, funded under ESEA Title III. Representative cross-sections of both the Mexican-American and non-Mexican-American populations of Fresno were contacted. Individuals interviewed in groups and individually totalled 153. The sample of Mexican-Americans included children, young adults, parents, professionals, and organizations. The non-Mexican-American population was composed of citizens, teachers, principals, school managers, and administrators in city agencies involved with Mexican-Americans. A classification matrix established for all the reports of PROJECT DESIGN is used to organize the data and recommendations. The major conclusion is that a negative self-image  exists among Mexican-American students and that negative school conditions surround them. Recommended changes in the attitudes of educators and educational procedures are outlines. Related documents are EA 002 841, EA 002 843, and EA 002 845. (MF)",

        "description":"This PROJECT DESIGN report, funded under ESEA Title III, assesses the special learner needs of Negro students and adults. Interviews were conducted with Negro residents of West Fresno as to the educational needs of the Negro population. The interviews focused on the day-to-day operation of the school system in relation to the following societal education standards: command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation, citizenship, worthy use of leisure, ethical character, and good health. Interviewees included students, parents of students, teachers, administrators, community leaders, men on the street, and persons attending Model Cities and other community meetings. The report concludes that the learner needs of Negro students and adults in Fresno are the result of  a cultural-educational deficiencies continuum of generation-to-generation disadvantage among Negroes. Such deficiencies are listed and various courses of school district and community action to alleviate the disadvantage are outlined. Related documents are EA 002 841, EA 002 843, and EA 002 844.

        "description":"This planning overview is part of phase two of PROJECT DESIGN, an ESEA Title III project administered by the Fresno City Unified School District. Developing a long-range interagency master plan for Fresno involves three separate but interrelated activities. The first branch of activity consists of conducting a needs assessment (EA 002 822 thru EA 002 845). In the second branch, results of the needs assessment are used to identify priority problems and to define procedures for solving them when immediate and intermediate action is necessary. This involves defining and analyzing priority needs, generating alternative solution strategies, selecting the optimum strategy, drawing a detailed master plan for implementing that strategy, and evaluating. At each step in the problem-solving  process there is communication with the Community Planning Register (EA 002 851 and 852). This interchange allows for the third branch, which is the linking of immediate problem solving with that of a long-range educational and community master plan. (Author/DE)",

It is part of Phase II of PROJECT DESIGN, an ESEA Title III project administered by the Fresno City Unified School District. The educational park remains largely theoretical; few have moved to physical planning and construction stages. The report notes that the possible benefits of facilitating racial integration, improved efficiency and productivity, increased facility utilization, wider range of various special facilities, and increased support and specialist staff services seem more than outweighed by massive construction and transportation funding. It is suggested that the district continue to monitor this concept. However, it is recommended that the Fresno schools seriously  consider adopting an organizational pattern containing middle schools. Not only do the values of middle schools make this approach desirable for Fresno, but also many of the recent innovative trends in Fresno would be further facilitated if the district would adopt the middle school concept. Existing school facilities and recently initiated building would both be utilized with minor modification. (Author/DE)",

        "description":"To serve emotionally disturbed adolescents in a residential treatment program, an educational cadre was formed to function as a diagnostic, teaching, and research instrument. Specialists in addition to classroom teachers included a curriculum specialist, a cognitive psychologist, and a psychiatric clinician. Experimental curriculum units in English and history were developed around cognitive style, learning and recall, and language. Tests, materials, and projects were developed. Evaluation indicated that the more reflective students gave literal or descriptive interpretations; the more impulsive ones gave answers high in abstraction or degree of affect or general interpretation. Language tests did not render statistically significant results. Observation and student critiques and  work products suggested that the experimental material and methods may have facilitated learning. Plans made for the 2nd year of demonstration and research called for categorizing behavior and further investigating cognitive style. (JD)",

The preacademic focus of the primary classes (ages 6 to 8) was validated in that a majority of subjects from the 1st year who had returned to regular classes were average or above in their functioning after 1 or 2 years in the program. Also EH children in the engineered classrooms outdistanced children in regular EH  classes and approached or exceeded normal controls academically and behaviorally.

Good learners were superior on measures of intellectual ability, reading comprehension and written language, and sequential and spatial memory. Factorial analyses also indicated that the good learners had more highly integrated and organized mental abilities. Neurological studies revealed more positive neurological signs in poor learners; electroencephalographic studies did not discriminate significantly between the good and  poor learners but did distinguish between the brain functioning of deaf and hearing children; ophthalmological studies indicated a high incidence of visual abnormalities in both experimental groups.

However, poorer adjustment was noted in subjects who had been in special classes longer, who had used postschool training facilities, or who used formal resources in job hunting rather than informal resources. Social class was found to be a factor, with subjects from families of higher class manifesting lower adjustment and greater tendencies to stay in school after age 16, to secure postschool training, and not to be expected by their parents to  hold full time employment.

The first two were made in January; the teacher was involved in a T-group experience in February; the third videotape was made in May with the same 15 boys as in the earlier and one girl previously absent. Analysis indicated significant changes in both the teacher's and the students' behaviors. The teacher became more indirect, reduced controlling behaviors, and increased praise and questions. The students' socially maladjusted behaviors were reduced and apparently eliminated for half of the members of the class. Confusion decreased and response to teacher and self initiated  responses increased. (Author/JD)",

Systematic exploration of the item-writing process may well make it possible for the computer to take on some of the less creative portions of item writing. The current study demonstrates the potential usefulness of the computer as a tool for an item writer. A spelling item type was used for this demonstration, as it seemed to have the fewest facets or dimensions. An analysis was then made of the types of misspellings which are used by writers of spelling items. A set of error-generation rules was developed and a computer program [The MISSPELLER] was written. A sample of words was fed into the computer  and a list of misspelled words, separated into previously defined error categories was created. The list was then evaluated by spelling-test developers and judged to be a useful resource. Other more complex item types are now being studied. Appendices contain samples of the printouts obtained.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of quizzing on achievement, with or without feedback. In three experimental sections quizzes were given immediately after the lesson; in three other sections quizzes were given the day after the feedback. The three conditions being used were: correct answers being given immediately; correct answers given the day after the quiz; and only the number of correct answers given to the student the following day. There was also a control section. It was found that sections receiving the delayed quiz did better on the final examination than those receiving an intermediate quiz. A short daily quiz administered one day  after a lecture serves to evaluate for the student mathemagenic behaviors in which he engages during the delay. When knowledge of results is delayed, mathemagenic behaviors are also engaged in, but it is the quiz material that is being processed rather than the lecture material. The utilization of mathemagenic behaviors by the student varies according to his achievement orientation. A bibliography is appended. (Author)",

The pragmatic necessities of the war questioned the relevance of this traditional approach and specialists appeared, concentrating their efforts on the recent Soviet period exclusively. Thus, Russian studies became distinct from Slavic studies. This article explores how integration of former traditional and fragmented approaches in Slavic studies and the more recent Russian studies has begun at a number of American colleges. (RL)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the processes that determine the characteristics of professional sub-cultures. It was postulated that mechanisms of attraction, formal and informal selection, promotion and reinforcement of desired characteristics serve to shape the personality which characterizes the members of a profession and can be expected to result in a common set of values, attitudes and skills. It was also postulated that these mechanisms could be investigated through use of self descriptions which identify the common beliefs, typical behaviors, preferences, and values of members of the profession. The Job Analysis and Interest Measurement (JAIM) was administered to beginning students at schools preparing candidates for five professions: social work, law, public administration,  business administration, and army officer. The JAIM was again administered at the end of training to social work students and army officer candidates. Results supported the major hypotheses. Highly significant differences were found (1) among student groups preparing for different professions, (2) among students expressing preferences for different sub-specialties, (3) between students who dropped out of training and those who stayed, and (4) between scores for students obtained at the beginning and at the end of training.

General recommendations include more state support for: (1) faculty research, (2) research into the connection between the discovery of knowledge and meaningful teaching, and (3) a broader definition of the  Donahoe Act. Encouragement should be given to (1) maintaining the present 3 divisions of California higher education, (2) permitting greater flexibility of the individual state colleges in the administration of their instructional budgets, and (3) involving qualified State College and University faculty members in doctoral teaching and research supervision (joint doctoral program). Specific recommendations are delineated further. The report contains over 150 pages of appended information and concludes with a bibliography. (Author/NF)",

Questionnaires were sent to a student, faculty member and administrator at each of 612 accredited, four-year institutions selected at random. Completed questionnaires were received from 983 persons or 53.6%. The findings showed that student unrest has manifested itself on the majority of campuses during the past 5 years, but less than 5% of faculty and students participated in activities related to unrest. Student unrest tended to be expressed through legal and generally accepted protest activities. Administrators rarely ignored the protests and tended to engage in  dialogue with the students. Relatively few resorted to the use of force. On most campuses, the situations that led to unrest no longer exist or are less severe. The lack of communication, especially between students and administrators, was most frequently cited as a cause for unrest, but lack of opportunity for student participation in policy formation also contributed significantly, as did objection to the principle of in loco parentis. Expectations are that student unrest will continue, that the amount and scope of demands as well as resistance to them will increase, but that many of the present demands will be met. (AF)",

These students need frequent opportunities for communication, open debate and widespread involvement, but these conditions do not prevail at most colleges and universities. Exchange increases and the dimension of discussion expands only when students perceive teaching and curriculum as relevant to their concerns and backgrounds. Outside the classroom student-faculty relationships should be based on accessibility, authenticity, honesty, knowledge, understanding, and the  ability to talk with, not at each other.

Respondents were asked to indicate how decisions should be made regarding either policy formulation or rules and regulations in each of the areas. In addition, students and faculty-administrators reported their perceptions on the degree of control desired by each other. Responses indicated that the students wanted more control over decision  making than faculty-administration found desirable. Misunderstandings of the desires of the other group complicated the situation and led to intensification of problems.

One's writing can be quite easily evaluated, one's teaching supposedly not. Yet student use of questionnaires on a teacher's effectiveness, or visitation of classes by colleagues could provide excellent information about the teacher's qualities in the classroom. There is great need for a clearing house of information about good teachers and the development of a system for identifying good and poor teachers on a campus. This could be done if a number of  institutions banded together and used a national metric system or similar device to collect information, and provide indices of evaluation. This would allow for a teaching effectiveness number to be added to the teacher's dossier, and teaching ability would thus become another factor to be considered in salary increases or recruitment.

        "description":"Because the Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology (CAATS) of Ontario are largely dependent on the Ontario Government for financial support, it is important to justify their level of expenditure, and prove that allotted public funds are effectively and efficiently managed. After a brief discussion of the existing resource allocation process in Ontario, this paper explores various formula financing systems. Cost plans used by various states in the United States for financing higher education are examined in detail. Traditionally, per student program costs are arrived at through an itemized examination of the budget or financial statement of the particular college. The financing formula system proposed for CAATS is based on an analytical process that focuses primarily on such  variables as teaching methods, administrative policies, and institutional characteristics. The basic purpose of the study is to develop objective information regarding the cost of a range of reasonable program alternatives in different institutions. (AF)",

Phase I of the series attempted to determine the number of professional and semi-professional personnel needed to provide the services necessary for optimum care; Phase II analyzed the potential of institutions of higher learning in Arkansas to prepare these personnel. Phase III establishes proposals to expand existing programs and to create new ones. Suggestions were derived from plans classified as &quot;not adequate&quot; or &quot;not existing&quot; in the Phase II report. Because of limited financial resources the  needed projects were classified in four priority levels: &quot;most urgent&quot;, &quot;urgent&quot;, &quot;intermedially urgent&quot;, and &quot;least urgent&quot;.

A questionnaire examining perceived power relationships was sent to 131 randomly selected faculty members in 6 social science departments at a state university. Three of the departments were in a period of stress as a result of contested tenure decisions, turnover of chairmen, and protest resignations. Eighty four members of the departments or 65% returned usable questionnaires. Faculty in non-stress departments reported greater reliance on legitimate, expert and referent powers for both themselves and their chairmen; respondents in stress departments reported greater use of reward and coercive powers, i.e. positive and negative  sanctions. When asked for their preference, both stress and non-stress faculty tended to select the legitimate, expert, and referent bases of power. When power preferences of the \"locals\" (off-campus reference group orientation), it was found that the \"locals\" perceived and favored the use of referent and legitimate power, while \"cosmopolitans\" perceived more emphasis on the use of rewards, and expert power.

Product-moment correlations were computed between each pair of the 60 items. The correlation matrix was factor analyzed by the principal components method using unity in the diagonal. All factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.00 were rotated to the varimax criterion. The four factor  solution was as follows: Factor I: Counselor, Factor II: Disciplinarian, Factor III: Administrator, and Factor IV: Advisor. These factors correspondingly accounted for 37.4, 19.6, 19.7, and 23.0% of the common variance for a total of 99.7 percent.

Academic success was measured according to their Spring Quarter GPA. Although the Deans readmitted 225 students based on their test scores, only 93 chose to attend class that Spring Quarter. Significant GPA correlates were found at  the .05 level or better among all categories of variables produced a multiple correlation with Spring GPA of R=.84. The major finding of this multivariate study had to do with the non-ability correlates with GPA from the 16 PF and the Activities Index.

The control group received instruction by the traditional approach of lectures and classroom discussion; while the experimental group had their lectures and discussions supplemented by multimedia lessons which could be taken in the college library outside of the regularly scheduled class period on a voluntary basis by those students that felt they needed extra instruction. A statistical treatment of the data using the T-test showed a significant difference in the achievement of the 2 groups. The experimental group's achievement was significantly higher than the control group's achievement at the 1% level of confidence.  (Author)",

Their attitudes on academic work and institutions and political and academic issues were compared on the basis of their identification with the role of student, as opposed to scholar, roles and membership in the union of employed graduate students at Berkeley. It was found that student identification and union membership were associated with coherent political radicalism and that a substantial proportion of the whole sample rejected the traditionally narrow ends of professionalism and the norms that presently dominate the academic world. It was concluded that rejection of academic norms and values is  increasing, but that radical graduate students and faculty should organize themselves within and across disciplines to deal successfully with their hostile professions and institutions.

The students were divided into 6 groups: left, moderate, and radical activists; left, moderate, and radical non-activists. The institutions were a small private liberal arts college, a medium-sized private university, and a large public university. Researchers met with the students in small groups on each campus and administered, in a 2 hour session, questionnaires. These instruments measured intelligence, personality, attitudes, values, extent of political activism, and political ideology. The anonymity of individuals and organizations was guaranteed. Results indicated that significant personality differences existed only between the 2 major groups of activists and  non-activists. Activists were more independent, more sociable, more socially ascendant and more assertive. Right activists and right non-activists were highest on \"Authoritarianism\" and left activists lowest. Right and left activists were both highest on \"Autonomy.\" (NF)",

The comparison of responses suggests that: a highly positive correlation exists between each group's rating of the areas; the areas are not considered as having equal importance; and the mean ratings of students indicating scores for the excellent and poor teacher in each area were consistently higher than those given by the faculty.

Data were obtained through questionnaires sent to full-time faculty members and institutional administrators in the Illinois 2-year public institutions. These questionnaires contained typical hypothetical situations in which communication problems might arise, and asked for each respondent's opinions concerning the probability and nature of any resulting communication. Variables were then statistically correlated in several combinations. Some of the more significant results indicate that organizational characteristics such as size, chain of command, and division of  labor may inhibit an atmosphere of effective communication between superordinate and subordinate; and that an individual's previous training and experience may not be as relatively important a factor as was previously thought, when judging his potential for leadership and communication.

Factors investigated include current and future population, student enrollment, and economic patterns; manpower distribution and needs; existing and required educational services; financing; and existing interfaces among 2-year colleges themselves and with other state-wide institutions of higher education. The following conclusions and recommendations were typical. First, gearing the system more to the needs of the state, making post-high school attendance opportunities available to all, and meeting the increasing need for semi-professional and technical training were recommended. To do this, it was conceded that the old notion of a  school in one physically located campus could be, under certain circumstances, replaced by a &quot;teaching service area&quot;--where course offerings were adaptable to the needs of the community and that required few permanent facilities. In addition, it was recommended that duplication in recruiting and program offerings should be reduced, as should current inequities in financing methods and present inefficiencies in coordination among the various institutions of higher education in the state.

Courses are classified as transfer, occupational, or comprehensive (both transfer and occupational), and tables are provided showing how frequently a course was offered, its relative ranking based on the frequency, and the percentage of colleges offering these courses. Upon comparing these 1967 figures with similar tables constructed for 639 schools in a 1962 study, the following general observations are made: most significant increases in curricular offerings were found among the occupational courses, although the number of junior colleges with such offerings has not substantially increased. In addition, while occupational education receives increased attention at  the public junior college, the current emphasis there is clearly on transfer courses, as it is to an even greater extent at the private junior college. Concluding, the author suggests that a greater emphasis must be placed on occupational education at the junior college level if national needs are to be met.

Of 2,320 applicants, 489 failed to register for the spring 1970 semester after taking the examination; of these, 239 returned questionnaires that sought reasons for failing to register. Data received were analyzed from several aspects, including sex and ethnic distribution, recommended course placement, previous college experience, and difficulties with registration procedures. Analysis of data led to the conclusion that financial problems, acceptance by another school, procedural problems in registration, and temporary deferment of entrance were the most important  reasons for not completing registration.

Both groups also favor some student participation in academic policy formulation, and this time the Harcum group's responses are comparatively more liberal. Most members of both groups disapprove of even non-voting student membership on academic policy committees.  Comparing the activities and opinions of groups at Harcum and other institutions who favored an \"equal-vote\" membership of students on academic policy committees with those of the groups favoring a \"no-role\" approach reveals the following: \"equal-vote\" groups evidence more extra-academic contacts with students, greater political activity, and an increased concern with campus reform than do the \"no-role\" groups; both groups, however, are similar in that they indicate teaching as a major source of satisfaction, feel teaching effectiveness very important in evaluating instructor performance, and advocate similar teaching techniques.

These two applications are analyzed in detail. A second contribution of this analysis is the provision of data and methodology for examining costs and effectiveness (in terms of physicians and students within broadcasting range) of configurations of subsets of points in the full network. The data and methodology could also be used for determining the minimum cost for networks using media other than broadband television broadcasting, such as audio only broadcasting in conjunction with slides or still  pictures. The cost attractiveness of networked, simultaneous broadcasting can also be compared with, for example, sequential broadcasting using mailed video tapes. (NH)",

A change in techniques is also expected because of growing needs of users as well as of producers of science information. These changes will have profound effects on the principal formal mechanism of communication in the discipline of physics in the U.S.--the archival, primary research journal. The examination of possible changes in the role of U.S. journals reflects the financial and scientific experiences of the American Institute of Physics that publishes 87% of the primary research literature of U.S. physics literature and 35% of the world's physics  literature. With financial support from the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Institute is undertaking the development of a National Information System for Physics that should provide scientists with more timely and facile access to the large well-organized central store of worldwide physics information. This access will be made possible by a variety of services and publications each responsive to the changing needs and interests of the many subdisciplines in the physics community. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"Because the pressure of technological advancement has made teaching factual knowledge increasingly difficult, educators have been developing curriculums to transmit intellectual processes applicable to many tasks instead of subject matter content. One of the 20 educational Follow Through programs, the Tucson Early Education Model, surveyed 42 TEEM-trained teachers (EP) and 75 non-TEEM teachers in Iowa, Texas, Georgia, and Louisiana to determine if teachers ask questions which elicit intellectual operations in children. Teachers were audio taped for 40 minutes in classrooms. Their questions were classified according to an Intellectual Operations model based on Guilford's Structure of the Intellect. The six classifications were (1) perception, (2) cognition, (3) memory, (4)  divergent production, (5) convergent production, and (6) evaluation. Analysis of data revealed that EP and NP teachers differed in teaching style. Although both groups placed inordinate stress on knowledge and memory questions which precluded the opportunity to teach other intellectual operations, EP teachers exhibited a significant shift away from this practice. The TEEM process approach attempts to prevent the teacher's imposition of intellectual demands for skills not present in the child's repertoire and capitalizes on the motivation inherent in his success. This new emphasis may have great impact, especially when employed to teach disadvantaged children. (MH)",

In a nonncontrolled experiment, Pre- and posttests were given to 23 disadvantaged white and black nursery school children using three sets of objects. These scores were compared with scores of 16 middle class nursery school children. The Piagetian  exploratory method was used, allowing the examiner to help the child to understand the questions. It was concluded that curriculum significantly increased the children's ability to make both first and second dichotomies and to shift criteria. The middle class children's classificatory ability remained at the same level. Both groups progressed in their ability to give verbal justifications. With suggested modifications, the testing method seems valuable because it evaluates the ability to coordinate both intension and extension. (NH)",

An overview and summary of the principal investigations on the relationship of malnutrition to intellectual development is presented. Some studies focus on infants and children whose malnutrition required hospitalization and others consider nonhospitalized children suffering from malnutrition. The difficulties of defining and assessing protein-calorie malnutrition and separating its influence from other biological, social, and environmental conditions are emphasized. Examples of studies involving attempts to improve children's nutritional  status by means of dietary intervention are also given. A discussion follows of the substantive and practical implications of the research studies. It is concluded that psychologists must continue to develop educational programs that facilitate the physical and psychological development of children both at home and in school. (DR)",

        "description":"This paper seeks to answer some of the questions asked by teachers and principals when a proposal for a token reinforcement system is introduced at a public school. The question of cost should not be a deterrent, since a well-planned token system puts little financial strain on a school, and the transition from tokens to social reinforcers can take place within 3 to 4 months without loss of appropriate behavior. At present, token systems should be undertaken on a pilot study basis in order to generate progress and evaluation data on the children involved. Necessary consultation time is not excessive when compared to therapist hours spent in traditional therapeutic centers. Teachers need not worry about the amount of time spent in the actual dispensing of tokens in the classroom,  because the small amount of time it takes is more than made up for by time saved correcting inappropriate behaviors. A token reinforcement program can improve classroom behaviors but can only enhance academic behavior when academic materials are adequately presented. Bolstering the students' confidence, involving the parents, and providing reinforcement for teachers and administrators are also important elements in the success of a token program. Recommendations are given for the establishment of an effective token system. (MH)",

He states that the solutions to the problems of air, water, and soil pollution may be found in redirected education. This \"education for survival\" can serve to replace confusion with knowledge and, thus, be the key to human survival. He maintains that education is more important than environmental legislation, because in a free society it is always the citizens who must bear ultimate responsibility. He asks humanists and social scientists to take the lead in solving our present ecological dilemma. The specific task of the new environmental/ecological education is to instill awareness, concern,  motivation, and training at every level of learning. (MH)",

External evaluation involved post-program testing on the Stanford-Binet, Illinois Test of  Psycholinguistic Abilities, Caldwell Preschool Inventory, Englemann Concept Inventory Scale, and the Metropolitan Readiness Tests. Test results indicated: (1) Stanford-Binet: a treatment effect; favored the Peabody curriculum, (2) ITPA: a treatment effect; favored both the GE and P9 curricula, (3) Caldwell: uncovered only a treatment effect, (4) Englemann: did not differentiate between groups, and (5) Metropolitan: found only a surprising superiority of the P3 curriculum.

Effects of age and various environmental conditions were investigated. Experiments had a similar design: subjects were given a task and made aware that a child was alone in an adjoining room. The experimenter then left the room and subjects heard the child's distress sounds; sobbing and/or calls for help. In one study involving elementary school children, age and number of children in the group were the variables examined. A curvilinear relationship was found between helping behavior and age. Helping behavior increased from K to grade 2, but decreased from grade 2 to 6; sixth graders helping about as much as kindergarteners. Up to second grade, pairs of children tended to  help more than individual children. In other experiments, 7th graders were given varied information about the permissibility of entering an adjoining room from which distress sounds would subsequently be heard. Children who received permission helped significantly more often than others. This finding suggests that society may overemphasize obedience. An experiment on learning helping behavior used kindergarten subjects to test variables of role playing, induction, and sex. The findings suggest that training in role playing may help children to learn prosocial helping behavior. (NH)",

The EIP classroom emphasizes both warm, personal attention from the teacher and carefully structured, concrete environments that invite exploration, language, and thought. Development of self control and intrinsic reinforcement through intellectual competence are classroom goals. A punishment is avoided except in cases of personal or property damage, and even then only consists of 3 to 5 minutes of isolation. Since teaching in an EIP classroom requires certain specialized skills, EIP teachers are trained in behavior analysis (through use of the Coping Analysis Schedule for Educational Settings)  and reinforcement procedures. Initial program data (obtained through observations of behavior) show gains in socialization and readiness for academic instruction. Gains in intelligence have been noted for children who have been exposed to EIP programming for three years. Investigations will continue to assess the stability of behavioral changes. (MH)",

The theoretical model proposed is an expansion of the Kirk and McCarthy (1961) psycholinguistic model. The proposed model, which is diagrammed in the appendix, can be a useful research model from which research hypotheses may be generated for test. As an example of the conceptualizations concerning infant behavior that can be developed from this model, a developmental matrix is presented, along with a hypothesis  that might be derived from such a matrix. The hypothesis is limited to the input phase of infants in their first 6 months of life, but other, broader hypotheses can follow. Finally, an experimental-stimulating responsive environment is suggested both for observing infant behavior and for modifying it in cases of decelerated growth patterns. (MH)",

On each picture, two gumpgookies are presented in a semi-structured situation, each engaged in behaviors that reflect different degrees of motivation to achieve. The child being tested is asked to select the gumpgookie on each picture which is most like himself, doing what he would do. Subjects were 179 Negro, Mexican-American, and Anglo children. Parent interview data were examined and subscales were constructed to assess educational opportunities, aspirations and attitudes, physical control, rejection, guilt, and reaction to infraction. The 100 items of the test were classified depending on (1) verbal clues alone, (2) visual  clues alone, (3) both verbal and visual clues; and were also classified as either short or long and easy or hard. An item analysis indicated that certain subjects responded positionally throughout the test. Some items were eliminated because of lack of response consistency on a retest. Although positional preference problems with the version of the test used in this study have necessitated major alterations, a new version of the test has been developed which should significantly decrease the positional response set.

Fifteen male and 15 female elementary school teachers' classrooms were randomly selected for observation. Subjects were those children who had never had a male teacher before fifth grade. Tests used were the Perkins Self-Concept Q-Sort Test and the SRA Junior Inventory. Analysis of the data collected indicated that (1) male teachers had no differential effect on children's self-concept when compared to female teachers, (2) interaction between the sex of the teacher and the sex of the students on students' self-concept scores was not significant, (3) female students' self-concept scores  were significantly higher than those of male students, (4) interaction between individual teachers and children's self-concept scores was not significant, and (5) mean self-concept scores didn't vary from classroom to classroom. The claim of a need for more male teachers in the elementary classroom to enhance the male student's self-concept was not supported by the findings. The sex difference found between students' self-concepts has strong implications for innovators in elementary school curriculums and research. (MH)",

Specific questions dealt with the proper focus of research and the use of research funds in the community. This essay presents the research psychologist's views concerning the Negroes' questions about research and the public's growing disenchantment with research. It is recognized that the research enterprise itself has engendered problems, deriving from intervention-evaluation projects, basic research studies, and research \"oversell.\" Intervention research poses problems of goals, methodologies, validity of findings, replicability, and the change and confusion in the researcher's role as the program progresses. The difficulty  of explaining basic research issues to the people involved is discussed, and professionals are encouraged to resist the tendency to oversell the purposes and probable outcomes of research. Considering the context of social change in which these issues are raised, researchers are urged to be aware of their values and goals for research and to communicate these honestly to black people. In sum, negotiations between researchers and community are considered a means to acceptance in the host community and should form the basis of valid research designs. (DR)",

Motivation is analyzed in behavioral terms, and behavior principles are proposed as a powerful tool for teachers for the amelioration of behavior problems and the individualization of curriculums and experiences. Much of the research reported in this paper took place in natural environments of children and involved complex behaviors as dependent variables. Numerous investigations have shown that social reinforcement dispensed by adults functions as a positive reinforcer for many behaviors of children. Other studies indicate that token reinforcement, as part of well-designed programs,  is effective in behavior modification and in promoting academic achievement. The studies reported deal with hyperactivity, behavioral and learning disabilities, remedial programs, and parent involvement. The behavioral analysis of complex academic behaviors, such as speech pathology and reading difficulties, has also shown promising results. The paper concludes with a discussion of methodological considerations, implications for education, and the value judgments involved in behavioral research. (Author/DR)",

Each of the kindergarten classrooms from which children were selected was staffed by a teacher and teacher assistant who had received a 6-week intensive training session emphasizing language development. Instruction was largely informal, although perception, language, and concept development were emphasized. A wide variety of materials was available for self-selection by children. Each of the eight first grade classrooms was staffed by one teacher who had received no special training. Instruction  was highly structured for total group participation in a teacher dominated atmosphere. The rooms were usually void of materials that could be self-selected by students. Both groups were given the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA) at the end of 5 months of school. Analysis of variance of the data indicated that the kindergarten children scored significantly higher than the first graders on seven of the 10 subtests of the ITPA and that the discrepancy between CA and PLA was significantly less for kindergarten subjects than first grade subjects.

The evidence that transfer does occur within the learning process is strong enough to warrant this study into the generalization of science instruction. It was hypothesized that students receiving instruction in a certain science program would domonstrate competence in social studies, language arts, and fine arts equal to or greater than their competence in science. Subjects were 64 students randomly selected from grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the Oshkosh, Wisconsin Public Schools System, which uses Science - A Process Approach. The instruments used to obtain the objective measures of student competence  were the Observing Process Hierarchy and the Science Process Instrument (AAAS, 1967). Analysis of the data tended to support the hypotheses of generalized competence in social studies, language arts, and fine arts.

Four areas of concern -- human development, sociology, education, and home economics -- are combined in this interdisciplinary approach to study teenagers' school coping behavior. The reports address themselves to data gleaned from the pilot study in which 196 single-parented teenagers from Tompkins County, New York, were interviewed. The paper by Nellie Brodis explores child-rearing practices which may cause dissimilar school achievement among welfare and non-welfare children. Michael  Rogoff's paper describes in detail the measurement of academic achievement used for this IRGOP study. Rose Anne Negele attempts to identify the kinds of maternal behavior and aspirations which are essential for high academic performance in fatherless adolescent girls.

An overview of the migrant describes his economic status, family-unit philosophy, habits and living conditions, educational level, and social status. It is noted that education could help the migrant to broaden his capacities and master new skills. Existent migrant programs which provide elementary, secondary, and adult education are discussed, and emphasis tends to be on individualized instruction, English as a second language, and  oral language development. The author devotes sections of his monograph to administrative developments such as interstate cooperation and record transfers, educational testing programs, health education, parental involvement in education, teacher training, and teacher aides in migrant education. Unmet needs in the education of migrants, recommendations emerging from research in terms of general education and curricula for migrants, and specific areas for needed research are presented in concluding pages of the document.

        "description":"The focus of this report is on poverty and its relationships to certain individual characteristics as distributed across 3 regions: the Ozarks, Mississippi Delta, and Southeast Coastal Plain. After a broad description of these areas, the study looks at (1) age of household heads, (2) number of persons in households, (3) housing quality (running water), (4) sex of household head, (5) residence and poverty status, (6) age and residence, (7) occupational profile, (8) sources of income, (9) gross farm income and farm tenure, (10) education, and (11) race. Results indicate that the Mississippi Delta had the highest incidence of severe and persistent rural poverty (as defined in this report). Also, three-fourths of the poverty problems were associated with nonparticipation in the labor  force, farm laborer occupations, and operation of small subsistence farms. An extreme gap in educational achievement was revealed between the poor and nonpoor and, in general, Negroes comprised a large proportion of poverty populations. Differences in the distribution of poor persons, in their contrasting personal characteristics, and in the particular economic situation of the areas studied suggest the need for several &quot;packages&quot; of interrelated and coordinated efforts linking Federal, state, and local programs to the specific problems of the areas.

In the document, education wastage in the elementary school is divided into 3 main components: (1) nonattendance, (2) repetition of grade, and (3) withdrawal from the school cycle. Year-grade and cohort data are compared and discussed for each country involved in the study. The enrollment and loss percentages are graphically identified. The document also includes discussions of financial costs, causes for wastage, and means of combatting wastage. It is concluded that (1) a number of curricular studies are required in order to reassess the type of education given at the primary stage and (2) that a main cause for wastage is  thought to be inappropriate standards of education.

The conference was based on the idea that the relationship of Britain and the United States with developing countries is becoming increasingly important in education since developing countries must look, in part, to external aid in terms of money, teachers, overseas training places, textbooks and other educational materials, or expert help and advice. In the document, conference proceedings are grouped under the following headings: (1) donors' (Britain, the United States, and the World Bank) programs and policies of educational aid, (2) requirements of recipient countries, (3) general  conclusions about priorities and principles of educational aid, and (4) specific suggestions for future Anglo-American cooperation. Appendix I is a discussion of all reports from final plenary sessions of the conference. Among the conclusions from these sessions, it is noted that primary education in developing countries must meet the needs of rural persons by preparing them for satisfying and productive lives whether or not the recipients find wage employment. Three other appendices conclude the document. (AN)",

The context of American Indian education is identified in terms of American history, geographical location, educational development, acculturation, and assimilation. The educational responsibility assumed by the Federal Government (most recently through the Bureau of Indian Affairs), Christian missions, and public education systems is discussed. Characteristics of the Indian population in general, Indian students in particular, and teachers of Indian students are presented and compared with national norms. Several of the conclusions reached are that  (1) school achievement of American Indian children is substantially below national norms; (2) Indian completion of high school lags behind the national level; and (3) a rapid rise in numbers of Indian students participating in post-high-school educational programs may be expected as the rise in the high school completion rate continues.

Other specific objectives of the conference were (1) to review state administrative requirements and discuss methods of strengthening state responsibility; (2) to expand further the programs of interstate cooperation as they pertain to the migrant child and his family; (3) to promote more extensive interagency cooperation by familiarizing the new state coordinators with those agencies having responsibility for services to the  migrant family; and (4) to discuss practical approaches and techniques involved in the implementation of an interstate system for transfer of records.

Although not representative of the urban Indian population, they have controlled the Indian image by their community visibility and their access to communications media and have perpetuated Indian separation from major urban institutions and agencies. To promote social change and economic improvement, Indian leaders will have to learn to work within predominantly non-Indian  organizations, to exercise internal pressures for change, and to coordinate their activities with change agents outside the Indian community.

Data for the study were obtained from observation of the community over a 3-year period, historical records, and interviews with a 25 percent random sample of all household (N=77). Findings of the study were that the institutions (schools, churches, government, and voluntary associations) of the community were strongly influenced by newcomers who were attracted to a rural recreation environment. By attempting to recreate their familiar urban culture,  the newcomers created social dissonance between themselves and the more traditionally rural natives of the community. (TL)",

Evidences are drawn from clinically oriented anlysis of the Adolescent Adjustment Interviews and are supplemented by field data and the use of informants. Recommendations from the study deal with diminishing the  intensity of identity conflict among Cree youth through (1) encouragement to retain sufficient emotional attachment to traditional values, (2) designing school curricula to validate self-images, and (3) reducing discontinuities in the enculturation of Cree children.

Among the discussions, it is noted that the natural resources base for recreation is in a period of tremendous change resulting in a need for education in recreation. Due to urbanization, knowledge of how to use the country properly is disappearing from the American mind, and this directly affects the aims and performance in public service. In addition, there tends to be little communication with the majority of  people about problems related to recreation programs, and it is therefore recommended that initiative be taken by those in the field of recreation resources to work with school systems in devloping conservation programs and to create an awareness of the importance of the American landscape as a basis for a worthwhile American society.

The report shows the existing situation and provides a basis for evaluating the nature and extent of problems related to health-care needs. The relation of persons per physician, dentist, and various paramedical personnel in Louisiana is compared with national average for the last 2 decades. It is concluded (1) that Louisiana is in a relatively disadvantaged position with regard to availability of all levels of medically related personnel; (2) that the state has not made a great deal of progress toward achieving national norms in the last 2 decades; and (3) that medical personnel are more available to urban people than to  rural residents, making the distribution of medical and paramedical personnel in the state highly uneven.

These people were described and analyzed with respect to deviance patterns and community social structure. Particular attention was directed toward the age groups of 16 to 19, and over 30. Factors considered in the analysis were (1) demographic structure, (2) economic activity, (3) native families and socioeconomic status, (4) institutions and social control, (5) ethnic relations, and (6) deviance. The results indicated that natives with traditional values and goals experienced little strain in community living, while those who were oriented to middle-class white values experienced a frustrating  disparity between their goals and legitimate means of attaining them. Seventeen tables support the analysis, which was intended to serve as an exploratory investigation into the factors behind increased social deviance. (BD)",

It is noted that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), with its relocation program for the Indian families, has assisted 8,000 heads of families or unmarried young adults to locate in the Los Angeles area during the years between 1953 and 1968 (an annual in-migration of about 1,300 per year, including all family members). However, it is reported that perhaps one-third of these in-migrants left the Los Angeles area. Of those remaining, the age distribution reflects a relatively large number of persons between 20 and 30  years old, which is a result of the BIA vocational training and relocation programs. Variables examined in the study include area of residence, tribal affiliation, occupations and socioeconomic status, age distribution, church role, and education. (EL)",

Over 200 school children, 21 teachers, 4 principals, and a random sample of 378 heads of families were interviewed. A modified version of the &quot;Index of Status Characteristics&quot; was employed for each family, yielding socioeconomic data. The study revealed 3 distinct groups among the approximately 10,000 Indian residents in the uptown area of the city: (1) a dispersed middle-class group, who are assimilating into the general middle class; (2) a  growing stable working class; and (3) an unstable lower working class group in which most of the city's Indian population falls. A positive correlation was found between educational attainment and socioeconomic position of family and was reflected in the Indian children's school attendance and achievement. (EL)",

Its purpose is to contribute to a better understanding of the problems of Indians in this society. An overall comparison of Indian and non-Indian suicide rates indicates no difference with reference to ethnicity, but there are significant differences with respect to age and sex. Suicide rates for American Indian males are higher for men under 45 than for American white males; however, for men over 45, the whites have a much higher incidence of suicide. The document states that there is no evidence relating suicide rate to the Indian's kind of schooling, but suicide rate is related to disorganized family life, alcoholism, and loss of  friends and relatives by death. It is concluded that the high suicide rate of young Indian men should be taken as a symptom of something wrong in their society and that an improvement in the socio-educational situation of Indians would probably reduce this symptom.

In addition, 3 self-studies of educational needs and problems made by Indian communities and data from previous research studies were included. The field study was performed by research teams located in 6  universities and consisted of collecting information on students and schools by observation of the school and its relation to the community and by interviews with students, parents, teachers, and community leaders.

The two groups of miscues were compared with the following categories: (1) correction attempts, (2) cueing from the peripheral visual field, (3) dialect, (4) graphic and phonemic relationships, (5) grammatical function, (6) level of syntactic involvement, (7) syntactic and semantic proximity, and (8) syntactic and semantic acceptability. Retransformation miscues were further categorized according to changes effected on the deep and surface-level structures. A total of 1,742 miscues  were analyzed, of which 1,061 were retransformation miscues.

Given a descriptive model of the learning process, it is in some cases possible to derive optimal conditions for instruction. The technique of optimization is illustrated by considering (1) the optimal number of blocks into which a list of items should be divided (whole versus part) and (2) optimal choice of items as a function of the previous response history, which involves dropping \"learned\" items during a training sequence. The efficiency of the dropout procedure depends on list criterion  only. A learning model which serves as a plausible approximation was developed for both the above examples. The problem of relative efficiency is considered. Tables, appendixes, and references are included. (WB)",

The 7,240 first-grade pupils and 3,036 second-grade pupils who comprised the sample for this study were participants in the Cooperative Research Program in First-Grade Reading Instruction. Pre-grade-1 measures were the Murphy-Durrell Phonemes test, the Murphy-Durrell Letter Names test, and the Pintner-Cunningham Primary Intelligence Test. The Paragraph Meaning and Word Reading subtests of the Stanford Achievement Battery were  administered at the end of grades 1 and 2. In a majority of cases, significant differences were found among correlation coefficients representing predictive relationshps for pupils enrolled in different programs. The Letter Names test was the only measure which generally predicted reading ability in a similar fashion for the various programs. It was also found that each of the readiness measures was somewhat more effective in predicting reading success for pupils enrolled in code-emphasis and i/t/a programs than for pupils in basal and language-experience programs.

Compared with the Botel Test scores were scores from three cloze tests for each grade level (below grade level, at grade level, and above grade level) and the scores of the Reading Comprehension subtest of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Findings revealed relatively low correlations (.11 to .18) between the Botel and the cloze tests. The Botel and the Metropolitan tests correlated fairly high at grades 4 and 5 (.49, .21), and  showed a statistically significant difference at grade 6. No significant relationships were noted between the cloze test instructional levels and the Metropolitan Test scores.

Second, the students' backgrounds should be expanded and filled in as necessary. Third, basic  conceptual terms should be noted and clarified. And fourth, the students should be directed to read for specific purposes. The students should understand this procedure and incorporate it into their own habits of study.

        "description":"This study investigated whether a random sample of 50 elementary teachers, 10 in each of grades 2 through 6, in Topeka, Kansas, discriminated against elementary school boys--and in favor of girls--in rating of pupil reading achievement and assignment to reading groups. Teachers rated each pupil in their class on level of general reading achievement and classroom behavior. They also reported which reading group pupils were assigned to. Unknown to teachers, standardized test scores of reading comprehension from the regular schoolwide testing program were obtained from the central administrative office. Data were analyzed by comparative frequency distributions, intercorrelations, and multiple regression analysis. No sex bias was found either in assigning pupils to reading groups or  in judging pupil reading achievement. A slight behavior bias was found on both reading group placement and teacher rating of pupil reading achievement. There was no convincing evidence of systematic, large-scale teacher bias on either criterion, overall or at any grade level, contrary to hypotheses. A bibliography is included. (Author/NH)",

It is noted that the linguists offer critical observations of phonics instruction mainly because so much confusion is present in the instruction about the relationship of sound and symbol on the level of teacher awareness. The author believes certain understanding provided by linguists are absolutely necessary in implementing any choice of approach made toward the teaching of reading. He emphasizes certain points which must provide the basis for any kind of phonics or neophonics instruction and which must be recognized in any kind of meaningful research activity.

The sample involved 324 students from 16 classrooms. Students were randomly assigned to classes, and teachers to the control (minimum time, averaging 20 minutes per day) and experimental (increased time, averaging 35 minutes per day) conditions. Teacher time preferences were determined from a questionnaire. Students were pre- and posttested on science achievement using the Cooperative Sequential Tests of Educational Progress, Science, Form 4A, and an experimenter developed test on the science content taught. Pre- and posttest measures of attitudes were obtained from interviews using Lowery's  Projective Test of Attitudes. During the school year all groups gained in science achievement. Changes in attitudes toward science occurred in both directions. No differences significant at the 0.01 level were found attributable to either time allotment or teacher preference for time allotment.

An important aspect of Elementary Science Study (ESS) materials is that they have been developed and designed according to how children respond as they work with the materials. ESS has placed great emphasis on having children  work with concrete objects instead of ideas. About 60 units have been developed, with teaching guides, and are now in commercial production. Some of the units are designed to be used by an entire class at the same time. Other less structured and more open-ended units may involve only a small group and may not be taught as a series of connected lessons. Some units are definitely designed for individual or small group work. ESS has an active workshop program to acquaint personnel with ESS and assists schools in the implementation process. (BR)",

By means of placement tests, pre-testing, and highly sequenced behavioral objectives, the teacher can prescribe for each student in the class according to his needs. The program also provides for individual diagnosis of skills and abilities by the teacher. In this way the teacher spends most of his time in a 1-1 situation and lecturing to the class is held to a minimum. This program, Individually Prescribed Instruction (IPI), was initiated at the Learning, Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh in 1963 and is now in its seventh year of operation. Presently, approximately 100 schools  are participating in this program. (FL)",

This study resulted from a 1963 report which discussed the results of the New Hampshire Statewide Eighth Grade Testing Program and the observation that a significant drop in the arithmetic computation scores occurred in 1964 and 1965. A study of the data collected in 1967 involved three different phases. The results of phase one indicated that the introduction of modern mathematics is somewhat responsible for the decline in computational ability. The second phase compared the arithmetic computational ability of 1965 eighth graders with 1967 tenth  graders. The results suggested no significant differences in computational ability in grade ten between traditional, transitional, and modern groups. The third phase involved a select group of tenth graders and their abilities in algebra and geometry. The conclusions were that students who had studied either a modern or a transitional textbook did markedly superior work to those who had used only a traditional textbook. (FL)",

Randomly selected students within classes of teachers who had participated in feedback and training activities were given alternate test forms for each of five content areas. Scores on these tests served as the dependent variables with scores on Verbal Reasoning and Numerical Ability subtests of the Differential Aptitude Test, and Davis Reading Test scores serving as independent variables. Data  were also collected on school and community characteristics. Analysis of covariance and multiple regression analysis showed significant differences between classes (tentatively attributed to teacher performance), and significant correlations between reading comprehension and achievement.

There are two purposes: to teach factual information about the conditions faced by the urban poor in the inner city and to produce a more favorable attitude towards poverty. The entire homogeneous senior class in an all-boy catholic high school in Baltimore participated in the role playing. This simple one-group pretest and posttest questionnaire study was conducted as a part of a unit on poverty in eight social studies classes for four 55 minute periods. No other activities were allowed between pre and post-tests. A pretest self report item measured personal and  vicarious experience with poverty. The greatest practical and statistically significant finding was that student attitudes were more favorable after the game than before. However, no increase in factual information and a small decline in interest were measured. Attitude change was positively correlated with vicarious experience with poverty, supporting Jerry L. Fletcher (1968). (There were no measures of long-term attitude change or teacher attitudes). (SBE)",

The methodology emphasized is the inductive  problem-solving (inquiry) approach through active in-depth participation of students in problem identification and solution within their changing communities social and physical environments. This method is combined with an in-depth multidisciplinary social science study of basic human activities. Course content and logical sequence emphasize transition to provide a common element at each grade level.

A suburban junior high school and high school were involved. Within each class, students of the same sex were paired according to their ranking on a standardized test of verbal ability, then one member of each pair was assigned at random to the experimental group. Only the experimental group played the game. Both control and experimental groups answered a brief questionnaire consisting of two items intended to measure  motivation for the learning task. The students then took part in the task which required verbal recall of facts and principles. The material was presented by filmstrip in the first experiment, by textbook in the last two, and, the tests for each experiment were different.

As a preliminary, various readibility measures formulas were reviewed. Those included were: Lively and Pressey, Gray and Leary, Lorge, Flesch, Dale-Chall. Research on the application and effect on comprehension of these formulas was also reviewed. Students completed a pre-reading cloze test from one of two texts utilized. They then read the chapter from which the cloze test had been constructed, and  completed a fifty item multiple-choice test. The cloze procedure was found not to be better than the other variables in predicting comprehension levels at the .01 significance level. However, it was significant at the .05 level. To fulfill the secondary purpose, two identical texts were used, however, the readability levels were different (grade 5-6, grade 7-8). A multiple-choice test was constructed to measure knowledge acquired after reading. It was found that reducing vocabulary difficulty and sentence complexity may not significantly improve comprehension scores. (SBE)",

The hope was to contribute to the improvement of the large and growing amount of academically based curriculum work through interdisciplinary exposure. The major emphasis was on cognitive content and its structuring, including the relationship of social science concepts, structure, and theory. Secondary emphasis was on values as content in the curriculum, and tertiary emphasis on the processes of learning. Issues of morality and rationality with respect to teaching substantive values emerged. The discussion of processes included several related ideas: discovery, inductive learning, inquiry, and problem solving. The question of how the components of  social science content relate to each other and to science were points of discussion (history, geography, anthropology, Political science). The nature and utility of behavioral objectives, and the individual needs and capabilities of the child, were discussed. The great need for teacher training programs to parallel the development of new curricula was noted along with some brief sketches of projects which are working to meet these needs. (SBE)",

The conference was planned to involve all the participants in a flow of problem-solving and inquiry activities in small, three to five person, cross-project work groups. Problems of teacher attitudes, behavior, knowledge, and performance, which hamper effective materials utilization, were identified from the dual point of view of the developer and the teacher. A framework within which effective training activities might be organized was developed. This model placed the teachers problem-solving activity  at the core of the curriculum change process, to which the scientist could contribute expertise and support through collaborative effort. A variety of inservice activities and training plans along with general behavioral objectives were discussed. Finally, a mechanism for curriculum project cooperative action was suggested-the Social Science Education Consortium. (SBE)",

Specific student behaviors and responses were measured and evaluated. First, student evaluations of teachers and classes (appreciation, perceived value, and logical benefits in critical thinking) were measured. Secondly, relationships between a selected group of demographic, attitudinal and perceptual characteristics (of the teacher, the class, the students-based on attitude and congruence theory), and, these measured evaluations were explored. Directional hypotheses were set only for testing the students and teachers views of: the offered topics (controversiality, pertinence), opinion expression, and teacher role and technique. The degree of congruence was  established between individual students and teachers regarding attitude and perception. Finally, the theoretical relationship between congruence and student reactions to their classes and teachers were tested. The data for this study was based on the original probability sample described in volume 1. Findings indicated favorable student evaluation, but, perception was signigicantly influenced by the demographic, attitude, perceptual characteristics, and the degree of congruence.

The subjects were 49 elementary education majors who voluntarily enrolled in the TTT Project at Indiana University. TTT is a government-funded project established for the training of teacher trainers, and involving both classes and public school practical experience. Twenty-four behavioral objectives were established and divided into three area: attitudes, knowledge, and skills. They were then judged by several social studies educators across the nation, and submitted to a doctoral seminar in social studies. The objectives were assessed several ways: attitude-by observation and attitude inventory, knowledge-by objective tests, and  skills-by observation of student teaching. In October 1969, a semantic differential was administered, and included behavioral objectives as a concept. The findings indicated: that these objectives can be used in methods courses, if the term is used behaviorally; and, students prefer their use because they feel their goals are better defined, and, they are able to use a variety of teaching strategies.

It assessed preferences of teacher trainees and determined any change in their attitude after an intensive teacher training program. Two sets of line drawings were used, the first showing ten arrangements of classroom furniture and the second showing five face-to-face teaching arrangements, both sets ranging from a tutorial to a lecture situation. The subjects were 152 Stanford teacher interns, 35 male and 117 female, all planning to teach in secondary schools and all without teaching experience. Pre- and posttest data were obtained, with a 6-week interval for teaching instruction. The drawings were used in a paired-comparison format and students also ranked them by order  of preference. Results are set out in five tables and show a significant relationship between physical surroundings and interpersonal teaching preferences. The results also appear stable from pre- to posttest and whether viewed by the interns as prospective student or prospective teacher. Future research will be concerned with establishing personality correlates based on assessments of authoritarianism, and traditionalism as opposed to progressivism. (MBM)",

The paired-comparison technique was used, enabling frequencies to be tallied, and results were also analyzed and cross-validated. Detailed results, set out in eight tables, indicate that students recognize some teacher behaviors associated with student gain and that their opinions are stable, but  there appeared to be no significant relationship between student opinion and student gain. It is recommended that the instrument be used in teacher training, in the development of standard definitions of teacher behavior, and to indicate different teaching patterns in relation to class gain.

The three observation systems are the Teacher Practices Observation Record, whose basis is the education of students in the process of reflective thinking; the Reciprocal Category System, which measures behavior along the humanistic dimension; and the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior, founded on the view of education as the acquisition of knowledge. A research project measured attitudes toward these behavior categories in a group of 109 public school teachers and concluded that none of the attitudes were necessarily interrelated. Thus the need for several types of observation systems was  derived and an attempt was made to train teachers in the use of the three different systems and in the formulation of specific behavioral objectives. Other aspects of the program include the development of a system of peer supervision for student teachers in team teaching arrangements and the development of evaluation instruments which measure the effect of teacher behavior on student behavior.

It was revised in the spring of 1969 to incorporate results of recent research and to apply specifically to classes in high school English. Similar devices, together with articles and books on research in classroom learning were reviewed for item content and construct validity. Wording was simplfied: each specification was limited, where practicable, to a single concept; and classifications were clarified, resulting in an increase from 28 to 34 specifications. The type of response was changed from frequency-of-occurrence to degree-of-occurrence to degree-of-agreement and the list tested in 16 classes Alpha coefficients were  obtained for section scores as well as for total scores, and correlational data suggested that both scores were useful. The construct validity was investigated through factor analysis and revealed the check-list to be a multi-dimensional instrument. It was concluded that (1) reliability of response was higher on observable than on inferred behavior, (2) items not understood should be given a neutral score, and (3) factor analytic results did not contribute to interpreting responses.

        "description":"This study reports relationships found between FIRO-B (Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation) scores and preference for classroom spatial settings. It was hypothesized that differences in interpersonal needs would be reflected in preferences for particular physical environments in which to teach. The sample consisted of 276 graduates and undergraduates enrolled in courses in the Syracuse University School of Education. The majority of the graduates had had experience as teachers. The FIRO-B and a questionnaire designed for the study were administered to determine preferred classroom settings. Chi square values determined significance of relationships. Results indicate a definite relationship between interpersonal needs scores and classroom preferences. As predicted,  persons with high control needs opted for a structured situation with the teacher in a position of control. Low control individuals selected settings in which the teacher's control position was less obvious. This relation between interpersonal needs of teachers and the classroom environment has implications for teacher and student grouping. Further research is needed to determine the importance of these findings for learning. (Author/RT)",

Emphasizing the need for students to translate cognitive learning into performance at the time each concept is first acquired, the model incorporates such innovative modes of instruction as the specification of performance objectives, mediation of content, student interaction with instructional material, remedial loops to encourage mastery, feedback systems on student performance, and a more effective motivational system. Central to the operation of the model are: the Learning Center (an instructional laboratory which houses mediated instructional units based on the content of foundation courses) and the Auto-tutorial Audiovisual  Laboratory (which provides students with skills for operating six to ten instructional machines and establishes performance criteria which must be met before the student begins instruction in the Learning Center). Other components include the controlled teaching laboratory (which permits students to bring each concept learned to a performance level through microteaching techniques); field experience (which may begin after three basic units of instruction and involves such activities as tutoring and serving as teacher aide); tutorial and small group seminars; and student teaching. Flow charts recording student progress and level of achievement and the results of a post-course measure of student attitudes toward 32 elements of the program are included with the document. (JES)",

The first group received discrimination training, practice, and feedback (DPF); the second group received discrimination training and practice (DP); and the third group received practice and feedback (PF). A comparison of pre- and posttest scores on several behavior rating scales showed consistent and significant improvement of the DPF and DP groups as compared with slight  improvement in the PF group.

This study investigated whether or not these behaviors would persist into later student teaching. Each of 50 secondary student teachers, who were divided into control and experimental groups, was observed twice during his student teaching--early and late--by trained observers using the OScAR 5V. Each student also took a semantic differential test twice to indicate his attitudes toward his education, teaching, and pupils. Analysis of observation results showed that the two groups differed significantly in only one of the 18 behaviors measured by OScAR 5V--non-TL students made more directing/rejecting  utterances. Behaviors assumed to have been acquired during the TL may not have persisted owing to intervening course work, differences between the TL and schools, attrition, low observer reliability, and confusion about coding. Attitude differences, however, were significantly different, suggesting that the reality-based experiences of the TL may have induced attitudes in TL students similar to those of beginning teachers. Future research should investigate whether reinforcement of desired behaviors in the interim between the TL and student teaching would affect persistence. (LP)",

During listening sessions, conducted during a teacher inservice program, subjects were asked to listen to the speaker for a few seconds and then complete one set of 22 semantic differential scales on each language sample. Data were subjected to three analyses appropriate to the three dimensions of the study--factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, and analysis of variance. Results indicated that two factors similar to the &quot;confidence-eagerness&quot; and &quot;ethnicity-nonstandardness&quot; factors observed by Williams were found, although  enough differences were found in the detailed composition of factors to suspect any definiate theoretical model based upon the two factors. Even though the two factor model was not really definitive, similarities among evaluations by Northern and Southern teachers were striking. Partial and multiple correlations of linguistic cues indicated that even after very short exposure to a child's speech, teacher judgments tended to classify a child as being &quot;culturally disadvantaged&quot; if his verbal and grammatical patterns were not standard (particularly if his speech exhibited irregularities in grammar, silent pausing, and pronunciation). This stereotype was extended by the fact that such associations were also significantly related to child race. Such predictions, based on absolute ratings of  both Northern and Southern teachers, were consistent across geographic boundaries. (Author/JES)",

Both of these programs trained students in teams, and the Ford Program placed the teams intact into inner-city schools for their teaching experience. When program graduates' scores on tests designed to measure desire for autonomy and sense of power were compared with scores of graduates of traditional programs in Chicago and Milwaukee, no significant difference was  found. However, when both groups were divided into teachers in black inner-city schools, white inner-city schools, and white suburban schools, there was a significant difference in scores, with the black inner-city school teachers' being the lowest. These results seem to indicate that special teacher training programs in themselves are not enough and that resistence to change from other school personnel may be a factor. (RT)",

A 20 percent stratified random sample of the 402 students was designated the experimental group, with the rest serving as controls. Teachers were told that experimental group members showed unusual promise for classroom leadership, and then after 10 weeks all classrooms were evaluated again. Differences in pre- and posttest scores on tests of social acceptance were found, and the differences in gain scores between the experimental and control groups were tested for significance. It was concluded that teacher expectancy, as developed in this study, did not effect changes in the peer acceptance of experimental group  members in either social or academic situations. It is suggested that further research be done in this field using more sensitive tests for measuring social position, letting a longer time elapse between pre- and posttests, and using methods to insure teacher credulity of experimentally designated expectations.

This hypothesis is derived from two paradoxical assumptions: (1) that internal children perceive more readily the connection between their actions and teacher reinforcement behavior and thus learn more and (2) that external children, lacking self-confidence, are more sensitive to teacher reinforcement behavior, and thus learn more than internal children. However, when 910 sixth-grade students were divided into these two categories by means of the Internal-External  Control Scale and pre- and posttested on the Metropolitan Achievement Test Battery, no significant difference was found between the change scores of internal and external children for the same degree of teacher reinforcement behavior. It was found, however, that for the entire group, a greater degree of teacher reinforcement behavior resulted in increased student learning.

The class was treated as a whole and decisions to change from one condition to another were based on the group mean. The study was divided into two phases. In phase 1 a reversal design was employed. After a baseline period with no tokens, tokens were introduced, then removed, and then reintroduced. Results showed an increase in work behavior for the class as a whole during both token periods as compared with baseline and reversal periods. However, under these conditions several distinct individual response patterns to tokens occurred. In phase 2 check marks were substituted for tokens.  Work behavior was maintained for all subjects. The study demonstrates that tokens can be effectively employed to increase work behavior in a preschool classroom and that individual children respond differently to institution and removal of tokens. Owing to the various individual response patterns that occurred under the token system, this study suggests new experimental strategies for applying token systems in classrooms.

Statistical analysis of data from two self-concept tests administered at the end of the year indicated that male teachers had no differential effect on children's self-concept scores when compared to female teachers and that there was no significant interaction between sex of the teacher and the sex of the students on children's self-concept scores. Related findings indicated that:  the female students had a significantly better self-concept than male students; there was no significant interaction effect between individual teachers and self-concept scores of children; and the mean self-concept scores did not differ significantly between classrooms. The lack of a significant relationship between male teachers and male students' self-concepts could be due to the short time spent with a male teacher as compared with five previous years with female teachers. The generally lower self-concept scores for boys and their possibly lower level of aspiration indicate a need for teachers to devise individualized curricula more appropriate for boys. (RT)",

Subjects of the study were 20 student teachers assigned to fifth-grade classes in public schools, who were pretested for similar questioning behavior. The 10 students in the experimental group participated in seminars on purposes and use of different cognitive levels of questions. All student teachers taught a 4-day unit on the same substantive material. Each day, their questions were recorded by observers using a specially developed observation schedule. Following the unit, pupil achievement was assessed by a specially  prepared test. Analysis of data revealed that the trained student teachers asked a significantly greater number of higher level cognitive questions than those not specially trained. Pupil achievement in the two groups was not significantly different. This could be attributed to the limited time that students were exposed to higher level questions and to the probability that student teachers have little \"power\" to influence pupils in their responses.

Statistical analysis of the relationship between conceptual system and teaching style yielded no significant differences using Schroder's Paragraph Completion Test. With Harvey's Conceptual Systems Test significant differences were found. As the abstractness of the teacher's conceptual structure increased, a  reflective teaching style, characterized by more sanctioning of search behavior, more handling of information by helping students theorize and express themselves, and less questioning for precise answers and sanctioning attainment, was used more often. Research results indicate that if a reflective teaching style is desired by educators, then teacher trainees whose conceptual systems are at lower stages of development must either be taught to use a reflective teaching style or be helped to develop a more abstract conceptual structure.

A variety of tests are being used to measure different aspects of  teacher behavior and student behavior. In addition, each teacher, working in cooperation with other school personnel, has selected a few children for intensive, year-long study and experimental instruction. In a continuing cycle, the teacher tailors her treatment of the child to his specific situation, observes whether the tactic works or not, then discusses it with consultants and revises it.

        "description":"This pilot study was designed to help teachers become more aware of their own behavior and its effect on the emotions and attitudes of their students. An inservice program was offered to 22 teachers, affecting approximately 540 children in eight elementary schools in Albany, New York. It was hypothesized that the impact of human relations training techniques--sensitivity training, feedback of classroom interactions, a combination of these two, and a series of lectures on new media to enhance student motivation--should show a trend toward a positive effect on pupil anxiety, peer relationships, self-concept, and attitudes toward school, as measured by pre- and posttests of anxiety and compulsivity, and observations of classroom operations. No significant changes or trends were  noted. However, teacher assessments of the results of their experiences indicated some attempts to move in positive directions as defined by the study. Further research in this field is suggested, with more time spent on training and special attention given to the selection of measurement instruments. (Author/RT)",

Wednesday classes taught by the institute director met in various elementary schools in the afternoon. The emphasis was on methods which help migrant children succeed in school. On Saturdays a speaker made a presentation, followed by discussion groups led by graduate students, and later in the afternoon, a question and answer period with the morning speaker was held. Each participant made two home visits and carried on a project with migrant children. At the conclusion of the institute each participant was asked to evaluate the program by rating 20 different aspects on a 5-point  scale. The median rating for each of the 20 items was either four or five.

The classroom concepts judged were: planning, textbooks, ideas, facts, homework, lecture, discussion, and story telling. The instruments were administered to randomly selected subjects: 37 elementary student teachers, 29 secondary student teachers, and 60 supervising teachers (18 elementary and 42 secondary). Factor analysis of data from the three groups indicated that the secondary  student teachers had the least diversified view of the school setting and the supervising teachers had the most diversified view. Discriminating analysis of factor scores from the previous analysis showed that the elementary student teachers' attitudes were similar to those of the supervising teachers, with the secondary student teachers being different from both other groups. It is recommended on the basis of this study, that prospective student teachers, particularly secondary, be informed that their attitudes will probably differ from those of the supervising teacher.

When demographic characteristics of the 386 returns were compared with total AERA membership, the sample appeared to be representative. Analysis of the returns indicates that there is a considerable amount of activist orientation toward social, political and educational issues, and that many members of the organization mistakenly believe that such activism is not widespread in AERA. Activism, futhermore, is somewhat greater for higher-status members of AERA, i.e., those who  head research projects and write a good deal. AERA members also tend to have a positive attitude toward educational research and its relation to political and social problems. Also, a majority of members in the sample indicate a willingness to volunteer research skills for the use of community groups, even if such groups were challenging the public schools. Action suggestions include an annual AERA prize for the best research effort devoted to the solution of a pressing social problem and AERA encouragement of members' volunteering their research skills to community groups.

In 708 undergraduate classes at Kansas State University, students rated their progress in gaining factual knowledge, learning fundamental principles, applying principles to practical problems, understanding themselves, learning professional attitudes and behavior, developing skill in communication, discovering implications of the course for personal and professional conduct, and developing greater cultural understanding and appreciation. Fifty-eight items were used to evaluate teacher behavior and effectiveness, and chi-square analyses were performed on each  item to determine significant differences between small, medium, and large classes. The findings indicated that at least 16 items appeared to be required in effective teaching, although they differed according to the size of class and type of objective. Broader application of this method of teacher evaluation is recommended by making the materials and computer programs available to other institutions. The results of the experiment are fully set out and discussed and appendixes give tables of norms and item analysis, as well as samples of the Faculty Information Form, test instrument, and the computer report to faculty members.

Some reading materials were developed by the laboratory staff, but the primary emphasis was on learning through experience. Arrangements were made for the trainees to observe the behavior and responses of children from infancy through age six, and microteaching demonstrations were critiques to identify principles of learning and concommitant adult responsibility for systematized organization and methods of teaching. Teachers criticized their own performance as a model of self-analysis for the trainees. Practice  in the use of art media, playing games, and story telling was informal. Statements by aides at the end of the program indicated that they felt they had developed a sense of self-confidence and had learned to communicate with children. They also felt they had developed better relationships with their own children as a result of the program. [Not available in hardcopy due to marginal legibility of original document.] (RT)",

Educational models, systems analysis, and learning systems are explained in some detail, with emphasis on the development from symbolic analogy through mechanical, biological, cybernetic, and economic models. A good model is defined as complete, reflecting the real situation under review, understandable, and encouraging feedback which will influence and improve the system. Attention is drawn to some of the constraints on systems planning, including time limitations, lack of adequate data, too narrow a concept of the subject matter, failure in communication with universities, education industry, and organizations, and lack of understanding of related  systems. Additional constraints which apply particularly to teacher education are certification requirements, personnel policies, the personality of the school administrator, parental attitudes, and the innate conservatism of the teaching profession. Six steps are listed describing the development of the model--conceptualizing the system, defining subsystems, stating objectives, developing alternative procedures, selecting the best alternatives, and implementing the system. A final warning is given that, while models should not be regarded as prescriptions to be automatically adopted, they provide a challenge and a tool for a necessary understanding of the whole system of teacher education.

The Recommended Standards (see SP 003 720) of the AACTE indicate that such studies are necessary for meaningful evaluation. The literature search, principally through ERIC and \"Psychological Abstracts,\" produced some 200 references. There appear to be no large-scale studies of the extent to which graduates acquired the characteristics intended by the program, but this may be remedied by the USOE-sponsored Elementary Teacher Education Programs. The University of Missouri published a report in 1967 devoted largely to evaluation, but this gave no evidence that graduates reflected the objective  criteria of the program in their teaching. An experimental program by Sandefur et al (1967) showed significant behavioral differences, while a similar study by Corle (1967) of inservice training by means of a 15-week ETV program showed little significant difference between the experimental and control groups. No studies could be found evaluating the teacher preparation program against pupil achievement. The question of whether we have the means and techniques to evaluate teacher preparation programs needs to be answered, and the parameters of teacher effectiveness must be defined, possibly by means of numerous small studies which would increase the fund of information needed for a major survey.

It attempts to discover if the use of IFT helped student teachers control the flexibility of their teaching styles, whether they could employ a variety of teaching models, and whether the conceptual ability of the teacher affected his flexibility. Two hypotheses were formulated: (1) that IFT will give teachers greater controlled flexibility and (2) that student teachers with a high conceptual level will have greater controlled flexibility than those with a lower conceptual level. The study used 54 teachers in experimental and control groups, with conceptual levels determined by a Sentence Completion Test. Both groups taught a Controlled Flexibility Lesson  near the beginning and end of their assignments, with the experimental group receiving IFT in the interval. Measurement of the initial styles showed no significant differences, and the final analysis showed that the experimental group did not differ significantly from the control group in controlled flexibility. All subjects in both groups were at the lower end of the concreteness-abstractedness spectrum, preventing a true test of the second hypothesis. The implication of the study is that IFT may be useful in helping prospective teachers learn more abstract teaching strategies, but further research is needed. (MBM)",

The achievement of this ideal requires the active involvement of the whole teaching profession, with elementary school programs exploring the differing styles of family and community life in several nations, continuing in greater depth in secondary schools with the study of the literature, music, art, and science of many cultures, while universities and teacher training institutions would encourage  greater personal involvement through foreign travel and study, and the use of overseas visitors to broaden students' outlook. At present these goals are largely unrealized, although UNESCO is an agency through which they could be reached. The possibilities for constructive action range from the simple but effective use of possibilities for constructive action pictures, tapes, and film strips to the establishment of research centers in universities which could provide in-depth information resources. This revitalization, turning education from its present preoccupation with the past to a growing concern for the future would not only create a better international community but would add to the exitement and enjoyment which are the bases of all true learning.

(The second part of the New School report appears in Vol. III, SP 003 902.) Topics presented at the Greystone conference included: the differences between mass schooling and mass education; the failure of schools to socialize children of minority groups, and classroom research methodology. The second conference consisted of short, controversial papers followed by discussion. The participants discussed education in its widest social context,  linking the crisis in American education to questions of societal instability. Discussion fell into four general topics: a critical view of American education; the art and science of teaching; education and social change; and the philosophy of modern education.

Teachers cited eight distinct student problem areas, including feelings of social inadequacy, natural shyness and reluctance to speak, poor vocabularies, and monotonal and mumbled delivery, all of which were aggravated by irregular attendance patterns. Seven major approaches were mentioned by teachers as effective solutions, such as encouraging Indian students to \"warm up\" with group speech activities before individual presentations and developing in students a greater knowledge and self-respect for Indian heritage.  Concerning their own classroom effectiveness, teachers pointed to the need for special training in various areas of speech instruction and recommended that a clearinghouse be set up as a source of information exchange.

Since drama is conflict and living language is action, the process of making a play is as important as the play. Thus, drama creation within a small group provides the basis for eventual development toward individual dramatic involvement in writing and in major dramatic roles. Subject matter should be related to the student's development, with first year drama exploring fantasy and nonrealistic events, and second year drama moving more toward realism. In the third year, the drama should be related to the student's emotional growth by his working in original open-ended incidents,  sketches, old theater styles, symbolic drama, or experimental approaches using tape-recordings, chants and choruses, masks, paintings, basic movement and spectacular lighting effects. The fourth year drama activity may focus on current events and contemporary problems, and original work should be supported by material from all genres of literature, especially extracts from modern plays.

The English teacher's main concern in language study is to impart to students the effective use of language (i.e., speaking, \"auding,\" reading, and writing). Improving language performance in writing may be seen in terms of three processes: instruction, including demonstration; exercise; and realistic practice. The third process is crucial for maintaining, in both student and teacher, the awareness that skill in sentence construction--not an end in itself--is relevant only when its application points beyond the language lesson. Although linguistics has  little direct application to literature study, the teacher can perhaps employ knowledge of language in order to develop and refine the effect of a piece of literature on his students. In general, educators should concentrate on language in relation to other aspects of human behavior and should, even in teacher education, avoid the teaching of massive linguistic theory just because it's there.

In the distributed practice, two sets of three words each were presented once every other day over a period of 6 days. The drill on six other sets of words was massed so that all practice for that set occurred on the same day. The probability of a correct response for words in the massed condition proved higher than that for the distributed condition during the learning sessions, but on retention tests (given 10 and 20 days later) the words learned under distributed practice were better remembered. Thus, massed repetitions appear to be better on short term performance, but more learning occurs in the long run when  repetitions of an item are well distributed.

To achieve a comprehensive curriculum design that brings the personal demands of students into greater congruence with the needs of society, the reform of supervisory education must include proficiency in three areas of knowledge: the technical skills of macro- and micro-curriculum design, the theory and practice of implementation of change in human organization, and the substance and techniques of systems  analysis. Organization development--the fusion of these three areas on a practical problem--is needed on several fronts.

Additionally, the diagnostic function of spelling scales was considered through the use of specific error categories in test construction. Five 50-item forms (each item containing from zero to four misspellings and representing a particular well-defined error category) were constructed and administered to 335 high school seniors, along with a standard battery of verbal tests. Although the machine-scorable tests raise their own difficulties--they may depend more on the student's proofreading ability than on his  spelling proficiency and may, in the course of testing, teach the student misspelled words and so impair his spelling ability--the experimental tests were found to function as well as the standard spelling test. The 12 separate error categories did not function as independently as was hoped; the need for further experimentation with four \"super\" categories (addition, omission, inversion, and substitution) was indicated. (Twenty sample test items, tables of test results, and a list of references are included.) (Author/MF)",

Teachers must present the sound, simple reasons for using the valid \"correct\" forms and for \"maintaining what is left of the traditional clarity, brevity, precision, and force of the English language.\" They must point out that language is an instrument of perception as well as expression, for a poorly  expressed idea is a poorly understood one. What is essential is to arouse an emotional concern for clarity and precision. If teachers fail to establish in students this understanding of and respect for skill in language usage, the students will be lured into extreme positions of opposing unreason with unreason rather than with rational thought, positions which can ultimately damage our contemporary civilization.

They should maintain a balance and simplicity that meets their pedagogical responsibilities of liberating minds and not allow or encourage students to egotistically ignore works which strike them as \"irrelevant.\" Above all, teachers must encourage their students to uncover the questions inherent in literature, to raise their own questions (particularly through writing), and to lead a self-examined  life.

English teachers face a sensitive situation in trying to correct grammar without implying that a student is inferior because his dialect is wrong. The motivation for uninhibited self expression may be provided by contributions to a weekly journal for which each student contributes anything--cribbed poetry, doodles, original writing, math assignments--which is not graded or corrected. Each week, superior items may then be put on the overhead projector, with the responsible student reading and the class commenting. Important  factors to be remembered in reading the journal entries are that (1) the richness of black dialect, alone or in conjunction with standard English, is a valid means of expression; (2) black students like and should be encouraged to express black thoughts; and (3) excellent writing may be produced. The self-discovery and confidence which can result from such expression are valuable achievements. (Sample student writings are provided.) (JM)",

The teaching process was defined by three major variables--the teacher's image of what teaching ought to be, his planning techniques, and his behaviors in teaching the lesson he had planned. To analyze the variables and their interrelationships, 20 Illinois MATE graduates from three institutions were asked to complete a 96-item questionnaire, develop a lesson plan for teaching a poem, and tape-record their teaching of the poem to a class. Although no significant differences appeared in the teaching processes of the graduates, the sample obtained for the study was too small to determine whether  significant differences actually did exist. The study is, however, suggestive of enough differences and patterns that further research is warranted. (Author/LH)",

Subjects were 50 students from a New York City suburban junior high school, 32 of whom were classified as successful, 18 as unsuccessful. The results of four Sensory Quotient Tests--visual, passive tactile, auditory, and active tactile--were (1) that the successful English students performed significantly better on the visual test, (2) that the unsuccessful students scored higher only on the auditory test, although the difference was not  statistically significant, and (3) that the total score of the four tests of the successful students was significantly different from the total score of the unsuccessful students. Also notable was the tendency of both groups to excel in the two tactile modes rather than the visual or auditory, giving some support to McLuhan's thesis that we are moving from a visual, linear culture toward a multi-media one.

Six intermediate and advanced English classes (141 eleventh grade students in all) were divided randomly into nine treatment groups. Two cooperating teachers assigned an argumentative essay, due in 4 days, which then received one of nine comment treatments--composed by the experimenter--but no letter grade. Students were allowed 5 minutes to read these comments before the essays were collected and questionnaires were distributed to be filled out at leisure.  Results showed that (1) the number of comments produced little effect; (2) purely negative comments produced lower scores in reinforcement, satisfaction, and confidence than completely positive comments produced; and (3) a mixture of criticism and praise, with praise dominating, produced the most satisfied and confident writers.

The poet is the speaker &quot;of&quot; the poem, the persona the speaker &quot;in&quot; the poem. The communicative circle is complete when it includes the reader who combines an analysis of the text (the words of the persona) with an analysis of the context (the message of the poet). The poet's strategy is to control the sympathies of his audience (as seen in Browning's &quot;My Last Duchess&quot; and Dickinson's &quot;I Heard a Fly Buzz When I Died&quot;), white the audience participates in a kind of dialectic by its search for the poet through his literary strategies. Unlike literary criticism, which attempts to determine the poem's value and what it should mean, literary interpretation is the process by which the reader  finds out what the poem actually means to him. Rhetoric, then, allows one to describe the activity of interpretation, for in interpreting a poem the reader must play all roles in the dialectic, performing both the explorations of the reader and the words of the poet.

However, it is his pride that eventually brings him down. When he convinces himself that he can create the future by predicting it and, later, when he vows to keep the &quot;Pearl of the World,&quot; he defies the whole structure of the secular authority as well as the gods themselves. Although Steinbeck is on the side of the rebel, he  seems to be saying that Kino has ignored the &quot;life giving relationship between tradition and the individual talent&quot; and must pay for this affront with his most precious possession, the life of his infant son.

As Americans espoused their disciplined curriculum, and Englishmen, having discarded that philosophy, promoted the former American position of anti-establishment progressive education, it became clear that the two sides were not debating with each other so much as with their own pasts. The group's final statement, although articulating the agreement reached on two minor issues--the evils of ability grouping  and the overemphasis on examination--was generalized and evasive. It failed to reflect the real worth of the Conference, which lay in personal participant discovery of previously unexamined social assumptions forming the foundation of educational theory and practice. The recognition of a need to work together in combining the best of discipline and creativity could lead to a more fruitful second meeting and, perhaps, to more effective English teaching on both sides of the Atlantic.

        "description":"Educational systems are changing rapidly all over the world. The practice of developed countries borrowing educational practices from other developed countries is as widespread as that of underdeveloped nations borrowing from developed countries in the creation of education systems. The primary trends of educational reform in post-World War II Europe are examined for their philosophical, political, sociological, and economic antecedents and ramifications. This structural analysis provides a model of functions and dysfunctions of certain educational features. Of special interest is the channeling of students, early in their careers, into academic, vocational, or technical paths, and the effect of this process on the perservation of a traditional class structure. Appendixes present  summaries of case studies from England, France, and Sweden on the topics of educational policy, structural reorganization in education, and curricular reform. (RA)",

Kindergarten, manual training, vocational education, evening schools, and citizenship education represented answers to problems arising from industrialism and urbanism. Educators and social reformers looked to the schools for the preservation of established moral and social values, but the schools could not reshape the urban environment. As a result, the problems of city life remained. Massachusetts schools turned from effecting broad social reforms to preparing children to fulfill economic functions; vocational education replaced manual training as preparation for the real world.

To determine the sensitivity of behavior rate of planning remedial action, 97 children (mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, regular, learning disabled, and brain damaged) were rated on five behaviors (tapping, walking, reading, answering, and counting). The results indicate that behavior rates from all categories overlapped, rates of regular children were significantly faster than the retarded but no different from the other categories, and there were no significant differences between the four exceptionalities. Conclusions are that there may have been too varied collection procedures, the behaviors rated were not sensitive to  the differences in the children, or the children may have been mislabeled. In the future labels must become much more individualized. (JM)",

Those signs judged very good or excellent in clarity and appearance were retained and selected ones taught by closed circuit television to Gallaudet students. Entering preparatory students recognized the English equivalent of about 66% of 92 new signs upon initial presentation. Seven months later they recognized about 75%. Upperclassmen were taught signs for specific subject matter in 12 areas and recognized about 80% initially. It was suggested that their higher rate of recognition resulted from increased familiarity with sign language and with the subject content. A listing is provided of the terms developed.

Films were placed in 12 classes. Method of presentation and time spent was determined by individual teachers, most of whom had attended a three-day orientation workshop. Group I, consisting of 38 children (median age 8.6) worked with the projectors and language films similar to but not a part of the experimental films for one year. Group II (43 children, median age 7.6) used the experimental films for one year. Group III (29 children, median age 6.6) used both groups of films during two years. To determine progress in speechreading ability, the Illinois Communication Scale (Form B) was administered  to each class before and after each year. Group III showed a 50% improvement in speech reading ability over the two years. Group I improved 21.74% while Group II showed 12.00% improvement. Reasons suggested for this are differences in intelligence, previous education, and age, and greater similarity than had been thought between the experimental and non-experimental films. The major criticism related to content (unrelated noun vocabulary). Appendixes include the Illinois Communication Scale and the Evaluation questionnaire. (KW)",

It was found that the lower economic group, which has the highest incidence of disability (17% as compared to 5% in upper economic households), has the least knowledge of how and where to seek help, and has more negative attitudes toward caring for the disabled. Among the general public, a much larger percentage of those in the lower economic group than in the upper and middle groups favors institutionalization of the handicapped rather than at-home care, and a much lower percentage favors having the handicapped work side by side with the non-handicapped. More of the handicapped have received medical services  than have received vocational training. Results also showed the need for providing doctors with more information on how to steer patients toward rehabilitation.

Intensive language stimulation training was the focal point. Described are means used to make the environment more stimulating, better structure daily routine, and motivate staff. Initial language stimulation and articulation  training is outlined, including modifications made as the program progressed. Aspects of reading training and instruction are summarized. Findings thus far show improvement in articulation, greater expressive use of language, more extensive receptive language, significant increase in intellectual ability, and ability to read and enjoy simple books.

Results showed that prompting caused superior performance in the first situation, demonstrating that guided learning mitigates the interference caused by associating categories rather than stimulus response items. Other variables examined included interspersed non-reinforced test trials in the trial-and-error situation, and the order of presentation of the two lists. Related to the design of instructional materials, results  suggest that, in the preparation of programed workbooks or similar items for the mantally handicapped, prompting would be an effective means of introducing new concepts for association with already familiar items.

Nonfluencies were counted in eight categories: the sounds, \"ah,\"\"um,\" or \"uh;\" correction; sentence incompletion; repetition; stutter; intruding incoherent sound; tongue slip; and omission. Performance in six treatment groups ranged from a low of 10.4 nonfluencies when there was videotape recording, teacher comment, and playback to a high of 37.1 nonfluencies when there was no videotape recording, no comment, and no playback. Since videotape playback without teacher comment resulted in almost double the nonfluencies (21.3) of those resulting from videotape playback with teacher comment, the conclusion was  reached that a positive interaction between the two practices is to be desired. It is interesting that the mere presence of a television camera and recorder reduced student anxiety somewhat, perhaps, because of a \"Hawthorne\" effect. (MF)",

Finally, empirical studies of training and development outcomes are reviewed; most of these studies are concentrated in three areas: laboratory education, programed instruction, and training the disadvantaged. Research in these three areas has borne fruit, but they are bright spots in  an otherwise dismal picture. For example, although management development is a huge enterprise, we know next to nothing about its behavioral effects.

The major elements of this scheduling procedure are: (1) a model of student learning that relates student time allocations to expected achievement, (2) an objective function and optimization procedure, and (3) a procedure for forecasting each student's learning characteristics. The most statistically reliable learning model was the familiar learning curve or logistic function. A objective function for the scheduling procedure was formulated by systematically  reviewing alternative ways of mathematically combining expected test results. The problem of assigning console time was shown to be a non-linear programing problem. Several efforts to find off-line predictors of on-line student learning were unsuccessful; but an on-line selection aid was designed and evaluated.

The first study, using two different sections of the same course taught by the same instructor, tried to determine how often students spontaneously admit confusion and ask the instructor for clarification. The results indicated that the students rarely did so, fearful of appearing stupid in front of the class. There also seemed to be little relationship between amount or type of participation and student achievement. It was hypothesized that if students could admit their confusion anonymously, these admissions would permit an instructor to make his presentation to the class more effectively. To examine the effect of such a system,  four additional studies were conducted, each of which examined another use or aspect of the Anonymous Feedback System, an electronic student response system. Though students at times profited from the system, no general statement could be made concerning either the benefits or negative effects of the system. (AF)",

        "description":"Part I of this report presents a survey of grading practices used by higher education institutions in New York. After reviewing current bulletins or catalogues of all the institutions, questionnaires were mailed to 226 requesting information on prior grading practices and on any recent changes in these practices. Results, based on an 80% response, are given of the basic grading practices and the use of the pass/fail grading options for (1) public, private, seminary, and parochial programs; (2) undergraduate 2 - and 4 - year programs; and (3) graduate and professional programs. In the first 2 categories, the overwhelming majority used grading systems with 5 points or more. The majority of graduate programs used a system of 4 points or less, while the majority of the professional  programs used grading systems of 5 points or more. Part II presents a bibliography of articles relating to grading practices. Part III presents a case study of attitudes toward 3-point and 5-point grading at Richmond College. The results of a questionnaire distributed to undergraduates, graduates, and faculty indicated a general preference for the 3-point grading system, with strongest support coming from graduate students. Participating institutions, the surveys and questionnaires are included in the appendix. (AF)",

Chapter I summarizes the contribution of private institutions, and describes their current financial position and problems. Chapter 2 makes projections of probable trends in institutional revenues and expenditures and concludes that possible deficits for private institutions could reach $140 million by 1980-81. Chapter 3 explains why existing external sources of revenue will not be able to satisfy future  financial demands and describes what steps the institutions might be forced to take and how these steps could weaken higher education in the state. The study recommends that the state provide direct financial support to its private institutions in the form of grants based on the number of degress awarded to Massachusetts residents; and increase the funding of the General Scholarship Program well above the level now planned.

The Bank aims to reduce demands by middle-income parents that expenditures on their children's higher education be made tax deductible, and the disparities in opportunity between rich and poor states.

Findings were used from several sources, especially the \"Questionnaire on Student and College Characteristics\" (QSCC), as a basis for identifying the similarities and differences of a sample group of 249 black students at 83 traditionally white institutions and a matched group of white students, and they were related to other research evidence. Findings indicated that there were more similarities than would have been predictable. Black and white students were involved equally in over half of 25 extracurricular activities; they rated 8 possible goals in attending college similarly,  with slightly fewer than half of both groups ranking the intellectual-academic goal first; and both groups perceived the general features of the college environment in the same way, though the \"racial\" environment was viewed quite differently. Black and white students differed in background characteristics; black students came from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and consequently had to rely on scholarship or part-time work as sources of financial support. A higher proportion of black students (82% vs. 74% of the white students) planned to attend graduate or professional school. (AF)",

This paper examines the evolution of the concept and discusses 29 court cases, beginning with a case heard in a Maine court in 1847. The evidence indicates that the future of the concept is unpredictable. Procedural due process is becoming more popular, but the reasons are becoming more diverse; reasonableness itself is no longer sufficient cause, but due process has taken on other meanings -- e.g., &quot;fair play,&quot;&quot;arbitrary,&quot;&quot;shock the conscience,&quot;&quot;freedom of speech,&quot; etc. Recent evidence from court cases shows that, though there has been some turning away from the concept, a semantic change in definition may be evolving. There appears to be a recognition  of the inherent right of educational institutions to control students. Sometimes this is termed the implied power to enforce reasonable regulations. The concept of in loco parentis seems to be enduring, and even with the provisions for due process, there is no strong indication that due process will be substituted entirely. (AF)",

A brief note deals  with recruitment of Negro graduate students. The rest of the report describes the program: its purposes and objectives; goals; recruitment of students in high school and their high school backgrounds; identification of transfer and graduate students; financial support provided; and supporting services which include continuing orientation, counseling assistants; academic and tutorial assistance.

This report discusses the historical background of upper division institutions, the experience of some of the early institutions, and the history and experiences of these institutions in the 1950s in Michigan and Florida, and in the 1960s in Michigan, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania. The basic findings were that most new upper division institutions were established less on  the basis of existing problems and needs than on either perceived problems and needs (that might reflect the real needs) or on needs of specific interest groups which were often unrelated to those of the local students. In addition, planning rarely attempted to analyze the ways in which this organizational form would meet perceived needs.

The purpose was to investigate: the formal mechanisms and the informal practices of faculty participation in governance; the emergence of oligarchies and the relationships of these &quot;ruling&quot; groups to faculty constituencies and administrative agencies; and formal and informal methods of liaison between faculty and administration. In particular, an effort was made to investigate: (1) faculty participation in developing and implementing policies and procedures concerning faculty personnel, budget, curriculum, and educational policy; (2) the structure and operation of the faculty senate; and (3) the degree of centralization in decision making. The major findings were: there was little or no central  University administrative or faculty review of personnel or curriculum. The faculty voice was least influential in matters relating to educational policy and budget at the institution-wide level, though faculty played a significant role in decisions on educational policies within the colleges. There seemed to be a faculty oligarchy composed of persons who had served on many senate committees over a long period of time, and they seemed to work effectively with administrators. Faculty members generally respected administrators for their integrity and competence. (AF)",

A recent analysis of the program outlines such factors as student backgrounds, characteristics, academic performance, and their interrelationships. The sample includes 67 per cent of the developmental students (456) who entered H.A.C.C. from 1965 through 1968. Of this sample, over 80 per cent were men, 70 per cent were 18 or younger at time of enrollment, and 60 per cent had completed an academic or college-preparatory program in high school. Most of the developmental students graduated in the  bottom two-fifths of their class, and American College Testing Program (ACT) scores for about 70 per cent of these students were lower than the average for all H.A.C.C. students. Between 33 and 40 per cent of the developmental students did not return for additional work at the end of their first year. On the other hand, one-third of the former developmental students who enrolled in transfer programs in 1966 and 1967 earned degrees, though a considerably lower portion earned career program degrees. The graduation rate was moderately lower, then, for developmental students than for all H.A.C.C. graduates. Based on the information collected, areas for improvement have been identified. (JO)",

Fifty-two students participated, 34 financially supported by the Neighborhood Youth Corps, and 18 others with similar backgrounds and characteristics. The minority students were enrolled in courses open to the entire SBCC student body; their experiences differed only in that they were provided assistance from the school's tutorial center. Student characteristics included School and College Ability Test scores below the fifteenth percentile on all tests, and tendencies toward both low self-concept in areas related to academi c achievement and relatively low interest in traditional occupational programs. At the conclusion of  the summer session, 46 of these students had completed the program, with 88 per cent of them achieving a GPA above 2.0. In addition, of the seven high school juniors in the program, six remained to achieve a mean GPA of 2.86. In terms of mean GPA, the performance of these students was identical with the performance of SBCC Students enrolled in the Spring 1970 semester. To conclude, the summer 1970 program indicates not only that minority disadvantaged students can be recruited and encouraged to take higher education, but also that financial aid and tutorial services can have a marked impact on their persistence and performance.

To investigate the impact ot these services, the performance and persistence of 75 students enrolled in a preparatory English course were studied. Each section was taught by the same instructor using similar techniques, and students were free to choose whether or not they wished to seek tutorial assistance. At the end of the semester, 63 per cent of the students completed the course. This compares favorably with the previous 65 per cent course-completion rate. Of the 65 students enrolled beyond the fifth week, none of the 24 who received tutorial assistance withdrew, as compared with a withdrawal rate of 59 per  cent for the 41 non-tutored students. Contrasting prior performance of tutored and non-tutored students in terms of cumulative GPA's, it was found that the lower his prior GPA, the less likely the student was to take advantage of the tutoring service. Performance on a standardized reading achievement test (SRA Reading Record) showed almost identical grade level gains for both tutored and non-tutored students. In conclusion, the impact of this tutorial program on performance and persistence has been positive, with noteworthy effects on persistence.

Most of the studies deal with the junior college student, and include reading achievement levels and scholastic performance, achievement and retention effects of course load requirements, and attitudes toward the open-door philosophy. Characteristics of graduating stduents, those with low grades, majors in physical education, and transfer students are investigated. Values of students in different nursing programs, high-school rank and its relation to nursing program success, the financial and economic understanding of business and liberal arts students, and levels of satisfaction experienced by business students are also reviewed. Junior  college libraries are treated in terms of student-faculty attitudes and use, conformity with certain American Library Association standards, and professional community college material available. Aspects of academic programs studied include those in correctional institutions, general studies, and courses related to the plastics industry. Studies focusing on the staff include a faculty internship program, and opinions regarding the junior college philosophy. Also reviewed are the effectiveness of student personnel services, an analysis of initial entrance fees, articulation activities, the American College Test's predictive value, and a valuation of teaching behaviors.

Aspects such as evaluation criteria, purposes, and obstacles; the role of effective recruitment; the need for in-service training; and student and administrative participation are covered. Included are sample forms used in several junior colleges to evaluate faculty members, division chairmen, deans of instruction, and deans of students. Faculty employment guidelines for one junior college are also provided. Next, the role of the academic dean is considered, particularly as it affects faculty growth and excellence, curriculum development, and personnel administration. The roles of various members of the community-junior college  staff in curriculum development are then considered, in conjunction with a discussion of the place of objectives, evaluation, curriculum meetings, and resource agencies outside the specific institution. Next, the historical development and methods of incorporating the general education requirement into a school's curriculum are surveyed, followed by a suggestion for more economical operation of student data processing laboratories through use of a full-time lab supervisor. The concluding papers deal with the increasingly diverse demands confronting schools, staff, and students, and with current trends in community-junior college public relations. (JO)",

        "description":"This study of Los Angeles City College (LACC) attrition examined characteristics of 397 randomly selected students who entered in the fall of 1967. Summaries of the more important findings follow. Ninety per cent of the sample population persisted through the first semester, though only sixteen per cent returned to complete a fifth semester. Dividing the student sample into quintiles based on School and College Test (SCAT) scores, those students in the lowest quintile showed considerably lower persistence after their first semester, though the rate increased for those remaining until the fifth. This finding suggests the influence of LACC's developmental studies program. In addition, SCAT performance predicted GPA well for the highest and lowest quintiles. Viewing students is  terms of subgroups, females recorded higher persistence rates than males. Blacks and Spanish-surname students persisted at a rate slightly--but not significantly--below the rate for all studnets, while orientals persisted and obtained AA degrees at a significantly higher rate. Place of last high school attendance was not significant on a nationwide basis, but it was for those students from Los Angeles schools. A comparison of this study with the NORCAL project, a larger-scale study involving 25 northern California junior colleges (see ED 039 879), showed similar results.

        "description":"This curriculum study focuses on the subject areas of English, mathematics, accounting, shorthand, and typewriting at Kapiolani Community College, Oahu, Hawaii. The author traces the inclusion of these areas in the business education program, as the college evolved from a technical school to a comprehensive junior college. One notable aspect of the program is the use of remedial courses for lower ability disadvantaged students in English and mathematics. A more recent development is the granting of credit toward unit requirements to non-transfer students for these remedial courses. In addition, subject matter taught in these courses has tended to emphasize the more practical needs of the non-transfer business student. In addition, some basic English and mathematics courses are  now offered by the Business Department. The accounting area--while expanding to provide increased offerings for the transfer student--currently lacks a semester course for those business students who might be interested in a basic accounting course for personal use or a better concept of office work flow. The most noticeable changes in the shorthand and typing curricula include; (1) less emphasis on skill building and speed; (2) more concern with individual development within the total organizational framework; (3) a trend toward thematic rather than single subject matter orientation; (4) increased independent study opportunities; and (5) greater emphasis on involving student s in the teaching-learning process.

Demanding more than a non-directive approach to students, it requires that a teacher know and communicate with each and every student, putting student needs and interests first. A recent use of such an approach involved 275 students meeting twice a week for lectures and once a week in groups of 25. Practice at applying the knowledge gained from the lectures, group meetings, text, and outside readings was provided through workbook exercises. The group meetings permitted discussion of course material, but emphasized individual student awareness and expression.

They perform such clerical and administrative tasks as programming courses, scheduling students in classes, and assisting in the registration process.

A survey of both the Virginia community-junior college counselors and the membership of the Virginia Personnel and Guidance Association indicates no knowledge of such a law in their state.

Seventy of the California colleges indicate they are now or will be using the audio-tutorial method in the near future. A large majority of them indicate that they prepare their materials locally. Many of the colleges use performance objectives in their programs, and emphasize constant student feedback and revision of instructional materials. Most also noted that, while the audio-tutorial method did not relieve much of the teachers' load, it did provide increased opportunities for more individualized, personal contact with the same number of students than did the traditional lecture method. Based on the data received, the following conclusions were  among those drawn: (1) despite the large amount of work required for preparation of audio-tutorial instruction, those instructors using it were much more enthusiastic about the method than those who largely used the lecture method; (2) students in the audio-tutorial program do learn more in less time, probably because the courses are oriented more toward student learning than teacher preparation and delivery; (3) students are more enthusiastic after experiencing both lecture and audio-tutorial methods; and (4) instructors are provided with greater opportunities to manage their educational environment, by providing content and curricular restructuring opportunities, and the opportunity to make course materials more relevant.

Five states--Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska--reported such enrollments, while two states--Arkansas and Oklahoma--indicated none. The two states having the largest number of responding public junior colleges with such a program (a total of 35) were Kansas (13) and Iowa (11). The most often reported procedures for classifying a high school student superior, combined class rank and GPA. Personnel whose enrollment recommendations were most often required were the high  school principal, high school counselor, and junior college dean. Only one college expressly required parents' consent for student participation. Other requirements frequently mentioned included high school standing as a first semester senior, and enrollment in no more tha n two college courses per semester. Most colleges also reported higher enrollments of this type during the second semester. Implications drawn from the data indicate the importance and positive effects of high school-junior college cooperation in providing capable students with increased opportunities for this early college exposure.

Nearly half (46.4%) of the unfilled requests resulted because the title was not owned. As an added service RAILS members were automatically provided with other locations for unfilled requests whenever possible. Thus, two thirds of the unfilled requests were given location information. Each request cost approximately $2.44 to fill, exclusive of photocopy charges and required 0.514 man hours. The mean cycle time for  processing was 5.45 working days.

        "description":"The separate undergraduate library was originated to provide students with the same quality of library services as are available in a good liberal arts college library. This paper deals with how reference librarians have used this opportunity to provide reference services for the undergraduate student. The major emphasis is on case studies of reference services in two of the leading undergraduate libraries in the country (University of Michigan and Cornell University). In 1969 the reference collection at Michigan was comprised of 3,549 volumes and 25,077 vertical file items, Cornell had 3,294 volumes and a smaller number of verticle file materials. Both undergraduate libraries offer reference assistance during 76 hours each week. The number and types of questions asked at the  reference desk of each library are presented in tables. Of 961 reference questions asked at Michigan, only in 19 instances did the librarian spend more than five minutes with the student. At Cornell, the librarian helped the student for over five minutes in 8 of 230 reference questions. The basic conclusions drawn from these studies is that the advantages of the undergraduate libraries have not been realized. Reference services are of low caliber. Too often the assistance given students is superficial and too brief. Some basic reasons for this situation are given. (NH)",

These services make the undergraduate library unique. It is the responsibility of the undergraduate librarian to develop his specialty so that our undergraduate libraries offer substantial service programs. This working paper concentrates on the problem of undergraduate library goals and three related subject areas: (1) service, (2) institutionalization and (3) professional staff. Intangible goals, such as to encourage the lifelong habit of self-education through reading, are extremely important but they cannot guide group action and therefore they must be supported by sets of tangible (or operating)  goals which do. Unless a structure of tangible goals is developed to bridge the gap between means and ends, the means gradually function as the tangible goals. Two basic capabilities an undergraduate library should have are: (1) self-service where the student or teacher uses the physical means of the library and (2) active-service which is dependent on the library staff working with the student and faculty. A brief bibliography of related books and articles is appended. (NH)",

Questions which must be answered before developing a selection policy statement include: How large, broad or intensive should the periodical collection be? What should the policy be on back files of periodicals? On periodical indexes? Also basic questions on audio materials must be answered. A policy statement must also take into account the hard facts of what an institution can and will do in supporting the program. In addition, the policy statement should spell out the methods of selection development to be used, including the extent and manner in which faculty and nonlibrary staff will be used. Initial undergraduate collections vary in size from 15,000 to  60,000 volumes, with maximums expected ranging from 62,900 to 200,000. The size of the institution, availability of research collections and other libraries and the nature of educational programs are factors which help govern the size and nature of the undergraduate library collection.

Each of these is an undergraduate library, yet each is different in areas ranging from the computerized complexities at Stanford to the elegant simplicity at South Carolina. Six basic ways the undergraduate library differs from the traditional university library  are: (1) provides open access to the collection, (2) centralizes and simplifies services to the undergraduate, (3) provides selected books of value for liberal education as well as the reserved book collection, (4) attempts to make the library a tool for instruction in library use, (5) provides services additional to those given by the research collection and (6) constructs a building with the undergraduate's habits of use in mind.

        "description":"This project was designed to compare three preschool curricula, with staff model and program operation held constant. The curricula were (1) a unit-based curriculum emphasizing the social-emotional development goals of the traditional nursery school, (2) a cognitively-oriented curriculum developed by the Ypsilanti Perry Preschool Project, and (3) the Bereiter-Englemann language training curriculum. All three of these programs have carefully planned daily activities and clearly defined week-by-week goals. The subjects for the study were 3- and 4-year-old functionally retarded disadvantaged children. There was a no-treatment control group. Teachers conducted classrooms and home teaching sessions within the curriculum style they chose. The results of pre- and posttest tests  (including the Stanford-Binet and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) are highly unusual. The gain scores of the treatment groups are remarkably high (significantly higher than the control group's scores), but there is no significant difference in scores among the three different curricula suggesting that the variables held constant in this experiment (staff model, method of project operation, and specific task orientation of the curricula) are at least as important as curriculum content in producing favorable developmental gains.

The Day Language Screen measures proficiency in certain receptive and expressive aspects of standard American English, while the Test of Grammatical Contrasts assesses ability to imitate, comprehend, and produce selected grammatical structures. Analysis of the Language Screen data revealed that, while no significant sex  or sex-status-race interaction effects occurred, there were significant status-race effects on pretest, posttest, and gain scores. Upper class subjects had higher pre- and posttest scores, but lower class subjects of both races had larger gain scores. The upper class group scored significantly higher on all three tasks of the Test of Grammatical Contrasts, while, between the two lower class groups, the whites scored higher on the comprehension task, blacks on the imitation, and there was no significant difference on the production.

This behavior may be due to a generalized tendency to be conservative risk-takers. This study investigates aspects of this problem by testing four hypotheses: (1) that Mexican-American preschoolers would take fewer chances on a risk-taking test than their Anglo-American or Negro peers, (2) that this inter-group difference would increase as the material value of the reward (candy, rather than praise) increased, (3) that fewer chances would be taken following failure than following success, and (4) that boys would take more chances than girls, regardless of ethnicity or reward. The subjects, 60 Negro, 79 Mexican-American, and 25 Anglo-American Head Start children,  were all given a risk-taking task developed for this study. The subjects were assigned on a stratified random basis to one of three treatment groups based on reward: beads, candy, or verbal praise. Analysis of the data showed no significant differences between ethnic groups, sexes, treatments, or for effects of failure and success. However, as predicted, Mexican-Americans took significantly fewer chances with candy reward, while Negro and Anglo-Americans took fewer chances with bead and praise reward. (MH)",

The questionnaire, which was primarily concerned with the food preferences of the children, was filled out by the mother of each of the 154 children in the study. Nutritional data was also obtained from analysis of one week's menus from each of the Head Start centers involved in the study. The only quantitative data obtained from the questionnaires was the amount of milk consumed by each child. Answers were so nutritionally favorable that it is suspected that the mothers may have given answers they felt they should give, rather than actual milk amounts. The foods reported as  being preferred by the children are valuable sources of nutrients. The Head Start food programs, as reported in the menus, were nutritionally adequate for the one meal served. There were no significant differences in food preferences of the children in the three different areas studied nor in the types of food served in the Centers in these areas. The questionnaires proved to be of questionable value because of the paucity of data they generated concerning quantities of food, but the data was helpful in determining food preferences. (MH)",

Ten male and 9 female dyads, each composed of 1 middle class and 1 lower class preschool child, were required to complete 12 simple block puzzles in which each was given some of the pieces his partner needed. Rewards were given for cooperative or competitive performance. \"S\"s in the two socioeconomic groups demonstrated similar behavioral repertoires. Their behavior usually involved the physical manipulation of puzzle pieces, rather than attempts to influence their partners. About 3/4 of all observed interpersonal acts could be categorized into taking, delivering, and demanding puzzle parts. Middle class \"S\"s  were more successful in general, but their demands were complied with less than were those of lower class \"S\"s. When competitive conditions were first, \"S\"s emitted more acts in both payoff conditions than when cooperation was first. This effect was strongest among lower class girls, possibly because of dominance of female models in the lower class home environment. A followup study on 2 very low performing lower class subjects revealed that their responsiveness increased greatly when paired with familiar lower class partners in their own preschool environment.

Though procedures varied in detail for each subject, the general plan followed was for the Baseline subjects to be put right into 60 second delay periods (after initial pause-building training) and for the Programmed subjects to receive a program of training steps in addition to the pause-building training before facing the 60 second delay of reinforcement. These training steps involved multiple schedules of continuous reinforcement and  progressive differential reinforcement, discriminative stimuli that were gradually faded out, and increasing delay of reinforcement. The pause-building training, apparently a prerequisite for successful entry into the training program, was effective, and so was the programmed training for the experimental group, but only up to the point where discriminative stimuli for not responding were faded out.

Experimental manipulations involving recording of environmental sounds and a stimulus presentation tape established the conditions in question: specific vocalized environmental sounds  presented contiguously with reinforcement and specific environmental sounds established as discriminative for reinforcement. Findings indicated that, for these subjects, pairing sounds with reinforcement produced no effects on rate of vocalization of these sounds, but that making these sounds discriminative for reinforcement did increase subjects' rate of vocalization.

Responses during test probes picturing children from each race-sex grouping indicated predominant control by the stimulus dimension of sex. Six of the subjects were then reinforced for differentially responding to photoslides of Negro and Caucasian children. During subsequent training, photoslides of new individuals were introduced. Responses during test probes which followed each of these phases showed no generalization along a stimulus  dimension of race. Effects of racial stimulus class labeling upon generalization were studied in a final phase following a multiple baseline design across subjects.

Hill Preschool Laboratories at the University of Kansas, children between the ages of two and five are being taught two kinds of precise skills, some to prepare them for the academic world and others to enable them to care for themselves more independently. Behavior analysis and application of reinforcement principles make earlier skill development possible. In this program, skills are programmed by simplifying the steps, isolating the specific responses, and consistently reinforcing correct responses. The amount of time and effort exerted by both child and adult is greatly decreased. An example of a self-help skill taught in this program is shoe-tying. As the child learns the skill, he is reinforced, the extra-long laces are shortened, and the instructions are  phased out until he can tie his own shoes with no instructions. Through such programming, skills have been successfully and easily taught to children in the program at earlier ages than would traditionally be expected. (MH)",

The costs shown may be reducible if space or transportation is donated, if services such as medical care are available through other funding sources, or if fees are paid by parents. The four attached tables present standards and costs for the three day care situations, plus a comparative summary and estimate of national costs. (Author/NH)",

This report contains four pages of text, summarizing in prose form the significant trends and enrollment patterns and citing the source and reliability of the data. Information described and graphed includes total preprimary enrollment of 3-5 year olds; cumulative percentage increase of preprimary enrollment of 3-5 year olds; and analysis by age, color, region, family income, occupation of head of household, and place of residence. The most striking trend is the yearly rise in the number of 3-5 year olds enrolled even though there was a yearly decline in the population of this age group. In 1968, 33% of this population was  enrolled. The report concludes with four extensive tables of data. (MH)",

The speech of 57 mothers from two ethno-cultural groups was recorded during two 60-minute sessions in each home. Siblings of two ages were observed: a child not yet talking (about 1 year old), and a child already talking (about 3 years old). A third visit yielded background information from the mother, and during a fourth visit (1 year later), the older child and the mother  were given intelligence tests. The units of speech analyses were words and sentences, dealing with speech aspects of amount, content, and form. Although all variable factors affecting verbal behavior were not controlled, study results yielded (1) meaningful measurement of four aspects of speech, and establishment of preliminary norms to evaluate a mother's manner of speech, (2) significant correlations of the children's intelligence level with the measures of mothers' speech, and (3) preliminary indications that readiness and ability of the mother to modify her speech is correlated with her intellectual level (part of an ongoing experiment).

The project, called Personalized Educational Programming, involves 60 first-, second-, and third-graders who are grouped into four family groups or &quot;prides&quot; that meet periodically for planning or group activity. Each child plans his own daily schedule with the assistance of a teacher and within the specific time constraints and subject  requirements for that day. Guidelines, suggested projects, and sample schedules are posted for students' perusal. The amount of freedom and autonomy an individual student is permitted depends on his past demonstrations of personal responsibility.

Mothers met twice a week for 6 weeks in a 2-part program that focused (1) on their children's language development and (2) on their own development in child rearing, cooking and sewing skills. A preschool teacher gave instructions on how to stimulate children's language development and motivation to learn through appropriate use of day-to-day experiences. Group discussions were encouraged at these meetings. The children had a special program, too, that was intended to provide experiences in  an environment that fostered cognitive, perceptual, and language development. The program took place in a well-equipped kindergarten room and was based on children's need for order and predictability, an alternating pace, mediated experiences, a sense of success and a general language facility. Measures taken of both mothers and children provided description of subjects, program evaluation, and evaluation of the measuring instruments used. The program activities were judged to be appropriate for the subjects. (MH)",

Test batteries were given in fall and in spring. The Binet test was administered at school, the Vineland at home through social work interviews. Each child's performance was examined in terms of items succeeded and items failed on the Vineland. Early failures and late successes were categorized, identifying subareas of good and poor development. There was a substantial difference between the mean scores on the Binet and the Vineland Scale. Only four children had a Binet quotient equal to or superior to their Vineland  quotient. Children excelled primarily in the self-care areas, being able to feed and dress themselves at an age level much beyond their skills in other areas. They were also able to use small tools to do routine household tasks. Failures tended to occur in the areas of communication, general self help, and locomotion. In regard to neighborhood exploration, children appear to be overprotected by their parents. Evaluation of the disadvantaged child's social skills should include many developmental dimensions. (NH)",

Twenty lessons were developed in classification training, which emphasized labeling, description, likenesses and differences, and categorical grouping of such objects as plastic fruits, toy airplanes, and wearing apparel. A guided discovery method encourages the child to  detect and recognize relationships for himself. Attention training lessons used materials such as stimulus shapes, parquetry blocks, and three-dimensional animals. The child learns to observe the characteristics of objects and then select like objects. For attention training, a minimum of verbalization and labeling is used as the child is encouraged to focus on visual stimuli. Head Start teachers have reacted positively to these curricula. (NH)",

Thirteen classes (126 children in all) served as sample, each with a teacher and a teacher aide. Measurement involved pre- and posttesting, 4 hours of classroom observation, and extensive interviews. Results indicate that, with one or two  exceptions, the teachers exhibited no racial or sexual bias. It was also found that the Head Start teachers used more disapproval than approval, a pattern of behavior inconsistent with the principles of general reinforcement theory for classroom interaction. Furthermore, the teacher's use of disapproval and approval was not contingent on specific behaviors. There was a significant negative relationship between teacher disapproval and an index of motivation. (MH)",

Fifty-six 4-year-old children from the Task Force Head Start Program of Buffalo, New York, were observed in four different communication patterns and the mean length of their verbalizations was recorded. Also noted was the interaction of sex with each of the conditions. The patterns used were the dyad, the triad (1 experimenter and 2 children), the small group (1 experimenter and 3 children), and the role-playing triad (same as triad, but with children encouraged to act out roles). Analysis of the data revealed no significant inter-pattern differences in mean  verbalization length, except that the small group elicited a statistically greater amount of speech than did the dyad (both with repetitions left in and with repetitions deleted). With and without repetitions, girls produced significantly more speech than boys. While the actual difference between the speech from the small group and from the dyad is small (less than one word per response), findings are important because they demonstrate that the dyadic situation may not be justified in terms of speech development, particularly since it is less economical of the teacher's time.

On a group of measures administered about 8 months after completion of the Head Start programs, no significant differences were shown between FHYS and SHS children, or between the two elementary school groups. SHS children, however, earned significantly higher IQ scores at the end of kindergarten than they had early in Head Start, and FYHS children showed a significant progressive increase in IQ over a  2-year period covering Head Start and kindergarten. This continuous increase in IQ is noteworthy, since previous studies have found a leveling-off effect following an initial gain in Head Start. It is recommended that follow-up studies concentrate on the long-range effects of FYHS programs with defined curricula focused on cognitive development. (Author/NH)",

The sequential curriculum is the Learning to Learn Program and the subjects are 44 4-year-olds and 42 5-year-olds . The experimental groups were exposed to the Learning to Learn Program, while the control groups entered a  traditional preschool or kindergarten. At the end of the first year of the project, extensive developmental evaluation indicates larger gains for the experimental groups, especially among the 4-year-olds. Long range plans call for a continuation of the experimental and control conditions, accompanied by further testing, through the second grade. (MH)",

The school was organized as an autotelic environment which the children (15 in each of two sessions) attended for 3 hours a day. Upon entering, children were pretested on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) and the NNS developed Categories (&quot;C&quot;) test. Results of these tests and others were later compared and correlated with those of Group I, a similar sample of subjects, and Group II, advantaged preschoolers. Comparative analysis revealed few significant differences but indicated progressively less mean difference between the performance of NNS children and the advantaged group. The  correlational analysis revealed no significant relationships, but it highlighted the need for other approaches to measure self-image. Longitudinally, public school teachers reported no difference between prior NNS graduates and other deprived children in terms of class standing. Improved daily attendance, increased confidence in individual ability, and positive attitude toward schoolwork are listed as qualitative gains for graduates of the program. Another report on the NNS program is available as ED 036 320. (WY)",

The colleges and universities located in the region may utilize various Federal grants and programs to assist them in this effort. With the use of change-manipulation procedures (e.g., bypass or multi-event planning), higher education could join resources with other agencies to accomplish greater educational change related to needs of  Appalachia.

The 8 variables were residence environment, mental ability, reading ability, anxiety, self-concept, achievement motive, verbal concept choice, and interaction with the dominant culture. The independent variable, residence environment, included the rural reservation, the urban colony, and the multi-ethnic community. The dependent variable, educational achievement, was measured by performance on the \"California Achievement Test.\" Eight test instruments were used to test 2 hypotheses: (1) that there is a significant relationship between the variables acting together and the educational achievement of Indian students  and (2) that a significant contribution is made by each variable to the variability of educational achievement when the other variables are held constant. In addition, the following question was asked: Which of the variables can be removed and still maintain the relationship found in testing the first hypothesis? There was a significant correlation (.01 level) between achievement and the 7 variables acting together. Individually, 4 variables were found to contribute more significantly to the variability of achievement than the others. Reading ability was the variable later excluded from the analysis. (EJ)",

In addition, questionnaires were mailed to teachers in the 8 schools under study. The 4 indicators of leadership potential used were leadership aspiration, academic performance, character traits recognizable by peers and teachers, and future plans of students. Sioux students were most often lacking in leadership aspiration, and Athapaskan students lacked leadership plans as reflected by their  lack of interest in college or a high-level service occupation. Major recommendations were (1) that Sioux students be exposed to an intensive program of study and guidance to encourage interest and concern for the Pine Ridge Reservation and (2) that Alaskan schools should provide both information about, and support for, college attendance and entry into professional level occupations.

The study utilized student questionnaires regardingschool experiences, residential life, and student assessment of the situation. Teacher questionnaires dealt with assessment of the district's educational situation, teacher-student relationship, and solutions to the dropout problem. Of the 293 resident students at Frontier Collegiate in April of 1967, 251 returned questionnaires. From the 103 teachers contacted, 38 questionnaires were returned. Studies of 4 of the communities from which the students came revealed the same common factors affecting student dropout at the  institution. There was a striking resemblance between the problems facing the Canadian Indians and those facing Indians in the United States. The problems are brought about by cultural and value differences arising from comparison to a dominant middle-class white culture. Because of this, the study included a tour of various institutions in Canada and the United States. The main purpose of the tour was to interview persons actively associated with either Indian educational programs or other programs designed to meet the needs of children from an alien culture, whether that be founded on economics, nationality, race, or geographical location.

Chapters are devoted to background, characteristics of Indian poverty, reservation marketing systems in North Dakota and South Dakota, costs of poverty, evaluation of current programs, and summary and  conclusions for the study. Each chapter gives conclusions independently; however, the overall conclusion was that, for example, due to lack of job opportunities, inadequate education, and poor health, the conditions of poverty for the Indian are deepened.

Cooperative play allowed both pair members to receive rewards; competitive play was irrational, allowing no subject to reach his goal. The number of moves pairs took to reach a goal indicated that younger subjects were more cooperative than older subjects. Among the older children, Mexicans were most cooperative, Mexican Americans next, and Anglo Americans least cooperative.

        "description":"Rural and urban seniors from all-black high schools in Louisiana were given group-administered questionnaires to determine the influence of 5 primary contacts on the formation of occupational aspirations of youth. The 5 primary contacts generally acknowledged to have some influence were parents, relatives, friends, teachers, and guidance counselors. The 264 respondents were classified by residence (rural or urban) and by sex. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was used to determine signigicant variations among the student categories. Parents were found to be the most helpful and influential for all categories of students. Teachers were second in influence but were more influential to rural students than to urban students, as were guidance counselors. Relatives were  rated more influential by urban students than were guidance counselors. The influence of friends was not significant except for rural males. It was concluded that a general theory of occupational choice cannot be formed until explanations for the differential influence of primary contacts are provided. (JH)",

Least squares analysis of variance and other statistical techniques were applied to data obtained by questionnaire from 296 selected subjects to determine the relative effect of the variables on occupational aspirations, occupational expectations, and AOGD. Findings suggested that confounding influences exist among many independent variables and that youth adjust and modify their occupational goals in terms of goal-impedance factors which confront them each day. It was also suggested that  black youth experienced less AOGD and held higher job plans for the future than their white counterparts. The document contains 22 tables and a bibliography. (AL)",

The report describes the state of education available to American Indian children, presents 3 case studies, and offers a set of recommendations for improvement. Collection of base-line data included obtaining information on school administration, curriculum and teaching methods, student achievement, attitudes of  teachers and administrators, and unique characteristics of the schools attended by the Indian children. Conclusions were that education provided for Indian children is a failure and has not succeeded in preparing them to be productive citizens in the larger society. In addition to the study activities, 3 pilot projects were developed at various sites: (1) educational materials libraries in Head Start schools, (2) a tutoring program for junior high students, and (3) a nonprofit organization for community development.

Some 225 children in grades 4 to 7 of an integrated elementary school on Vancouver Island, Canada, served as the subjects. Approximately one-third of the subjects were Indian. Results of the study indicate that Indian children have difficulty in vocabulary development and comprehension.

One implication is that the planning of a language arts program for Indian children be based on specificity of diagnosis and individual prescription rather than  on vague, general test information such as grade placement scores.

        "description":"The study investigated an area of education in which few studies have been published: the area of the Mexican American college student. Most studies have focused on elementary and high school experiences because these have been the most frequent targets of militant Mexican American groups from California to south Texas; therefore, very little is known about Mexican American college students. Even in areas of the Southwest, where the Mexican Americans may number 50% of the total population, the college dropout rate is significantly high. El Paso, Texas, is such an area, yet only 30% of the enrollment at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is Mexican American. For purposes of this study, 782 students at UTEP filled out questionnaires. Of these, 760 were divided into 2 groups:  those marking Mexican or Spanish American as their \"predominant ethnic background\" and those marking Anglo American. It was found that family background factors affecting Mexican American elementary and high school students seem to have little value in predicting success in college as measured by grade point average. If there is a set of ethnic-related factors which account for differences between the groups, it may be found in sociopsychological relationships on family and peer levels. This study strongly suggests that UTEP, for example, is not successfully recruiting more academically proficient students regardless of ethnicity. (EJ)",

The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 stated that the function of Cooperative Extension was to provide practical instruction in subjects related to agriculture and home economics. Subsequent amendments to the Act and earmarked congressional appropriations have made it clear that the service is to deal with all matters of vital concern to rural Americans. Although the university never serves as an instrument of direct social action, it can be a vital force in bringing about action on the part of individuals, organizations, and institutions through its educational activities. Since the passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, General Extension  Services have moved more aggressively in developing programs to help fight poverty. With funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and Title I of the Higher Education Act, University Extension Divisions have assisted public schools and communities to become more effective in dealing with disadvantaged people. Through their Extension Divisions, universities can work in 4 major areas: (1) public affairs education, (2) training leaders to work with the poor, (3) direct work with the poor, and (4) modifying community organizations.

Housing is characteristically of adobe construction and small in size, but house trailers have been moved into the area recently. The educational environment includes (1) bussing of children from distant villages, (2) a central school district (Indian Oasis School District #40), (3) a high school and an elementary school serving a population of 779 students, and (4) a 3-man elected school board.

        "description":"In the attempt to develop means for underemployed workers to increase their level of economic success, 684 south Texans (mostly Mexican Americans) were retrained for aircraft assembly and then relocated in the Dallas vicinity. Some 46 relocated workers were interviewed 1 month after their relocation in order to ascertain adjustment patterns resulting from moving to the more dominant American cultural system. Those who remained in the program were interviewed again at 6, 12, and 18 months after relocation. In addition, 6 returnees were interviewed in south Texas. The analysis attempts to show the relation of successful rural-urban migration to achievement as a primary value orientation. Findings suggest that importance of family is significantly related to failure in a relocation  program. On the other hand, achievement orientations are slightly more important to stayers than to returnees. Measures of delay of gratification used give only slight support to the achievement model. The authors conclude that the theoretical framework used is valid but that better measures of values are needed for a predictive model. The analysis points to an important use of the value framework in the study of migration. (Author/AL)",

In 1966, some 484 high school sophomore boys in 3 rural counties in east-central Texas were given a questionnaire. A similar questionnaire was administered to 325 of the original sample in 1968, an additional 71 were contacted personally, and 37 responded to a mailed questionnaire. Findings indicated that, generally, the higher  the occupational aspirations and expectations of white boys the more stable they remained over the time period. The Negro boys' occupational aspirations and expectations lowered over the time period. Negro boys raised their educational goals while those of the white boys remained congruent. In general, occupational aspirations and expectations of both the white and Negro youth appeared more dynamic than their educational status projections. (LS)",

The study was concerned primarily with conceptions held by white elementary school children about the American Indians. Secondly, it was hoped that the survey would provide broader insights and would help to solidify attitudes about Indians. Students were asked to write 1-page papers on &quot;What I Know About Indians&quot; to determine the type and quantity of previous experience of any kind that these students had had with American Indians. It was hoped that this approach would allow the students to provide information unaffected by an overly structured instrument. Responses were analyzed in terms of (1) Factual Statements and (2)  Attitudes Toward Indians. Some 643 responses were recorded from students in grades 3-6. A great diversity of knowledge about Indians was found. It was felt that the affective and factual pictures of American Indians presented by the students tended to be uncomplimentary and inaccurate and that factual knowledge of American Indians was overgeneralized. In conclusion, suggestions are presented for effective guidelines in the development, employment, and evaluation of Indian cultural and historical materials. (EL)",

Major hypotheses dealt with the combination of biographical variables that best predict teacher morale, differences in morale among teachers grouped by salary level, and differences in morale among teacher grouped according to level of salary increase. The research sample of 46 school districts was selected from all high school districts in North Dakota whose 1968-69 high school enrollment was 400 or less in grades 9-12. The Purdue Teacher Opinionaire (PTO) was distributed to 809 teachers; 545 responses were used in the analysis. The PTO contained a total morale score and 10 factor scores relation to teacher rapport with principal,  satisfaction with teaching, rapport among teachers, teacher salary, teacher load, curriculum issues, teacher status, community support of education, school facilities and services, and community pressures. Statistical techniques used included stepwise backward multiple linear regression, analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance. When the PTO total morale score was used as the criterion, the significant predictors of morale were educational preparation, years of teaching experience, and age. (Author/JH)",

Comparisons of the sample were made by school location (rural and urban) and by sex.

He claims that the types and levels of transformations and interpretations, verbal and nonverbal, that must go into good reading are not susceptible to simple speed reading programs or formulas. He suggests that speed reading is best taught indirectly and that educators need to focus on understanding the reading process as it is integrated with the total personality, intelligence, emotions, previous education, and life experience of the reader.

A descriptive abstract describes each entry in Part 1.  Part 2 included citations and brief annotations for relevant documents published prior to 1950. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"A distinction is made between the learnability and readability of text materials. Learnability refers to the extent to which new learning results from reading a passage; readability refers to the extent to which a passage is comprehended. Cleraly, comprehension can occur without new learning. Classic readability formulas use text characteristics such as word difficulty and sentence length to predict comprehension. In this study, the prediction of new learning with a variety of text variables was examined. Sixty-two sixth-grade subjects read 11 passages ranging from second- to twelfth-grade difficulty. Learning scores were based on two types of pretests and post-tests. The results of stepwise regression analyses of text characteristics on learning scores revealed that the same  characteristics, including word difficulty and sentence length, which predict comprehension also predict new learning. However, more than one text characteristic in a multiple regression equation did not significantly improve the predictability over the zero order correlation. Thus, classic readability formulas may be used to estimate the learnability as well as the readability of text materials. (Author/NH)",

The purpose of the experimental evaluation was to determine whether playing the game actually did influence the associative structure of those verbs and adverbs that are \"guessed\" words in the game. Third graders from two classrooms in an integrated school (60 percent Negro) in Baltimore City were randomly divided (same reading achievement level) into an experimental group (N=23) and a control group (N=22). Pretests and post-tests were given to both groups on the first and fifth day, respectively. The experimental group played the game twice each day (about 20 minutes per day) on days 2, 3, and 4. Playing the game appeared to result in small changes in associative patterns  on the desired direction. The game could be developed for children in all the elementary grades.

Currently in its fourth year of operation, the program is designed to provide students with individualized, self-paced instruction in college-preparatory chemistry. The author discusses the rationale for the program, the initial phases, the problems encountered and changes instituted each year, and the program as it is presently structured and operated. The establishment of a hierarchy of behavioral objectives and the procedures for evaluating student performance are presented. The report includes an analysis of data collected on the performance of students in both the independent study and the conventionally taught chemistry programs. The results indicate that the independent study  students are better able to achieve and retain the processes, generalizations and hypotheses of chemistry than the conventional chemistry students.

Subjects were assigned to five strata on the basis of scholastic aptitude; in each stratum, subjects were randomly assigned to one of the five treatment groups which differed only with regard to feedback modes. A treatment X level analysis of variance was performed to determine whether differences existed between any of the treatment groups with respect to any of several variables tested. Group means were not significant with regard to SAT scores,  pretest scores, or the time required for subjects to attain the criterion of 30 correct responses. Results indicated that the most significant factor in the rate of error correction by adjunct auto-instruction is guiding the subject to the correct response. The most significant factor in immediate retention is the amount of feedback information the subject receives. Analysis of variance tables are included. (LC)",

A fourth assumption, that inservice teacher training in questioning strategies will alter teachers' questioning techniques, will be tested by a pilot study involving 30 teachers in two treatment groups and one control group. The first group will be instructed in specific questioning techniques; the second will consider articles that deal generally with the value of  asking questions.

Therefore, it was hypothesized that instructed children score higher on an inference test than those not instructed, and interactions occur between different decision-making styles and the reflective teaching strategy used in the instruction. Subjects were 42 white middle class fifth graders in two classes and two schools. A pre-, posttest 2x3 factorial design was used: experimental and control groups were divided into three categories of decision-making style --&quot;overgeneralize, inference, and cautious&quot; as determined by Hilda Taba's Social Studies Inference Test. The &quot;reflective teaching strategy&quot; consisted of  a four week self-instructional programed package designed to develop reflective thinking. Analysis of test results revealed no significant differences between groups on scores associated with inference. Although an interaction pattern did emerge, it was not statistically significant. The interaction pattern suggests that children who do not have an inference decision-making style will need non-reflective teaching strategies to develop their inference abilities. (DJB)",

For the purpose of clarifying the development of the lexicon, Krathwohl's hierarchy on what 'valuing' means and his definitons of terms are accepted. The works of Gagne and Taba serve as the basis for this model. No attempt is made to deal with all levels of the affective taxonomy, nor to refine the positioning of the affective processes in the hierarchy. The goal is to alert the teacher to the place of the affective components in the sequence and to encourage exploration of them. The model can be a useful tool in planning the sequential  arrangement of learning activities in the effort to assure cumulative experiences in both cognitive and affective realms. A hypothetical test situation involving the conceptualization of values is described. Testing and refinement of the model is recommended. (SBE)",

The effect of urbanization upon traditional tribalistic cultures is the focus. A case study is used to encourage an inductive approach to the learning process. It is based upon the first hand accounts of Jomo Kenyatta and Mugo Gatheru as they grew up within the traditions of their ethnic group --the Kikuyu of Kenya. Materials using the \"mystery story\" approach are included for an analysis of the iron age culture at Zimbabwe. The case study package purposely does not go into detail on such steps as the identification of theme and the determination of procedures to encourage  individualization. The latter part of the guide is arranged as a reference section by subtopic or understanding including questions suggesting the direction of inquiry, and pertinent reading selections, diagrams, maps and drawings.

O. J. Harvey's This I Believe Test  measured openness or closedness of belief structure and openness to change. B. B. Brown's Philosophical Beliefs Inventory measured endorsement of Dewey's basic philosophy; his Teacher Practices Inventory measured accord with Dewey's recommended teaching practices.

Some of the problems discussed are: 1) school selection by geographical location; 2) working with the authority structure in public school systems; 3) deciding which contact in a school would be most receptive; 4) selecting the participant classes within a  school; 5) soliciting the cooperation of the teachers; 6) establishing clear communications with the teachers about their role, the experimental nature of the episodes, and the desire for honest and candid feedback.

By assigning values to these responses, it was possible to generate an index of student interest. Other data sources for this evaluation were a thirty-five item multiple-choice test on a unit completed, and a verbal ability test to measure student ability. Since tests had not been standardized, it was necessary to consider each episode separately. To control student ability, the classes were divided into four ability groupings. Each ability group studying each episode  (48 cases) was ranked by the class mean on the multiple-choice test and by the index of student interest in that episode. Only about a third of the cases illustrated a marked positive correlation between interest and performance, because as ability level decreased the correlation between interest and performance also decreased. The effect of the teacher background and preparation variable is reported in ED 035 583. Another related document is SO 000 245. (SBE)",

The techniques used were: 1) visits by staff members who observed classes in session and interviewed both teachers and students, 2) multiple-choice tests, and 3) an essay test. Students expressed a generally high level of interest in the course, with the high points at the beginning and the end. Despite the fluctuations in interest, the objective tests indicated a uniformly high  performance and a low correlation of less than .12 between interest and performance, and a consistently high correlation between ability and performance. Critical thinking skills in analyzing social problem situations from a sociological perspective were measured by the essay test. The students appeared to have a good grasp of substantive ideas and concepts, but a considerably less adequate grasp of sociological methods. Certain substantive weaknesses and the effect or teacher style are also mentioned. SO 000 241 is a related document. (SBE)",

Three environments are considered: 1) the inner environment of the child; 2) the immediate environment in which he finds himself; and, 3) the global environment which is of so much concern to mankind. Instead of asking a student to respond to a textbook abstraction of his environment, the student is allowed to choose the investigations which in turn will serve to structure the course content. Further, the student's self-image is enhanced by allowing the emotional self to be as apparent as the logical and rational self. It is hoped that the materials &quot;Investigating the Earth&quot; reflect the notion that in true self-directed inquiry  situations students have access to the entire process of research. Finally, an early pilot effort with inner-city ninth graders is documented. The students were asked to &quot;go out and photograph evidence of change&quot;; they then had to decide on the operational definition of change, what the evidence for that change was, and photograph that evidence.

The main functions of the school are to promote the acceptance of change and to foster the notion of individual control over the environment. The specific aspects  of change are: national integration, problems of rapid economic development, and the promotion of self-confidence and initiative. In this integrated interdisciplinary approach to learning, the teacher's role is to provide experiences which will provoke questions, to provide media, and to assist the inquiry process, centering around learning techniques rather than subject knowledge. Other methodology includes: inservice and preservice teacher education, multimedia instruction, cognitive and affective testing and evaluation, and conference followup. (SBE)",

The second attempts to define the role of political science within this movement. The third analyzes content material and methods employed by the projects using political science. The final chapter offers some possible implications for college and university political science curriculum. (Author/SBE)",

        "description":"This manual presents the rationale and coding system for the study of dyadic interaction between teachers and children in classrooms. The introduction notes major differences between this system and others in common use: 1) it is not a universal system that attempts to code all classroom behavior, and 2) the teacher's interactions in his class are recorded and analyzed separately for each individual student. The five different types of dyadic interaction situations which the system codes are each described: response opportunities, recitation, procedural contact, work-related contact, behavioral contact. Explanations are given of the various categories and sub-categories of behavior within each type, e.g., for a response opportunity behavior the coder identifies the child and  codes the type of question (four types), the level of question (four levels), the quality of the child's answer (four categories), and the teacher feedback reaction (12 types). General coding conventions are discussed and instructions given for using the two coding sheets. Appendixes contain 1) the General Class Activities Coding Sheet, 2) the Reading and Recitation Group Coding Sheet, 3) discussion of additional variables not included in the system (to illustrate that it is an open system which may be modified), 4) 20 pages of coding examples, 5) explanation of derivation of scores from raw coding, and 6) recommendations for establishing intercoder reliability and assuring validity.

There is a strong and rapid insurgence of student teaching centers with such organizational features as full-time center coordinators and joint councils with policy-making responsibilities composed of representatives from the state department of education, all participating institutions of higher education, and the school system. Another pattern is the metro council for student teaching for pooling of ideas, personnel, materials resources, and efforts, often with all cooperation institutions assuming equal accountability for all or any  phase of the program, which extends from preservice through the advanced stages of inservice teacher education. The presence of federal dollars, a major thrust toward such partnership, is designed to make teacher education more relevant and more professional. Among several implications for research is the need to examine very closely the impact of a wider sharing of decision-making responsibilities on the 1) quality of learning in the public schools, 2) quality of personnel coming into the profession, 3) quality of education in the teacher education programs and 4) strength and direction of the profession (professionalization).

Estimated costs are summarized (e.g., $18,370,000 for the entire 5 years of program development and operation and $4,035 for each of 1200 students during the first year of sustained operation.) Estimated costs are also compared to costs of continuing the present program (at the University of Georgia).

        "description":"An expressed purpose of the Teacher Corps program is to encourage and assist changes in teacher education directed toward better ways to prepare teachers for work in areas of concentration of low-income families. Too often community involvement in such programs takes place after most decisions and plans have been made. As the 1970-72 Teacher Corps Guidelines are followed, most of the new proposals for training interns will reflect the movement toward competency-based programs. And since the Model Elementary Teacher Education Programs meet this condition, there will be a close cooperation between the Models and Teacher Corps. The effective preparation of Teacher Corps interns requires participation by the local community in the planning of that prepatation. The Model Programs,  through their various provisions for local responsiveness, provide an excellent vehicle for accomplishing these desired outcomes. As one example, the Georgia Educational Model allocates a segment of the continuing inservice education of the teacher to cooperative planning by the local community, the teacher and the school system. All three of these would also share in the implementation of the proficiency modules, and university credit is designated for these &quot;local-conditions&quot; modules. The past has shown that community participation is vital. The present indicates that exciting new models can effectively facilitate that participation. (JS)",

Preservice began with 28 corpsmen in laboratory and seminar classes which emphasized exploring the world of the public school classroom. Inservice combined internship in the elementary schools with campus classes, the two running in parallel sequences of subject matter: reading, math,  social studies, science, and physical education. More theoretical courses were reserved for summer to give interns a chance to synthesize their learnings. Program effects on the university include three new courses in the curriculum and greater use of interdepartmental team teaching and video tape equipment. The impact on the schools was also strong particularly in areas of teacher knowledge of new methods and materials, and practice of team teaching. Corpsmen participated in diversified and individualized community activity. Evaluation methods included oral exams, National Teacher Exams, and teaching effectiveness ratings.

Implementation involves planning and followup meetings with student teaching personnel of both universities and the school system. Student teachers and supervising teachers would be familiarized with the project at an orientation dinner meeting. A series of five  seminars for student teachers (two all-day and three half-day) would focus on 1) Intergroup Relations in the Desegregated School, 2) Utilization of Mass Media in the Desegregated School, 3) Classroom Management, Control, and Discipline in the Desegregated School, 4) Affective Classroom Climate in the Desegregated School, and 5) Project Evaluation.

        "description":"A new technique for teacher education has been developed in response to the belief that teacher education's number one priority is to be concerned with the emerging self of the teacher trainee. Research on effective teaching has revealed that it is not what the teacher is taught that is the critical factor but the way in which the knowledge and attitudes, beliefs and feelings, are internalized. Thus experiences must be developed which provide students the opportunity to see the relationship between theory, methods, and self, permitting integration of the person. The \"C\" group model grew out of a need for inservice education with personal involvement and an opportunity to test out new ideas and exchange with colleagues the results of new approaches. The new approach, piloted at  Northeastern College (Chicago), was labeled \"C\" group because many of the factors which make it effective begin with \"C\": collaboration, consulting, clarifying, confronting, being concerned, caring, and being committed. It differs from \"T\" group by going beyond focus on the self to application of specific teacher-child procedures. The five to eight voluntary members of a group meet with a professionally trained group leader for periods of at least 1-1/2 hours to provide time to warm up, report results of past commitments, get into new concerns, and permit time to develop new commitments, and evaluate what is happening to them as persons and professionals.

The guidelines focused on and incorporated 1) current education objectives, 2) psycho-sociological influences, 3) changing methods of education, 4) technology, and 5) new organizational arrangements into a system for personnel management. Four procedures for developing the guidelines were 1) review of pertinent studies in the field of staffing, 2) analysis of annual personnel reports filed by all Washington school districts with the state, 3) review of the literature to identify emerging directions in staffing practices, and 4) interviews with 180 superintendents in the state on  perceptions of staffing needs. Guidelines were drawn from an analysis of the six major trends in staffing practices which were identified: 1) greater use of collegial organization; 2) increased staff specialization; 3) greater use of teacher terms; 4) the increasing influence of the personnel function; 5) application of a systems approach to personnel management; and 6) increased use of the evaluation process. (This paper, which summarizes processes and conclusions of Patterson's doctoral dissertation, contains the 29 guidelines, grouped according to the six trends, and diagrams of four differentiated staffing models incorporating them.)

The method developed (in Phase 1--see ED 003 905 for report) is an individualized, multi-media approach. Revision activities, based on feedback provided for Phase 1, include the remaking of six videotape lessons, development of an &quot;Action Handbook&quot; to supplement them, and revision of the 200-page self-study programed text. An elementary science curriculum, &quot;Science--A Process Approach&quot; (AAAS Science), provided the content for the development of the model. During the 1969-70 school year 511 elementary school teachers in Palm Beach County and Alachua County, Florida, were admitted to IN-STEP training programs in AAAS Science. Both experimental  and control groups were pre- and posttested with the Elementary Science Teachers Inventory (Lane). Analysis of data serves to further confirm the hypothesis suggested by the results of Phase 1: that the IN-STEP approach is an effective and efficient method of conducting inservice training (at least in AAAS Science). Conclusions were based on results obtained from Phase 1 and statistically significant gains in group mean scores of all the experimental instructional groups during Phase 2 (1969-70). (Author/JS)",

Twenty-six instruments are included for the implementation of the diagnosis, with discussion and analysis of the data. The second section deals with methods of improvement, and includes materials designed to provide the support  needed for inservice training. The program consists of two separate parts: 1) the Simulation and Data Bank Packet, consisting of real-life data from COPED schools, and 2) the Problem Solving Packet, which guides faculty members in diagnosis, problem definition, and action design for their own situation. The material can be used with or without an outside consultant. The Simulation and Data Bank packet may involve the faculty in one or more brief sessions, while the Problem Solving Section could stimulate the development of a process that could extend for an entire year. Optional taped episodes are available for the simulation sections. (MBM)",

This commission was dissolved in 1968, as it was felt to be insufficiently flexible to meet urgent problems. The work of the Eight-State Project, begun in 1965 to explore the possibility of designing education for the future, is examined, as well as the educational policy centers at Syracuse University and the Stanford Research Institute in California. The growth  of teacher militancy in recent years is seen as producing a shift in the sources of educational decision-making to the teachers' unions and away from the educational objectives commissions. The historical record of the commissions, the research literature on their effectiveness, and the growth of teacher unionism seem to support a cynical assessment of the future prospects of the commissions.

The program identifies conditions believed to influence the student's learning outcome as 1) instructional strategies; 2) situational variables; 3) learner characteristics; and 4) the content carried by the instructional strategies. Learning experiences are then designed to enable teachers to establish these conditions. The demonstration of competence under either laboratory or practicum conditions requires evidence  that all of the conditions that influence the learning process in pupils can be put together in such a way that the outcomes desired for pupils can be achieved.

Three separate orientation meetings were held, one with staff and administrators from the public schools, one with staff and administrators from the college as a whole, and one with students majoring in elementary education. A series of meetings was also held with the faculty of the Department of Education and Psychology. The purpose was to familiarize participants with the basic characteristics of the program and the terminology used, to obtain corrective feedback on the work already done, and to prepare for the planning exercises. The planning exercises were intended to further clarify the program and to verify  commitment to it, and to arrive at a collective judgment on its feasibility for the OCE coalition. The first session provided additional information on the program, obtained further feedback, and developed a general plan for the first year of implementation. The second session analyzed the 5-year plan and submitted findings and recommendations. A collective judgment was obtained by all those who would ultimately be affected by the project that the further development and implementation of the program was both feasible and desirable.

Chapter 7 deals with economic feasibility,  explaining how this was determined, summarizing the cost for development and sustained operation, and exploring the feasibility of development and operation costs. It also explores the possibility if the number of alternate paths for learning activities should be reduced, and investigates the cost of each phase of the program model independently.

The study was conducted by the Syracuse University Protocooperative, an organization composed of four public schools, two Title III centers, a regional educational laboratory, a group of educational futurists, an educational industry, and the University. A major emphasis is on the detailing of costs associated with implementation of the program. Additional outputs from the study include a refinement of the model, descriptions of strategies dealing with various aspects of program implementation, detailed specifications regarding the personnel, material, and facility  requirements of the program, some generalizations concerning exportability of the model, and a simulation package (described, but not included in this report) which allows potential adopters to face the problems of implementation. Major conclusions are: 1) The refined Model seems acceptable to the Protocooperative members and to the majority of teacher educators sampled. 2) Specifications of the program do not call for personnel, facilities, or materials which are unobtainable. 3) Program costs would be reasonable. 4) The Model Program is, in every sense, feasible.

An attempt is made to develop techniques for the systematic observation and analysis of such behavior. Data from a pilot study, and analysis of a video-recorded sample of 15 student teachers led to the development of a typology of seven categories of nonverbal behavior, and seven categories of terms descriptive of affective qualities. An instrument was constructed to measure the relation between student teachers' gestural behavior and reflected qualities within task-setting, demonstration, and evaluation contests. As a test of validity, the researcher and six judges used the instrument in observing three student teachers. Analysis of the data  was conducted to ascertain frequency of observations relative to patterns of gestural behavior and reflected qualities, and a factor analysis was used to ascertain the influence of the instrument and the extent of independence between the constructs. Evidence supports the proposition that the constructs provide a valid and reliable index of student teachers' qualitative gestural communication behavior, and that these might be applied to teachers in all fields of education. Further research is necessary to test the reliability of the instrument. (MBM)",

The speeches attempted to identify the values implicit in the educational systems of the three participating countries--England, Canada, and the United States, the process by which a human being acquires values, and the ways in which the school  curriculum can be modified to include both implicit and explicit education in values.

The legal structure of education includes the federal government, the state, and the local school district, while the extralegal structure includes political pressure groups, formal organizations and informal influences which may come from individuals or groups  working behind the scenes. The changing concepts of learning which are considered include new attitudes toward IQ tests, educational and developmental psychology, programed instruction, the use of chemicals to stimulate learning, and student motivation. Other topics include remedial reading programs, standarized tests as a measure of student achievement, the planning, programing and budgeting system, merit pay, techniques to be used in evaluating teachers, and identification of those who should apply these techniques.

The Sausalito Teacher Education Project is an experimental on-site teacher preparation program sponsored by San Francisco State College to train teachers to be more effective in multi-ethnic, inner city classrooms. The University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee is developing a program to increase the responsibility and involvement of students. Northwestern University student teachers have been living and teaching at the Navajo Rough Rock Demonstration School in Arizona to gain insight into another culture. Excerpts from logs detail the  experiences of two interns from Antioch-Putney Graduate School of Education in schools in Montgomery Co., Md., and Washington, D.C. At New Mexico State University a co-operative program in teacher education enabling students to learn on the job is now in its fifth year. In Kanawha Co., W. Va., seven colleges and universities cooperate with the school system in teacher education programs. The University of Washington's Tri-University Project has developed a prototype for elementary education, while Wayne State University prepares students for the inner city by giving them greater classroom responsibility.

Another activity was writing two proposals--one for the training of educational researchers, and another for the inservice professional training of adult education researchers.

Work at the first location led to the design of a study exploring the differences between individuals in their ability to interpret facial displays of emotion. At the Educational Policy Research Center, the chairman was involved in studies of student protests in general and of the student and faculty strike at San Francisco College.

These schools are part of a 17-school ES '70 Network banded together for the purpose of developing innovative curricula for the 1970's. The purpose of the institute was to prepare the 45 teachers in the following areas: writing behavioral objectives and developing \"learning packages\" to attain these objectives; gaining skill in group dynamics and developing more self-understanding, openness, and ability to deal with affective phenomena; becoming acquainted with educational simulation; and gaining experience with a broadly-based humanities approach to learning. Significant gains were attained in measured  ability to identify, evaluate, and develop behavioral objectives, and in measured attitudes toward teaching and students, in the direction of more acceptance and understanding of students. Subjective, open-ended evaluation by enrollees and generally positive toward the institute, but also somewhat critical of the humanities and educational simulation aspects of the program. Based on critique by enrollees, changes are recommended for future institutes, and a reunion followup is advised to permit further evaluation and sharing of transfer values and experiences.

Questionnaires sent to recipients and to administrators knowledgeable about the recipients' teaching sought information about the following: 1) selected demographic and professional characteristics of recipients, together with characteristics of the origin and development of their projects; 2) effects of the recipients' projects on themselves and on students, other teachers, administrators, parents, and school board members; 3) means of disseminating the results of projects. Data received from 86 of the 108 minigrant  recipients indicated that the major effect was on the recipients themselves in the form of professional satisfaction in being able to teach in ways which resulted in important behavioral changes in pupils. External effects, such as increased acceptance of innovative ideas by administrators and others, were moderate.

Using film study to combat the supposed immorality of theatrical films and employing instructional film to transmit information has provided a negative precedent for the methodology of film teaching. To combat this, only qualified, well-prepared teachers should teach film, study guides should be avoided in that they tend to be literary rather than cinematic, students should be taught to perceive what is in the film rather than to apply arbitrary standards, and both the artistic expression of film and the blunt economic facts of the film industry must be presented. Using the visual media in  this way gives students the tools necessary for visual literacy and constitutes a new and vital challenge to educational philosophy and practice. (JM)",

Upon successful completion of assigned tasks, the experimental group, 24 eighth graders, were given points in the form of currency, exchangeable for sweets or special privileges. To encourage students to seek more abstract goals, a progress chart served as a secondary reinforcer, motivating students to seek success itself instead of concrete rewards. The success of the experiment was measured through group and individual comparisons with two control groups, one of slow learners and the other of low-regular learners. As measured  through objective testing as well as through the teachers' subjective assessments of their subjects' overt classroom behavior, the experimental group made superior progress in writing skills while acquiring independence and a willingness to attempt the unknown. The experiment indicated that a systematic program of concrete reinforcement is practical and effective in changing the learning styles and behaviors of previously unmotivated students. (DD)",

Three typical speech-related problems of the disadvantaged--lack of school \"know-how,\" inability to verbalize well, and the presence of poor speech patterns--provided the basis for the reeducative effort. Based on a presentation of sequentially developed lessons in listening, audibility, proper use of voice, specific sounds, phrasing, strong and weak verbs, asking questions, and making statements--the program's greatest success seemed to be in developing audibility and correcting withdrawn attitudes. Secondary goals for this program included (1) a respect and appreciation for  the language of a child's own culture, (2) a receptivity to the language commonly used by the greater society, (3) increased ability to communicate with the greater society, and (4) improved self-esteem.

Test materials consist of an administrator's manual and a kit of props which provide stimuli for the desired, tape recorded, children's responses. No special skills are required to administer the test. Classroom teachers, familiar with the directions, stimuli, desired responses, and use of the props can administer the test in about 10-15 minutes. While pronunciation and  vocabulary items are included, major emphasis is upon grammatical competence. Scoring is done at the SWCEL from the taped conversation. A total score and two part scores (Vocabulary and Pronunciation--items 3-26, and Use of English Grammatical Structures--items 27-83) may be obtained. The test is not standardized; however, field testing of the instrument has provided general categories of scores which permit classification of groups of students in terms of English fluency and data on reliability and validity.

Chronological arrangement may be permissible, therefore, for normal data processing; random arrangement should be retained for computer processing. A set of nine cognitive ability tests were found to be poor predictors of achievement and, hence, ineffective for scheduling students. Split-half reliability for each text administration and test-retest reliability for each pair of administrations are given, together with test difficulties. An attempt was made to fit learning curves to the data to provide measures of individual performance. No  consistent pattern appeared as to the curve providing the best fit over all students and it is suggested that meaningful information cannot be gathered from comprehensive monitors containing only nine items, as did these. The anticipated increase in scores from pretests to posttests did not occur. Since reliabilities and other parameters of the tests were acceptable, other explanations must be sought for the lack of change. For example, content validity of items or relatively sophisticated prior knowledge held by the students. (DG)",

        "description":"The Quality Measurement Project was established in 1956 by the New York State Education Department to determine the feasibility of measuring quality differences between schools and of identifying variables related to these differences. In the latest revision of the project, begun in 1964, 99 representative school systems, excluding the New York City school system, administered tests at grades 5 and 8. Distinctions were drawn between national and state norms on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills and the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test. Comparisons were made between school system groups based on system size, average I.Q., and average level of mother's education, father's education, and father's occupation. Likewise student groups were compared on I.Q., mother's education, father's  education, and father's occupation. As a result of these studies and further correlations, three methods of school system evaluation are suggested: comparison of school system average score with several state subgroup norms, comparison of local subgroup average scores with similar state subgroup scores, and the prediction of a local average score by use of regression analysis and a nomograph. The study is supplemented with comprehensive graphs and illustrations. (DG)",

Instruments of assessment to be used with behavior modification treatments must be sensitive to the behavioral goals of principals, teachers, and public school officials. Moreover the treatments used in behavior modification must incorporate teacher behavior. Specific criteria necessary for valid and reliable observing and recording techniques are also prerequisites to instrument development. The Durham Education Improvement Program has developed two instruments, Coping Analysis Schedule for Educational Settings (CASES) and Spaulding Teacher Activity Rating Schedule (STARS), to permit the study of the socialization process in ongoing  school settings and treatment of behavior disorders by social agents. Two procedures requiring trained observers using technical aids (signal generators, and an event recorder with attached micro-switch keyboard) have been used; a third, employing wireless transmitting microphones in conjunction with the event recorder, is proposed. Short forms of CASES and STARS are appended along with recording sheets used to gather data in classrooms. Examples of criteria for rating observation techniques are included. (ES)",

Three tests in different content areas were developed using item specifications found in the Piagetian literature on formal operations. Items were six-choice logic items with abstruse content. These tests, four Piagetian formal thought tasks, and a measure of verbal intelligence were administered to a sample of above-average teenagers. The formal operational reasoning tests were  demonstrated to have substantial content validity, modest concurrent validity, and limited construct validity. Six item structures were found to have uniformly high first principal component factor loadings, validity indices, and reliability indices. The need for further research in this area is pointed out.

Four components of school satisfaction were interpretable in meaningful terms: teacher student relationships, student peer relationships, subject matter difficulty, and subject matter interest. Knowledge of this four dimensional attitude space provided information about the achievement-attitude relationship which was contrary to previous findings in the area. For example, school satisfaction should be considered in terms of the specific components; schools should not attribute student satisfaction to personality alone; and, finally, certain components  of school satisfaction are significantly related to achievement and ability and do significantly increase the multiple correlation between ability and achievement. Further research is needed to better define the nature of these school satisfaction components and to discover their antecedents. (Author/PR)",

This report covers Phase II of the project and emphasizes a systems analytic viewpoint. One of the distinctive features of JCES is its concern with the evaluation of the management of the funding process, as well as with the impact of the substantive programs being funded. The JCES evaluation model is described in some detail, including goals, objectives, systems elements, and variables. The statistical data sub-systems, including the  instruments to be used, are characterized and analyzed. The system reporting requirements are discussed and specified. The data analysis plan requirements are outlined. JCES implementation schedules, working organization, and manpower requirements are noted. Political and practical implementation problems are discussed. The sampling designs to be used are described in detail. Finally, brief discussions of the requirements for the further development of the total JCES are included. The appendices to this report are available as TM 000 108.

Nine basic principles are set forth, accompanied by a variety of standards for their implementation. The principles cover such matters as democratization of administrative matters, the foundation of the school's program in the needs and aspirations of those it serves, analysis and selective use of community resource, adequate  program organization and personnel for all aspects of the school system, suitable environment, proper physical facilities, satisfactory budgetary and funding procedures, and experimental programs aimed at general improvement.

        "description":"This twenty-four item scale assesses students' actual and desired political-social activism in terms of physical participation, communication activities, and information-gathering activities. About ten minutes are required to complete the instrument. The scale is divided into two subscales. The first twelve items (ACT-A) question respondents on their Actual Activity, i.e., the average actual frequency of participation in various sociopolitical activities during the prior three years. The remaining items (ACT-D) ask the respondents to indicate their Desired Activity, i.e., the average desired frequency of participation in the same activities during the same period had the respondent been free of all obligations. Scoring of the subscales is a simple sum of weighted response  alternatives. Response alternatives (a) are given a weight of 1; (b), 2; (c), 3; (d), 4; (e), 5. These are summed for the subscales; ACT-A consists of the sum of scores for items 1-12; ACT -D consists of the sum for items 13-24. Scores on each subscale can range 12 (low activity) to 60 (high activity). In previous research, college student sociopolitical activists were found to score significantly higher than nonactivists on both ACT subscales. Split-half reliabilities were also high: 0.93 and 0.96 for the ACT-A and the ACT-D subscales respectively. (Author)",

This study included 910 children--all of those completing the seven-year examination. About 65 percent were white and 33 percent Negro. Control is instituted for socioeconomic-educational status and age. Thirty-five percent of white males, 49 percent of white females, and 45 percent of Negro males and females completed first grade when tested. Of these, 38 percent of white boys, 13 percent of white girls, seven percent of Negro boys, and five percent of Negro girls were retained in the first grade. The higher rate among white boys than Negro  boys contradicts prevalent expectations. The difference in the promotion-retention rate for this sample of white boys in comparison to Negro boys is not a function of lower mean school achievement nor of mean intelligence scores. In part, it can be explained by greater homogeneity of achievement by the Negro children. The higher retention rates for white boys appeared to be a function also of the promotion policies of schools serving low socio-economic groups. (Authors/JM)",

In general pattern the implementation of the program remained unchanged from the previous year although there were a number of specific changes including those among staff and student personnel and budgetary arrangements. Data on socioeconomic background and previous achievement were collected and analyzed. Students in the different centers participating in the program differed significantly in mother's education, total weekly income, number of rooms in apartment, number of years at present address, and Adjusted Life Chance Scale score. No differences were found in age of students, father's education, monthly rent, and number of persons  in apartment. It was found that, on the whole, first year students were performing on grade level in each of the subtests of the Metropolitan Achievement Test; overall academic average was the 70's for the eighth and ninth grades. For all the classes, first to fourth years inclusive, however, the academic average was approximately 72. By June, 1969 fourth year students had completed their first year in college, either in branches of the City University or private colleges. Third and fourth year students viewed on the basis of past achievement and socioeconomic data as students who would most likely not complete high school, went on to reverse this prognosis in a ramarkable manner.

This program was established to provide the probation department with information useful in establishing similar joint programs with other private institutions. Goals of the program were to: motivate the probationers, raise educational aspirations, reduce contacts with the police, and reduce recidivism. Part I of the report contains impressions about the program gathered through interviews with students and staff. The findings were that: orientation and selection procedures were inadequate; some staff were too young, with a resulting lack of authority in  handling behavior and discipline problems; and, the academic component was not sufficient. Students, however, felt the program was valuable and that a continuing relationship would be beneficial. Students also thought that their motivation and aspiration had increased, but doubted any effect on future recidivism. Part II of the report contains testing and personal data on the probationers, focusing on some intellectually talented youth. Part III contains program alternatives to counterproductive juvenile institutions. A bibliography is included.

The Program of Special Directed Studies for Transition to College (PSDS), a five-year experimental project, is aimed at providing a four-year, high quality college education for educationally and economically disadvantaged minority group students. Forty students were admitted in 1968 with full financial support. A three-week orientation program tailored their course load to their abilitie s and interests, with adequate and individualized counseling. Two years are allowed to qualify for regular admission with no grades recorded on the permanent transcript during this time. The  research intrinsic to the program is for the purposes of: (1) investigating the consequences of special collegiate arrangements; (2) evaluating and accounting for areas of success and failure; (3) making research available locally and nationally; and, (4) providing bases for desirable changes in PSDS and other programs. The research design is a pre-test, post-test control group allowing for analysis of test scores. The multivariate definition of &quot;success&quot; and evaluative measures to be used are included.

This minority is losing faith in speech as a means of redress, but corrective measures should come through dialogue and not collision. Few Mixican Americans designated themselves \"browns\" a year ago--but it is now necessary, given the growing black-white polarization. This affirms the Mexican-American self-identity. Browns constitute the second largest and most destitute minority, yet they retain faith in and patriotism toward America. Lack of collective bargaining and \"green card\" practices maintain an oversupply of unskilled labor and depressed wages. Brown education is a disaster area. Justice is arbitrary, and police seem to be waging  undeclared war in brown communities. Equal opportunity in employment is a hoax to a people denied the basic rights of collective bargaining, education, and justice. The author says the situation can lead to anarchy; without the protection of the rights of minorities, the majority flirts with its own eventual demise. (Author/DM)",

Two interviews were conducted in September 1968 and in June 1969 with the same respondents: a random sample of district resident, a random sample of parents and school district elites. Results indicate consistent and general support of about 50 percent of the total for the program among all three samples. However, opposition increased over the period studied by a very slight amount to about 30-35 percent of the total. Little real polarization appears to have taken place among respondents contrary to expectations. In the community in general the transfer program is not a controversial  issue and has received little attention in the newspapers.

        "description":"An experiment employing a 2x2x3 factorial design sought to determine the extent to which socially disadvantaged elementary school students' unfamiliarity with some terms in a verbal subsection of a group intelligence test may account for their relatively poor performance on such tests. Training was provided so as to attempt improvement in these students' test performance. Fourth, fifth, and sixth grade disadvantaged children (288 in number) were randomly assigned within sex and classrooms either to a relevant or irrelevant familiarization condition. Four trials of pronouncing and writing 20 verbal items later encountered in context as part of a modified Subtest Number 7 of the California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity comprised the familiarization process. Treatment  differences involved different word lists. Immediately following this, students read the story part of the Subtest and answered the 25 multiple-choice questions. A spelling test on the 20 relevant terms followed. Analysis of variance of the data showed that although the &quot;relevant familiarization&quot; group was superior to the &quot;irrelevant familiarization&quot; group on the spelling test, there were no significant differences between the groups on Subtest 7. Further analysis disclosed that only a minority of the &quot;relevant familiarization&quot; group managed to finish the experimental treatment before being introduced to the story; results were, thus, held to be inconclusive.

National Education Association President, George Fischer, expresses views about changing attitudes, cultural differences, Southern school desegregation, busing, and the Nixon administration. Mrs. LaDonna Harris, a Comanche Indian, focuses on the problems of the American Indian people, and contends that Peace Corps work with people of different cultures all over the world is futile when the problems of cultural difference in the United States remain unsolved. Leon Panetta talks of the need for leadership and clear thinking on the issue of desegregation in order to prevent worsening of relations between the races. Roy Innis offers an alternative to the  Department of Health, Education and Welfare plan for desegregation. Charles Gonsales, student NEA president, enjoins educators to begin asking some basic questions about the great cleavage between &quot;our national goals and our national behavior.&quot; Mrs. Gwendolyn Woods, National Coordinator of the National Association of Black Students discusses the recommendations that the Association proposes to create an educational experience that is relevant to the black student and to the people the black student would wish to serve.

        "description":"The Southern Regional Council interviewed students in four widely diverse Southern communities, in July of 1970, about their experiences in desegregated schools. The survey objective was to find answers to such urgent questions posed by integration as: whether the students were just a bitter vocal minority, or whether they represented a new wave of militancy born of the disillusionment of black students with the great experiment of integration. Students' opinions quoted at great length related to the situations in Mobile (Alabama), Charlotte (North Carolina), and Greenville and Beaufort (South Carolina), and ranged from bitter negativism of attitude to that of cautious optimism. Findings reported are contended to indicate: that there did not seem to be a mass embracing of  separatism, but that many were being edged in that direction by factors such as humiliating experiences in desegregated classrooms; that the unkept rich promises of integration were making students lose all faith in the American system; and, that as a result, the very educational structure was being threatened not only by racism but by archaic attitudes, teaching methods, and approaches to learning. It is held that youth will have its say, and that failure to listen could be a tragic, even fatal mistake. (JW)",

These options are each discussed in relation to policy framework, objectives and evaluation, curriculum, personnel, finance, health and pupil services, purchasing, plant maintenance and operations, and other services. On the district level, suggestions are made for parceling out administrative responsibilities to local school boards and community groups. These responsibilities  relate to purchasing, contracts, determination of school organization, capacity, and busing, administrative district reorganization, citywide schools, grants for instructional improvement, maintenance, and food service. In addition, recommendations for revising systemwide policies by referendums (school-community opinion and advice) and other means are made. These relate to administrative roles and responsibilities, curriculum policy, financial policy, and personnel policy. Individual statements by the Commission's members, and a bibliography are appended. (RJ)",

Federal, state, and local governments have had access to only small amounts of relevant social and behavioral science knowledge or small numbers of skilled scientists in these areas; thus the nation responds too slowly to urban problems. Scientific and technical knowledge must be used to inhibit misconceived programs as well as create new options. HUD's present research program is limited by insufficient funds and inadequate intramural R &amp; D capacity. Additional extra-mural research capacities can be found in the universities and the non-academic private sector. The &quot;systems&quot; approach  shows promise for coping with urban problems and for designing R &amp; D programs. Research is relevant if the results provide: (1) greater understanding of obstacles to successful program implementation; (2) identification of new program instruments for goal achievement; and, (3) the basis for reliable estimates of the future. The Committee therefore specifically recommends research on planning and information systems, sources of obstacles, and new program instruments which foster desired social outcomes. (DM)",

Educational administration must now encompass the social process of the local social system. In the Woodlawn locality of Chicago, (one of the ten poorest Chicago communities), the Woodlawn Experimental Schools Project (WESP) was instituted to restructure the social system through a mutuality of effort for the improvement of achievement. Decisions and policy were to be made by The Woodlawn Community Board (TWCB), comprised of members from the University of Chicago, Chicago Board of Education, and from The Woodlawn Organization. TWCB will use a WESP model to hopefully provide the vehicle for decision-making power of the black community  residents of Woodlawn in the educational institution. This model for group mobility emerged because an earlier individual mobility model failed. Black community leadership, therefore turns to the aggregation model as an alternative, which will assess reality in terms of the local social system, choose the most effective goals and objectives, and widen their finite set of knowledge to include a multitude of alternatives.

        "description":"Techniques for developing the potential of culturally deprived people cannot be developed without more knowledge of the basic mechanisms of mental change. Psysiological generation and regeneration are both apparently governed by the same set of mechanisms. Regeneration is possible only when a part of the damaged structure is left, and these mechanisms are part of its genetic blueprint. Since psychological phenomena are a subclass of biological phenomena, we may expect the same convergence for mental change. Any developmental process of mental regeneration begins at some point on the sequence of stage organization. It appears, although the evidence is much more tenuous than on physiological regeneration, that developmental rehabilitation ends at some point further along the stage  sequence. If the beginning and end stages of mental regeneration are the same as mental generation, then there should be fundamental convergence between their courses and mechanisms. It is this theoretical deduction that requires much empirical investigation if success in developing the potential of culturally deprived people is to be attained.

The main aims of the project were: to provide screening techniques to enable children in need of compensatory education to be identified at an early age; to make longitudinal studies of infant school children in deprived areas, with particular reference to their emotional development and response to schooling; and, to develop teaching programs involving materials in a variety of media, which may be used to help culturally deprived children at the infant school age. The project was concerned with children in the four to eight years' age range,  and the research team was to work in several areas of England and Wales. Teacher groups and permanent displays of materials were to be organized. (Author/JM)",

DEEO staff located in four OE regional offices and in Washington, 16 university school desegregation assistance centers, and 25 State education agency units&lt; responded to  more than 6,400 requests for technical assistance from over 1,300 different school systems. Title IV program funds supported training for an estimated 17,500 teachers and other school personnel in the university institutes and local school district inservice programs. Approximately 75 percent of program funds were allocated for activities to assist schools in the 17 Southern and border States. Nearly three-fourths of all school systems receiving technical assistance were located in the Southern States. (Author/JM)",

The Clerical SOLO curriculum model has accomplished this by providing an opportunity for a student to determine relevant learning objectives, to learn in a manner that suits him best, to learn at his own rate, and to be actively involved with the evaluation of his performance. Activities that tend to create an inaccurate self concept such as arbitrary scheduling, ability grouping, and grading have been eliminated. On the average, rates of learning increased over the semester. Students  indicated a preference for the Clerical SOLO learning experience over other tradionally taught business education subjects. Instructional costs decreased by 16.7 percent even withstanding an increase of adult contact and supervision. Given that the above benefits did occur without sacrificing student achievement, the Clerical SOLO will be continued with continual refinement. (Author/JM)",

A unitary system of higher education will use teaching, research, and service resources to the highest possible degree in the provision of student opportunity. A unified system provides a maximum access to post secondary programs to all, without racial discrimination in admission, staffing, institutional support, and all other facets of operating  a higher education enterprise. A unitary system will be characterized by: a planning process which provides for majority and minority group opinion and expression; cooperative planning among institutions within the context of the needs of all the people in a state; maximum use of all available and projected higher educational facilities; extensive use of faculty across institutional lines; dilineation of institutional roles based on the unique characteristics of each; and, due consideration of the location and proximity to each other of the institutions in determining role and scope responsibilities.

Seven hundred and seven subjects from an urban school system used in the study were comprised of 309 disadvantaged students (138 in elementary school, 171 in secondary school; 184 boys, 125 girls) and 398 advantaged students (186 elementary, 212 secondary; 199 boys, 199 girls)--the criterion of \"disadvantage\" having been defined according to family income (less than $4,000 per annum), welfare aid status, and housing in low-rent or subsidized tenements. A  self-perception instrument using 40 bipolar traits expressed in sentence form were presented to the subjects. An analysis of variance statistical design was applied to the index scores obtained. The results showed that disadvantaged children of all ages had higher self concepts than advantaged children, but that disadvantaged high school students were not as high in self concept as disadvantaged children at the elementary school level.

Cohen discussed women in the labor force today, future trends in women's employment, future demands for workers, health personnel shortages, educational opportunities, homemaker services needed, and increased freedom of choice in the future. Some of the points were: (1) Economic factors, amount of education, and age of children are major factors which influence married women's decision to work, (2) Of the total labor force growth between 1964 and 1980, about 21 million (87 percent) will be due to population increases and the remainder will be from rising labor force participation rates of adult women, (3) Professional and technical  workers, those with the highest average educational attainment, will be the fastest growing occupational group, (4) Acute health personnel shortages will necessitate rethinking training and job requirements to allow for upward and lateral mobility of personnel, (5) More flexible time schedules in both education and jobs, and adequate child-care and homemaker services would allow more women to work, and (6) Skills and knowledge of women will be used more creatively and fully than ever before.

        "description":"While most servicemen have no trouble finding employment in the current booming job market, they often find themselves taking jobs beneath their highest skill levels, a loss not only to them but to their employers. Those whose military service was in non-technical jobs often can find jobs only at the beginners level and even those may be hard to come by. This doctoral study investigated the extent to which military experience contributed to the qualifications of the civilian applicant and helped him get the job, and the contribution his skills made to the actual performance of the job once hired. Of the officers questioned, 64 percent said that their military service had helped \"somewhat\" or \"a great deal\" while 13 percent felt that it had been of \"no help\" or a \"hindrance.\" Of  the crafts group of enlisted men, 30 percent reported it had \"helped a great deal.\" Approximately 40 percent of both officers and enlisted men said there was no need for the military training and experience in the performance of their jobs.

In an effort to skirt these conflicts three counties were selected to pilot test a program that involved extending the school year. The major purposes of this effort were to provide vocational training as part of the regular school program and to assess the value of operating the occupational center during the summer months. The program was run and provided data to support the conclusions that: (1) A quality program could be made available to all students, (2) Approximately 22 percent more students could be  served by the area occupational center, (3) Total use of equipment and facility for 12 months allows a greater number of students to use the equipment for a longer period of time, and (4) Student tuition could offset the added expenditure of the extended school year. Among the recommendations were that student recruitment time be extended and that student achievement records be available to counselors and teachers.

To solve these problems the Board received a 3-year Title III grant to institute a new approach whereby students divided their time equally between their neighborhood school and O'Fallon, and a racial balance was established and maintained among freshmen entering the program. Students of all ability levels were recruited, course offerings were diversified, and special emphasis was placed on promoting vocational education at O'Fallon. Based on questionnaire and enrollment data gathered to summarize and evaluate the new program's  first year it was found that progress had been made toward achieving a balanced student population based on race, culture, and ability.

Outcome was measured against the variables affecting selection for work-release. The study found that factors affecting parole performance after work-release include: (1) length of term served before work-release, (2) length of time on work-release, (3) skill level of work-release job, (4) continuation of work-release job into parole, and (5) relationship between work-release and parole locale. A sample of orthodox parolees was compared with the paroled work-releasees to disclose possible differences in parole performance and problems raised during supervision. The study concluded that the  work-release experience generally brought fewer problems for the parole supervisor, in terms of transgressions, mobility, and family problems. The problems raised by the work-release parolee were more likely to be associated with behavior consistent with the ultimate purpose of parole.

Because money spent to provide jobs will ultimately reduce welfare costs, practically all manpower programs have undergone or will undergo significant redesign. This report was prepared to supply community development personnel and the general public with detailed information about these developments and to provide some analysis of their impact. Major emphasis is placed on the proposed Manpower Training Act of 1969, both because of its impact and because it is typical of present administration policy. This proposed act replaces previous legislation, such as the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962. Other programs under consideration are the Neighborhood  Youth Corps, Public Service Careers, and Concentrated Employment Programs. (BH)",

The apprentices were matched on the following criteria: (1) similarity of trade, (2) age at time of indentureship, (3) marital status at time of indentureship, and (4) educational level at time of indentureship. Conclusions drawn indicate: (1) Few apprentices fail their courses; the vast majority of those not completing their program simply drop out, (2) Dissatisfaction with the employer or lack  of confindence in the value of certification caused drop-out, and (3) Lack of maturity, although not confirmed by this study, may be a causative drop-out factor.

By focusing attention on the data systems of large public agencies, such as educational and law enforcement services, the researchers found a vast quantity of untabulated  data.

Part One gives data showing unemployment by occupation, race, education, and place of residence. The effects on the disadvantaged of changing employment patterns are demonstrated, and various manpower programs are evaluated. Part Two discusses the implications of these findings for welfare, unemployment insurance, and manpower development programs. For policy and planning the committee recommends a central manpower advisory board composed of industry, labor, academic, and government experts capable of formulating a comprehensive manpower development plan. Policy should concentrate on making employment more attractive than welfare,  and improving the structural imbalance of the labor market by improving the skills of surplus manpower and offering a labor exchange to improve mobility. An independent and permanent source of funds is needed to supplement state and federal funds and might be acquired through a special unemployment insurance tax payable by the employer as an investment in a more effective employment service program.

Analysis of integration and expectation in relation to socioeconomic status, size of school, community orientation, knowledge of occupational education opportunities, and occupational preparation behavior revealed: (1) In integrated schools, white students have higher occupational expectation levels than nonwhite students except when socioeconomic status is low, the school is small, or social integration is high, (2) Whether white or nonwhite, segregated or integrated, urban students have higher expectations than rural students, (3)  Level of occupational expectation is positively related to socioeconomic status for both white and nonwhite students, and (4) In segregated schools the expectation level of white and nonwhite students does not differ regardless of socioeconomic status. The results imply that the physical and social dimensions of integration as well as race of the student influence occupational expectations quite differently. Results also suggest a need for occupational education programs that would emphasize social integration as a means of raising expectation levels. (Author/SB)",

Least squares regression analysis indicated that curricular offerings were positively related to absolute size of the &quot;using&quot; industry but negatively related to its relative size. Data received from the North Carolina Department of Community Colleges confirmed the second hypothesis, that curriculum mix  is affected by the local administrators' budgetary allocations.

        "description":"An 11-semester research team conducted an evaluation of the Concerted Services in Training and Education (CSTE) pilot projects in Arkansas, Minnesota, and New Mexico. CSTE is a direct action program which attempts to stimulate area development through coordination of services and programs at local and national levels. Using an evaluative model consisting of environmental, resource, process, and product evaluation, data were gathered and analyzed from on-site evaluations and a survey of 855 community leaders and agency directors, graduates, trainees, and control groups. The team found substantial evidence that CSTE is attaining satisfactory performance on all objectives. Some expansion of local industry occurred and several small industries located in the pilot areas, but the  overall increase in local employment was not great. In its present form CSTE appears to lend itself to rural counties that are conspicuously lagging in economic development. Though low income people have been helped by the training programs, a need still exists to attract wider participation of these people, not only into the training program, but also into the planning process.

First, only about one-fourth of all high school students are currently enrolled in vocational programs, and second, it is estimated that more than three-fourths of all students could benefit from such programs. A recent study revealed a total of 7,000 private, profit-making schools were serving an estimated 1.5 million students, meeting the needs of students through their diversification of programs and their highly specialized staff. In private vocational schools the evaluations are usually made by private accrediting organizations; student failure means teacher failure, and the dropout rate is usually lower than that of high schools and colleges. The usefulness of the private schools would be enhanced by  congressional recommendation for use of the schools under provisions of the Vocational Education Act leading to joint ventures with public high schools, and by a government-sponsored loan-grant program enabling more students to attend these private schools.

Realizing that difficulties may exist, such as in the unique nature of a specific program or in the lack of adequate measurements of effectiveness, it was felt that a general evaluation model should be developed. The Apex model was developed to evaluate a program in a rural, economically depressed community in North Carolina, with an integrated population of 1,900 students in four schools, Grades 1-12. The model was adapted from a previously developed model and incorporates process evaluation, product evaluation, and a feedback system. It also makes use of the post-hoc  method and a control group. This model was useful in judging the effectiveness of the Apex project in relation to specific project objectives and in relation to the intent of the legislation which funded the project. It is believed that certain aspects of this model can be used in developing the needed general model of evaluation. (JS)",

The ten most needed competencies in arc welding were found to be: (1) understanding of the effect of amperage, arc length, speed of travel, and angle of electrode on weld quality, (2) ability to weld in various positions, (3) understanding of properties of metals, (4) ability to select proper electrode and amperage setting, (5) understanding of poperties and uses of electrodes, (6) understanding of safe operating procedures, (7) ability to prepare and fit pieces to be joined, (8) ability to weld cast and malleable iron, and (9) ability  to recognize and make corrections for weld defects. In oxyacetylene welding, the most needed competencies were the abilities to adjust proper gas settings, obtain correct flame, select welding and cutting equipment and materials, identify steel and cast iron temperatures by color, as well as to understand safe operating procedures and the effect of tip size, gas pressures, speed of travel, angle of tip, and type of flame on weld quality.

        "description":"A study was made to determine the extent of age bias among counselors working with adult clients in educational settings. An Age Norms Inquiry questionnaire was sent to counselors in 55 urban colleges and to members of the Adult Development Guidance Association (186 of 381 questionnaires were returned). Age bias was operationally defined as preference for completion of selected developmental tasks at earlier age levels. While no uniform opinion with respect to age norms and constraints was shown, and more than half of the respondents showed some age bias (50%+ bias on 19 of 32 items and over 75% on 5 items), there were a sizeable number who were vigorously opposed to any suggestion of age norms and who would fight for counseling each individual case on its own merits. Women  counselors were generally less age biased but no other counselor characteristics measured (age, counseling experience, or training) showed any significant correlation with age bias. The division of items into family, general, and vocational-educational categories also did not relate consistently to the bias found.

The evaluation of staff changes in attitude toward the device was made with positive results. The evaluation of class interaction between the experimental and the control groups was made. World-of-Work skills were explored but not proved any more adequate than regular adult basic education if instructional time was similar. Typing skills cannot be developed with the adult in 100 hours of combined academic and typewriting instruction, but the electric typewriter did provide an ego-building device and rationale to the associates for attending classes. The project did prove that the class size and  attendance improved during the 100 hour experiment. Recommendations for further use on a 250 hour program was found to be needed to confirm that the 20% withdrawal from the program was realistic. (Author/DM)",

Indigenous paid staff conducted direct, door-to-door recruitment. Classes, meeting once a week, 2 1/2 hours per session, for 10 weeks, concentrated on communication and computational skills, consumer education, minority group history, and community problems and solutions. The OIC curriculum department sometimes augmented by volunteers, gave additional support mainly through consultation and guidance. Instructional materials were designed, and group discussion was included, to promote maximum involvement and participation. Paraprofessional group leaders were trained as  community volunteers and staff members in five leadership training sessions at selected homes. Special practical projects in such areas as consumer education and community problems were offered, backed up by staff followup visits and audiovisual presentations. A total of 80 homes and 1,179 trainees (892 actively attending) were enlisted. (A detailed evaluation appears, followed by data on participant characteristics, attendance, and motivation.) (LY)",

Attention is given to special characteristics of the hard core unemployed, areas of potential educational interest for unmotivated, undereducated young adults, program planning priorities in manpower development, and the need for more adequate motivational research. It is concluded that the motivation barrier can be overcome, and that rapid literacy training and general educational progress (leading in turn to higher aspirations for self and family) can be realized in an  occupational training situation.

A 119 item questionnaire covering demographic background, early education, occupational history, amount of continuing education, attitudes toward current occupational status, perception of one's occupation, and the influence of continuing education experiences on life activities, was given to frequent and infrequent participants (FPs and IPs) in a program offered through a combined high school/junior college, and to nonparticipants aware and unaware (NPAs and NPUs) of the program. These were among major findings and conclusions: the four groups differed consistently, with  participants highest, and NPUs lowest, in income, educational background, and father's occupational level; most educational activities in each group entailed occupational subject matter; frequent participation was positively related to upward mobility; and FPs differed from other groups in upward moves made even before participation in adult education.

In India, the study was in two phases: a survey of 108 villages in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and West Bengal; and a study of adoption behavior among 680 farmers from eight villages in these states. In the villages, it was found that adoption was positively related to the presence of supporting institutions (schools, panchayats, and cooperatives) and access to, and contact with mass media channels of communication. Leaders' receptivity to change affected the whole village. Contact with the outside world was positively related to agricultural adoption among the farmers: contact with extension  agents; visits to the city; mass-media contact; secular orientation; and knowledge of political leaders. India should make investments in the social sciences, as well as in agricultural technology; should view supporting institutions as a necessary part of the social infrastructure; should strengthen mass communications; and make plans for employment of labor released from larger, mechanized farms.

The author relates the New Careerist's position to the concept of the 'marginal man,' who is now moved to the fringe of his own poverty group by having found gainful and secure employment. She raises the question of whether the program has not weakened the New Careerists' relationships with their own neighborhoods, perhaps by removing them from their neighborhoods for a good part of the day. Despite this marginality of the New Careerist's role, responses to a brief questionnaire indicated that participants' community  orientation was stronger than their professional orientation. In contrast, dropouts from the program exhibited several characteristics of professionalism to a greater extent from the outset than did those who stayed in. (MF)",

Comparative analysis of the achievement of the two groups, using the T-Test and F Ratio, showed that achievement by the extension classes was equal to, or significantly greater than, that of students in the on-campus classes. Analysis of extension student questionnaire responses, using the Mann-Whitney U Test, supported the thesis that success in tele-lecture  teaching is greater when the professor limits continuous lecturing to 20-25 minutes, provides printed material, uses audiovisual techniques as a supplement, makes a number of personal visits (two or three) to the class, and bases the class on problem solving techniques.

Results indicated that the average home demonstration club member in the county in 1967 was about 49, had three family members, reported a gross family income of $7,867, was not employed, had some training in home economics, and had used two information sources on clothing construction during the previous year. Adoption ratings (including overall scores) were  higher for participants than for nonparticipants on all 14 practices. Greatest differences (cited in order) were on clean finishing, trimming seams, applying zippers, staystiching, reading labels and hang tags when buying fabrics, using interfacing, and making darts. Factors influencing adoption included employment status, sources of assistance and instruction in clothing construction, and the types of training received. (Authors/ LY)",

In its future form, it might begin with basic education as a foundation for vocational education, which in turn would evolve into forms of further training, refresher training, and retraining in keeping with the ideal of a dynamic, free society. A comprehensive system is needed which gives each individual opportunities for lifelong education suited to his talents, wants, and needs. Guidance and evaluation must also be improved. Finally, Europe will need an integrated continuing education system based on advanced technology. (LY)",

About 35% of the EC students registered only once; and 31% for two quarters or a year. The rest attended intermittently. Those with day and evening classes registered more persistently and intermittently over the years than \"EC only\" students. More than 72% of all EC students had had some college; over 27% held degrees (mainly from the University of Minnesota). Degree holders included 13% with baccalaureates and 14% with graduate degrees or  some graduate work.

No relationship to age, family status, place of residence, satisfaction from housework, evaluation of family income, or satisfaction with volunteer service, was found. Groups who viewed women's employment favorably were those who had worked since marriage; had some college or vocational  training; had family incomes of $10,000 or more; perceived husbands, children, and peers as approving of their employment; and were employed in higher status occupations.

Turnover among direct hires was attributed largely to monotonous, physically exhausting, or dangerous working conditions reported; but several personal characteristics (being young and unmarried, poor job history, not having to pay most of one's household bills and darker skin) were also relevant. Training program turnover was related to trainee attitudes toward the scheduling of training sessions; it was highest among darker skinned trainees with militant racial attitudes.  Although training may have changed attitudes (especially toward time, work, and personal sense of achievement), it had no discernible effect on job skill development or subsequent turnover. Emphasis was urged on improving working conditions on industrial entry level jobs rather than training men to adapt to unpleasant, high turnover jobs.

Attention focus (cognitive style) in the concept attainment process was not satisfactorily measured. The symbol manipulation process of literate and illiterate adults varied sufficiently to suggest further testing. The verbal behavior of lower class rural adult women was distinctly limited when compared with middle class rural women in the same community. This suggested that differentiated instructional programs should be examined. A design for manipulating the instructional variables was developed for  possible use in dealing with variance in the \"awareness stage\" of learning.

A national survey of existing NCE programs shows a predominance of full time directors (27 with master's degrees, four with doctorates, one baccalaureate); numbers of full time nurse faculty range from three to 23. Recourse to budgets, fees, grants, and tuition for financial support varied widely. One program's experience of how to get funds stressed the importance of identifying needs and securing a strong diversity of sources. NCE participation studies at the University of Wisconsin and elsewhere reveal  (among other things) strong motivation to undertake and persist in NCE programs, especially among nurses who pay their own fees. Meanwhile, such new concepts as health teams, career ladders, and a continuing education core curriculum are emerging.

Although Massachusetts had relatively many registered nurses (RN), 45% were inactive. Resulting shortages were great, especially in state hospitals. All agencies had high turnover, with impending staffing crises in some agencies because many experienced nurses were nearing retirement age. A majority of nurses surveyed expressed interest in inservice training programs (especially in psychiatric nursing) which build on previous education. Of all state service nurses, 12% had baccalaureate degrees, 7% had graduate degrees, and 81% had diplomas or associate degrees only. There were new nursing programs in state institutions, but many did not meet RN needs because of lack of  accreditation and other problems. Because Federal, state, and private sources of financial aid were readily available, educational costs were no great obstacle. Citing inadequate salaries (much below private hospital levels) as the Chief handicap in recruitment and retention, the Governor's Standing Committee on Nursing recommended higher salaries, together with improvements affecting patient care, recruitment, administration, and education. Increases of 11% and 5%, respectively, were urged in the proportion of baccalaureate and graduate degree holders. (LY)",

Demographically, Eastern Washington State College students were older, more apt to be female, married, and possess more formal education than students from Central Washington State College and the University of Washington. The institutions tended to serve students who lived near them. High proportions of the Central  State college and the state university were primary and secondary school teachers. The most general shortcoming of the correspondence courses was felt to be lack of contact with faculty and other students. Perhaps this and the restriction on the number of credits a student could earn through correspondence were the reasons that students limit themselves to 1-3 correspondence courses.

A preliminary study in the western states showed no small companies, and relatively few other, with preretirement counseling programs of any consequence. Eight large and medium sized companies, four with and four lacking such programs, constituted the sample; 648 retirees and employees were interviewed. Most retirees (75%) accepted retirement as such, but many retirees and employees opposed mandatory retirement policies. Finances, health, activities, retirement attitudes, previous retirement planning, morale, and job skill level were significantly related to good adjustment;  resistance to retirement correlated with income, activities, financial planning, health, enjoyment of activities, retirement attitudes, and marital status. Activities, health, and financial planning were especially germane. It was concluded that preretirement counseling programs aided adjustment and weakened older employees' resistance to retirement, as well as improving morale and job related attitudes.

The  second week was largely devoted to developing the actual strategies for reaching and teaching disadvantaged adults, as well as a sharing of participants' previous work with consumers.

A total of 15 kindergarten and four  first-grade classes participated in the program, which was conducted by a bilingual teacher specialist for approximately 15 minutes per day throughout the 1964-65 and 1965-66 school years . Despite \"horizontal differences in background\" and \"vertical differences in experience and personality,\" the kindergarten children appeared \"unusually ready\" for a program matching their stage of development and maturity. This report consists of an outline of the rationale and objectives of the Project; a discussion of the methods, results, conclusions, implications, and recommendations; and related correspondence.

        "description":"The first field testing of the Adult Basic Education Oral Language video tapes, conducted during 1968-69, included five television video lessons and used three testing conditions: a classroom condition with video exposure, a classroom condition with video exposure and follow-up drills conducted by a teacher, and a home condition with video exposure and no drills. Only the home setting treatment (found advantageous in terms of cost) was used in the 1969-70 video field testing program. The testing scheme was designed specifically to determine the effectiveness of 15 English as a Second Language video programs among rural adult Mexican Americans in two different geographical areas, urban Mexican American adults in two different geographical areas and time arrangements, and urban  Cuban and Puerto Rican adults. It is concluded that the video programs do not tend to affect a dramatic change in attitude toward learning and using English among Mexican Americans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans, but is also is noted that the majority of the subjects in the experimental population already have a favorable attitude toward this variable. It can be tentatively concluded that, where the population attitude is lowest, greater goals are realizable through the Program. This report includes an outline of the research design, statistical findings, summary, conclusions, and recommendations. (AMM)",

On the basis of language acquisition data, a limited number of findings are presented in the form of suggested developmental universals. These universals are grouped according to the psychological variables which may determine them, in the hope that it may someday be possible to predict facts of linguistic development from principles of mental development. The underlying assumption of this work is that the child brings certain operating principles to bear on the task of learning to speak. Some of these principles stem from his general cognitive development and some are a product of his psychological capacity to process and store information. Some of the latter principles  may be specific to the manipulation of language but no particular claim is made here as to their innateness. Two broad aspects of mental development are considered. The first section of the paper deals with developing cognition of the social and material worlds (cognitive variables); the second section deals with the particular abilities of the human mind to deal with linguistic structures (language processing variables). The discussion is limited to the development of grammar. (Author/FWB)",

However, these studies have not explicitly examined the effect of level of linguistic analysis on correlations observed between language variables and status variables. Three levels of analysis of a linguistic construction were selected for study: grammatical form, lexical choice and use of a predication type. The corpus was the speech of forty-eight dyads of children (male, female; low, middle socioeconomic status; Negro, white) performing three problem solving tasks. The grammatical form of the construction differentiated between social groups, sexes and races. Lexical choice within the construction seemed to depend primarily on the task  itself. The findings demonstrate that status differences in speech behavior at one leve l of linguistic analysis cannot be taken as evidence that similar status differences exist at another level.

        "description":"One of the central questions in the study of bilingualism is the degree to which it is possible for a group to maintain their language even when accepting other cultural values. There are numbers of cases of peoples who have managed to develop a modern industrial society without giving up their national language; this is difficult, but possible. A necessary concomitant of such a result is a highly developed sense of national identity, and a movement supporting the national language as a symbol of that identity. Whether this will develop with the Navajos remains to be seen. The present survey was carried out in order to provide a picture of the present status of the Navajo language, to serve as a baseline for later studies of any change, and to permit some degree of prediction of  the direction and speed of language loss. Results of data gathered on the language of six-year-old children permitted the following generalizations: (1) Overall, 73% of the children in the study come to school not speaking enough English to do first grade work; (2) the farther a school is from an off-reservation town, the more likely its pupils are to speak Navajo; (3) the farther children live away from a school, the more likely they are to speak Navajo at home; and (4) language is maintained for some time even when other traditional features of life are given up.

The city treated here, Redwood City, California, has a growing Mexican American population and was one of the 23 California cities selected for bilingual schooling through Title VII; programs were initiated during the 1969-1970 school year. Chapter I, \"The Sociolinguistic Description of a Bilingual Community\" traces the history of the Mexican American community in Redwood City, and discusses models for dealing with bilingual communities and their applicability to the Redwood City situation. Chapter II, \"The Measurement of Oral Language Proficiency of Bilinguals\" reviews the literature on discrete-point and overall skills of oral  proficiency for young bilinguals and presents general information on the nature of Spanish-English bilingualism among the Redwood City kindergartners and first-graders who were the subjects of the study. Concluding remarks stress the importance of considering socioeconomic and other home factors in studying the child's verbal abilities and the need for better discrete -point and overall skill tests. An appendix presents the questionnaires used in the study, and an 118 entry bibliography completes the work. (Author/FWB)",

Four major deviations were identified. The study was also concerned with analyzing the consistency between students' pronunciation of these specific vowels and their spelling of words containing these vowels. Results indicated that a positive relationship between  students' pronunciation and their spelling of these vowels existed. The second phase of the study was concerned with developing a method by which Appalachian students could learn to recognize those dialectal deviations identified in Phase One. An aural-oral approach using rhyme was developed. Results indicated that such a method was effective in helping students recognize the difference between their pronunciation of specific vowels and the pronunciation given these vowels in Standard American English.

The author's point of view is that expressed by Noam Chomsky in his criticism of Skinner's \"Verbal Behavior.\" Evidence is produced to demonstrate that, contrary to the assertions of behaviorists, innate skills are involved in first language learning. The author stresses that although it can therefore be supposed that every child learns his first language in the same way, independently of IQ or culture or training, there is no evidence that second language learning is one particular kind of task approached in  the same manner by all learners. For this reason the author believes that there is no basis for believing that there is the possibility of finding a theory that can provide a universally valid technique for language teaching; he stresses instead the pragmatic aspects of language instruction. Finally, in considering how linguistics and psychology can help the language teacher, the author concludes that \"Linguistics and psychology have nothing to say about the methods used in foreign language teaching.\" (FWB)",

The model seeks to overcome the low language aptitude of such trainees in academic learning situations by emphasizing their demonstrated task-oriented language learning ability. It also seeks to address the problem of inadequate teachers by employing a few highly-qualified supervisory instructors while capitalizing on the minimal teaching ability of the HCN (host country national) teaching apprentices. TALK has three chief features: (1) its one-to-one technician-to-apprentice design; (2) its applicability to cross-cultural training; (3) its status as a collection of learning elements: expert supervisory instructors, monolingual apprentices, craft-oriented language  materials, a shop and necessary machines for the practice of the skills in question. The model rests on assumptions about the role of conviction in language learning (e.g., that any normal adult can learn as much of a foreign language as he is thoroughly convinced he needs), and on the importance of personal relationships with monolingual speakers of the target language. Earl Stevick's memorandum on the Mikro-Kor Plan for language learning, which stresses task oriented learning and close relationship with the HCN instructor, and the &quot;Summary of TALK model for Ceylon Blue Collar Workers&quot; are appended.

Although the author agrees with Chomsky's view that linguistics has nothing to offer the teacher in the form of specific proposals for language teaching methodology, he argues that linguistics can give the teacher the understanding of the phonetic, morphological, syntactic, semantic and usage aspects of the language necessary for classroom effectiveness. Because of the dominance of transformational grammar in recent linguistic research, it is considered imperative that the TEFL teacher be aware of the terminology, tenets and results of this particular approach to language. The paper is, therefore, intended to provide the  teacher with such an overview of transformational grammar and te direction which it is taking. In addition one specific approach designed to make the results of linguistic research directly relevant to the TEFL teacher is outlined: the development of a book intended to make the teacher aware of the sorts of errors most likely to occur among learners of English, the linguistic facts which underly these errors, and the way or ways in which the errors might be remedied. Work on such a book is presently being carried out at the Language Research Foundation in Cambridge, Massachusetts. (FWB)",

To tell a foreign student of English that a word is \"colloquial\" or \"slang\" is to tell him nothing. He needs to know sets of words which are appropriate and inappropriate in the same contexts. Our notions of phonological and grammatical features in terms of language variations are even vaguer. Although modern texts usually claim to stress  patterns which are realistic and adapted to current needs, a student may never be exposed to actual samples of language in use. The fact that the varieties of English we listen to and read are not necessarily the ones we speak or write suggests that language texts should illustrate more often than they do spoken and written English which would be natural for the student to use productively. It also suggests that there is a need for drills in which he is asked to change a spoken or written text from a variety he would normally read or listen to into one he might actually speak or write.

Much of the apparent confusion about how they should be used in the language classroom results from a failure to distinguish the ages and levels of proficiency of those for whom the dialogs are designed. The great advantage that dialogs have over other modes of presentation of any kind of new language material is not so much that they are a reflection of linguistic reality, but rather that they present the material in a context that students find relatively easy to remember. It is essential that the student be taught the meanings of the dialogs in as realistic a setting as the classroom allows. Dialogs are not an end in themselves but should show the student that what he is learning  in the classroom is going to be useful outside the classroom as well, both as a source of expression and as an indication of what the other culture is like. Selection and techniques for presentation of dialogs are discussed. (AMM)",

        "description":"In Quebec, English is taught as a second language to four groups of people: French-speaking Canadians; immigrants; Indians and Eskimos; and foreign students. The first group, in contrast to the others, is not integratively or instrumentlly motivated. They are not submitting to anglicization in North America nor are they being required to know English for either school or work. Both the federal and provincial governments have given financial, technical, and administrative encouragement to TESL. However, Quebec's insistence on sovereignty in education, especially in language teaching, makes federal funding of ESL programs a sensitive matter. Other pressing problems are the lack of extensive retraining programs for teachers, the absence of publicity campaigns to instruct the public,  and the failure of teachers to prepare students for English language learning. Increased communication between governments, ministries, school boards, teachers, training institutions, universities, parents and students would be a breakthrough toward solving some of the perennial problems. Also badly needed are centers for language learning, such as established recently by the Universiy of Ottawa, where research into language learning and teaching, teacher training, materials development and information dissemination can be centralized and coordinated.

In foreign language teaching, the testing of skills development has become a specialized area requiring the combined efforts of linguists, psychologists, statisticians, and educators. Teachers must constantly ask: What kind of progress are my students making in this second language course? and How effective are the instruction and the materials used in teaching what is to be learned in this course? Some language courses include series of tests; in other cases teachers must design their own tests. The most important point to keep in mind while designing tests is whether or not the results of the tests help to answer the above questions. Raw scores can be very deceiving without further information as to the  difficulty of the test or how the scores of all the students relate to each other. The size of the sample must also be considered. More can be decided about the progress of a student from a number of tests taken throughout a course of instruction than from one or two tests taken at the predetermined intervals. The aim of testing is not to penalize the students. The most useful information tests should be closely connected to the teaching, and should be arranged to take the least possible amount of time. Keeping test files is useful for evaluation and review. (AMM)",

The author feels that when the student counselor begins practicum, he is burdened with semi-crippling expectations of how he is supposed to do counseling according to a rigidly held, inadequately known theoretical counseling model. The need for a pre-practicum simulated counseling experience is next discussed. Such an experience involving 30 master's students, working in groups of three which meet two or three times a week in conjunction with their Theories of Counseling course is described. The three students interchanged and enacted the roles of client, counselor and reactor. Emphasis was placed on the utilization of the behavior change principles of role playing  and shaping. These as well as the goals of pre-practicum training are fully discussed. The effects of both techniques are presented. The paper concludes by acknowledging that the description of the pre-practicum experience was observational and without experimental, back-up data, but that initial indications were that it is a fruitful approach deserving of further research.

Women and men preferred men supervisors, women did not have as high aspirations as men. Close to 10,000 questionnaires were received for the turnover study. The overall turnover rate for women was consistently higher than for men. Occupation and age had a significant impact on turnover.

Acquiring these skills enables the student to progress to the second tier of learning the Administrative, Educational, Community Development, and Socio-Bionomic skills. This knowledge then enables the student to participate in the problem solving seminars and field work  which prepare him to attack the health education problems to be faced on the job. Integrated with this three-tiered approach is continuous guidance, counseling, and explanation. (RSM/Author)",

Most current writings use this last definition. Most of the issues of generation center around the three respective social systems of the individual, the family, and the society. For the individual, his generation is part of his identity. The greatest differentiation of generations is probably seen within the family. Each rank of descent and each developmental stage is likely to be recognized. In society, there may be only two significant generations: those who are not full members of  society and those who are. The study of generation gap can be clarified by considering two dimensions. The first is the amount of transmission of culture. The second is the amount of effort needed to negotiate the gap or the amount of conflict involved in the transition. By combining these two dimensions, we get four types of generation gap situations, ranging from the most serene to the most explosive. It is more important to know which of these four is most probable than to ask whether there is or is not a gap. (SJ)",

It began with the assessment that student unrest, to be effectively dealt with, must be viewed as emerging from and reflecting the structural, cultural, economic and other characteristics of our society. Schools exacerbate the situation by their repressive rules, their conformity-oriented structure, and their imperviousness to change. Specific approaches are suggested to initiate changes in the relations of schools to students, staff, and the community at large. The focus for change is on three main areas: (1) ideology; (2) organization; and (3) curriculum. The paper concludes with a  strategy for change which rests on two basic assumptions: (1) the rights of students must be upheld; and (2) the principles of \"due process\" and \"rule of law\" must prevail in schools and society. At bottom, the problem of student unrest was seen as a problem in the management of conflict and change. (TL)",

        "description":"Two major trends in psychodramatic research during the last 10 years are delineated: (1) evaluating its effectiveness as a form of therapy; and (2) varying the communications process via role playing to produce attitude change. Examples of both are given. The author concludes that findings to date may well dissatisfy the practicing psychodramatist and sugests that possibly the wrong research questions have been asked. The focus must be on more limited aspects of the psychodramatic process, if valid and productive scientific research is to take place. Several possible studies are suggested which are pertinent to psychodrama and which could be carried out with validity in respect to scientific criteria. Special emphasis is placed on a basic issue which the author views as having  been almost totally ignored, viz., whether the spontaneity state actually exists. This is a question of examining the process as distinguished from the ends which can be achieved. The paper concludes by urging a renaissance of relevant psychodramatic research. (TL)",

        "description":"Project Upper Cumberland was a three year endeavor which served 16 Tennessee counties. The final report and evaluation, in three documents, summarizes the three innovative programs which it engendered: (1) teacher inservice training, emphasizing human relations; (2) a pilot cultural arts program (art, music, drama) for grades 1-12; and (3) a pilot guidance and counseling program for grades 1-9. This portion of the report focuses on the cultural arts and guidance and counseling programs. All three areas have as a general goal the changing and improving of attitudes. The full scope of each program and the evaluative measures utilized are included. Positive results are noted in the fact that many elements of the cultural arts project and of the guidance program are being continued.  Overall, it would appear that the greatest contribution of the project has been the introduction of the Title III ESEA concept to the region, thereby laying the groundwork for future programs which hopefully will attack the needs of the region with greater accuracy. The research reported herein was funded under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. (TL)",

In addition, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Lie Inventory was given. Statistical analyses were performed to discover relationships: (1) between background information and marihuana usage and alienation; and (2) among more than two respondent characteristics and marihuana use and alienation. Protest sympathy and father's occupation were found to be significant predictors of alienation. Marihuana usage and alienation were significant reciprocal predictors, though no causal relationship was established. Evidence from the study provided a basis for the  following conclusions for the sample population: (1) marihuana users are more alienated than non-users; (2) alienation is increasing among college youth; and (3) marihuana usage has increased among college students. Characteristics of students more likely to use marihuana or evidence alienation are listed. Conclusions also indicated that factors examined in this study are by no means the whole story.

Intentionality defines a central objective of teacher training, namely the teacher who can respond and act appropriately in the constantly changing and not always predictable classroom situation. The curriculum is designed to give teacher trainees a set of behaviors and a method useful not only in teaching human relations, but teaching in other areas as well. Specific skills in an area of human relations behavior (eg. relaxation, attending behavior, etc.) are arranged in a hierarchical fashion which must be performed progressively and successfully. An  example of such a hierarchy is presented giving both performance criteria and performance-oriented instructional tasks. The paper concludes with a description of the intentional teacher: a person who can act in a multitude of contexts and situations. (TL)",

This program involves the use of paraprofessionals (called parent educators) who are indigenous to the neighborhoods which they serve: (1) to act as classroom aides; (2) to make frequent home visits; (3) to teach mothers learning tasks which they, in turn, teach their children; and (4) to serve as communication link between home and school. The first paper discussed a multi-dimensioned Home Environment Review (HER) which is a new instrument for measuring those aspects of the home environment which are amenable to change and are school related. Plans  for its use include: (1) evaluating the Florida Parent Education Program (FPEP); and (2) developing tasks to be brought into the home by parent educators. The other papers discuss the FPEP's impact on the school, the community and the sponsoring university. One of the important findings is the need for a basic change in teacher education. The final paper elaborates on the University of Florida's innovative Teacher Corps Program, a two year Masters program aimed at preparing teachers for educationally divergent children. (TL)",

        "description":"Starting with the observation that attitudes towards death cannot be divorced from attitudes towards life, the author proceeds with a critical and reflective look at American society's poor management of death, both in terms of the dying person and the bereaved. Denial is the mechanism used to protect ourselves from facing the fact of death, and the result is a cold and inappropriate ritual which assigns the primary roles to the undertaker and the physician. Much is said about the stages through which a dying person goes in making his peace with death, and about the \"grief work\" of the bereaved in learning to live with his new situation. The unfortunate and lonely ways in which people are forced to handle these critical periods is examined. Specific suggestions for changing the  attitude toward death includes: (1) stop denying its existence; (2) humanize the procedures that surround it; (3) redesign the rituals so as to humanize them; and (4) teach about death, appropriately, throughout life.

Third, considering the above two areas, the optimum approaches of industrial and organizational psychology research to meet  the requirements of the future are explored.

Small groups were shown one film daily over a period of five days and discussed the role behavior of the supervisor shown in the film. In one group of experimental subjects, positive attitudes toward Structuring Expectations and Production Emphasis, and negative attitudes toward Consideration and Tolerance of Freedom were reinforced. For a second group of subjects the opposite reinforcement conditions prevailed. Control groups did not see the films. The experimental group of poorly adjusted students that received negative reinforcement of Consideration and Freedom, and positive reinforcement Structure and Production was rated several  weeks later as responding significantly less favorably to supervision than the control group of poorly adjusted students. It was concluded that for this group of subjects, attitude reinforcement worsens behavior. Previous research with the moview indicated that discussion of the five roles without attitude reinforcement resulted in significant improvement in response to supervision. (Author)",

A second paper presents a study involving middle class adults married at least ten years who viewed pornographic films. Results suggest that these films produced no  sustained change in behavior with the above subjects.

Poverty is defined in psychological terms as a pattern of hopelessness and helplessness, of feeling limited and expendable. In these terms, psychotherapy is viewed as excluding the old, the black, the poor and the ignorant. Given the absence of hard data supporting the effectiveness of psychotherapy with these individuals, a case is made for the use of non-prfessionals in mental health efforts which could serve this unserved population. In line with this, it is proposed that psychotherapy must couple  individual remediation with attempts at institutional change. A residential youth center, formed by the author and a group of non-professionals in New Haven's ghettos, is offered as an example. Twenty youngsters, aged 16-21, previously adjudged to have almost insurmountable problems, were admitted. A control group was used. Results showed increased work attendance, increased incomes, and decreased arrests and time in jail. Also, the group came to feel less alienated and more trustful than the control group. (TL)",

The data were obtained through the mass administration of a precoded and pretested survey instrument to seventh, ninth, and twelfth graders. From the data, several conclusions were drawn: (1) grade has only a minimal impact on the pro-parent orientations of youth; (2) social class appears to be an important variable where the level of parent adolescent affect is not controlled; and (3) perceived reference  set help in making decisions about goals is not an important factor in the determination of the hierarchical preferences among youth when considered relative to other variables.

Even this definition was viewed as inadequate, ignoring, as it does, the reciprocal effect of population on individuals. The author proposes a framework of relationships between the individual and society. Within this framework, he focuses on the causes of human fertility, which refers to the number of live births in a population, not to the capacity to bear children. The urgency of the population problem is stressed as the factor which should motivate psychologists to assist in researching the myriad questions which a focus on Psychology  and Population raises. Many of these questions are included, and significant research beginnings cited. (TL)",

One study examined the ability of Kindergarten and First Grade children to apply a simple rule of logical inference in order to solve a two-object discrimination problem. Specifically, the rule was of the form \"if A, then not B.\" A second study employed the more difficult conditional discrimination problem and provided evidence concerning the ability of pupils in Grades 6, 10, and 14 to apply the more complex rule \"if A and B, then A; if B and C, then B; if C and A, then C.\" The second part of this paper describes preliminary efforts to develop a general model for describing cognitive processes. The proposed model was compared to other similar theoretical models. Finally,  the practical usefulness of this theoretical model for educational research was demonstrated by describing a successful elementary school mathematics project which stressed the analysis of mathematical statements into statements of underlying cognitive operations of processes.

        "description":"Twenty-seven kindergarten subjects were trained on two different double classification matrix tasks to determine whether they were hierarchically related. Prior behavioral analyses had shown one task to be simpler than the other. It was assumed that, in hierarchical transfer relationships, one order of task acquisition is more favorable than others. Thus, it was predicted that learning the simpler task, then the complex, was the \"optimal\" learning sequence. The study was designed so that this optimal order could be compared with non-optimal orders. Results indicated: (1) that subjects who learned in optimal order learned the more complex task in fewer trials than subjects who learned in the reverse (non-optimal) order; and (2) subjects in the reverse order group acquired the  simpler task in process. These are in accord with the hypothesis that the two tasks are hierarchically related. It was suggested that acquisition of complex cognitive skills may be a matter of learning specific relevant prerequisites rather than of entering a \"stage\" of development. (Author/TL)",

Existing definitions of community tend to confuse two very different classes of social relations, symbiotic and commensalistic, a very clear differentiation being made between the two in the paper. The paper proposes that researchers use the concept of residential locality, defined as arbitrary geographical areas inhabited by households, persons, and institutions. Several important ways of characterizing residential localities are presented, each leading to researches which would assess the effects of living in particularly residential localities upon those who have their addresses in those places. In addition to specifying meaningful dimensions of  residential localities, the author suggests operational forms of each dimension and discusses some of the measurement problems which may arise. The conceptual framework plus the operational forms provide ways of designing empirical studies which would sort out the effects of residential localities from other contingent factors. (KJ/Author)",

Three judges analyzed 432 value statements taken from articles in the social and behavioral sciences. Interviews were conducted with a sample of 404 subjects to derive value categories which could check against the values domain established through literature analysis and also serve as a data pool for instrument development. Fourteen judges categorized sets of 290 statements into value and  non-value categories, and reported decision rules governing their choices. The interviews conducted in the course of establishing a values domain concomitantly produced data which will be utilized in instrument development, and yielded corollary results suggesting differences across ethnic, socioeconomic, and occupational variables.

Performance goals stated clearly in terms of observable student performance can be used to improve educational methods. Because it is relatively difficult to construct indirect objectives that will satisfactorily represent complex cognitive or affective achievements, educators often settle for criterion tasks that demonstrate nothing beyond the recognition or recall of information. However, performance objectives can be constructed for the cognitive and affective domains so that both students and teachers will know the desired goal and whether or not it is attained. Differentiated staffing is pertinent in freeing professional staff members from  routine duties to assist students to interact with the learning environment as self-directed learners. (Author/MLF)",

The study analyzed data functions currently used or planned by the districts and processing needs relative to the size of the district. Data for the study were obtained from a survey of about 100 local school districts and from discussions with local district and State education personnel. Major conclusions are as follows: (1) districts with less than 1,500 students require no data processing services, (2) initially, the experimental regional data processing  center should be under local control, and (3) county cnters should be selected as regional sites. A model is proposed for the establishment of regional data processing centers with recommended boundaries. In addition, recommendations are made concerning organization, staffing, and operation of the centers. Related documents are EA 002 689, EA 002 869, and EA 002 870. (Author)",

Data for the study were compiled from interviews with a national sample of 572 school board members in 96 districts. Since size is the basic variable, a series of controls is imposed to ascertain the extent to which variations attributable to size remain stable when individual properties are taken into account. Results indicate complexity operates both to strengthen and to impede the representative function. In more populous districts, board members tend not to define their roles as representing the public's wishes irrespective of personal values. The relative strength of the \"delegate\" as opposed to the \"representative\" role orientation of board members in less  populous districts may be laid to the relatively undeveloped group life of smaller, more homogeneous communities. In general, perceived conflict with public expectations is highest in large cities. Further, criticism of school boards, personal contact with the board by community organizations, and activity by interest groups (including teachers) are consistently greater in large districts.

Data from questionnaires that sought demographic data, local-cosmopolitan orientation, and other information relevant to the study, were collected from districts in the metropolitan areas of Kansas City, Missouri, and Cincinnati, Ohio. The main hypothesis, that school board members are more favorable toward inter-school-district cooperation on functions with economic implications than they are on functions with social implications, was confirmed. In metropolitan Kansas City, board members with cosmopolitan orientations were found to be more favorable  toward inter-school-district cooperation than those members with local orientation. Furthermore, it was found that the social implication of certain functions emerged more strongly when locals were considered than when cosmopolitans were considered. (Author)",

The study postulated that the organizational structure of a school was a variable that would co-vary with a school's organizational climate. Interviews with school principals, and questionnaires distributed to 137 elementary schools in Washington State were used to collect data. Through statistical analysis, a number of significant but low-order single and multiple correlations were obtained. These correlations supported the general hypothesis, but represented explained variance of such low  magnitude as to make either generalizations or detailed discussion of implications futile.

Evaluative data was secured from student records, teacher plans, pre and post physical fitness testing, teacher reports, student activity checklists, and interviews with parents and participating physicians. Case studies of three randomly selected students, one from each grade, were also part of the evaluation. Evaluation data showed an increase in physical skills and ability and the program was judged  successful. Approximately 1/4 of the students were able to return to the regular physical education program by the end of the second year. Appendixes include forms and information used in the program evaluation.

Thirty preschool deaf children were matched and assigned to either unit. The same type of output transducers were utilized for all the children. Teachers used the Verbo-tonal Method (primarily an auditory program) for habilitation. The low-frequency unit produced a greater acoustic response below 500 Hz. Hearing aids were selected that produced frequency responses similar to the training units (the Mini Suvag for children on the low-frequency unit, the Zenith Vocalizer II for the conventional  unit). A Bruel and Kjaer test system was used to evaluate the training units and hearing aids. The Mini Suvag, capable of simultaneously driving a vibrator and a headset, had a greater low-frequency response. (KW)",

Results indicated that the more severe stutterers showed improvement during therapy but regressed slightly during the followup period, while those subjects with a less severe handicap maintained their improvement during the followup period. Since the progress of the subjects was not statistically significant, it was concluded that modifications of the therapy program were necessary for more effective and  lasting results.

Serial Multiple Discrimination Teaching Examinations (Teaching Tests or TT's) have been so used in an introductory psychology course attended by 5,000 students in the last five years. Since these tests have a low chance factor (the probability of getting a single question correct by guessing can be as low as 1/6,250), students do not guess. They study instead, and many of them have made perfect scores (40 consecutive errorless questions). Studies have shown that students taught by these examinations earn a higher proportion of correct answers and have a wider range of scores than those taught by other objective exams; they also scored above the mean on new  exams over comparable material which were prepared by professors at other universities; and item analyses have consistently shown larger discrimination indices and higher internal consistency coefficients for TT's than for True False or Multiple Choice questions.

The primary measure of individual differences of subjects involved in the study was that of intelligence quotient (I.Q.). The study attempted to determine whether or not treatments might be differentially designed in order that individual differences of this nature might be adequately accommodated. The subjects, 319 senior high school students, were divided into six treatment groups which were matched as nearly as possible on the variables of sex and age; each of these three groups was further subdivided into three I.Q. groups in order to analyze performance relative to intelligence. Information was presented in  formats ranging from visual only through various visual-verbal treatments to one that was verbal only. Subjects were then tested for recall. Analysis of test results suggests that no single treatment was more effective for a given I.Q. group than was any other treatment and that high fidelity, full color visual-verbal presentation of information is the most effective of all the methods of presentation tested.

However, when the ratings were adjusted for the number of associates recalled, either statistically or experimentally, no evidence of systematic  change in the ratings across time was obtained.

When indifferent items were presented following responses to one stimulus, the delivery of either liked or disliked items after responses to the other stimulus produced no systematic changes in discrimination performance. The results support the A-R-D interpretation that attitudinal stimuli (interest items) which elicit emotional responses will also serve as reinforcing stimuli when made contingent upon  instrumental responses.

In the eight studies reviewed, experiments were designed to answer this question and other questions related to it. In three media studies using the same four treatments (oral presentation without visuals, with line drawings, with shaded drawings, and with color photographs), line drawings were most effective in the slide study oral presentation in the videotape study, and relaistic photographs in the programed instruction study. In another study, nine slide treatments having various types of visual illustrations were administered to 1054 high school students. Results indicated that at certain grade levels, color is an important  instructional variable. Three later studies using a videotape of the nine slide presentations on 22-inch monitors, on a 5 by 3-foot front projection image, and on a 6 by 4-foot rear screen image found that students viewing the smaller images did better than those viewing images on the large screens. To summarize: where time is unlimited, simple line drawings are preferable; where time is determined by the students, as in programed instruction, more detailed presentations have greater learning value.

Requirements for the specification of training objectives are discussed. The implications of data-processing technology for improved control over the specification and implementation of training objectives are illustrated in an example of how computer< programs can generate criterion task specifications from relatively simple data bases, and compare student performance with these criterion tasks at a response-by-response level. Thus, where training is concerned with  teaching task performance, both specification and implementation of traing objectives can be considerably improved. (Author)",

Managers of education and training may have different concepts of what they want, as favorable outcomes, than do the investigators doing the research. Classical statistical and experimental designs assume laboratory rigor of control over variables that is seldom possible in the real world of a school or classroom. Yet in the broader perspective of educational institutions, the effectiveness of the institutions is a current issue of fundamental concern in our society. In this report, possibilities for measuring outcomes of training are surveyed, considering training as a form of planned social change. Various approaches are discussed. Illustrations from  the computer-assisted instruction (CAI) literature of recent attempts to measure training outcomes are given. The principal conclusions presented are that the classical four-way design is impracticable for most evaluation studies in training environments; that a policy of &quot;adaptive research for big effects&quot; is apt to be scientifically and administratively desirable; and that current attempts at measurement of training outcomes sill use fairly simple methods.

Since the primacy effect over the functional beginning of such lists was not diminished, the proactive inhibition (PI) hypothesis was rejected. The primacy effect may be due to initial list members being relatively free of PI, spending longer time in a limited-capacity rehearsal buffer or being associated with stronger retrieval cues. Tests of memory showed consistently depressed retention of items immediately preceding a forget cue. This result was considered to be more in harmony with a rehearsal-buffer notion than a  stronger-retrieval-cues position. (Author)",

        "description":"Since it is impractical to have students test patients for hearing loss, training in basic pure tone audiometry is usually inadequate. To remedy this, a simulated audiometer was developed that interfaced with an IBM 1500 instructional system for computer-assisted instruction, and a course of instruction was written in Coursewriter II. The instructional portion of the program was tested with 27 subjects of varying backgrounds in audiology. Sixteen subjects produced acceptable audiograms on the criterion task; of those who did not, all but two showed improvement during the criterion task. No systematic relationships were found between time for the course, number of errors, and final performance. Students performed equally well, whether they had had experience with audiometry or  not. Extension of the course to include more sophisticated audiometric test procedures, addition of an audio capacity, and improvements to the Audiometer Trainer Unit are recommended. It is suggested that the concept can be applied to other health-related devices and training. Appendices include theory and maintenance instructions, an instructional manual, course frames, computer listings, a course outline, an oral postprogram questionnaire, and sample of Unit 3 audiograms.

        "description":"An instructional monitor is a program which tries to detect, diagnose, and possibly help overcome a student's learning difficulties in the course of solving a problem or performing a task. In one approach to building an instructional monitor, the student uses a special task- or problem-oriented language expressly designed around some particular class of problems. Correspondingly, the diagnostic programs in this &quot;special purpose&quot; type of monitor system often utilize information that is specific to the kind of problem being studied. In the SIMON system a different kind of experimental approach has been taken. The student addresses SIMON in an easy and very general programing language rather than a special task language. Using SIMON, students construct programs for systems or  processes which can represent vastly different situations whether from mathematics, biology, physics, engineering, or elsewhere. The student tests his program against a &quot;true&quot; program provided to SIMON by an instructor. At the student's request, SIMON tests his program against its &quot;true&quot; model to determine if it works. If not, SIMON points out where and why it does not. (Author/MF)",

Fifteen students out of a class of 100 used the machines for regular class work; in the laboratory, out of 70 volunteers, 35 were taught by tutors, and 35 were put to work at the dictating machines with tutor assistance as needed. Tutors discovered that by using prepared tapes and the dictating machines, they could teach three times as many students as they had before. The machines were thought to be helpful to the tutors, also, in giving them various insights and was considered unexpectedly useful to non-laboratory students who used them for review. Although laboratory students using the machines did  slightly less well on evaluated final composition than laboratory students not using the machines, the dictating machines were thought to be helpful in bringing recognition of the oral quality in writing and in establishing habits of independent study.

Their opinions were then the basis of a panel discussion by an advisory council that met in Washington, D.C. Questions bore upon the accomplishments, the trends, and the effective use of instructional technology. Some of its accomplishments were considered to be the individualization of instruction, the application of the systems approach to education, the development of trained personnel, the establishment of a public service system of broadcasting, and the demonstrated effectiveness of instructional technology. Among trends mentioned  were the application of research to the development of large-scale systems, cost-effectiveness and accountability measures, and validated multi-media packages. Measures recommended to achieve effective use of instructional technology include: development of training programs, establishment of experimental and demonstration schools, winning educator acceptance, and expansion of efforts to develop instructional materials. Verbatim responses to the questions are listed with the number of persons making each response specified. (MF)",

        "description":"An analysis of a Mexican essay by Samuel Ramos attempts to resolve the issue of whether or not there is a common philosophy in Latin America today. Manuel Mendoza concludes that no such philosophy exists, because the area has not had time to develop an internal character, and as a result, the intellectual and and philosophical concepts are based wholly on European ideals. Many artists in present-day Latin America are finding the means and resources to create a national philosophy. In Mexico, the revolution of 1910 uprooted the indigenous foundation and incorporated it into the prevailing culture borrowed from Europe. Mexican artists feel the effects of an exploding national spirit. Samuel Ramos' essay on the Mexicans and Mexican culture is considered to be an important milestone  toward achieving a national, indigenous philosophy because (1) it is in essay form, a genre most advantageous for expounding a philosophy; (2) it is written in Spanish, a language which lends itself more readily to literary moods than to scientific or technical treatises; and (3) it recognizes the predominance of the European culture and admits to the need for assimilating local traditions into the cultural mainstream.

In October 1968, the Organization of American States (OAS) [Organizacion de los Estados Americanos (OEA)], sponsored a symposium in Brasilia, Brazil, in cooperation with the Brazilian government and the Brazilian National Association of Professors of School Administration. Attending the conference were Brazilian government officials, members of the sponsoring organizations, and consultants and specialists from the United States and 13 Latin American countries. The two dominant themes of the conference emphasized the values of school administration (1) as an instrument for the elaboration, execution, and  evaluation of educational development plans; and (2) in the training and improvement of school personnel. In order to stimulate discussion, two papers were presented. Jack A. Culbertson, the University Council for Educational Administration, Columbus, Ohio, discussed &quot;Administration: Fundamental Tool in the Development, Execution, and Evaluation of Educational Projects&quot;; and J. Querino Ribeiro, of the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, presented a paper entitled &quot;The Education of School Administators.&quot; In this report, written in Spanish, both papers and their accompanying bibliographies are included.

Upon investigation it was clear that a standard course in English was not sufficient to deal with the communication problems caused not only by linguistic difficulties but also by intercultural conflicts. A special course for TA's now emcompasses linguistic practice, intercultural communication workshops, and an introduction to American classroom methods. Many of the assignments are structured to necessitate some form of interaction, as it is felt that social interaction with Americans, even more than class work, effects the greatest progress in fluency. The program has evidenced  increased understanding of intercultural interactions and changed classroom behavior on the part of the TA's. An improvement in English proficiency, however, has not been realized as the TA's \"see no need and no reward for extensive work in English.\" Unless language learning is seen, the author points out, not as an end in itself, but as a means to achievement within integral parts of life and work, there will be no significant language learning.

Spontaneous speech samples were collected \"unobstrusively\" by an observer who recorded, verbatim, the verbal interactions between fifty lower and fifty middle class mother-child pairs in a doctor's waiting room. These interactions were analyzed according to formal categories, such as the number of words used, and to content categories based on the nature or purpose of the interchange. The authors found that the language used by the two different groups  fell into divisions very similar to the language modes described by Bernstein, a lower overall verbal productiveness being typical of the lower class group. The authors feel that if the observations made in waiting rooms can be assumed to be valid for other contexts as well, then this study can be said to support the notion that the home situation gives middle class children an important advantage in school, as well as the idea that compensatory programs may be necessary for lower class children.

        "description":"Acoustic studies have shown that phonetic context can have substantial effects on the cues associated with a given speech sound. The present study investigates whether or not modifications in the acoustic correlates of initial stops and fricatives due to the following vowel can affect phonemic decision processes. In the first of two experiments, C-V syllables comprised of a stop plus a vowel were paired and presented to 36 first-grade subjects in a discrimination task; in the second experiment, fricatives were involved instead of stops. The results for Experiment I showed that subjects discriminated the stops significantly better in long vowel contexts than in short vowel contexts. Results for Experiment II showed that discriminations of place contrasts involving /s/ or /z/ as  well as the homorganic voicing contrasts were not subject to differential vowel effects. Discrimination of /f/ from voiceless /th/ and /v/ from voiced /th/, however, were significantly better in back vowel contexts than in front vowel contexts. Discriminations of /f/ from voiceless /th/ and /v/ from voiced /th/ were found to be significantly more difficult than the discriminations of the other fricative contrasts. Results show that effects of coarticulation affect discrimination probabilities. These findings question theories of one-to-one correspondence between the acoustic segment and the sound perceived.

        "description":"This paper serves as an introduction to a group of papers produced by the Classroom Interaction Project of the Center for Research in Social Behavior at the University of Missouri in Columbia. This project has been chiefly concerned with ascertaining if black-ghetto and white-suburban classrooms use language differently and, if so, in what ways. Finding earlier methods used in classroom interaction research inadequate, the project has concentrated on the development of formal concepts and methods for the analysis of classroom discourse, and these papers are meant, therefore, to illustrate the application of these formal tools for classroom discourse analysis to the problem of racial differences among classrooms. The paper begins with a description of the methods used in producing  the videotape recordings which serve as the data bank for the project. The data bank, which consists of more than 250 videotaped classroom lessons, and the sampling procedures used in obtaining it are then discussed, followed by an explanation of the various stages involved in processing the data. Finally, general conclusions are presented. Although differences between the languages spoken in black and white classrooms were found, there was no indication that black classroom usage is inferior to white classroom usage.

        "description":"This paper argues that traditional techniques of content analysis which have been applied to classroom verbal interaction studies fail to account for certain types of implicit information, and presents a technique, called &quot;reconstruction,&quot; that provides for the inclusion of such information in a content analysis. It is argued that if identical messages (paraphrases) can contain varying amounts of overt information then the case for implicit information and thus reconstruction is supported. In other words, if individuals who interpret messages must supply information which is not overtly available, then this implicit information must be included to obtain frequency counts which accurately reflect the semantic preoccupations of the verbal interaction. The paper first discusses the  existence of implicit information in a communicative event and a technique of reconstruction for discovering that information. The second part presents data to show that reconstruction makes a difference, and in particular that black and white classrooms differ in the degree to which they exhibit implicit information in their discourse. These differences are felt to be substantive. It is also felt that, without such reconstruction, content analyses of classroom discourse generate distorted views of the concerns of participants.

Findings did not support the two major hypotheses that (1) white pupils use complex language more frequently than black pupils, and (2) complexity of language increases with grade level. It was found rather that black and  white pupils in the sample were in different language development cycles, in which whites attained maximum use of complex structures sooner than blacks but where blacks used more complex structures once their peak of development had been reached. It was also found that the classroom language of the teacher tended to reflect that of the pupils.

The author's thesis is that such policies have considered neither the advantages which the child may have if he learns in his native tongue nor the willingness of the non-English speaking groups to learn English. He finds, rather, that official acceptance or rejection of bilingualism in American schools has depended on whether the group involved has been considered politically and socially acceptable, and that the decisions to impose English as the sole language of instruction have reflected the popular attitudes towards that particular ethnic group  and the degree of hostility evidenced toward that group's natural development. The author analyzes the experience of five groups: German-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Japanese-Americans, American Indians, and Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico. He shows the different behavior manifested by the government at various times towards these groups and how the requirement that English be the exclusive school language was imposed or withdrawn as government policy changed. Finally he examines the Bilingual Education Act and what it suggests as a government policy for the future. (FWB)",

Results indicated that black freshmen perceived the communication structure more positively than seniors, and blacks with low grades felt more positively than blacks with high grades. No significant differences were found in the perceptions of black males and black females. Explanations for the results included the possibility that because of the nature of the white university structure there was little black participation in social events, advice  seeking, and contact with those in authority. Consequently, this may have altered the perceptions of seniors compared to freshmen. The possibility was also raised that the university may be concentrating on the blacks who need academic help but ignoring the needs of its other black students. Other results were compared to previous research and it was suggested that a series of studies be conducted on black perceptions of communication structures so that specific changes could be recommended.

In the second section a comparison is made of results produced when ends are separated from, as opposed to conjoined with, means. The third section provides the outline for the new methodology. The key ingredient on a philosophical level is the  distinction Dewey makes between ends in themselves and ends in view. The latter arise out of activity and act as hypotheses to direct but not control activity, while the former are determined before activity and thus provide the very limits for activity. On the educational level the key ingredient is that education be a process of the student determining his own goals and receiving the results of his own planning. (Author/RSM)",

Observers recorded children's behavior as well. Reliability of observations by both teachers and observers was found to be adequate.

The factors were: (1) amount of repetition, 5, 25, 45, or 65; (2) reinforcer, good or bell; and (3) satiator, good or bell. Two additional groups were run as control groups to determine the effectiveness of good and bell in the absence of satiation treatment. Following the experimental treatment, Ss were given 50 learning and 25 extinction trials on a fixed color-position discrimination learning task. Support for stimulus satiation and satiation generalization was found on both learning and extinction data. The obtained functional relationships were generally curvilinear. (Author)",

Hypotheses tested were: (1) participants would show a greater increase in attitudes and behaviors conducive to growth of children than their matched controls, as well as a greater increase in their sense of fate control; and (2) preschool experimental children would show greater behavior change than the control youngsters. The sample consisted of one middle and one lower class experimental group, and one middle and one lower class control group. There were five mothers in each group. Findings show that experimental group mothers, regardless of class, differed  significantly from their matched controls in showing an increase in rejection of the homemaker role by the end of the year, and that mothers in the lower class experimental group evaluated their daycare children as being more dependent at the end of the year than at the beginning. Increased dependence upon significant adults is considered desirable in lower class children since it suggests an increased susceptibility to influence by future teachers.

        "description":"This study is concerned with the effects of creativity training programs and teacher influence on the development of creativity. An attempt was made to answer the following questions: (1) are two programs equally effective in developing divergent thinking and in fostering positive attitudes about creativity and a self-concept as a creative thinker? (2) does active participation of the teacher facilitate or inhibit the effectiveness of instruction? (3) does the teacher's divergent thinking ability influence the effectiveness of instruction? and (4) are there differential effects due to the interaction of the above three factors? Fifth grade teachers (20) and 473 pupils participated in the investigation. The teachers were identified as high or low on divergent thinking and teachers  in each of these categories were assigned randomly to one of the four treatment conditions. Although the results are complex they suggest that the Productive Thinking Program seemed somewhat more productive than the Purdue Creative Thinking Program, particularly in the absence of teacher involvement in the former program. It is also suggested that the teacher's level of divergent thinking ability may have little bearing on the effects of the programs in general. (RSM/Author)",

The research indicates that there are valid predictors of these outcomes. Classroom teachers of selected elementary grades nominated, for study, aggressive/disruptive children and socially acceptable/productive children. Random samples were drawn. For all the studies, predictors and criteria are made explicit. Significant predictors were found for later social adjustment: (1) classroom behavior traits, (2) arithmetic achievement, (3) response to a sentence completion test, (4) a child's parents' marital relationship, and (5) maternal discipline. Significant factors  were also found for academic achievement: (1) teacher ratings of social adjustment, (2) I.Q., (3) sex, (4) scores on a behavioral problems checklist, (5) parents' education level, and (6) classroom behavior. Both poor social adjustment and low academic achievement are correlated with aggressive/disruptive behavior and all three are correlated significantly with eventual delinquent behavior in the community. Early identification and individualized intervention are urged. Remediation and behavior modification are highly recommended. (TL)",

        "description":"This questionnaire survey of the interracial attitudes of a representative sample of 638 black youths in Washington, D. C. in 1968 replicates a similar one done in 1966, and compares 1968 patterns with 1966 patterns. In addition it concerns itself with identification, political views, vocational aspirations and expectations. The basic findings are that willingness for personal associations with whites decreased slightly between 1966 and 1968, but remained on the positive side of the scale. Black awareness increased although the preponderant majority chose the term 'Negro' rather than 'Black' for self-identification. Political stance was primarily moderate, with most considering themselves 'American', contributing to a picture of dual identity in both the drive and drift toward  first-class citizenship. Dropouts continued to be less accepting of whites than in-school youth although the gap became smaller by 1968. With the diversity of sentiment and inclination, a rationale can be found for almost any kind of racial reform program, pluralism appearing to be the most acceptable and democratic. The schools, as only one of the major national institutions, cannot by themselves achieve such a complicated societal goal, but can route their programs in the desired direction. (Author/CJ)",

Each was unexpectedly confronted with a scheduled delay during which time he was invited to wait in a waiting room where his behaviors were observed and analyzed. Multivariate and subsequent univariate analyses of variance indicated that: (1) curiosity increased with age, black children were more curious than non-black, no sex differences existed; (2) problem solving ability  increased with age, with boys being more successful ultimately than girls; and (3) persistence appeared to be related to age but not to sex or race.

Subjects were women students at the University of Washington, 1968-69. For assessment of basketball competence, indications are that: (1) evaluation, by one individual, of films of play can be highly reliable as a measuring method of skills but not knowledge; (2) film evaluation cannot assess knowledge; and (3) skill evaluation cannot be used to indicate knowledge. Swimming competency was assessed using both a written test and self-estimates of two random samples. Comparisons made between the test and self-estimates reveal comparable results for the two samples. Conclusions indicate that: (1) self-estimate cannot be  the sole measuring device employed; and (2) scores on the written test used here cannot be used as an accurate measure of competency. Evaluation by qualified judges of gymnastics performance indicates that film evaluation of skill, rating by the course instructor, and rating by a high level performer who has competed can all be valid measures of competency.

Six agents of socialization are identified: family, primary social environment, extrafamilial role model, school, secondary social environment, and voluntary associations. It was suggested that the relative importance of each agent would shift over time, moving from family primacy in childhood to secondary social environment and voluntary association. Examined also is some material on student perceptions of possible futures. A ranking by students of socializing agents in their own lives  indicated that the family fell from first to second place, but no further. In general, students felt optimistic about the future in areas where they felt they could make a personal input and less so where they felt they could not. Considering the constraints of the present domestic and world situation, the strong possible feelings about the future are almost surprising. (Author/CJ)",

The main findings relate to the establishment of reliability for the main components of the Revised Behavior Scores System developed to assess the basic processes taking place in settings using GGI as a therapeutic technique. This system is derived from the scoring categories, surscores, and scoring conventions developed by Borgatta and Crowther (1965) in the Behavior Scores System. Subjects were members of two groups of male delinquents undergoing GGI at a correctional facility in Tallahassee in the summer of 1970. Results indicate that in general the system is sufficiently  reliable to generate sound data, although data generated for the surscores and the single scoring convention used indicates that these components in the analysis system should not be used for gathering quantifiable data. The system should yield highly reliable data relative to the behavior occurring in therapy groups while providing measures of the learning processes accounting for such behavior. (Author/CJ)",

        "description":"The author examines the data from the Richmond Youth Project. Questionnaires were administered to and completed by 4,077 students in the eleven public junior and senior high schools. The students were categorized by degrees as rebel or nonrebel according to three criteria: (1) whether they had stayed away from school just because they wanted to, (2) whether they had been sent out of the classroom, and (3) whether they had been suspended from school. The analysis focuses on rebels' personal characteristics, their perception of future status, and the relevance of their school experience to their futures. Samplings of the total data are presented and indicate that the rebel: (1) is extremely anxious about his future, (2) feels that teachers want students to be quiet, (3) is a  terminal student in a system which is primarily preparatory for college, and (4) is not facilitated by the curriculum in a satisfactory identity development. The concluding discussion emphasizes the need for individualizing curricula and for initiating thoroughly integrated work and study programs. (TL)",

The bulk of the paper is devoted to describing the bases and procedures of two group approaches which the author uses with underachievers. One of these, the Human Potential Seminar, is specifically designed for those persons who are not using their potentiality but would like to be. The process is described. The other approach, termed Success Groups, focuses on those students who underachieve in order to demonstrate independence or retain dependence on their parents. These \"committed\" underachievers must be  interrupted in their efforts. Contracts are made with the group and written commitments to specific grade point achievement goals are demanded. While academic achievement is the overall goal (success rate = 72%), results also indicate markedly improved self concepts. (TL)",

An informal, eclectic approach to education is recommended and several suggestions offered: (1) drug information courses and/or dissemination of information to administrators, faculty, residence hall advisors, etc., (2) the informal use of low-pressure publications, and (3) cooperation with students, previously involved with drugs, who want to help. A close scrutiny of existing services and their effectiveness in responding to  student needs is urged. Other areas broached include: (1) confidentiality, (2) the use of extra-university agencies, clinics, drop-ins, etc., (3) the university's role vis-a-vis current drug legislation, and (4) the appropriateness of institutional discipline.

An effort was made to separate 247 children into \"auditory\" and \"visual\" subjects on the basis of their performance on two immediate memory sub-tests from the revised (1968) ITPA. Since the correlation for the Visual test did not reach the specified level of .85, the intended comparison of \"auditory\" vs. \"visual\" subjects could not be completed. Instead, a comparison was made of within Auditory Strength (on high vs. low performers') decision strategies. The prediction that High Auditory performers would make fewer errors while \"learning the task\" but would be more responsive to the monotony of the task and would therefore be more apt to vary their choices in the  stable-state than would the Low Auditory Sequencers was only partially confirmed. Additional hypotheses were tested. Results are discussed in light of recent sensory modality literature and children's functioning in probability decision tasks. Study limitations are assessed.

This paper suggests evaluation methods especially appropriate to such projects by applying a systems approach to the evaluation design.

These three evaluation methods provide information to facilitate decisionmaking during the course of the project, instead of postponing evaluation until after completion of the project. This type of continuous evaluation system  should be an important part of any innovation program. (Figure 4 on page 30 may reproduce poorly because of marginal legibility.) (RA)",

This model describes aspects of staff utilization according to variables universal to all school staffing procedures. Individualism, collegiality, professionalism, workflow structures, perpetuation structures, systems self-renewal, and accountability are the variables that constitute a staffing structure. Since each is a continuum and relatively independent from the others, a school staff may be characterized as having developed to a certain degree along a continuum for any variable. It is then theoretically possible to provide comparative measures among a variety of staffing innovations, to obtain pre- and  post-innovation measures in a single school, and to obtain growth measures for one or more variables.

Resource allocations and education facilities planning are based on these projections. In most American cities, the political power of various interest groups negates the effectiveness of enrollment projections. This situation exists because (1) principals and teachers, anxious to improve their positions, compete among each other for scarce resources, and (2) external political forces from community groups, home and school associations, and citizen watchdog committees place pressures on the school board and administration to alter priorities and to expand or curtail funding and staffing levels. To  avoid inequities brought about by pressure groups, educational planners should rely on rigorous research methodology and management planning techniques. (RA)",

Using samples of 100 elementary, 100 secondary, and 100 unit districts from Illinois, regression analysis showed the second theory to be more nearly correct.

        "description":"The purpose of the research was to determine which community characteristics, among the 29 studied, were statistically most useful as predictors of per-pupil Federal aid to the 169 school districts of Connecticut. Three regression models were developed using community traits as predictors of Federal aid allocations. Community characteristics reflecting need -- as defined by law -- were found to be the best predictors in all three models. A judged rating of the town's organization and aggressiveness in the pursuit of Federal funds was also a significant predictor. Multiple correlation coefficients for all models were significant at the .01 level, and cross validation indicated little shrinkage. (Author)",

Planning should be a continuous process that recycles annually and involves both the government operating agencies and the entire community.

The more established philosophy orients itself to the efficiency of the whole system, while the second orients to particular groups and claims that adequate participation in the system is denied these groups as well as those for whom planners play an advocate role. This paper argues that the efficiency of the whole system and the needs of disadvantaged groups must be furthered. Two kinds of knowledge can contribute to solving the dilemma: (1) concepts and measurements of the attribute and benefit distribution through the system and across groups and localities; and (2) theories capturing the dynamics of redistributive processes, linking the  fortunes of groups to characteristics of the whole system.

This paper makes three major objections to Kasper's study: (1) its use of State data as the basis for observations in the cross-sectional analysis despite the concentration of unionization and salary determination at the local district level; (2) its use of average salaries in the State as the dependent variable; and (3) its omission of the structure of the school districts in the State, an important offset or aid to unionization goals. The authors argue that disaggregation from the State level to the district level is the only way to avoid bias caused by weighing different types  and sizes of districts equally. (Author/JF)",

Instruments were developed to (1) compare a sample of demonstration classes with regular gifted and nongifted classes, (2) rate centers on the degree of detail provided to explain the program to visitors, and (3) record teacher interviews and visit and postvisit reactions. The paper contends that the centers can be judged successful in achieving the immediate goals of effective  dissemination and demonstration on innovative models, but cannot be so judged in the most important goal of convincing local schools to adopt the models.

Through sociograms and the Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire (OCDQ), five hypotheses of informal organization relationships were tested. Four hypotheses were supported by sociometric and statistical analysis: (1) teacher interactions surpass teacher attributes in explanation of variance, (2) teachers can be classified as influentials or noninfluentials from measures of their behavior and attributes, (3) isolated teachers perceive teacher behavior differently than nonisolated teachers, and (4) the principal's socially of control consists of eight or fewer subordinates. The hypothesis, that socially active teachers  perceive principal behavior differently than nonsocially active teachers, remained unsupported. (RA)",

The children were administered medical examinations, educational and psychological tests, and were rated by their teachers on the Walker Behavior Checklist. Results showed that only one child from the sample of 97 was inappropriately placed in an EMR class. Although IQ scores revealed 14 other children with IQ's above 80, it was concluded that the evidence of educational performance and medical information justified the placement. In relation to the value of the  forms used by the Oregon Board of Education, indications were made for the need of more stringent visual and hearing acuity tests and for the inclusion of standardized educational tests. The danger of placing a child in an EMR class primarily on the basis of an IQ score was emphasized. (RD)",

Analyses of student performance indicated that subjects with internal locus of control and analytic cognitive style gave more correct responses in the initial acquisitions phase than did externally controlled and global children. No difference was observed in the final acquisition block; however, when composite correct responses were analyzed, the analytic children were found superior to global children.

Nine papers report perinatal studies on such topics as obstetric history, obstetric trauma, fetal head position, maternal pelvic size, birth position, intrapartum uterine contractions, and related fetal head compression and heart rate changes. Five special studies of the developing  brain concern trauma during labor, trauma to neck vessels, the immature brain's reaction to injury, partial brain removal in infant rats, and cerebral ablation in infant monkeys. The following aspects of the premature infant are discussed in relation to MR in five papers: intracranial hemorrhage, CNS damage, clinical evaluation, EEG and subsequent development, and hematologic factors. Five papers on postnatal trauma examine subdural hematoma and its etiology, the battered child, an interdisciplinary prospective study, and intellectual sequelae of coma due to acceleration concussion.

It was suggested that tasks themselves, as well as reinforcers, provided information to the individual concerning his behavior. Results were interpreted as generally supporting the hypothesis. Implications were drawn for the use of reinforcers in the classroom, the role of task interest in curriculum design, and the need to consider individual differences in motivational  orientation when selecting instructional materials and methods.

The focus of the program was on productive cooperation between parents and professionals. During a period of 2 years, 45 families completed the program. The program consisted of individual instruction with a parent, and parent and professional group meetings on a regular basis. The researchers felt the program of direct approach to parents offered an effective, realistic approach to the very young emotionally disturbed child to whom traditional therapies were often unavailable. It was concluded that the approach improved the mental health of the family by strengthening the parents' self concept and  enabling them to use themselves more productively as family members. (CD)",

Three measures of input organization employed were category clustering, associative clustering, and subjective organization. Subjects were presented with five stimulus lists of 12 words each, and were given 12 trials on each list. Results showed that EMR boys demonstrated less category clustering and recall than normal boys on the categorized list, and less associative clustering and recall on a stimulus list composed of high-associative paradigmatic noun pairs. Difference in recall between the groups on a stimulus list of high-associative  syntagmatic word pairs was significantly less than the difference in recall on a list of high-associative paradigmatic noun pairs. EMR boys also exhibited significantly less recall than normal boys on stimulus lists of low-associative paradigmatic and low-associative syntagmatic word pairs. (Author/KW)",

During the project period (1965-1968), 784 referrals were received; of these, 330 cases were accepted for services. The cases closed as successfully rehabilitated during the project period numbered 140, representing approximately 42% of the cases accepted for services.

Significant correlations between balance ability and reading level were found in only about 40% of the sample, indicating that learning difficulties of EH children may be categorized into balance related and balance unrelated. Three experimental subsamples were given a short term, structured, and programed balance training of equal duration (6 weeks), starting at different dates. One subgroup under the age of 9 and of average intelligence showed significant increase in reading ability after training when compared to controls matched for IQ, age, sex,  father's occupation and balance ability. No experimental effects were apparent in the other two E-groups with higher age and lower intelligence. Nonreaders who also manifested low static balance ability did not improve in equilibrium control nor in reading in spite of intensified balance training of 12 weeks. Trainability in balance was significantly correlated with Performance IQ and reading level prior to the training. Length of stay in EH class correlated positively with reading in those experimentals whose reading improved after balance training. (Author)",

Effects on pupil behavior were determined by contrasting the educational and linguistic achievement and social behaviors in the several instructional arrangements. Researchers concluded that the major impact of the aides alone appeared to be a reduction in undesirable behavior in the classroom and an enhancement of the spelling achievement; class size alone had an effect on arithmetic and classroom behavior, with the standard classes gaining more in math  and manifesting less negative behavior than the increased classes. It was generally felt that the most pronounced effects of the study appeared in the primary classes and suggested to the researchers that administrative strategies other than aides and class size should be developed to enhance the behavioral, linguistic functioning of intermediate educable mentally handicapped pupils.

The Slosson Intelligence Test for Children and Adults, an adaptation of the Test of Social Inference, an adaptation of the Temple informal Reading Inventory, and the Auditory Reception and Verbal Expression subtests from the 1968 Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities were given. The distributions were converted into T-scores and the children scoring above and below a  T-score of 45 (equivalent in the research data to an IQ of 75) on each of the variables were identified. Applying Jastak's concept of multiple criteria led to the authors' suggestion that the diagnosis in 25% of the children in EMH classes may be erroneous in that they scored above the cutting point on at least four of the five criteria. Only 31% of those in the EMH classes failed either four or five of the five criteria. The authors note that the findings support efforts to maintain most children found in EMR classes in the regular classroom through the use of tutoring and resource rooms. (Author/RD)",

        "description":"The study was divided into three major phases: to develop a mathematics curriculum for educable mentally handicapped; to develop a measurement instrument to evaluate the children's learning at various cognitive levels; and to determine the relative effects of two instructional approaches (inductive and deductive), two forms of repetition (exact and varied) and two modes of representation (manipulative and non-manipulative) on the children's mathematical learning. Seventy two subjects from two elementary schools were selected and placed in one of eight program conditions. It was found that the total program, when IQ was allowed to vary, resulted in significant amounts of learning at various cognitive levels. Manipulative modes of application were noted as better facilitating  synthesis level than did nonmanipulative modes of application. The inductive mode of presentation was felt to facilitate the learning of set operations better than the deductive mode, and the two forms of repetition equally facilitated all types of mathematical learning.

The instructional system of the Open University is unique: it employs a multimedia approach and stresses the interdisciplinary nature of the foundation courses. Weekly radio programs and open-circuit television programs will give support to the course work. Part-time class tutors will give regular tutorials at 250 local study centres scattered throughout the country. The Open University was established for social, political, and economic reasons: to give a second chance to adults who were eliminated by the highly selective secondary system in Great Britain. This chance can be given more economically through the Open University than  through a conventional British university. The implications of teaching at a distance depends on the country in which it is happening. In developing countries it may afford a short-cut to a higher education; in the United States, where educational opportunities are more liberally provided, it may represent an alternative to be taken by those who prefer it.

Its Faculty of Science provides instruction in the disciplines of biology, physics, chemistry, and earth science. The philosophy of instruction is anti-specialization, pro-integration; the social impact of science and technology and the social responsibilities of scientists are emphasized. Very soon, 7,000 students will begin the first undergraduate science course to be given, studying in their own homes. They will receive correspondence packages, containing basic course materials; they will have part-time class tutors available to them; they will have access to study centres where they can meet counselors and where they can use the audiovisual  facilities--television, radio, film projectors, tape players, record players, and computer terminals. Another learning resource available to students is summer school. Kits for science experiments are sent to the students by mail. Higher-level courses are being planned; for these, laboratory work will be essential, and arrangements for it will probably be made with conventional universities. Applicants to the Open University have had a modal age of 27 years. (MF)",

In all the industries studied, ITV was introduced no earlier than 1964. ITV programing appeared to be directed toward: orientation of new employees; updating professional employees; skill training in the human relations and communications areas  for supervisory, sales, and personnel employees; and skill training for blue collar employees. Inter-communication between industries, concerning ITV is just now becoming evident. The study concludes that industry is an environment in which major adult educational activities are taking place, thatthe formal educational system is not responding to industry's needs and may be unable to do so, and that industry is proving to be a unique educational environment.

This exception was the Russian three-dimensional film. All the other films were shown on wide screens or multiple screens. Screens were side-by-side, above and below each other, facing each other across a stage, flat on the floor, composed of lenses, and composed of smoke. They were square, triangular, round, hemispherical, and spherical. Screens were reflected by giant mirrors into infinity--before, behind, upward and downward. Multi-image projection was used with varying degrees of effectiveness. Rotatable panels and electroluminescent panels were used. Audiences viewed the films walking through pavilions or riding  through them or sitting down. The spectacular film projections were accompanied by spectacular sound, coming from all possible directions. In addition, the wide use of synthesizer music brought many new sounds to the ear. Besides visiting Expo 70, the author met with the television producer and head of English language teaching at Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK). A Summary is given of NHK's accomplishment in teaching English. (MF)",

Half of a real sample of fifty handwritten responses were submitted to the frame, with a match score of 96% and a sense score of 48%. After revision, the frame attained a match score of 100% and a sense score of 88%, on the other half of the test set. Conclusions drawn from the study were that (1) for an open question with a large number of legal answers and an adult, heterogeneous student set, a striking improvement in meaningful intercept can be obtained through close analysis of a modest number of live responses; and (2) as a  corollary, the rate of improvement to be derived from close analysis beyond this modest number must decline quite rapidly.

This hypothesis was tested and supported by a study conducted in a suburban school of Honolulu. One hundred-five students in grade 9, registered for a biology course, were taken as subjects. The experimental group, consisting of 62 students, read &quot;DNA: The Key to Life,&quot; a linear programed textbook. The control group of 43 students were taught the same text material by the biology teacher in the usual way. The experiment continued for four weeks. A 2x2 multivariate analysis of covariance design was used for analysis of the data, using two instructional methods and two levels of SES as independent  variables, posttest scores on the two achievement tests as dependent variables, and chemistry grade, SCAT-Quantitative, and two pretest scores as covariates. Although the results of the study cannot be generalized, they are very encouraging. It is planned to replicate the study on a much larger sample, at different grade levels, and in different subject areas. The results of the final studies are expected to be very useful for the improvement of individual instructions. (Author/MF)",

The subjects were a sample of 42 vocational school-bound eighth and ninth grade students drawn from the population of students in five junior high schools. The same teacher was involved for the Teacher Only and the Teacher+Film treatment groups; the Film Only treatment group was supervised by a graduate student with no previous teaching experience. The major findings of the study were: (1) students acquired significantly more skill with Teacher+Film than with  either of the other two treatments; (2) there was no significant difference in the acquisition of skill between Teacher Only and Film Only treatment; and (3) as measured by student conversation, shop climate tended to be more conducive to the acquisition of skill in the presence of the intervention.

Two clear effects seem to emerge from the data. During learning, the availability of past examples reduces the load on memory, thus facilitating performance for subjects low on memory ability. Also, subjects with high reasoning ability benefit substantially from more complex examples and seem to be able to utilize availability better than subjects of lower reasoning ability. Since these explanations of complexity effects and all observations on posttest performance are based primarily on post-hoc reasoning,  further studies are recommended to confirm them. (Author/MF)",

This model was compared with a model based upon higher level managers' perceptions of what leads to first-level unit effectiveness. There was an overwhelming importance of production emphasis by both groups, but supervisors were more concerned with immediate or short-run variations in performance, while managers were concerned with total or long-run performance. Supervisors' criteria of organizational effectiveness appear generally reflective of managerial  perceptions and goals, and the four dimensions of the managerial model can be found in the supervisory model. Managers tend to view human relations dimensions as important in themselves, while supervisors view these dimensions as important only as a means to the economic performance dimensions. (Author/MT)",

        "description":"The literature on learning research pertaining to the internal processing operations of the learner was reviewed. The current thinking of learning theorists regarding the nature and importance of these processes in learning and retention is described, and their significance for instructional technology is examined. Verbalization, imagery, and organization engaged in by the learner during periods of rehearsal and self-initiated recall have been shown by theorists to have surprisingly strong positive effects on learning and retention. These internal processing operations, as well as the habit of selective attention, are worthy of immediate consideration by the instructional technologist. Two courses of action are suggested: programmatic research on these processes in the context of  meaningful material, using appropriate \"learning induction mechanisms,\" and reorientation of the goals and methods of instructional technology to give greater emphasis to \"learning to learn.\" (Author/MT)",

Specific properties of letters, pictures, numbers, and sounds comprise the units and structures in the learning of young children. (2) Traditionally, measurement and diagnosis of students followed a \"selection model.\" This practice may be superseded by an \"adaptive model;\" that is, instruction will be modeled on the characteristics of each student. (3) Competence develops in the student as he learns overt and covert  responses that change from simple, unitary responses to large response organizations and strategies and as he learns to respond in appropriate context. (4) The usual measures of learning progress are concerned with the frequency of correct responses, errors in relation to some performance standards, and the speed of performance. Further attempts need to be made to measure transfer of knowledge, problem solving, and self-direction. References are appended. (MF)",

The results showed a superiority of the motion condition. The second study was designed to test the hypothesis that motion functions so as to cue the critical elements of the display. Cuing arrows were added to the videotapes to show the direction of motion. The results again showed the superiority of the motion condition. No effect was attributable to the cuing arrows, and no interaction was observed. For the motion conditions, significantly less time was required to perform the task in both  trials. (Author/JY)",

What are the characteristics of successful mature researchers and what research environments facilitate research of high quality and quantity? Since very little research deals directly with these questions, answers to them are sought in related research literature, and suggestions are made for research that is targeted to this area of investigation. Correlates considered in forecasting success of students are those of previous training and experience, and those of personal and intellectual qualities. Factors considered in determination of characteristics of successful training programs are those of faculty quality, student  quality, institutional setting, and academic content of the training curriculum. Productivity of scientists is found to be related to personality profile, intellectual correlates, and work patterns. Themes that stand out in an appraisal of a research environment are: relationships with other scientists in the research setting, relationships and interactions with administrators and supervisors, diversity of interests and activities in the organization, and finally, physical and financial resources available to the scientist.

Comparable percentages reported in the B.A. survey were 83.9% and 28.3%. Many of the institutions that do not list a foreign language requirement do expect students to complete courses in second languages for certain major fields. Institutions which may not grant the B.S.  degree offer science and mathematics majors a B.A. degree; such non-liberal arts graduates are, thus, required to know foreign languages.

The main thesis of the first of two articles points out that while a producer's first concern must be to communicate the context and spirit of a particular drama to a modern audience, he must also bring out the formal and esthetic qualities which are implicit in the ancient conventions. It is suggested that features to be emphasized include messenger-narratives, formal debates between characters, and particularly the chorus. The second paper explores some practical consequences of these general considerations noting that every play has its own unique problems of presentation. (RL)",

Henning's doctrine of the Latin accentual system of the \"penultimate\" rule is also examined. While the author recommends a reading of Greek verse with strict metrical ictus for a close natural rendering, he does not suggest the application of this system in prose due to an inevitable conflict with a Byzantine rendering of the accent.

The army is heavily involved in education and training; in addition to West Point, there is an Army school system which consists of 2 colleges, 20 branch schools, and 11 specialist schools. Many soldiers have completed high school while in the army, others have improved their basic education, 90 percent of the career officers hold undergraduate degrees, and 25 percent hold advanced degrees. The ROTC programs are of vital importance and great efforts are being made to improve Summer Camp Programs and to provide other useful training programs. The ROTC programs on campus have borne much of the brunt of the antimilitary  feeling currently in vogue, and Professors of Military Science at the institutions hosting ROTC have been given increased flexibility to blend the precepts of the military profession with the philosophies of the institution, and have been encouraged to sustain a meaningful dialogue between the Army and the students. Efforts have also been made to improve the quality of the ROTC staffs. To end the draft will require double or triple the enlistments of quality personnel, and for that a good professional climate, more money, and a better image are essential. (AF)",

This paper reviews (1) some of the books written on general education; (2) the difficulties that general education is experiencing because of its stagnation in the face of major social changes; (3) the factors likely to affect the future course of general education, which include the expansion of the proportion of youth attending college, the changing characteristics of these students and of faculty, the increasingly pluralistic mission of colleges and universities, the growing emphasis on disciplines rather than liberal arts as instruments of human development, the growing power of the individual departments,  and the decreasing consensus on the means and ends in higher education; (4) those areas that have not changed, such as the undergraduate curriculum, and techniques of college instruction; (5) three periods in the twentieth century evolution of higher education curricula; and (6) some undesirable and some essential qualities of the general education programs of the future.

This paper examines the effects of present accrediting activities and the work of regional associations and professional societies on part-time and continuing education. Part-time and continuing education has long been discouraged by the prestigious universities, though the notion of full-time faculty, full-time students, and the community of scholars has in actuality become a myth. Yet these myths are being perpetuated by accrediting teams who have encouraged practices directed against continuing education. Accrediting groups have pressed for greater emphasis on standardized tests for admission, increased efforts at recruitment, broader geographic representation and more financial aid, all aimed at  admission and retention of the full-time student. The Commissioner of Education in New York State has proposed the \"external degree\" which, if accepted, would provide much of the flexibility needed to respond to today's problems and to the demands that our society is making on higher education. Voluntary agencies do not have the authority, nor can they respond quickly enough to the crises faced by higher education, and there is great need for regulation of the educational enterprise by a new administrative agency of the federal government.

The results of this study on personality development indicated that personality development during college is characterized by several major areas of change. At 12 strikingly different small colleges that attract widely varying students, the direction and magnitude of net change on 13 Omnibus Personality Inventory scales was very similar. When subgroups of students with similar entering characteristics were studies at different colleges, direction and magnitude of change varied. The variations in change were systematically related to college  emphasis, student characteristics, student-faculty relationships, teaching, study activities, and reasons for study. Where a comfortable fit occurred between student and college, personality development proceeded along several widely shared vectors of change. For deviant students within different colleges, vectors of change differed, depending upon the particular relationship between the student and his college. (Author/AF)",

There is also increasing demand for changes in residence requirements at the master's level, because many of those pursuing this degree hold full-time jobs. Changes are also necessitated by the technological revolution in education. At the University of Illinois, PLATO, a computer-based education system, is already in wide use, and there is every reason to believe that by the mid-1970's a statewide PLATO network will begin to break down the lockstep of the formal educational process. This will mean that the University will be able to reach over hundreds of miles, with persons completing  courses without ever having been on campus. It will make residence requirements obsolete. At the graduate level the substantive reasons for residence requirements will have to be re-examined, for it is not so much that the doctoral student needs the institution, as that the institution needs the doctoral student, for graduate students play a vital role at the center of the university's intellectual life. The role of the graduate student is changing, as is the society he lives in, and this must be taken into account when resident requirements are being established. (AF)",

This year's budget will probably not allow any money for generalized traineeships, there will be a modest increase in research support, some money for fellowships and limited amounts for other projects. There will be some administrative changes in traineeships and fellowships, with an increase in the stipends and the abolishment of the dependency allowance. Educational costs are high because a larger proportion of the population is being educated at all levels in this country than anywhere else. There are too many Ph.D.'s and too many B.A.'s, while there is a shortage of mechanics. There is a great need to  set up additional hierarchies of prestige to the verbal-intellectual one, with education focusing on occupational training with liberal arts subjects at the periphery. At the graduate level this means a need for different programs, such as programs for teachers of science and mathematics and programs for science practitioners. In its support for training programs, the Foundation will look for something other than training in the traditional disciplines, and university support for applied programs will be an important factor.

This last degree is often awarded by independent colleges which either do not have a Ph.D. program, or are just thinking about getting one underway, and the student with this degree has often to go to a major university for the completion of his doctorate. The situation is different for engineering, where the pursuit of the master's degree is generally a part-time  occupation, and where the degree itself has been downgraded over the last 5 years. The Ph.D., much more theoretical in nature, is being pushed in engineering. This is only acceptable if the fact is not overlooked that the nuts and bolts engineer is as important as his theoretical counterpart. A positive sign is the development of some hyphenated degrees, combining engineering and the natural sciences with some of the social sciences, preparing students to deal more effectively with the social fabric of our society.

In the Spring of 1970, persons with M.I.T. doctorates in physics and chemistry had fewer job choices than those with dotorates in the earth sciences, biology, or mathematics. Of the 3 job markets for doctorates in the natural sciences: industry, government, and higher education, only the latter is expected to grow significantly in the next several years, though the demand in the industrial sector may increase with an upsurge of the economy. The hiring rates in the higher education sector will, however, be a good  deal lower than they have been. This means that Ph.D.'s are currently produced at a faster rate than they are needed, and this trend will probably have to be reversed. As for improving the quality of the graduate programs, students should be trained to: (1) contribute to the solution of society's problems, (2) take on broader responsibilities in industry, and (3) be effective teachers.

In tackling these problems, it would be a great mistake, however, to weaken the classical disciplinary departments. More than 60 new chemistry departments were created since 1960; in June 1969, these granted only 140 Ph.D.'s as opposed to the 1,800 Ph.D.'s granted by the earlier established, 125 departments. There seems to be no need for establishing new chemistry departments, except perhaps for geographical reasons. Chemistry faculty at 4-year institutions should be given more opportunity for leave, and technicians should be used in the conduct of research. In terms of the science curriculum, there is need  for greater flexibility and for encouraging Ph.D.'s to develop greater awareness of peripheral fields. As for scientific manpower needs in industry, inflation and rising costs have forced a reduction in recruitment. Improved business conditions will change this picture. (AF)",

The peak of Federal support was in 1968-69, with funds for fellowships decreasing significantly in the ensuing years. Because of cuts in Federal R&D expenditures many of the new doctorates are no longer as easily absorbed by the job market as in previous years. This situation has caused many departments to limit their admission of new graduate students, and has discouraged institutions from launching new doctoral programs. Because of a continued decrease in Federal support, many institutions may have to eliminate some existing doctoral programs, and serious questions are being asked within the Federal Government about the worth and effectiveness of continued support for advanced education.  High priority areas will probably be the following: (1) assisting the disadvantaged; (2) support for fields where a deficit exists, such as the environment, transportation, and urban studies; (3) strengthening the quality of graduate programs by geographic areas; and (4) some non-categorical support for institutions. Notwithstanding these priorities, present support levels for fellowships and traineeships, though much reduced, will probably be maintained during the next few years. (AF)",

Students are worried about employment opportunities, institutions worry about the quality and quantity of their future graduate programs, and the government worries about an adequate supply of trained manpower for the future. Added to these worries are the increasing suspicion of science on the part of the young, increased employment problems for scientists and engineers, and a limitation of students in the graduate programs, ostensibly for financial reasons. All this has pushed the production of Ph.D.'s downwards. Thirty percent of the doctorates in science are involved in non-academic research, and in this area the Federal Government, the main supplier of funds, has been retrenching.  Though private support for R&D has increased, this trend may not continue. The employment picture of scientists and engineers in higher education will depend on future enrollments. According to projections made by the N.S.F., doctorate production will increase by 60 percent over the next 10 years, graduate enrollment in the sciences and engineering will increase from 60 to 65 percent, R&D expenditures will probably remain at 2.8 percent of the G.N.P., and the supply of scientists and engineers with the Ph.D. will probably be slightly larger that the demand, though this will vary and be more pronounced in engineering.

These trends will probably continue, though the percentage of college teachers with doctorates has been slowly increasing over the last 20 years in the 4-year colleges and universities. The percentage of doctorates in 2-year colleges has remained small, while the number of those with master's has increased. The number of 2-year colleges has increased substantially since 1960 and probably will continue  to increase. Their sources of new faculty have been former high school teachers, the graduate schools, college and university classrooms, and the business occupations. This will probably not change in the near future, with the percentage of doctorates remaining small, and with programs in professional education supplying at least 30 percent of the faculty. It would be advisable to establish a master's degree for college teachers and recruit students for that purpose. (AF)",

        "description":"The research component in the natural sciences does not have to be changed. Ninety-three percent of the students surveyed by Ann Heiss for her book \"The Challenge to the Graduate Schools\" felt that the research component of the natural sciences contributed to their scientific development, and 85 percent felt that it was intellectually stimulating. Eighty-eight percent of the faculty surveyed felt that dissertation research component should remain unchanged. In contrast, only 43 percent of the graduate students in English thought that research contributed to their development. This happy condition in the natural sciences is due to the mutual dependence of professor and student. The student does his first research on a professor's problem and does not do his own research until his  last year. This seems to work to both the professor's and student's benefit. In the social sciences and humanities, students tend to begin on their own and professors tend to view their role as teachers and advisors as a duty role. There are also differences within the natural sciences. The chemist tends to get his doctorate in 4 years, and often takes a 2-year postdoctorate. The physicist takes generally 6 years for his doctorate under the same professor. The 4- and 2- year schedule provides for more flexibility and greater self-selection of the students. (AF)",

These degrees do not generally lead to a doctorate. Other master's degrees are waystations to the doctorate, or are consolation prizes for those who should not go on for a Ph.D. A master's doesn't mean mastery of the subject, however, which is more the criterion of the Ph.D. Those institutions that offer the master's degree as the highest  degree could use it as a means of broadening the understanding of the field rather than duplicating what major institutions tend to do. Economic incentives have been overemphasized not only for baccalaureate education, but also for advanced education, especially at the master's level. Particularly in the humanities and social sciences, the master's degree could be used to help the student appreciate the applicability and relevance of the tools they were taught about as sophomores.

It has become necessary to make the Ph.D. more flexible than it has been, to prepare more than research-oriented specialists.

Some have proposed to limit Ph.D. production to 50, 75, or 100 of the older, more prestigious institutions of higher education. This would have the potential of stifling the intellectual and creative aspects of the degree, because quality and innovation cannot be maintained in all disciplines in any selected number of schools. Some of the emerging institutions have Ph.D.-granting departments that have received the leadership and support necessary to establish a quality  degree, generally in programs for which there is substantial local need and support. In addition, limiting the Ph.D. programs to a few institutions, could create a schism in higher education and become a source for political intrigue. Seventy-three percent of all Ph.D. students are part-time and many of them are at the \"emerging\" institutions. This must be taken into account when the decisions regarding Ph.D. programs are made.

At this point about 1 percent of the babies born 27 years ago gets a Ph.D. This production rate will probably increase to 6 percent of the adult population. With the present situation in higher education, which includes an average retirement after 40 years of service, the supply already outstrips the demand. The problem is, however, that the birthrate is declining, so freshmen enrollment in 1985 will be 20 percent less than freshmen enrollment in 1975. To deal with this future surplus of Ph.D.'s, students must be warned that a Ph.D. does not entitle them to a scholarly job. Students could also be kept longer out of the labor market by prolonging the time it takes to get a Ph.D., by increasing the number of post-doctoral  programs, or by creating a new and more advanced degree. Another possibility would be the establishment of central government controls for the selection of prospective Ph.D.'s and their disciplines. Control could also be exerted by faculty organization that could establish new hiring and retirement policies. Also, foreign graduate students should be allowed to study here only if they intend to return to their native country upon graduation. A final solution may be the establishment of federally supported centers and institutes where Ph.D.'s could do high quality research. (AF)",

In recent years every facet of the PhD has come under attack. The degree will probably be reshaped from a standard of achievement and accomplishment to a standard of potential, from a demonstration of the ability to use certain research skills to mere knowledge of what the skills are. There are three groups that will affect the reshaping of the PhD: (1) Those who plan to obtain the degree because it is the promise to a better life. As more people become aware of this factor, the pressure will increase to do away with the achievement standard. (2) The second group, the current PhD holders, the college faculty, will want to keep the degree  exclusive, especially at a time when the job market is tight. (3) The third group that will affect the PhD is the one that pays for it: the federal and state governments, neither of which seems interested in expansion of PhD programs, and the undergraduate students whose tuition often pays for graduate programs. There probably will be pressure to generalize the PhD degree and the PhD will no longer be the mark of highest achievement as a research degree. (AF)",

This overspecialization has been a major contributor to the depressed condition in modern languages, history, philosophy, and some of the social sciences. Reaction to this specialization has set in with renewed enthusiasm for interdisciplinary programs of study and research. The problem arises with the need for integration of the various methodologies that each discipline has developed. The lack of integration plus the commitment to the culture of  science explain to some extent the charges of irrelevance that have been levied against the social sciences and humanities. It is likely that new generations will come to scholarship with no hesitation of incorporating speculation or vision or insight or values into their publication, because they will have recognized that human existence does not consist solely in accumulating knowledge.

In  both types of institutions about one-half of the freshmen receiving course exemption also received credit toward graduation; (3) departmental examinations, Advanced Placement examinations, and USAFI courses are the mechanisms accepted for advanced standing by the largest number of institutions; and (4) although acceptance of each mechanism has increased at the institutional level since 1968, the proportion of freshmen involved has remained relatively constant.

A special history course was devised that used original documents selected by the students and the instructor in accord with the topics chosen as relevant by a large group of freshmen students. The topics were presented in reverse chronological order, with each topic begun in the mid-twentieth century and independently traced backwards. The material was available in written form and on tape, and the instructor related the material to other forces at work in history. The classes consisted of 16 students; 5 were disadvantaged, 2 were Merit Scholars and the others  represented a cross-section. The students could choose from 4 different testing options for their interim exams, but had to undergo standardized testing at the end of the year. Testing did no occur because of the campus situation in the spring of 1969. Thus, although, there were no objective results to compare what had been learned in this course, as opposed to the standard course, the subjective results were impressive. The students were \"involved\" and enthusiastic and there was minimal absenteeism. The list of documents used are included in the report. (AF)",

Most, because they are often low achieving, minority group, and lower socioeconomic status students, gravitate to institutions having the least amount of student financial aid available. The second section cites statements made by College Opportunity Grant applicants on their needs and problems. Education is seen as a way out not only for the student, but also for the family. The third section  deals with the built-in disadvantages minority and poor students have in applying for financial aid, such as application deadlines, and scholastic and extracurricular considerations.

The vision of the church-related college, this paper suggests, has been modified through the years by changes in denominational polity and attitude; by forces of geography, control, and public favor; and by the financial arrangements that provided the pragmatic matrix of the college's affiliation with its sponsoring denomination. There are, however, three issues that require an explanation before the true dimensions of the church-college's relation to the public good can be outlined. Each of these  issues reflect the image the nation as a whole has of the church-related college.

This paper explores the question: \"what will be lost to American society and the churches if church-related colleges sever their denominational ties?\" Church-related colleges find themselves caught between the remnants of their secular past and the demands of their public present. This has lead to a crisis of identity in most church colleges; and yet it is only when a college asks how it can use its resources for the common good, and when it involves the whole college community in the answer to this question, that the college can move to a deeper faithfulness to its Christian heritage. Increased federal and state support for higher education and the great expansion of public education have also contributed to the crisis. To preserve  the diversity and independence of higher education in this country it is vital that churches continue to exercise a countervailing power against state-supported higher education. Church-related colleges must continue to serve the large number of students within the middle range of abilities and educate them for social involvement and sensitivity. These colleges can also undertake programs for the disadvantaged from all walks of life and educate people for a world of creative diversity. (AF)",

The G.I. Bill of Rights and federal funding for higher education were instrumental in providing growth capital for catholic institutions. These events also precipitated (1) a serious shortage of priests, brothers and sisters to assume the increased responsibilities, and (2) a cost squeeze when federal funds had to be matched. Catholic colleges went public for recruitment of faculty, stdents, board members and eventually administrators. As they did so, they became much more secular institutions. The sixties saw the beginning of the radical questioning of Catholic  institutions, as the call for ecumenicism that flowed from Vatican II began to have its impact on Catholic institutions of higher education. Prominent Catholic educators debated the functions and role of the Catholic college in these moves to secularity, and it is the thesis of this paper that colleges that are public in their charters, goals, purposes, governance, and in their recruitment of students, faculty, and administrators, are not church-related.

The contemporary university is the heart of \"the self-sufficient finitude,\" the autonomous value system which rolls along according to a process that is causal but not directed to ends. The university has become the most relevant system ever devised for the technological society, and it is this relevance, this soul-destroying efficiency, that has brought the university into conflict with the new generation, i.e., those who have an apocalyptic rather than technocratic orientation toward the future. Yet most of the  analyses of \"university trouble\" continue to search for new techniques to improve the system instead of confronting the real issue, which is the conflict between the uses of the multiuniversity and the value system of the new generation. The private college of general education will have to go into spiritual seclusion in order not to succumb to the dominance of technique. In contrast to the multiuniversity, the purpose of the college will be to create an educational experience around those values which form the basis of man's freedom as an intuitive, spontaneous, creating, valuing creature.

Each year approximately 65 students have been brought to the campus for an intensive period of educational, artistic, and recreational experience. This report concerns the post-program educational attainments of the first three summer groups, a total of 195 students. Schools in St. Louis, Mo., and Cleveland, Lorain, Elyria, and Oberlin, Ohio were asked to nominate twice as many individuals from culturally deprived or poverty backgrounds who had some likelihood of success as the program was able to accept. From each school's list pairs were matched as closely as possible, and one from each pair was randomly selected to participate in the program. This study  tried to determine whether the summer experience, plus the follow-up contacts with the Special Opportunity staff, significantly improved the likelihood of a person staying in school, attaining good grades, and for the 1964 group, of entering college. Significance was measured against the performance of the randomly selected controls. This report also describes the method that was used for taking account of the quality of the match and examines the importance of networks of &quot;significant others.&quot; (AF)",

        "description":"It is the author's contention that student government revitalization will come only when student government begins to play a substantive role in policy making and implementation. The purpose of this paper is to consider, criticize, and propose a number of models for student participation in junior college governance. The first, a traditional model, which sees student government as an educational experience, is rejected on the grounds of paternalism and because it is \"in loco parentis.\" The second, a jurisdictional model is rejected because of its emphasis on increased fragmentation and the potential for confrontations of positions arrived at with little prior communication. The author prefers three participatory models. The first is a federal model with a faculty senate, student  assembly, and administrative executive, and with established procedures for intercommunication. The second is a delineation of areas of primary responsibility for faculty, administration, and students. The third, and most controversial model, is a \"college senate\" with faculty and students as voting members. It is stressed that the administration is still a key component in governance and that the models should not seek to eliminate the voice of the administrators or reduce their role to that of token errand boy. In the end, only abilities and rationality of trustees, faculty, students, and administrators will determine the success or failure of any given model. (CA)",

The resident program required 20 persons, who represented five specialities in junior college education, to participate in a concentrated program from June, 1969 to May, 1970 at Auburn University, as well as participate in the in-service program. The in-service program consisted of 99 persons, administrative teams of several junior colleges, who met in a series of seven conferences of two days duration each throughout the year. The following conclusions were reached: (1) development of programs which maximize use of a team-approach in solving simulated  problems adds realism and leads to elimination of barriers caused by specialization; (2) the consortium approach to development, program planning and execution is successful; (3) use of a common experience core provides the basis for teamwork and leads to a greater understanding of the application of specialization to common problems; (4) participants were pleased with the operation of the program; (5) there is evidence that participants plan to implement change at their colleges as a result of this program; (6) the internship experience must be carefully developed and supervised.

The most popular subject for comparative study is the transfer student vs. the non-transfer student. Other studies involve selection of vocational/technical programs, initial or deferred decisions regarding school majors, and characteristics of different schools. The author questions the worth of such studies. Rather than compile information on groups at one point in time, she suggests, it would be better to establish common data sources and compare the effects over a period of years. Many in the junior college field are dedicated to a curriculum designed to meet identifiable educational needs of disadvantaged students. The second half of the review attempts to answer (1) how  remedial programs affect the student and (2) how pertinent they are to the lives of those they purport to serve. Disadvantaged and/or remedial students need options they can visualize as real opportunities. This will require assessment and variations in admission requirements, counseling, testing, and/or success criteria. (CA)",

Stern for 4-year colleges are applied to 2-year institutions specifically with students enrolled in programs to prepare them for employment. A survey was made of: (1) all freshmen, at a community college and a technical institute, who were enrolled in four specific occupational curricula; (2) those students who continued in the curricula into a fourth term; and (3) those students who subsequently dropped out. Results were based on demographic characteristics, scholastic aptitude, and expectations for environmental press. The findings suggest: (1) within a narrow range of variation between environmental press in the community college and the technical institute,  public images of the two schools were not sufficiently different to attract students with different expectations for environmental press or divergent personality needs; and (2) the findings on variations between personality needs of students who continue and those who drop out suggest a differential selective retention power based on variations within a narrow range of intellectual interests and motivation.

Achievement and noncognitive measures were used in analysis. The two methods of analysis used were: (1) descriptive, where remedial and regular groups were compared according to pre-selected variables and obtained correlations between remedial and regular course grades for remedial groups; and (2) covariance analysis, used to increase precision in randomized  experiments and to examine group performance in college courses, controlling for ability as measured by English achievement test scores. Remedial students tended to have higher grades on first regular English courses than students who were assigned directly to regular courses. There were fewer significant differences in mathematics courses.

The present Quality Control Model of Faculty Development is widespread, deeply entrenched, and grounded on assumptions and premises that are limited, obsolete, and contrary to the interests of students, instructors, college, and community. Alternative models go beyond evaluation while still anchored to a basic substructure of procedural safeguards and academic due process in the administration of tenure. Such models begin with a judgment of competence over the wide range of growth needs of the faculty member. One alternative model introduced in this paper is the Development Model for Faculty Growth and Evaluation. Speculations are  offered on what outcomes could be expected from it. (Author/CA)",

The concept of accountability is based on specifically defined objectives and measurement techniques that determine exactly what the teacher intends to accomplish, and instructional methods that guarantee that most students will obtain the objectives. The change strategies presented are designed to breach the barriers to change by employing methods that cause the entire institution to become accountable to students and the community. An eight-point plan for change is considered. For a college to be successfully accountable, change must be planned and incorporated into a management strategy. The  effectiveness of the strategies advocated in this report depends on the strength of the college president, the total support of him by the college board, and a suitable time period in which to implement programs. The accountability model presented in this report is applicable to any community college if implemented within a broad, flexible framework of planned change.

The programs of urban outreach are: student service corps; community development centers; an enrichment program; and a scholarship program. It is suggested that community action must really be community-based to succeed. A program cannot be bound to pre-conceived ideas or plans of action. Among the significant impacts of the project on the college are: expansion of adult education programs; greater ethnic balance in staffing; less  bureaucratic procedures in areas such as registration; and revised credential requirements that stress community experience rather than academic training. As the college reached out, community attitudes and awareness of the college's service role changed. Among project weaknesses are: less-than-expected success in instigating new community leadership; early mistakes in delegation of responsibility; and failure to specify researchable questions by which to evaluate the project. Twelve recommendations are discussed. Other community colleges considering outreach programs can look to the Inner City Project as a partial model. (CA)",

This study has also  (1) stressed the need of the Division of Vocational and Technical Education for accurate cost data, (2) pointed out some limitations of the Unit Cost Study conducted by the Illinois Junior College Board, (3) described some of the problem areas and weaknesses of methods used to allocate costs, and (4) provided recommendations implementing an accurate program cost identification system.

It is believed that the load policy of counselors is affected by power politics, as it is much more variable for counselors than for instructors. There is an indication that the present variance will diminish over time. Some pressure toward a more uniform load policy is the result of counselors seeing themselves and their profession as distinct, and seeing value in cooperative efforts designed to preserve and enhance their status.

The training program was evolved for and by students. Training consisted of 40 hours one week before the beginning of each semester, plus two hours a week in-service training for four semesters. The average caseload was 12-15 counselees per peer counselor. The program, ideally, was staffed by  professionals from the psychology department, but had the cooperation and support of the entire institution. Two program objectives were: familiarize the peer counselor with the factual information most needed by students; and enable the counselor to be confident of his ability to function at an affective level. Although there are several areas of difficulty for implementation of a peer counseling program, the evaluation of the Los Angeles project indicates peer counseling on academic and subjective grounds is very effective. It is hoped that the project will stimulate experimentation and replication by other colleges. (CA)",

The problem of this study was to determine if library services, meaning of orientation, extent, use, and accessibility of books, materials, equipment and services by a qualified librarian, would produce a measurable increase in academic achievement over that of students who are not exposed to similar resources. The investigation involved two groups of twelfth grade students. One group used extensive library services with independent study under a librarian's supervision; in  the other group library services were incidental. Comparing College Verbal Scholastic Aptitude Test scores for each group before and after the study, it is evident that academic achievement can accrue when students are exposed to library services.

With the learning resources concept, instructors will be more prone to look upon media not with the idea of why it should be used in teaching, but how it can be used in order to do a more effective job of teaching. The effective use of media will necessarily be based on individual student need, and will permit the instructor to become the creative synthesizer of the learning process rather than the regimented dispenser of knowledge. The learning resource concept will more effectively permit the new teaching technique and approaches to reach all of the faculty. The provision of a one-stop total service will tend to create faculty interest and use. The very concept of learning resources will  allow a college to take a far more effective management approach toward the use of media in order to insure the most effective use of personnel.

Public libraries are reaching approximately ten to twenty percent of the total population of the community.

Librarians must not only state the nature of the libraries' case before the general public, but, also, be able to \"sell\"  the libraries' programs and services within the general \"market\" of ideas, goods and services. It is also necessary for librarians to \"re-create\" the present day library in order to make it more effective and functional in the light of present day society's needs.

Four areas were chosen as a framework for participation: recognition of common problems, assimilation of materials, development of background preparation and planned performance of individual service. The four work sessions were planned to insure participation and also to demonstrate all the techniques available to a consultant who hopes to develop leadership in working with groups of people. During the three days each individual was part of a changing group of consultants urged to give thoughts to various areas of common interest, to ask questions, to comment and to exchange ideas. The work sessions were concerned with: (1) recognizing common problems, (2)  materials useful to state library consultants, (3) the consultant in action and (4) demonstration: library board meeting. The other five sessions consisted of: two luncheon and one dinner speaker, a reactor panel and an evaluation of the workshop. A roster of participants and a bibliography are also included. (NH)",

The ERIC system contains over 40,000 education documents. As the New York ERIC liaison, the New York State Research Coordinating Unit (RCU) has actively incorporated the ERIC system into its service-oriented functions. To establish a network for the effective dissemination of ERIC resource materials the RCU enlisted the cooperation of 32 institutions within the State, each having an ERIC microfiche collection, microfiche readers, and a subscription to &quot;Research in Education&quot; (RIE). The establishment of this network has led to three phases of operation: (1) the input phase--documents received by  RCU are evaluated and sent to Central ERIC for possible inclusion in the ERIC system, (2) the output phase--provides availability of information to local educators in New York, and (3) the utilization phase. It is hoped that unanswerable questions will lead to research projects in needed areas. Putting Research into Educational Practice (PREP) is a new and unique research and report service which focuses on current educational problems which are studied by qualified researchers; the results of this research are prepared as PREP documents.

The survey showed that, although there was great homogeneity among the collections, there was also considerable diversity among the special and unique holdings. Included in the recommendations for effecting cooperation through CONVAL were: CONVAL librarians actively participate in all aspects of academic planning; CONVAL be incorporated; each CONVAL library contribute  equally to its maintenance; each library write an acquisitions policy statement; interlibrary loan privileges be extended to all classes of borrowers within the consortium; the CONVAL Director investigate the use of other storage facilities and make compacts with large libraries for access to their collections; teletype units be installed in all libraries and fully exploited in interlibrary lending; all libraries adopt the Library of Congress classification system and that Dartmouth be designated as the CONVAL Research Center for Automation.

Several papers on problems of library service to youth were presented, and the conferees then met in small work groups for further discussion. The needs of youth and the objectives of library services to youth were outlined.

        "description":"The present examination shows that the classification scheme of the Library of Congress (LC) must be considered as unsuited for use in Danish and, in all likelihood, other non-English language libraries as well. The book collection of the Library of Congress on which its bibliographical service rests, is possibly more special than would first be imagined. As far as the classifying process is concerned, LC is unsuited for systematizing on various levels, including simplification for use in open shelving. Neither is it immediately amenable to other types of adaptation required for non-Anglo-American libraries for language reasons. LC does not have the same receptiveness and flexibility to enable the user to use different paths of access to the same literature and at the same time  afford purposeful browsing. It lacks firm structural principles which certainly can lead the classifier and to the correct place. (Author/MF)",

        "description":"A basic description of the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) and how it can be utilized by the practicing librarian is presented. PPBS is described as a system of relating planning to budgeting that seeks to get your dollars worth for you by analyzing what you are doing in the light of what you should be doing and plan to do in the years to come and tieing that back to your standard yearly budget. The importance of having clearly defined program objectives is stressed. A planning budget must follow a generally standard pattern which is introduced by intensive thinking or analysis about the library needs of the community and followed by an analysis of the potential and actual benefits of the library's services. Six steps needed to effectively use PPBS are: (1)  critically define broad goals and objectives, (2) lay out a program structure, (3) set out the objectives for each program, (4) detail every possible way of attaining each objective, (5) make a cost-effectiveness study of the alternate approaches of each alternative and (6) formulate rules of standards by which to rank the alternatives in order of desirability. This procedure should be applied frequently to new problem areas -- at least each budget cycle. (NH)",

Emphasis has been placed upon the response of libraries to their environments. The library &quot;stakes out claims&quot; or establishes domains with regard to resources, users, and policies. Libraries then seek to have the environment acknowledge the validity of these claims. This process of establishing &quot;domain consensus&quot; is a critical activity of organizations and is a prerequisite for the formation of cooperatives. Contributions from the theory of coalition formation were utilized in order to conceptualize the process of library cooperative formation. Interaction between organizations has been viewed as an exchange system into which libraries enter becuase they expect to  receive benefits in exchange for the resources they contribute. Two aspects of the exchange system were considered. The process of formation was examined, followed by an examination of some variables which affect the policies and performances of established systems. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the parameters and the manner in which each paramater affects the system. (Author)",

The six libraries active in the procurement of foreign language items do not have a uniform acquisition policy and no real attempt  is made to acquire all materials in all specific subject areas. Translations are procured on the basis of need and no acquisitions people had language/subject abilities. In most agencies, the materials first go to pertinent foreign desks and then to the library which acquires the items after use for permanent storage.

On the contrary, all the relevant documents in the small collection are the same as those in the large collection. The research work done does not give information to what extent the sampling method gives practical results. A more attractive method would be to accept figures obtained in the Cranfield Project for recall ratios at various coordination levels. In the Cranfield Project, coordination level of 3 means that out  of 7-10 search terms all possible combinations are taken, but are counted only once independent of which terms match. This is inherent to the scan-column index technique used in the project, which is not easy to imitate in operational systems using computers, machine punched cards or manual punched cards.

The second paper, \"The Specific-to-General See Reference in Thesaurus Construction\" advances the proposition that the employment of the specific-to-general see reference is a faulty element in the structure of subject access vocabularies. The reference aknowledges the existence of a specific subject but denies the searcher direct access to material on that subject through a specific  subject heading or index term. As a consequence, review of an undeterminable amount of non-relevant material is required in the retrieval process. The specific-to-general see reference should be vocabularies.

Early planning decisions which contributed to the success of the institute were: (1) methodology--there were no lectures and no drop-in experts, the group would build its own expertise; (2) participation would be limited to the larger Indiana Public Libraries; (3) each library would be represented by its chief librarian and the adult services librarian who would work directly to implement change; (4) the institute would be divided into several parts--planning, experimentation back home, evaluation and  problem solving, follow-up communication and evaluation for a period of two years and (5) the final objective of Part I would be to help participants draft plans for implementing changes in library service and administration necessary to effectively meet the library needs of the disadvantaged.

Component E, the systems component, can stand alone or become a part of the total system. The timetable charts span 1966-76 and indicate the number of years involved in program development, training tasks, parent involvement activities, implementation in classrooms, evaluation for each component and for the  total system. Feedback from the Head Start component has already provided enough information to permit this first revision of the basic plan and to reshape the tasks and objectives of subsequent phases. (WY)",

        "description":"In a Behavior Analysis classroom the first step is to define instructional objectives for academic or social skills. The second step is to determine how much the child already knows about what is to be taught. An Entry Behavior Inventory and diagnostic tests help teachers decide where each child needs to begin working in the sequence leading to academic objectives. Motivation is taught with the help of incentives such as teacher-praise and child selection of favorite activities. A token system rewards the child with tokens for behavior and improvement at learning tasks. Tokens may be accumulated and exchanged later for activities such as recess and a chance to play games with classmates. To be effective, tokens must be used for immediate reinforcement and delivered at frequent  intervals when the child is learning steps of a new and difficult task. A classroom team of teacher and aides makes it possible for each child to receive personal attention and reinforcement. Parent participation, in the classroom and at home, is a key factor in the success of the Behavior Analysis approach. The curriculum, the daily schedule, and the use of reinforcement techniques for discipline are discussed. Program and staff development and evaluation are described. (NH)",

The experimental population consisted of 16 12-month-old infants attending enrichment sessions at Syracuse University's Children's Center. The control group consisted of 16 12-month-old infants who received no intervention. All the infants were black and from low income homes. The tests used in assessment were: a standardized infant global IQ test, the Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale, the Early Language Assessment Scale, and the Piagetian Infancy Scales. The results demonstrated that females benefited more than males from the enrichment  program, possibly due to differential home treatment. The advances made by the experimental infants both on the Object Permanence Scale and the Means-Ends Scale compared to their controls offers encouragement to explicitly planned enrichment efforts, based on a Piagetian cognitive-developmental model and designed to offset cognitive deficits that sometimes result when an infant is not provided the variety, sequencing and challenge appropriate to his level of experiences.

Reports on preschool education in these countries give examples of both an early and a late start to compulsory education, very extensive and very limited preschool provision, and the effects of private and state support. Educational provision is made for very small numbers of children under three years of age, if at all. In most of the countries primary education is separate from preschool education and contacts between the two systems are usually limited. Countries are compared on such matters as preschool staffing, curriculum, class size, and parent involvement. Lack of resources and conflicting values are considered the main  reasons for the slow growth of nursery, (or preschool) education in Europe. Suggestions are made about the policies that governments should adopt in this sphere, and about the important roles that parents and teachers should take as partners in the educational process. NH)",

Observations and interviews find these factors significant in constituting the social marginality of such children: (a) the stigma of illegitimacy, (b) the mothers' undesirable occupational status (prostitution), (c) children's economic and educational deprivation, and (d) physical differences, expecially color of hair and skin. Amero-Korean children are racial hybrids, but not cultural hybrids, for they are socialized in the relatively homogeneous Korean culture and have no alternate course but to become part of the in-group. The often disastrous effect (of being racially hybrid) on children's self-image and emotional development is  discussed. These children have rarely been adopted in Korea, largely because of cultural attitudes favoring kinship lineage and because of social apathy. A multi-dimensional solution to the problem is proposed, which involves an underlying attitudinal change on the part of the Korean people, integration of these children into society, pooling of welfare institution resources, and a stronger government role in child welfare. Tables are included of the status of hybrid children in Korea, and of intercountry adoption. (NH)",

The basic hypothesis of the study was that ownership arrangements and programs of day care centers could both be used to predict such characteristics as variations in clientele, facilities, staffing patterns, and organizational arrangements. A census was taken of 543 state-licensed preschool day care centers in Chicago. Programs were classified according to four factors: (1) Success-Orientation: mastery of skills/mastery of interpersonal relationships; (2) Supervision: directed learning/non-directed learning; (3) Skill Development: fixed tasks/flexible tasks; and (4) Reward-Motivation: operant conditioning/positive reinforcement. The  report suggests that the test of accuracy of the cost analysis procedures will be their ability to provide insight into such matters as good management strategies, optimum sizes of day care centers, suitable fee schedules, proper ratios between indebtedness and net income, and appropriate staffing patterns. Evidence gathered to date indicates that the classification system may be used as a predictive device. [Filmed from best available copy]. (AJ)",

Along with definitions of language, the program types differ in the kinds of interactions which occur between teacher and child and among children themselves. The kind of interaction a program promotes should be a key feature in choosing a published package for preschool use. It is important to know exactly the kind of learning relationships that are being rewarded and whether they are the kind of learning behaviors the school wishes to foster. Other major points of comparison among programs come from inspection of the teacher's guide. Programs differ  in the amount of organization and sequencing provided for the teacher and they also vary in the amount of detailed information given to guide the teacher. The single most important factor in choosing a program seems to be whether the teacher is able to spend the 15 to 30 minutes per day carrying out the recommended classroom procedures.

First grade samples of middle class Anglo-American, and economically disadvantaged Mexican-American children displayed gains in vicariously-induced conservation as did a separate group of 4-year-olds. On initial (imitative) task stimuli, modeling increased conservation responses which then generalized to a new set of stimulus items without further intervention. Verbal feedback praising the model's responses did not affect performance. A nonconserving model reduced conservation in initially-conserving children. A nonmodeling instruction procedure failed to modify conservation scores. The model's  provision of a rule to explain stimulus equivalence improved performance when criterion response required judged equivalence plus explanation, but not when the response criterion was judged equivalence alone. Children who observed the model conserve without giving an explanation nevertheless increased their correct judgments-plus-rule responses in the imitation phase, thus demonstrating that observational learning can produce inferential thinking.

Four- and 5-year-olds (N=86) were matched on several developmental variables, with one group at each age entering the Learning to Learn Program at either the nursery or kindergarten level. The other two groups served as controls and entered day care centers or traditional type kindergartens. During the second year of the project the experimental groups either attended kindergarten or first grade at the Learning to Learn School, and the control groups attended either Title I kindergarten or traditional first grade classes in public schools. Experimental and control groups were tested on measures of intelligence, psycholinguistic  ability, visual motor ability, primary mental abilities, readiness and achievement. Results indicate that the children who began the program at age 4 have made much larger developmental gains than children in the matched control group. To a lesser extent, the children who began the program at age 5 have advanced more rapidly than their control group.

To learn from these programs, evaluators must identify four criteria of critical differences existing among programs and attack the programmatic analysis of these differences with vigor. The four criteria are specification of: (1) the process through which program goals and instructional objectives are generated or selected (the view of child development involved and the manner of accounting for societal press), (2) the conditions or processes to be used to insure the willful interaction of the target population with these goals and instructional objectives (the appropriate incentive conditions), (3) the  appropriate sequence for the introduction of learning opportunities or the strategies required to enable the programmer to order instructional objectives in some sequence, and (4) the strategies required of the teacher or programmer for organizing the learning situation for optimal benefit to children. Admittedly, generic approaches and the functional equivalence of models pose additional difficulties for evaluators but these can be overcome by directing preliminary efforts toward understanding the relationship of a model to a complete educational system.

The discussion covers the issue of the definition of a &quot;new&quot; stimulus event, the inherent difficulties in a simple matching process, and presents an alternative model for attending to stimulus events. An experiment is presented which demonstrates an Orienting Reflex (OR) hierarchy comparable to hierarchies of concept formation attainment in the same age child. Specifically, a redundant visual signal is followed by four variations of that signal; changes in color, size,  number, and rotation. The results, accounting for both discriminability and intrinsic value demonstrate a hierarchy of stimulus salience. This hierarchy of color, size, number, and rotation is consistent with concept formation acquisition and these results are used to argue for the proposed model of attending which emphasizes the need to consider cognitive principles in understanding an OR.

Correlations were made for a Personal Relations Content scoring category, and for a Personality Index. Results showed that the justifications which children gave for choosing others varied with age,  sex, and the activity to be shared.

The brain goes through major developmental changes after birth, and researchers have suggested that this growth process presents an opportunity for fostering the plasticity of genetically determined connections. Animal studies show that postnatal growth of the brain is influenced by increasing the sensory input from the environment. This influence is manifested in terms of increased interconnectivity of nerve cells and microneuron development. It is proposed that, in the human learner, two dimensions of environmental enrichment are necessary: interaction with objects and interpersonal interaction. Implications are discussed for teaching the disadvantaged child and for helping to establish creative  modes of thought. Development of better measurement techniques for ascertaining the microneuronal growth pattern and its behavioral correlates should precede further research. (Author/NH)",

Twenty-four children were divided into two main age groups (mean ages: 3 years 8 months; 4 years 5 months). Within each age category, children were randomly assigned to groups of four for seriation training, classification training, and a control group. To assess IQ and verbal ability, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test was utilized as a pretest-posttest measure; Piagetian tasks as a posttest only. Tasks included a seriation series of six problems and a classification series of seven problems. Three conservation tasks (quantity, number and area) were  administered as far-transfer tests. Covariance analysis of the seriation task battery indicated there were significant treatment main effects and an age-treatment interaction with the high age seriation group indicating superior performance. Classification in both age groups was not found to be effective. Learning was not found to generalize to the far-transfer tasks. The age-related findings from this study were interpreted as supporting the stage-dependent aspects of Piaget's theory. (Author/AJ)",

Ten boys and ten girls each from kindergarten, third, and sixth grades (N=60) were randomly selected from pupils having an IQ within the 83 to 117 range. The measure was an adaptation of Piaget's three-mountain coordination of  perspective task. While viewing six different object arrangements from a static position, subjects were asked to match photographs of the object groups with the position of the camera when the picture was taken.

These sequences featured black and white children who were unknown to the viewers and who portrayed roles in which they demonstrated simple concepts. Data from this preliminary study (N=59) indicated that: (1) both types of kindergartners can acquire concepts (over, around, through, etc.) by passively viewing either an unknown, same or opposite color child teaching, (2) viewing an unknown child-teacher of the opposite color did not alter the initial same color preferences of \"preferred companions\" of either type of kindergartner, and (3) high concept attainers did not demonstrate more pre-post change  to opposite color child-teachers as \"preferred companions\" than low concept attainers. Recommendations for further research are given. (Author/NH)",

        "description":"Two parallel and complementary studies of Language Modelling and its relation to the development of communicative competence in the young child are reported. Over a 6-month period, Study 1 involved weekly naturalistic observations (in the home) of the nature and quality of the linguistic stimulation offered by mothers to their children between 2 and 4 years of age. The eight homes visited represented black and white families, with high and low incomes, in suburban and inner city settings. The differing maternal language behaviors observed seemed to reflect differing basic premises held by middle and working class mothers about infancy and early childhood. Language usage is one of the areas affected. It is suggested that intervention programs help mothers to learn more about child  development and include language programs. Study 2 tested the language usage of 40 preschool children of differing socioeconomic backgrounds in three basic areas of competence: perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic. The results were used to plan training sessions in communication skills appropriate to each child's needs. Pretests and posttests indicate that children benefitted by such training over the short term. Appendixes are included.

        "description":"This study is concerned with the way in which children's naturally occurring behaviors change over a period of time as they adapt to a nursery school setting. A set of seven varieties of environmental constraints and fourteen adaptations to these constraints was observed among 18 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds in a nursery school classroom first in the fall, when the setting was newly initiated, and secondly in the spring, when the setting had been in existence for an extensive period of time. The findings showed that duration of the setting was significantly related to changes in several varieties of constraints and adaptations. The results illustrate a basic conception of ecological psychology, that the program of an environment's inputs to individuals changes if its ecological  properties change--in this case, if the duration of the setting increases. ED 040 421 is an earlier version of this study. (Author)",

Mothers completed the Cain-Levine Social Competency Scale and questionnaires on the social experience of their children. Ratings of reactions to separation and of adjustment were obtained on the first day of nursery school and one and five weeks later. Experience with playmates at home, experience in group settings away from home, and contact with different baby sitters in the home were each independently related to ease of initial separation. A total social experience score correlated -.46 (p<.001) with separation distress. The social experience score was not related to fifth-week separation problems but was  correlated with adjustment through the fifth week. Social competency was not related to separation reaction ratings or social experience but was correlated with adjustment through the fifth week. The results supported the view that the distress which some children exhibit at the start of nursery school is a function of the novelty of the situation for the child in question.

Cohen admonishes teachers to remain aware that in the classroom they are both teachers and observers trying to find clues to understanding and interaction. Because teachers are human beings with attitudes and beliefs of their own, it is difficult to be objective in making observations of children. An open mind ready to accept anything that there is to see, without judgment, is a prerequisite. Observations of children must begin without any preconceived notions of what one ought to find or will find. Perceptions of children can be influenced by the observer's personal associations, moral judgments, age, and physical well-being. Adults must learn to perceive children's behavior first as it is meant, and only secondarily as it is interpreted by adult  standards. Body movement is the major language of expression in early childhood and tells more about the meaning of children's behavior than their words. Teachers must learn to read body language to interpret children's developmental stages of competence, experimentation, testing, and general attitudes toward self. (Author/AJ)",

Subjects were 789,225 kindergarten children representing a  cross section of Seattle's population, according to SES data. Teaching materials were cassette recordings manually synchronized with 2x2 colored slides of concept exemplars and nonexemplars shown on a slide projector. The concept \"island\" was taught to children in groups of two and three, and three critical attributes were delineated. Analysis of variance indicated no significant differences.

Chapter I introduces evaluational questions and the research strategy. Chapter II presents sampling procedures for pretest and posttest data on 943 children, explains criteria for development and selection of measurement instruments assessing children's learning, program content, parent and teacher attitudes, and describes field operations. Chapter III analyzes results in three parts: (1) a descriptive analysis of the viewing population (age, sex, advantaged children, Spanish-speaking children, rural children, and disadvantaged at-home and in-school viewers), (2) a  probing analysis investigating in depth the characteristics of at-home, disadvantaged, high-viewing children in relation to home background and high or low learning, (3) an inferential analysis examining the overall effectiveness of the television series in achieving its goals. Chapter IV presents the summary, conclusions and recommendations. Extensive appendixes include detailed information on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; goals and evaluation instruments. (WY)",

Nine projects were reviewed and summarized into a viewing profile chart. The chart presents information on title and date of survey, surveyor, purposes of survey, character of sample, size of sample, availability on UHF, VHF, and Cable TV and percent of penetration. The results of the projects showed a highly encouraging rate of viewing and supported the need for special efforts to promote wider viewing, especially in low income  neighborhoods and in communities served only by UHF stations.

The first section gives a brief history of the Children's Television Workshop, describes the operational model followed by the Workshop in carrying out its initial experiment, and suggests application of the model to future Workshop productions. The second section specifies the language and prereading goals represented in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; curriculum and discusses the reasons for their inclusion. These goals include improving self-concept, general concept development, and the development of specific perceptual skills. Behavioral goals related to the learning of letters are listed and discussed in detail. The third section describes  many of the production techniques and teaching strategies used to implement these letter-learning goals. The problems of sequencing and scheduling instruction for broadcast television are considered. The fourth section provides some preliminary data on the ability of viewers to name certain letters. The evidence suggests that some success has been achieved in teaching letter identification. The final section is a summary. A statement of instructional goals for the 1970-1971 experimental season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; is appended. (Author/WY)",

Indian people are closely attuned to their lands and resources--it is part of their traditional culture to have close ties with and appreciation for the soil, trees and plants, water, wildlife, clean air, mountains, the sea, and all the beauties of nature. With this kind of appreciation, teachers of Indian children can readily implement activities related to environmental improvement. This booklet was designed to help teachers and students in learning of the relationship of the environment to the human race. Divided into 5 major sections of activities, each  activity is classified according to the level for which it is best suited. Symbols such as PRI for primary, INT for intermediate, and JH for junior high designate the level.

Criticisms of the social studies programs have stemmed from inconsistencies evidenced by \"what is claimed for social studies\" as opposed to \"what our Indian students and research people say is being accomplished in this area.\" Thus, new directions for social studies include structure based upon a conceptual framework that draws from all the social sciences, concepts  introduced at an earlier age, improved teaching methods, more and better media, and attention to the modes of inquiry, skills, and treatment of data. In keeping with this, the Washington office of BIA is committed to the assistance of areas, agencies, and local schools in implementation of new and better social studies programs. (LS)",

For each progressive grade level, units extend the context of human relationships. The theme for the beginner level is the school. The family in several cultures is studied in grade 1. Human interaction in the vicinity of the school and in urban and rural settings is the focus of grade 2. Community life is studied in grade 3, and relationships between man and  the land are explored in grade 4. Throughout the units, the child studies the familiar culture first. Other cultures and settings are used to develop the social science generalizations around which the units are developed. Objectives for each unit consist of 3 categories: understandings or knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The content has been converted into a series of problems with many accompanying daily activities which can be selected and modified by the teacher in light of pupil characteristics.

Purpose of the guide is to promote the Navajo child's understanding of how he interacts with members of his nuclear and extended families, with peers and teachers within the school, with members of communities located in the Navajo Nation, and with persons in the larger, pluralistic American society. For each progressive grade level, units extend the context of human relationships. Grade 5 is concerned with culture contact on the North American continent. Changing cultures in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres are studied in grade 6. United States history is the focus of grade 7, and grade 8 deals with political processes and institutions. Throughout the  units, the child studies the familiar Navajo culture first. Other cultures and settings are used to develop the social science generalizations around which the units are developed. Objectives for each unit consist of 3 categories: understandings or knowledge, attitudes, and skills. The content has been converted into a series of problems with many accompanying daily activities which can be selected and modified by the teacher in light of pupil characteristics. Objectives for each unit were developed from the Bureau of Indian Affairs' publication &quot;Curriculum Needs of Navajo Pupils.&quot; Related documents are RC 005 056 and RC 005 057. (JH)",

As stated, the main comparisons relate to a carefully selected sample of pupils in each school (pupil criteria are given for all 4  schools). The report provides results of interviews held with teachers, parents, school staff, and other community members in the target areas. Among the findings, it is pointed out that RRDS was believed to be a successful experiment in introducing the new concept of involving Indian adults to exercise authority in controlling their own school. However, it is noted &quot;that the primary focus of administrators (at RRDS) seemed to be on public relations,...that the secondary emphasis was on an employment program for local people, and that other affairs of the school were neglected&quot; (see RC 005 062).

Staff training was conducted under contract with Birgham Young University using pre-school and  bi-monthly workshops. Students participating in the program ranged in age from 5 to 7 years and were in kindergarten or first grade. Curriculum content was that required by the district and state, with the exceptions of instruction in history and culture of Indians (with an emphasis on the Navajo) and the instruction of English as a second language. Program evaluation yielded the conclusions that: (1) the bilingual program was accepted with enthusiasm by parents, (2) children in bilingual classrooms were maintaining self-images as positive as Navajo children who had been more highly integrated into the Anglo culture, and (3) academic achievement of Navajo children in bilingual classrooms was equal to or greater than that of Navajo children living in or near Anglo communities.

The population consisted of 536 Mexican American, Negro, and Anglo boys in 6 parochial high schools. Instruments used were a student questionnaire, the Jesness Inventory, the Lowe Anomie Scale, and the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale-Form E. Observed asociality was evaluated in terms of underachievement, absenteeism, dean referrals, and deportment ratings. Group differences were investigated on some of the foregoing variables and on personal-social variables such as socioeconomic status, physical size, school program, social participation, expressed interests and hobbies, and school attitudes. Multiple stepwise regression and analysis of variance were the  statistical procedures used. A significant positive relationship was found between observed asocial behavior and tested predelinquency, anomie, and dogmatism. Dogmatism related positively with observed asocial behavior for Anglo but not for Black or Mexican Americans. Black Americans had the highest ratings on observed asocial behavior, tested predelinquency, dean referrals, and negative deportment. Mexican Americans had the lowest ratings on tested predelinquency and dean referrals. Anglo Americans had the lowest ratings on anomie and deportment ratings. No significant differences emerged between the groups in terms of dogmatism, underachievement, and absenteeism. (JH)",

The present study investigated those factors that differentiate between first-year teachers who remain for a second year and those who resign after 1 year of employment with the Bureau of Indian Affairs Schools. The underlying theoretical model was of a cultural-role and dissonance variety. Those individuals who had the most incongruency in areas related to their work environments were the most likely to terminate employment. Termination of employment was also related to dominant career patterns. A pretest-posttest design was used, and data were collected by means of questionnaires and structured interviews. Analysis of  questionnaires and interviews focused upon isolating those items that discriminated between the teachers who remained for a second year and those who resigned after 1 year. Additional analyses were performed on the data, investigating sociological and ecological variables. Personal, sociological, and ecological variables related to teacher mobility were isolated. The discriminating variables were discussed in light of their implications for further research on teacher morale. (Author/EL)",

It is pointed out that the methods employed and the special materials used to teach English as a second language have not been successful, perhaps as a result of lack of motivation. It is noted that there are 2 significant types of motivation in successful language learning: (1) instrumental, in which the student wishes to learn the language in order to make some particular use of it, and (2) integrative, the more successful of the 2 methods, in which the student learns in order to be able to know the world of the other language better and to grow closer to its speakers and perhaps be more like them.  In assessing the possible level of integrative motivation, a semantic differential test was given to 11th and 12th graders of the Albuquerque Indian School. These 52 students (33 boys and 19 girls) represented 5 tribes: 18 Navajo, 21 Mescalero Apache, 9 Rio Grande Pueblo, 2 Zuni, and 2 Southern Ute. Analysis of test results on the 19 categories included in the instrument reflected that these Indian students indicated a desire to learn the English language but showed little evidence of being attracted to other aspects of Anglo culture. It is suggested that more time be devoted to making the world of English more familiar and more attractive to the Indian student. (EL)",

The document discusses problematic conditions which the Indian faces in these 2 cities and reports the results of questionnaires sent to agencies in the Omaha and Lincoln areas seeking information on the extent and nature of contact with Indians and on the general conditions of Indians. In keeping with this, attempts to help the urban Indian  through Federal assistance and other service agencies are discussed. Seven appendices are included. (EL)",

The 7th and 8th graders were grouped by ability. The other 2 grades were included for purposes of comparison: 6th for anticipatory reactions and 9th for possible effects of grouping experiences. Attitudes toward grouping were obtained on a 25-item questionnaire. Self-concept was determined by a scale of bipolar adjectives in semantic differential format. The Student Opinion Poll was used to determine attitudes toward school. Grades and standardized achievement scores were obtained from student records. Data were analyzed using correlation and chi-square techniques. In general, positive  attitudes toward ability grouping were expressed. Some attitudinal differences were found among students in different levels of grouping placement, with those in the highest and lowest groups being more favorable. Students perceived their grouping placement with considerable accuracy. No systematic attitudinal differences existed between sexes, but there were differences between classes. Students who had experienced homogeneous grouping were more favorable toward it than those who had not. No significant relationships existed between course grades and attitudes toward grouping, but significant relationships existed between achievement scores and attitudes toward grouping, with higher achievers being more favorable toward grouping. Little relationship existed between attitude items and  self-concept or school satisfaction. (JH)",

Three experimental groups were composed of (1) 9 Mexican American children from low-income families and 9 Anglo children from middle-income professional families (heterogeneous), (2) 18 Mexican American children from low-income families (homogeneous), and (3) 17 Anglo children from middle-income professional families (homogeneous). Four measures of cognitive functioning and 3 behavioral measures were individually administered at the beginning of the school year and again 8 months later. Comparisons of mean gain scores on pre- and post-tests  were computed. Data demonstrated that heterogeneous and homogeneous grouping both have a facilitating effect on cognitive growth and behavior modification. It was noted that further research is needed to identify the psychosocial dimensions of the learning environments in heterogeneous and homogeneous groups and to assess their contribution to cognitive change and behavior modification. Dimensions suggested in interpretation of data were the teacher's mode of coping with problem situations and interacting with children, the role of the teacher as a model for behavior modification and an agent of reinforcement, the nature of the interpersonal relationships among children, and the social-climate properties of the group.

Two central factors considered in the research problem were (1) analysis of the processes of communication and diffusion of new ideas and technologies, and (2) acceptance and actual adoption of recommended farm practices among Chilean farmers. The 3 dependent variables selected were exposure to mass media, exposure to technical agricultural communication, and adoption of recommended farm practices. Interviews were conducted with 244 farmers of 3 communities located in the province of Colchagua. It was  found that levels of usage of public information channels, as measured by an index of exposure to mass media, were associated with social factors such as age, education, farm size, and income. Other findings suggested that the farmers' informal associates and commercial and institutional sources influenced adoption; that mass media appeared to be divorced from the adoption process; and that agricultural extension service and other agricultural agencies were relatively unimportant as diffusion and adoption agents.

In a review of the literature, the author points out the need for a bilingual approach to education in an effort to help non-English-speaking citizens lead more productive lives in our society. It is noted that there is opposition to this approach from the many investigators who claim that there is evidence linking native bilingualism with retardation and underachievement in schools. The author cites the more recent studies which show that this handicap results from the way communities and schools have dealt with children who speak another language and not from the children's bilingualism; thus, he feels it is desirable to erase the reigning Anglo stereotype and to recognize the Mexican  American in developing curricula and educational programs. Included in the document are discussions of types of bilingual programs and thought processes involved, along with conclusions and recommendations for continuing bilingual-bicultural educational programs and corresponding teacher education programs.

Discrepancies revealed in comparison of results from the 2 types of evaluation were that (1) in evaluating parental opinions of the school administration in the schools, the field team was in marked disagreement with the  scale results; (2) in ranking the 4 schools according to the teachers'\"understanding of the local Indian community,\" there was no agreement on the ranking of 3 of the 4 schools; (3) the scales sometimes failed to differentiate between schools where the field workers felt they could; and (4) the field workers sometimes felt that no meaningful differentiation between, or ranking of, schools could be done where it had been done with the scale results.

Results of the various scales indicated that few of the 27 schools studied were heavily criticized by the students and parents; 9 of the 27 schools drew favorable responses from the students in terms of the school responding to student needs. It was noted that the more acculturated students had a better basis for evaluating their schools, while most Indian parents had a poor basis for critically evaluating their schools compared with college-educated middle- and upper-class Americans. The majority of the 700  adults interviewed, like most Americans, accepted the schools that served them as being adequate or good. The strongest criticisms of schools for Indians were voiced by community leaders and other influential people. It was felt that the short time-span given to the study and concealmeant of negative feelings by the Indians (when talking to strangers) might have contributed to the lack of criticism in many of the Indian communities.

Objectives were to emphasize the distinctive cultural character of Appalachia and to emphasize exploration and experimentation rather than mastery of formal rules and techniques. The program was evaluated in terms of pupil reaction, pupil achievement, pupil adjustment, and parent reaction. Osgood's Semantic Differential, the Pupil Adjustment Inventory, specially constructed achievement tests, and interviews with parents and pupils were used. Of 12 activities offered in the program, the 5 attracting the largest number of pupils were ceramics, painting, crafts, musical instruments, and folk  dance. Significant improvement in achievement level was found in 8 of 12 instructional areas. Significant improvement in pupil adjustment was found in achievement as related to aptitude, attitude toward school work, personal worth, activities and interest, attitude toward school, and the school's influence upon the pupil. The 2 suggestions most frequently made by parents in regard to program improvement were extending facilities to accommodate more children and improving transportation facilities. Deficiencies in facilities, materials, and equipment were found at all 6 schools. In the opinion of the evaluation staff, the specific objectives of the Cultural and Creative Arts Program were met.

        "description":"The third session of a 3-year annual summer Cultural and Creative Arts Program was held in 6 Monongalia County, West Virginia, schools for first-through sixth-grade pupils. Objectives were (1) the development of a sense of appreciation for the unique culture and resources characterizing the Appalachian region, (2) the development of a desire to explore and experiment rather than to duplicate externally imposed patterns and standards, and (3) the realization of success in terms of the unique personal satisfaction which results when children successfully move closer to the realization of their own potentials. The program was evaluated in terms of pupil reaction, pupil progress, and teacher effectiveness. Twelve activity rating scales, 3 for each of the 4 major areas (arts, music,  drama, and dance), were constructed to provide pupil performance ratings; an adaptation of Osgood's Semantic Differential was used to detect changes in pupil attitudes. Significant improvement in pupil performance was found in 10 of 12 activity areas. While changes were found in pupil attitudes, changes in a positive direction were not indicated by pupil responses. Program area preferences as ranked by pupils during initial and final phases remained stable. A wide range was found to exist in respect to teacher effectiveness. An assessment of total findings indicated that the objectives were accomplished. (JH)",

Statistics show that medical services provided by the program reached 38% of all migrant workers in New Jersey at the peak of the 1969 crop season; however, extension of program services to reach a till larger percentage of the migrant population will require more clinic facilities and transportation to bring patients to the necessary services. As reported, there was a shortage of nurses, but physician and hospital services were readily available and were used by the migrants. Efforts have been consistently applied to the implementation of project-supported sanitation standards: the 1969 potable  water program and the installation of a water-borne sewage disposal system evidence positive results. Community family counseling agencies increased assistance to migrant families in 1969, and migrants now participate in the Health Services Index Referral System. (LS)",

The 3 groups of children served were 4- and 5-year-olds (prekindergarten), 5- and 6-year-olds (preschool), and 7- through 13-year-olds (orientation with emphasis on individualized oral reading and &quot;games&quot; geared to processing information at levels other than memory). General goals for the overall program focused on 3 behavioral domains. In the cognitive domain, attention was focused on increasing the quality and quantity of verbalization patterns; on extending knowledge of English language structure; on increasing ability to comprehend and apply  information; and on enabling the children to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate on the basis of knowledge gained. In the affective area, activities were designed to increase the ability to receive and attend to relevant stimuli; to respond appropriately and effectively in specific situations; to gain self-confidence; and to develop an increasing awareness of, and interest in, books and reading. In the psychomotor domain, both indoor and outdoor activities were structured to enable pupils to refine perceptual skills and to increase proficiencies in both gross and fine motor abilities. Program evaluation consisted of pupil assessment by faculty members and teaching aides. Some of the more evident trends are noted in the document, and tables provide statistical support for the findings.  (JH)",

        "description":"An interactional view of the factors of school success or failure is presented which encompasses the student's strengths, weaknesses, and limitations on the one hand and specific classroom situational factors on the other. The child's success in the classroom is seen as dependent upon the congruity of his characteristics and the characteristics of the classroom in which he is required to perform. Therefore, the ability of the teacher to personalize instruction may be the most important single factor in preventing or mitigating learning difficulties for a number of students. It is suggested that children who have been labeled as learning disabled may be placed in either of three groups: children with major disorders which interfere with learning, children who are adversely  affected by the particular classroom situation, and children with minor disorders who have sufficient compensatory powers to cope with their problems under appropriate circumstances. A set of sequential and hierarchical teaching strategies is outlined involving a two-step process by which teachers can identify and attempt to meet the remedial needs of children in each of these groups. Finally, the roles played by specialized teaching techniques and materials in correcting such learning problems are analyzed. (Author/DH)",

In the area of reading instruction, for example, there is a great opportunity to compare teaching reading in English to English speakers with teaching reading in French to French speakers and with the teaching of reading in the other official language to each of these groups. The number of other ethnic groups provides opportunities for teaching both official languages as second languages.

Experimenter-devised tests were administered to all subjects to measure intersensory transfer, intersensory perceptual reaction time, modal preference, and sight vocabulary. In addition, subjects were given the reading subtest of the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, Elementary Battery, Form B and the Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Test, Level 2, Form A. Positive correlations were found between sight vocabulary and reading comprehension, between  intersensory transfer and intelligence, in addition to the expected high relationships among sight vocabulary, reading comprehension, and IQ. It was concluded that (1) auditory-visual integration is related to reading achievement in grade 3, (2) ability to respond rapidly to cross-modal stimulus presentation is related to the sight vocabulary aspect of reading achievement, and (3) direction of modal preference has no effect on intersensory tests used in determining modal preference.

Randomly assigned subjects were taught by the experimenter in groups of approximately six, for two 15-minute periods twice weekly. Teaching content was a list of 28 words. At the end of 10 weeks, the subjects were individually tested on their recall of the words taught and on their ability to transfer to 26 similar words. Analysis of  variance results favored the two spelling pattern treatments, but found no significant differences among the transfer scores when compared by treatment.

The subjects were 54 children from a semirural elementary school who had had no formal training in letter recognition. Three acquisition lists were used to represent increasing intralist similarity. Word recognition and generalization tasks were constructed. The children, randomly assigned to learn each list, were given prefamiliarization training and then were given acquisition and test trials. Analysis of variance results revealed no significant differences between groups in the serial-order trial condition, but showed that introduction of intralist similarity impeded rate of acquisition. The  medium-similarity group responded more like the no-similarity group than like the high-similarity group. It was concluded that, contrary to the findings of previous studies, the present results implied that medium similarity is sufficiently effective for use with beginning readers since it allows rapid initial learning while causing greater accuracy in subsequent word recognition than no similarity.

The eight lessons of the course, for each of which a separate booklet is provided, include the following: (1) The difficulties of traditional orthography and the development of i.t.a., (2) Study of i.t.a. characters, (3) Study of i.t.a. characters continued, (4) How to spell in i.t.a., (5) Teaching reading with i.t.a., (6) Children's writing and spelling, (7) Setting up i.t.a. in a school, and (8) Remedial reading and i.t.a. Each lesson consists of a series of notes which covers a specific aspect of i.t.a. followed by a short test. The author recommends that the best results will be  obtained from the course if teachers work through it in a fairly short time while all the problems discussed are kept fresh in the mind. In addition to the lessons is a separate booklet containing an i.t.a. booklist and various teaching materials for use with i.t.a. (Author/DH)",

        "description":"This study examined children's preferences for three qualitative levels of thinking--abstract, functional, and concrete--in vocabulary. It was hypothesized that whereas older, more mature readers would choose abstract meaning, younger readers would choose concrete meaning regardless of the nature of the material, and also that a dominant cognitive style might emerge in individuals for one of the three levels. A \"Choose a Meaning Test\" of word meaning, a \"Depth of Meaning Test\" of paragraph meaning, and a \"Creative and Critical Reading Test\" of paragraph meaning were administered to 79 third graders and 111 sixth graders in Berkeley, California. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance, correlation, and factor analysis. Differences were significant (.01) between grades and  measures, correlations were moderately high, and factor structure appeared to confirm structures found in other similar studies. The results suggested to the author that dimensions of meanings of this measurement may have implications for describing more and less mature readers. Tables and references are included.

The 33 subjects from three schools would enter first grade in the fall and were considered low achievers on the basis of kindergarten testing. Upper-grade elementary students volunteered to tutor on a one-to-one basis and were placed under a supervisor in each school. Each tutor was trained in structured tutoring techniques in teaching the prescriptions which constituted the criteria objectives for each child. At the end of the 6-week period, the children were given a test that measured their achievement of the specified criteria--seven letters, five sight words, eight sounds, eight to ten phonetic words, and five to eight  nonsense words. The first-grade teachers in the three participating schools were asked to rank all their pupils on reading ability 3 months after the beginning of the school year. This ranking disclosed that only five of the children in the study were considered to be in the lower one-third of their class in contrast to all 33 having been identified as being in the lower one-third of their kindergarten class.

Sex differences were also considered. Six boys and six girls were randomly selected from each of 10 first-grade classrooms. Complete pretest and post-test data were obtained on 111 pupils. The auditory factors were assessed by two specially constructed instruments, the Roswell-Chall Auditory Blending Test, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Digit Span, and the auditory discrimination subtest of the Harrison-Stroud Reading Readiness Profiles. The readiness test and Lorge-Thorndike Intelligence Tests were also administered at the beginning of first grade,  and the SRA Achievement Tests, Primary Battery, were given the following April. Interpretation of the data revealed a generic relationship between the auditory perceptual variables, but it appeared that the instruments were measuring different skills. Sex had no significant effect on test performance, though a positive trend of superiority for girls was noted. Significant relationships were found between the prereading variables and measured reading achievement. However, it was concluded that redundant information was obtained by using the combination of auditory perceptual measures, the reading readiness, and intelligence tests.

Although steady growth was observed on all measures, rate and consistency varied with the type of reading measure used, as well as with the specific test series. The Metropolitan Achievement Tests and the New York Tests of Growth in Reading yielded consistently higher scores than did the two informal measures, the Harris Graded Word Lists, a measure of sight vocabulary, and the highest level of book used in the classroom. The New York Tests appeared to yield somewhat higher scores than did the Metropolitan Tests. Acceleration appeared greater in the first and second grades on the  standardized measures and in the third grade on the informal measures. There was approximately a one grade discrepancy between the frustration level estimated by standardized tests and the instructional level estimated by informal measures. It was concluded that standardized test results seem best suited for assessing the achievement growth of individuals and groups, while informal measures are probably best suited for determining each child's functioning level and for selecting materials.

Six issues and concerns are then stated which appear as recurrent needs in literature: (1) a more precise definition of reading behaviors; (2) clearer distinctions among process, language development, and pedagogical aspects of reading; (3) a more effective means of locating and structuring research; (4) more rigorously scientific conduct and evaluation of research; (5) greater interdisciplinary research efforts; and (6) better coordinated program research. One effort to meet some of these needs was the 3-year project  Application of the Convergence Technique to Basic Studies of the Reading Process. The report continues by outlining the convergence technique and its use in a five-phase program. The phases consist of (1) a comprehensive review and evaluation of research; (2) evaluating, expanding, or refuting the models defined by phase 1; (3) developing an instructional system; (4) delivering the system to classrooms; and (5) implementing the system nationwide.

The following points were noted: (1) Most children are taught to read as we and our ancestors before us were by an alphabet which is at least 1,000 years old and took its form from the convenience and expediency of the writer rather than consideration for the learner. (2) We persist in using an out-of-date medium for learning because of man's innate conservatism and distrust of anything new. (3) Since many educational authorities accept the fact that i.t.a. cannot harm the child's ability to read eventually in T.O., it is not necessary to delay the use of an alphabet especially designed to make it easier for children to learn to read.  (4) Even children with an inadequate linquistic background can learn to read in i.t.a. and thus add the benefit of print to the benefit of speech in developing their ability to understand and learn the English language.

The difficulties which many children experience in learning to read with traditional orthography (T.O.) are pointed out. These include the variety of patterns for any one letter and the different sounds represented by the same letter. In contrast, i.t.a. is always lowercase and has 44 characters which consistently represent sounds of the English language. It is shown that efforts were made to retain as many of the characteristics of T.O. as possible; thus all but two of the Roman alphabet characters are used, and 15 of the 20 augmentations are similar to T.O. In addition, the top half of the letters  have been left almost undisturbed while the discriminating features of the new letters are in the lower half of the line of print, a characteristic which facilitates transition to T.O. Questions pertaining to later reading are concerned chiefly with transition to T.O., learning to spell correctly, and the grasping of etymological roots present in T.O. The author presents his view that spelling and etymology can best be taught after children have acquired fluency in reading and there is no need to teach either before the transition to T.O. has been made.

The criterion for developing and revising test items was based on the inability of the readers to answer test items correctly before reading the passages and their ability to answer the test items correctly after reading the passages. Interpretation of the test depends on three scores: (1) the efficiency score, i.e., the number of incorrect chunks out of 100 possible that the individual correctly identifies during the 25-minute test period; (2) rate, which is determined by the number of the last item attempted; and (3) accuracy, which is the percent correct. Using these scores the  reader can be classified as efficient-inefficient, rapid-slow, and accurate-inaccurate which yield six possible categories of mature readers. Although there is no empirical research which supports this particular categorization, speculative judgments are made concerning them with the hope of stimulating definitive research.

It was assumed that subjects would generate responses representing a number of word types, that some of these word types would be sensible and some nonsensical, and that responses would be representative of the entire body of possible response words. Five versions of a 300-word cloze passage, every fifth word deleted, were administered to 390 junior-high-school students who were randomly assigned to one of the versions. Protocols were hand scored and success probabilities were calculated. A correlation matrix among seven variables was calculated and analyzed using a stepwise  regression program. Significant correlations were noted among the seven variables, with the highest correlation appearing between size of response body related to success probability.

Individualization, defined as personalized instruction, may be accomplished through helping the student to read course materials, helping him to read special materials, or helping him in terms of reading skill needs. The Genesee Community College, Flint, Michigan, relies on several measures to determine student entry skills, provides personalized programs designed to develop skill weakness areas, and evaluates individual progress as it relates to program and individual goals. Emphasis in instruction is on improvement of vocabulary, comprehension, and rate. References are included. (MS)",

Two of the major problems in motivating a college student when his efforts in the educational system have already been largely futile include lack of adequately trained personnel and lack of suitable educational aims. Adequate teacher training would include anatomy and physiology, psychology, elementary reading, diagnostic testing and interpretation, remedial techniques, and a sociological background sufficient to handle students from various types of environments. A problem more important than trained personnel is providing motivation related to suitable aims and goals. Education to  be relevant must fit with reality. The culturally deprived student is practically-oriented and not given to abstract ideas. Since his is operating on a sensori-motor level rather than a cognitive level, it would seem that our structured academic system must undergo a change if it is to educate for reality. First we must find out what reality is for our students, and then educate them accordingly. References are included. (BH)",

Subjects were 80 white urban disadvantaged children, all 5 years old, divided into four random groups. Each subject was required to respond to 25 words and responses were recorded on cards. Commonalities, representing about 25 percent of the responses, were classified as syntactic, paradigmatic, phonological, and indeterminate and were analyzed descriptively. Phonological commonalities were most common, monosyllables produced more common responses than did polysyllables, and syntactical commonalities seemed more common  than did paradigmatic. It was suggested that greater attention be paid to syntactical development in children and to the inverse relationship between syntax and syllable length. The essentially idiosyncratic nature of the responses given (75 percent) implies that these children may have been making immature associations which could later produce reading difficulties.

        "description":"Six formulas designed to predict reading capacity were compared by correlating each with actual reading performance. Two of the formulas, the Science Research Associates Tests of General Ability (TOGA) and the Harris Formula, are based on mental age only; the third, the Los Angeles Formula, employs both mental and chronological age; the fourth, the Bond and Tinker Formula, involves IQ and length of exposure to academic instruction. The fifth method, the Durrell-Sullivan Reading Capacity and Achievement Tests, uses listening comprehension skills to predict reading achievement; and sixth, the Monroe Formula, uses mental, chronological, and arithmetic ages to determine reading capacity. These six formulas were applied to 81 children in average reading groups of grades 3 through 6.  Each of the reading capacity scores was correlated with reading achievement scores from administration of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test, using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. The Los Angeles Formula was found to have the highest correlation (.62), and the Harris Formula, the lowest (.08). It was concluded that most of the variance is unaccounted for, and further examination of other variables needs to be undertaken to assess reading capacity as related to reading performance.

And yet the need for improved instruction to reach poor and reluctant readers compares in seriousness with the needs in the United States and Great Britain. It is recommended that research should place less emphasis on comparative evaluation of teaching methods and an increased emphasis on understanding learning processes and language development. A series of studies done in Canberra, Australia, is described. Language samples from over 100 primary-grade children were analyzed, and these samples were compared with language patterns in reading materials. It was concluded that children of fairly high language development, who have mastered grammatical constructions and vocabulary and whose family backgrounds are  rich in language, have little trouble learning to read, regardless of the system used. It was postulated that these children had less trouble with the artificial language of a primer than did children who had not yet mastered oral language. It was further postulated that instruction aimed at increasing the language development of children who experienced early difficulty in reading would help them become more efficient readers. (MS)",

Reliabilities were obtained by using a sample of approximately 750 junior-high-school students. In addition, the experimental  tests and a reading subtest of the Sequential Tests of Educational Progress (STEP) were administered to 240 junior-high-school students, half of whom read the paragraphs and answered the questions and the other half answered only the questions. Items judged for passage relatedness were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance procedures.

The sample consisted of 87 fifth-grade students who were of above-average intelligence. To study the relationship of children's skill at recovering the deep structure of sentences to reading comprehension, the Deep Structure Recovery Test (DSRT) was designed and administered. Reading comprehension, measured by a cloze test and the reading subtest of the Metropolitan Achievement Test, correlated significantly with the DSRT. The DSRT was found to be the most important factor in reading comprehension as measured by the cloze test when compared to IQ, word knowledge, and word recognition skills. The relationship of children's skill at making a lexical analysis of the main verb  of sentences and reading comprehension was measured by a sentence completion test and the subjects' performance on sets of items which contained different types of verbs. It was concluded that while the ability to recover the deep structure is an important aspect of reading comprehension, the results did not indicate a clear relationship between lexical analysis strategy and reading comprehension.

By differential vowel duration is meant the relatively different durations of vowels according to whether the following consonant is voiced or voiceless, stop or fricative. The children's task was to produce a series of consonant-vowel-consonant English words using each of the vowels /I i u/ before one voiceless and one voiced fricative. Four stimulus conditions were used: a visual stimulus using familiar storybook pictures and three sets of tape-recorded stimuli with the vowel /i/. One set had normal differential vowel duration, another had abnormal equal vowel duration, and the  third had four occurrences of each word with graded vowel durations. Results showed that acquisition of differential vowel duration preceded control of the voicing feature which conditions it in adult English. Correct intrinsic vowel duration was produced in all responses. This document, Part 1, includes the introduction and reports of three stimulus conditions.

Four stimulus conditions were used: a visual stimulus using familiar storybook pictures and three sets of tape-recorded stimuli with the vowel /i/. One set had normal differential vowel duration, another had abnormal equal vowel duration, and the  third had four occurrences of each word with graded vowel durations. Results showed that acquisition of differential vowel duration preceded control of the voicing feature which conditions it in adult English. Correct intrinsic vowel duration was produced in all responses. This document, Part 2, includes the report of the fourth stimulus condition, conclusions, appendixes, and a bibliography. Part 1 of this study can be found in document RE 003 491. (Author/DH)",

The bibliography is divided into three major parts: elementary, secondary, and college-adult. Part 1, Elementary School Reading, comprises the major portion of the book, reflecting the preponderance of research done in this area. It is divided into seven sections which deal with general, basal, individualized, language-linguistics, programed,  phonics, and artificial orthography programs. Part 2, Junior and Senior High School Reading, is concerned with applications of skills at these levels, with the use of reading in the content areas, and with remedial methods and programs for dropouts. Part 3, College and Adult Reading, contains references to documents dealing with reading programs in colleges and in junior colleges, in the armed services, and business and industry-related groups. Each entry contains a full bibliographic citation and a brief annotation. Ordering information and an author index are included. (MS)",

The problems and consequences of an increasing birth rate are indicated along with the need for reducing present rates of population growth and eventual stabilization of population size at some manageable level. Commitment to voluntary family planning, enabling a couple to regulate its family size and respecting its right to do so, is urged. To this end, governmental policies designed to influence fertility must in large measure depend upon a high degree of congruence between the overall society's objectives, and those of the individuals comprising that society. While the  principle of free choice will not automatically assure reduction in fertility, it will be consistent with our traditional emphasis on the dignity of the individual. (BL)",

The authors begin by proposing an operational definition of the number concept in the form of a set of behaviors which, taken together, permit the reference that the child has an abstract concept of \"number.\" These are the objectives of the curriculum. Each behavior in the defining set is then subjected to an analysis which identifies hypothesized components of skilled performance and prerequisites for learning these components. On the basis of these analyses, specific sequences of learning objectives are proposed. Finally, a discussion of the ways  in which a hierarchically sequenced early learning curriculum can be used in schools is presented. In particular, a \"complete mastery model\" is described.

A secondary objective was to determine whether or not there was some underlying multidimensional structure to a set of mathematics achievement data. The four clustering procedures (Ball and Hall's ISODATA, Johnson's HICLUS, Friedman and Rubin's iterative procedure, Singleton and Kantz's iterative procedure) were compared by applying them to a data set from the National Longitudinal Study of Mathematical Abilities of SMSG. The clustering variables were scales which described the characteristics of thirty junior high schools and their communities. The four clustering techniques produced very similar sets of clusters, and  from all indications three or four clusters seem appropriate for clustering the mathematics achievement data. It was found that the students' mathematics achievement across clusters was not the same after adjustments were made for differences in aptitude and initial understanding of mathematical concepts. It was concluded that the differences in achievement were due at least in part to the effect of the particular school on the student. (Author/RS)",

        "description":"Discussed are the difficulties of implementing research findings in elementary schools; i.e. effecting a change at the level of interaction between teacher and pupil. An inherent difficulty is communicating research findings to the people in the local school systems who must act on them. The author states that even if this is remedied the following problem remains: convincing a person to act on what is to him unfamiliar information and to change his behavior when he has no readily apparent investment in the change. To solve this problem the author proposes involving teachers to the extent that they feel a part of the investigations and have some investment in their outcomes. From his own experiences he cites three ways in which this may be accomplished; the use of demonstration  centers as training sites, getting as many teachers as possible actively involved in the research project, and urging teachers to try individual research studies within their own classrooms.

The 1968-1969 school year represented the first year during which a formal PEP program was implemented. This report describes the results of this first year. The PEP early learning curriculum included the following areas: (1) beginning mathematics curriculum; (2) classification curriculum, which included skills in basic color, size, and shape discrimination; and (3) gross and fine motor skills curriculum. The effectiveness of PEP is indicated by the significant gains in I.Q. scores and achievement levels by both the PEP criterion-referenced tests and standardized tests. This report presents information on  students' progress in cognitive learning only. However, PEP is attempting to create a total learning environment which will affect the growth of young children in both cognitive and psychological development. (Author/FL)",

The learning task was presented by a computer assisted instruction system to 130 introductory educational psychology and science education students. After being given a battery of six cognitive ability tests, all students were randomly assigned to either an example only, an objective-example, a rule-example or an objective-rule-example treatment. The presentation of rules significantly reduced the number of examples and total time required to complete the task and increased performance on a transfer test. The presentation of objectives did not significantly affect total or display latency, but significantly reduced  the requirement for reasoning ability. It was concluded that objectives have orienting and organizing effects which dispose students to attend to, process, and structure relevant information in accordance with the given objectives.

He outlined the status of health care in this country, including the financial state of medical affairs, particularly for university health sciences centers and medical schools, and the lack of efforts in reducing common diseases, smoking, highway accidents, and environmental pollution. Recent national trends indicate: (1) pressure for increased manpower output and thus delivery of health services on a team basis, and (2) the consumer having a voice in the development and direction of health education and care facilities. Implications for health sciences campuses are that team teaching  and multi-disciplinary teaching will be more fully utilized, emphasis will be placed on economy of operation, and hospitals and other care facilities must become self-supporting.

Eight item prototypes were developed from which the items tried out were generated. Items were compiled into seven test booklets each of which was administered to approximately 40 children. Staff members and teachers who had used the instructional program reviewed sample items for their measurement of the objectives they were designed to test. Teachers' comments were generally suggestions for changes in wording; questions raised by staff  members could best be answered by research on the completed instrument.

The independent variables were (1) teacher attitude (high, middle, low); (2) grade level (3, 5, and 6); and (3) sex of student. The dependent variable was the mean classroom attitude score calculated separately for the two sexes. The results showed no significant relationships between teacher and student attitudes. However, there was a significant difference  (p<.01) among the three grade levels. In fact, Scheffe's tests revealed a definite decrease in students' attitudes toward arithmetic with significant differences occurring between grades 3 and 6 and grades 5 and 6.

Thus, policies and methods of school health programs and services outlined here are designed to help local school districts in the assessment of existing programs and in the development of new policies and procedures. Topics covered include: responsibilities of school personnel, health appraisal and medical examinations, supportive and special health programs, first aid and emergency care, school laws, and State Board of Education rules and regulations for health. Quick reference  to some of the information is provided through occasional use of charts and lists. (BL)",

This study was begun \"to formulate and test a unified secondary school mathematics program (7-12) that will take capable students well into current collegiate mathematics\" and to \"determine the education required by teachers who will implement such a program.\" Also included in the report is a scheme for a taxonomy of objectives and course contents for each of the three courses developed (grades 7-8-9). Recommendations are that the program be reexamined for possible adoption as a curriculum for all junior high school students, that the preservice mathematics education of prospective junior high school teachers be reexamined, and  that the unified approach developed for junior high school be extended throughout the senior high school.

        "description":"The study was designed to develop, test, and refine a model of teaching behavior for teachers of a first course in algebra. The model described five categories of teaching behavior which should be exhibited by algebra teachers. To aid in observation of these behavior categories, a modified Flanders interaction Analysis instrument was developed and is included in the report. The instrument was used to categorize verbal behavior of three ninth grade algebra classes each of ten teachers. A pretest of math ability and posttests of algebraic achievement and attitude toward the teacher were administered to the students in each of the ten classes. No significant differences were found between student achievement and attitude in relation to ratings of teachers on (1) years of teaching  experience or (2) number of semester hours of credit in mathematics. However, teachers who had high correspondence to the model had higher student achievement and significantly (.05) higher student attitude toward the teacher than teachers having low correspondence to the model.

Immediate knowledge of results was provided for group one, delayed for group two, and no knowledge of results for group three. Residual scores, obtained by taking the difference between the number of novel problems answered correctly and the predicted number using stepwise multiple regression, were used as the dependent variables. These residual scores were analyzed using a four factor mixed model analyses of variance, with subjects nested within classes which in turn were nested within treatments. The fourth factor was a repeated measures factor (acquisition and retention tests for analyses one, treatment  days for analysis two, and performance on non-novel problems for analysis three). No significant treatment effects were found. Significant differences among classes were observed, pointing out clearly how this source of variation, which has historically been implicitly pooled by investigators unfamiliar with statistical nesting, can affect scores.

The teacher behaviors that were considered emphasized three instructional functions: (a) causing learner awareness of learning goals; (b) evoking learning performance including completion of the learning task and provision of motivation for learning; (c) assessing learning outcomes. The experiment involved teachers who received special training in the use of seven teacher behaviors and teachers who received no training. Two main implications  of this study were found. (1) When the learning environment is controlled in terms of subject matter content and materials, and proportion of time devoted to independent vs. group learning, the group learning situation produces superior outcomes. (2) Measurement of a specific set of teacher behaviors that define only a limited segment of the total teaching act does aid in the prediction of variance in pupil learning outcomes. (FL)",

The model is based on the idea that social studies offered as part of the socialization process are either directed to the passive citizen who votes, serves on juries, etc., or to the participant citizen who actively gives some direction to the growth of our society. Both types of citizens are seen to be then confronted with: 1) comprehending: knowing the heritage of our culture; 2) coping: working with the demands of our political, social, and economic institutions; and, 3) connecting: seeing the emotionally satisfying roles that can be assumed in our increasingly pluralistic society. The author then gives examples of how the various new social studies project materials can be submitted to his  model criteria in order to clarify the uses of the curriculum adopted. A bibliography is included. (CWB)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to explore a possible program for the development of world understanding and cooperation in a school setting for children under six years of age. The framework for this interdisciplinary human relations education program includes interrelated process skills, with generalizations, and action proposals. Process skills involve synthesis of the child's feelings and emotions with his ability to process and utilize information. To achieve these goals importance is placed on the methods used to foster the process skills of perceiving, communicating, loving, decision-making, knowing, patterning, creating, and valuing. Direct acquaintance with people of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds is the most effective method to develop empathy or understanding of  individual, physical, cultural, and racial differences. The concepts or generalizations presented are suggestions which need not be considered sequentially. These are followed by action proposals or suggestions for various learning activities which contribute to the child's understandings of the concepts. It is suggested that attitude development begun in the home can be clarified and extended as teachers and parents plan and work together. In addition, human relations education must be an integral part of preservice and inservice teacher education programs. (SBE)",

        "description":"During the winter semester of 1970 a seminar was conducted for doctoral students in social studies education as a practicum in curriculum development to meet some of the special needs of the small high school, specifically the production of social science independent study packages. The packages produced were one-half Carnegie unit equivalent senior elective packages to be pilot tested in the Laboratory school at Missouri University the following year. The packages were conceived of as meeting three needs in education: 1) a need for greater commitment to the concept of continuous progress, to encourage further study in the social sciences; 2) a need for breadth in the small school social studies curriculum through self-contained packages for the student and the teacher; and, 3) a  need for the fostering of responsibility in students for their own learning. At the present time six packages have been completed: 1) General Psychology; 2) Introduction to Prehistory (Anthropology); 3) Understanding Our Economy; 4) The American Civil War; 5) The Negro in America; and, 6) American Political Parties. Three more packages are scheduled for completion: 1) American Foreign Policy Since 1945; 2) The History of Science; and, 3) Ethopia. The ultimate goal is to offer seniors twenty to twenty-five such packages. (SBE)",

The Institute staff and thirty participants, chosen in administrator-teacher teams from inner-city schools, are listed. There were three phases of program operation: 1) Workshop and lectures; 2) Field testing of curriculum materials produced in Phase I; and 3) Revision of materials. Evaluation procedures on the 25 experimental and 25 control classes are detailed as an entire section on evaluation.  Results of the analysis indicate that Institute participants felt positively toward the materials they produced and their experiences in the Institute. The children in the program learned more about integrated Afro-American history and enjoyed the learning process.

Other objectives included development of materials and implementation of the program. The methods involved the development of two models: one for interaction of the Providence Public Schools and Rhode Island College to identify the various categories involved in curriculum development together with the stages involved in the process; and, the other to develop curriculum guides and resource units from an analysis of the concept structure of the social sciences and of the broad aims set for the social studies program.  Results, conclusions, and recommendations are also treated. Of the six conclusions, one stated that the program has adaptability to another school system any place in the country and could be implemented within two calendar years. (Author/DJB)",

These several reasons are discussed: 1) the educational system operating in black communities may in terms of comparative education methodology be compared to that operating in many colonial and ex-colonial areas, it may also be examined in terms of class structure; 2) if the effects of Negritude and the Moslem faith are thought to be important variables in the school and to have similar effects on students in different nations including the United States, use of the comparative approach is also appropriate; 3) where nations are interested in strategies to ameliorate the lot of disadvantaged groups and/or to secure integration, the United States provides  some excellent case studies; 4) one can compare separate black and white educational structures in terms of operations, manpower objectives, etc. The bibliography contains these sections: 1) history; 2) political, legal, and civil rights; 3) socio-cultural attributes, class structure, and race; 4) cognitive development and socio-conceptual styles; 5) the family; 6) language and dialects; 7) learning and intelligence; 8) education, employment, and vocations; 9) urban education and case studies; 10) educational surveys; 11) equality and quality education; and, 12) innovative educational and social strategies.

(IC). The IC is perceived as a facilitator of change in schools for purposes of improved instruction. Application of anthropology to education takes two general forms. The first is the use of anthropolgical concepts and methods to an analysis of the educative process called the anthropology of education. This paper develops: 1) a brief rationale for relating cultural anthropology to the work of the IC by looking at some of the procedures employed in the anthropology of education; 2) presents some analytical perspectives for examining the role of the IC; and, 3) spells out some of the  operational implications for the preparation of IC's. It is noted that the perspectives suggested for analysis and training are not meant to be limited to a supervisory function, they are intended to be tested for their utility in helping educators understand and develop human activities and interaction including relationships among students, students and teachers, teachers, teachers and administrators, and parents.

It has been only within the last ten years that countries have paid systematic attention to the development of educational programs. The specific form of these programs varies from country to country, but there is a consensus among population educators that these concepts should be infused in all relevant subject areas and grade levels--not constitute a special course. Several countries, such as Korea, are well along in laying the foundations for a sound program, but Chile is the farthest advanced in actually developing a national program. They have not only developed the conceptual scheme for  infusing population education into the elementary and secondary social studies curriculum, but have translated the scheme into instructional materials. The program is interdisciplinary, flexible, and stresses inquiry methods. The Chilean model is incomplete, however, in that it does not include a development in the biological sciences comparable to that in the social sciences, nor is there an institutionalized method for introducing these concepts in teacher training programs.

Locating and organizing information, interpreting pictures, charts, and maps; observing, applying problem-solving techniques and critical thinking to his own life; and working with others, are the skills in which the third  grader will need instruction and the means by which he will discover man's interaction with the land.

The universe consisted of all classes, grades 6 through 9, participating in the new social studies program. Stratified sampling of this group and a matched  control group in another urban district were used. Three sets of original instruments, two sets of classroom observation schedules, and three observers were used. Results indicated that the attitudes of the teachers and students in the experimental groups were significantly more positive with respect to the questions above. However, teachers felt that they needed a wider spectrum of materials, more training, and more staff assistance. Tabulated data and analyses are included.

The examinations used were for short units developed by the curriculum project Sociological Resources for the Social Studies. Twelve short units, or episodes, were taught to nine thousand high school students in three hundred classrooms in central city, rural, and suburban areas. Student achievement was measured through the use of episode examinations administered to paired classes as pre-and posttests. The results did not support the hypothesis. Although there were gains in learning for all classes, the  variation between the stimulus and control groups was not statistically significant. Limitations of the study include the small number of cases in several of the categories of comparison, the cognitive character of the achievement, testing instruments, and the use of a volunteer teacher sample.

A significant departure from other innovative efforts within the profession was the heavy involvement of classroom teachers. Some highly useful ideas for bringing about needed changes in social studies education also emerged. Briefly stated, some of these are: 1) we must help youth to seek the truth about modern life... face it more freely, and change it more fully, rather than continue to indoctrinate through rote memorization of facts; 2) classroom work will have meaning only if it is related to community commitment outside the classroom; 3) the  informed public opinion that could act as a check on the irresponsible exercise of power by the United States Government does not yet exist. The classroom must critically confront the realities of nuclear power, the military industrial complex, etc; and, 4) Black studies are not needed merely or especially for blacks, but for whites. Wingspread also called for the establishment of a clearinghouse and newsletter for disseminating information about innovation in secondary social studies. Some major revisions in teacher training are needed in order to accomplish these objectives. (JLB)",

The thirty participants were drawn from education and several social sciences, giving a strong interdisciplinary flavor to the proceedings.

A summary is included of varying procedures throughout the provinces regarding school age requirements, grade structure, promotion, school calendar, and such special programs as bilingual instruction in English and French, Catholic and non-Catholic schools, and curriculum innovation. It is  noted that local education boards have the delegated authority to operate schools directly and to provide funds with provincial and federal assistance. The survey shows, however, that the federal government has jurisdiction over education programs for Eskimos, Indians, inmates of federal penitentiaries, and dependents of members of Canadian Armed Forces. Listed are 20 federal departments or agencies and 10 national organizations involved with education in Canada.

The individual will develop an understanding of his physical self and of the nature and qualities of appropriate human behavior in a social context. He will understand that each individual, because of his unique biological, psychological, and sociological configuration, conceives ideas differently because he perceives his environment differently. An inductive method of studying man throughout time and around the world is employed. The skill objectives include: 1) skill in locating, appraising, and interpreting data concerning social problems; 2) ability to organize data obtained through research, listening, and observing; 3) ability to express himself orally, in writing, and  graphically; 4) ability to participate effectively in groups; and, 5) ability to use critical and reflective thinking in problem solving. The attitudinal objectives are: 1) respect for the worth and dignity of every individual; 2) social and civic responsibility; and, 3) respect for law and legal process. Guides for each of four units contain: an outline of content and purpose, cognitive and affective objectives, suggested learning activities, a bibliography of multimedia materials, and a student bibliography.

        "description":"The objective of the project reported here was to devise and put into operation a social studies program for junior high school students in the seventh and eighth grades. The objectives for this program were to develop the informed individual with: 1) a good self-concept with a sense of individual worth; 2) a sense of moral judgment; 3) a valid understanding of the nature of race and of the many misconceptions about race now prevalent; 4) respect ethnic groups and their achievements; 5) understanding of the nature of conflict as a constant in human living and of socially acceptable ways of resolving it; and, 6) understanding of the many roles an individual assumes as a member of society and the influence these roles have upon him. A team researched the problem, and tried out the  learning activities and materials devised or selected in the classroom. The end product was two teacher resource guides that include both cognitive and affective objectives, and rely upon inductive or inquiry methods, the use of critical thinking, role-playing, independent and small group research, and multi-media instruction. The guide for the seventh grade has been published (SO 000 858). An objective evaluation instrument was constructed, administered at the end of the 1970 school year, analyzed, revised, and will be published for use with the guide. (SBE)",

One program discussed is the sensitivity training approach. It is discussed in terms of its goals, techniques, role of the leader, and appropriateness for the foreign student. The other approach, intercultural communication workshop, is analyzed in the same manner. The burden of the paper is to show that the nature of each approach limits its usefulness for a specific group. The sensitivity approach is felt to be of doubtful use in a setting involving persons who are not accustomed to a penetrating search into their own personalities. The workshop on the other hand is deemed more useful  with participants who are inclined to deal with reality from a cognitive perspective as distinct from an affective one.

Data for the first study consisted of the number of correct responses by each student to the three daily 12-question posttests and the 18-question post-posttest; for the second study the number of correct responses by Ss to a 16-item posttest and a 20-item post-posttest. Results were submitted to means tests and  analysis of variance to determine the effects on performance of class, day, conditions, type of administration, and their possible interactions. The study failed to support previous studies: There was no general facilitative effect of interspersed questions (after relevant text material) on incidental learning. No experimental differences were found when sixth graders were treated in intact classroom situations vs. small groups, and no differences were found that could be attributed to days with respect to short term and delayed retention.

Criteria used were 1) each respondent's total score describes with at least 90 percent accuracy which items were reacted to favorably or unfavorably; 2) the item marginals, or the percentage of favorable responses to each scale item can be consistently rank ordered from the lowest percentage pro through the highest percentage pro; and 3) the scale can be submitted successfully to intensity analysis to determine which score represented a dividing line between favorable and unfavorable attitudes. Test  included administration to 1) 1,070 university undergraduates who selected and rated one of their best teachers and one of their worst; 2) a follow-up with 660 college sophomores; 3) 2,186 tenth graders in 14 high schools--using Cornell scalogram analysis and intensity analysis and correlation with principal's ratings of teachers, 4) replication with 1,912 sixth graders in 48 schools in seven districts.

Children who were above 90 percent or had 10 percent improvement were given access to all activities in a project room. Children with less than 10 percent improvement were given limited access to activities. Children who decreased more than 10 percent were restricted to teaching machines. When spelling scores were no longer included in percentage scores, spelling scores decreased. When spelling was again counted but math was not, spelling scores increased and math scores decreased. The success of the manipulations indicated that written performance in the classroom, including tests and homework, can be brought under operant control.  Reinforcement in this case was the opportunity for the child to work on such projects as baking and working on models. Children seemed to respond much better to reward than to whatever consequences presumably followed their poor scores in the classroom or at home. (Author/JS)",

The three teacher workshops dealt with development and use of instructional objectives stated in performance terms, implementation of the concepts of learning modules and mastery tests, and application of contingency management techniques for controlling student behavior in the classroom. The program provided participants with first hand practice and experience. Numerous practical exercises were built into  each schedule, and participants were asked to use instructional materials, course content, and specific behavior problems from their school-year environments and experiences. In the contingency management workshop, classroom practice was held with pupils, and teachers alternating as teachers and observers. Additional workshops were conducted for administrative and supervisory personnel to enable them to provide knowledgeable support to the teachers in implementing the new techniques during the school year. Workshops were considered successful. A follow-up program will assist the teachers in implementation and evaluate the effectiveness of the innovative techniques in the classroom. (Author/JS)",

Elementary school teachers employed in a suburban St. Louis district (N=260) responded to the Pupil Control Ideology Form (PCI). From this group 20 were selected to comprise two experimental groups: those with highest scores (custodial) and those with lowest (humanistic). Flanders' interaction analysis was then used to classify the classroom verbal interaction of each teacher in the two groups during each of three 20-minute observation periods. Data was analyzed by utilizing the test of significance of a difference between proportions, z to test three null hypotheses. There was no significant difference between the proportions of indirect verbal  behavior, of direct verbal behavior, or of student verbal behavior. However, the humanistic and custodial Ss in this study differed in the frequency of use of verbal behaviors categorized as 1) accepting and developing student ideas; 2) lecturing, giving facts or opinions; and 3) student-initiated verbal behaviors. In each case, the humanistic group of teachers utilized significantly more verbal behaviors classified as indirect than did the custodial group of teachers. It is therefore concluded that the pupil control ideology of the teacher does differentially affect selected verbal behavior in the classroom. (Author/JS)",

        "author":["St. John, Nancy"],
        "description":"A study investigated the academic growth, self concept, and interracial friendship behavior of 956 black and white sixth graders under teachers of varying characteristics. The major independent variable was teacher characteristics, the independent variables were four measures of the academic growth of pupils and four measures of their attitudes. After one week's observation researchers rated the 36 white teachers on 13 dimensions using Ryans' (1960) Characteristics of Teachers Scale. Validity of ratings was measured by examination of narratives and interview protocols and by comparison of ratings of first/second observers and observer/mother. Factor analysis of ratings revealed three clusters of characteristics (&quot;child-orientation,&quot;&quot;task-orientation,&quot; and &quot;fairness&quot;) that were  unrelated to background characteristics of teachers or ability level of pupils. Relationships were examined by means of zero order correlations, analysis of variance, and multiple regression analysis. For black pupils, child-orientation correlated significantly with reading growth and fairness with improved conduct. Between-classroom variance in black reading scores nearly doubled from fall to spring. The relationship of teacher characteristics and pupil outcomes did not diminish when the effects of sex, IQ, family SES, and classroom SES and percentage white were removed through multiple regression analysis. Conclusion: Minority group children appear to be responsive to teachers with interpersonal skill, rather than subject-competence. (Author/JS)",

        "description":"A program was conducted to train 20 experienced teachers and administrators from school districts in Southern Appalachia as agents of change in entry-level administrative leadership positions in the districts from which they have been recruited. Leading to a master of science degree with a major in educational administration and supervision, the program covered 15 months full-time spanning a summer, a full academic year, and the following summer. Included were a human relations laboratory (sensitivity training), selected field problems, simulation, an intensive humanities \"live in\" seminar, an academic year-long behavioral science seminar, and seminars in change agency, decision making, and group processes. Other experiences included two short-term internships in the home  district during the 15-month period, an organized program for the development of strategies for implementing needed changes in the home district. Results of a test battery administered before the program indicated a group well above average in academic potential and ability with a slightly better than average achievement record, a reasonable competence in general English skills, a strong conceptual ability, with a tendency toward dogmatism in its attitudes. Reaction to the program by both staff and fellows was \"overwhelmingly favorable,\" with the \"live in\" humanities seminar and human relations laboratory ranked as major strengths. (JS)",

        "author":["Merritt, Daniel L."],
        "description":"A study explored the relationships between 1) congruence of attitudes between principals and teacher candidates with different job qualifications, and 2) principals' attraction to teacher candidates. Concern was to test relationships expressed in Newcomb's ABX system of interpersonal attraction. In a simulated selection situation, elementary principals (N=140) rated an applicant for a teaching position. Principals were volunteers from a random sample of 500 drawn from all full-time elementary principals in New York State excluding New York City and Long Island. Instruments were the Education Scale (Kerlinger and Kaya, 1959) to secure principals' attitudes toward general educational practices and the Interpersonal Judgment Scale (Byrne, 1961) to measure their attraction to the  hypothetical candidates presented to them. Teacher applicants were represented by written information in which the attitude congruence with the principal and the level of teacher qualifications were varied. The results of data analysis (two-way analysis of variance) suggest that 1) the similarity-dissimilarity of attitudes between principal and teacher candidates does affect principal attraction to the candidate with principals more attracted to those holding attitudes similar to their own and 2) effect of similarity-dissimilarity of attitudes seems to be more powerful than the effect of teacher candidate qualifications.

        "description":"This manual is first in the series \"Personalized Education for Teachers,\" a program based on the thesis that truly personalized public education (that which is tailored to fit the personal needs and feelings of students) is possible now. The general purpose of the manual is to present a system of ideas and procedures which make it possible to personalize the education of elementary teachers and, by extension, the education of students of all ages. The first half of the manual is designed to help teacher educators to understand what prospective teachers are concerned about. A teacher concerns model is described which depicts the teacher concerns or growth motives which occur in a regular sequence. The second half describes application of the model and what it involves. Materials  are listed to assist in applying the model through the use of two kinds of procedures for tailoring teacher education programs to fit the personal needs of prospective teachers. Desirable outcomes, costs, both economic and personal, and possible undesirable outcomes are described. Included are a list of 33 references; a list of 14 other items in the series (manuals, videotapes, assessment instruments, etc.); and an overview model for the use of these materials in the personalized education program which involves four steps: 1) assessment of teachers, 2) arousal (activation) of concerns, 3) awareness (perception) of feelings, and 4) resolution (learning) of concerns.

        "description":"As has been the case in medicine, social work, and psychiatry, progress in education will follow closely the adequacy of our category system concerning pertinent functions of a child, our understanding of these functions, how children fail to function properly (malfunction), causes of malfunction, signs of malfunction, course of malfunction (time, sequence, and states), means of detection, and the development of techniques specific to a task. The more we understand our task, the more we can direct our efforts. Not only is such information necessary to classroom diagnosis and prescription, but it also serves to direct research and development efforts. A study of the literature in these other applied sciences to determine the types of background knowledge a practitioner in these  professions requires in order to provide appropriate treatments for his clientele reveals, among other things, the fact that these professions emphasize diagnostic information more than does education, the practitioner's first task being to arrive at a systematic understanding of his client so that he can focus his efforts more effectively. If individualization of instruction implies that the teacher's task is to provide experiences appropriate to each child's present level of development, potential, interests, etc., then a similar approach is needed for progress in education.

        "author":["Neujahr, James L."],
        "description":"To examine three teachers' communication to individual students during their attempts to individualize instruction, a class of sixth grade students was videotaped as it spent a week in science, in social studies, and in mathematics. Tapes were analyzed using a modified form of Bellack's observation system. With the pedagogical move as the primary unit of analysis, the emitter(s) and target(s) of each move were coded with pupils individually identified in over 95 percent of all moves. Each move was coded as to whether it had substantive meaning (dealing with subject matter) or instructional meaning (dealing with assignments, materials, procedures, and other nonsubstantive topics). Data was analyzed to reveal 1) the percentage range in teacher usage of each move type (structuring,  soliciting, responding, reacting); 2) number of moves directed to each pupil per class; 3) percentage range of teacher moves in type of meaning communicated (substantive or instructional); and 4) the various types of teacher ratings (none, positive, negative, or both) received by pupils. Results give evidence of considerable consistency of teacher role as he reacts with different pupils in an individualized format. His primary function remains soliciting, and the functions he performs least frequently are structuring and responding. Although his functions do not vary greatly, the frequency of interaction varies greatly across pupils, as does the content of the interaction. (JS)",
