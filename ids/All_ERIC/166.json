        "description":"Since the &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; decision in 1964, courts have debated the degrees of protection from defamation that should be offered to individuals and the concomitant degree of freedom that the press should have to report on matters of public concern. Most recently, the Supreme Court has attempted to balance these competing interests in the cases of &quot;Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Time, Inc. v. Firestone.&quot; From these two cases come new definitions of public figures and private individuals, two categories given differing amounts of protection under the law. After examining the various manners in which state courts and lower federal courts have construed these definitions, it is concluded that there will be no rest for publishers and broadcasters while the criteria  for determining who is a public figure and who is a private individual are so unsettled.

This publication summarizes the major points set forth by each discussion leader and includes selected comments from participants. The following topics were discussed: reaching and holding the marginal reader; using news research to increase readership, achievement test scores, print and the TV-centered world of children, how people read, reaching the minority reader, newspaper in the classroom, graphics, techniques that work (a round table discussion), and a perspective.

The second half of the paper provides a summary of the developmental course of presentational (or artistic) techniques. Developmental changes in skill in literature, music, and the pictorial arts are discussed in terms of the complexity of the experience which can be mastered, the specific techniques and conventions of symbolic systems, and the relationships between the experience in a work and the life-experience of the individual. Parallels are noted between the  development of skill in the arts and other areas of psychological development, including the changes that result from the acquisition of formal operational modes of thinking.

        "description":"This publication discusses a cost analysis study of bilingual education in Texas that sought to determine the per-pupil costs of a minimally adequate program that would correspond to the regular monolingual program funded under the state's foundation finance program. The study identified the essential costs of a model bilingual education program as defined by a panel of experts and then calculated weighted-pupil factors for different grade levels of elementary bilingual education. Although the study focused specifically on the state of Texas, the methodology used can be readily adapted to develop cost factors for other states. Findings of the study indicate that cost weights for the first year of a bilingual program are 1.31 for grade K, 1.42 for grades 1-3, and 1.36 for grades  4-5; for subsequent years of a bilingual program the cost weights are 1.25 for grade K, 1.35 for grades 1-3, and 1.30 for grades 4-5.

Although courses had been selected previously with the aid of a counselor, arena scheduling allowed students some freedom in the choice of the teacher or time of day or semester that they wanted for a particular course. To examine reactions to arena scheduling, questionnaires were given to samples of students and to all staff members. Responses of the students were generally favorable, particularly when preferred teachers and/or times were obtained. Most of the teachers agreed that the advantages of arena scheduling outweighed any disadvantages. Although there were many suggestions made to modify and  improve the arena scheduling procedure, most of the respondents to the questionnaires favored its retention at Templeton. (Author)",

The place of the high school in the scheme of schooling is receiving an unprecedented searching reappraisal. New programs are being developed to meet the needs of high school age students and also to expand the utilization of school facilities by community members. Districts experiencing declining enrollments have tried a variety of options. First among these is redeployment of surplus space to accommodate those activities and programs that have been deprived of adequate space. Other  uses of surplus space have been for vocational, special, and adult education programs; teacher centers; and community schools as service centers. Finally, rather than destroy the local high school (a strong community symbol), some areas enacted legislation enabling the private sector to convert unused school buildings to shops, theaters, and other community amenities.

The manual attempts to describe the requirements and development of a tutoring program in generic terms; however, it often cites examples from the program on which it is based, the ESCAPE Tutoring Program at the University of Oregon. The manual is divided into four sections that focus in turn on important aspects of a tutoring program. Section 1 outlines the essential steps in structuring and implementing a tutoring program. Section 2 offers guidelines for volunteer tutors. Section 3 outlines the structure and content of personnel training. And section 4 provides basic guidelines  to teachers using tutors. Each of the sections can be read apart from the other; however, the reader seeking a full perspective on a tutoring program is advised to read all the sections. (Author/JG)",

Students were identified by these study areas so one is able to determine where students live and where they attend school. Consequently, the correlation of a considerable amount of sociological and school data is possible. This information is helpful in determining the stability of particular school areas, the influence of the open schools, and the extent to which racial composition is affected by where students attend school versus where they live. Three tables provide  information on student membership in attendance areas (by race), percent of students residing in attendance areas who are in membership in that area (by race), and number of students who leave their neighborhood to attend another high school (by race).

It has been suggested that planning traditionally employs a rational decision model that leaves the planner poorly equipped to deal with matters of organizational process and governmental politics. Planning, to be more effective, must now begin to proceed in depth into an analysis of, and the development of procedures related to, organizational processes and political bargaining. Each of the three decision models developed by Graham Allison has broad implications for the role of the educational planner. The planner must now begin to devote much time to the theoretical  and methodological development of a planning orientation for the two models that have been largely ignored. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"This study examines the politics of program implementation in Michigan. It focuses on relations between the Michigan Department of Education and the state's local school districts in the administration of state aid for compensatory education. With its accountability emphasis and with the many administrative issues that have characterized its development over the years, the Michigan program offers an instructive test of the leadership capacity of the state education agency. The article focuses on the interplay of state and local power in determining the direction of the compensatory implementation process and the effect of an administrative bargaining game on interpretations of the law. The Michigan data is examined in terms of Morton Grodzins's &quot;sharing&quot; interpretation of  intergovernmental relations in which a structure of fragmented, yet coordinate, government supposedly ensures both central control and diversity. The discussion reveals the obstacles to reform that are inherent in the sharing argument. Only by establishing mutually supportive client-administrator relationships, by tempering leadership demands on the local schools, and by preventing the development of damaging state-local conflict could the department of education assure the continuation of its compensatory education idea.

Although a late entrant among the European nations engaged in school reform, West Germany is now heavily involved in the problems and politics of structural change. A &quot;General Plan for Education,&quot; calling for widespread alteration in the nation's educational system was approved by the various state and federal governments in late 1973. The first section of this paper briefly reviews the background of West Germany's planning effort and the major provision of the &quot;Plan.&quot; The second section assesses the current (mid-1975) situation in the implementation of German educational reform. The third, and major, section seeks to draw some general conclusions about educational  planning and the initiation of structural change. In the author's view, the German experience indicates the need for carefully designed strategies for implementation as a closely related function of plan development. (Author/IRT)",

Five areas are highlighted for special policy attention--support of certain noneducational programs, of revisions in present federal-state relations, of increased authority for local site management, of changes in testing and the setting of standards, and of the setting of policies for continuing education and for the maintenance of centers of excellence.

It is hypothesized that each school has a set of norms, evaluations, and expectations characterizing the achievement expected of students in general and of various student subgroups in particular. Although different norms, expectations, and evaluations applied to various groups and individuals account for some variation within the school, it is hypothesized that there are also differences in school social systems that explain differences in achievement among schools. The first and foremost general conclusion derived from this research is that some aspects of school social environment clearly  make a difference in the academic achievement between schools. The socioeconomic and racial composition of the schools explain a significant portion of the variance in mean achievement between schools, but the social-psychological and normative variables that were identified clearly contribute an additional portion of the explanation of the variance in mean school achievement. It was also determined that racial and socioeconomic composition alone are not an adequate description of the elementary school environment. (Author/IRT)",

It centers on educational participation as a behavioral act because outcomes are not independent of the actors who shape them. A knowledge of who participates and why they do so should help in understanding and predicting change in educational institutions. This research effort attempts to analyze the effect of selected antecedent and concurrent variables on participation in participatory educational planning. This particular vehicle for educational participation has two significant features: it is a form of involvement that allows people to participate at the policy level (making policy decisions via long- and medium-range planning proposals) and is an easily accessible form of participation. The first chapter deals  with participation in education generally and seeks to provide the context for subsequent examination of participation in planning. Chapter 2 provides the theoretical framework for this. study. In it are included the research design and operationalization of variables. The two subsequent chapters describe and analyze findings. Four groups of participants (parents, teachers, students, and administrators/nonteaching staff) are given separate attention. Chapter 5 brings together the major findings and discusses some of the implications. A detailed methodological section is provided in the appendix. (Author/IRT)",

In &quot;The Future Belongs to Those Who Prepare for It&quot; by D. McCartney, reasons for paying special attention to the education of the gifted and talented are pointed out. Recounted in a second chapter--entitled &quot;'Pushy Parents' Working for Gifted and Talented&quot; by K. Wood --are a father's practical solutions to many of the problems caused by community opposition to the education of gifted and talented children. Political action in the field of legislation for educational programs is the topic of &quot;How 'Organized Persuasion' Works for the Gifted in Public Education&quot; by C. Nathan. An outline of guidelines for organizing statewide and local groups is  presented in the chapter &quot;Are You an 'Only'? Organize for the Gifted and Talented!&quot; by K. Coffey. A final chapter--&quot;Practical Hints for Parents of Gifted Children&quot; by G. Ginsberg--provides a list of 20 suggestions for home life with the gifted child. Appended exhibits include an otuline of the qualities of gifted children in the preschool and elementary school years, a table of mini-courses sponsored by the Gifted Children's Association of San Fernando Valley for children from preschool to senior high school level, a community resource form for parent organization, and a description of suggested permanent committees for parent organization.

        "description":"Presented is the final report of a field survey involving 140 teachers which was conducted to determine whether elementary teachers, as compared to special education teachers, feel adequate in teaching children who exhibit learning, behavior, and neurological problems. Sections in chapter 1 address the need for the study, a statement of the problem, questions to be answered, delimitations, definitions, and an overview of study procedures. A review of the literature (chapter 2) notes that problems identified on the basis of teacher perception tend to be indicative of future academic performance of the child and of the need for some type of special education service. Study procedures are discussed in detail in chapter 3 on the theory and rationale of the survey instrument,  selection of the items for the instrument, the field test of the instrument, and the teacher survey. Tables are provided in chapter 4 on the statistical analysis of teacher responses. Results are summarized in chapter 5 as concluding that the teachers feel relatively adequate about the instructional approaches they report they would use for children exhibiting symptoms within each problem area; however, as teachers experience failure in assisting a child with problems, the likelihood for requesting assistance for special service increases. Appended material includes a copy of the self-report needs survey, the letter for the second follow-up questionnaire, eight item groups used during the field-test phase, and tables with raw data.

        "description":"Legal aspects relating to the application of procedural due process safeguards to special education are surveyed, the requirements of P.L. 94-142 are pointed out, state response to these safeguards are described, and the extent to which the adversarial hearing system has facilitated appropriate education is reported. Particular emphasis is placed on the landmark consent decrees in the federal cases of Pennsylvania Association of Retarded Children v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Mills v. District of Columbia Board of Education which provided for extensive and detailed procedural safeguards to protect the rights of children being classified on the basis of mental, physical, or emotional handicaps. Among the requirements listed for P.L. 94-142 are written notice of the  procedural safeguards available to the parents or guardians fo the child, the right to an impartial due process hearing, and the right to an independent evaluation. It is reported that the most typical state system includes notice to parents that their child has been referred for an evaluation, provision of an impartial hearing officer, and independent evaluation prior to the initial due process hearing. The bulk of the document is devoted to the findings of a study on perceptions of Massachusetts hearings participants (parents, lawyers, hearing officers, and school staff) involved in cases where parents have refused to sign educational plan prepared for their children. Findings are seen to indicate that although the intent of the hearing is to provide an informal forum in which parents  and schools can discuss the child before an impartial hearing officer, the adversarial hearing structure tended to reward behavior characteristic of a formal court hearing; i.e. the party which maximized the behavior which characterizes a formal proceeding increased their chances of winning the case. It is suggested that special education staff be taught to be specific in their statements regarding the child's needs and the prescriptive services required, and that they learn to describe objectives for the child in real terms rather than in mystifying &quot;lingo&quot;.

        "description":"Presented is the evaluation report on 28 projects serving seven different classes of handicapped children and their parents in Oregon which were funded under Title VI of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Brief sections cover the criteria for establishing funding priorities and the evaluation plan, results and discussion of the 1974-75 Title VI projects, and recommendations. The bulk of the doucment consists of individual evaluation reports on each of the 28 projects. Reports usually include such information as the following: title of the project, location of the project, population served, funding allocated, beginning and ending dates, background and rationale, objectives and evaluation plan, methodology, results, and third party evaluator's comments. It is noted that  1,058 children were served with nine projects for the emotionally disturbed, five projects for the hearing impaired, five projects for the learning disabled, three projects for the speech and language impaired, two projects each for the developmentally disabled and the educable mentally retarded, and one project each for the visually impaired and parents. Findings from the 28 projects are seen to support a method of education which involves taking children from the regular classroom for varying periods of time depending on their needs, providing assistance in various academic as well as behavioral problem areas, returning the children to the regular classroom for longer durations as the behavior begins to reach criterion level of acceptable performance, and training the regular class  teacher in procedures used by the special teacher.

This paper examines central concepts in the development and operation of self-instructional courses in languages which would otherwise not be included in the curriculum. Among the topics discussed are: individualization of instruction, reflecting the differences in student  interests, needs, aptitudes and objectives; and self-instruction, emphasizing the importance of training students in language-learning techniques. Consideration is given to material adaptation and development, participant orientation, the use of language laboratory facilities, tutorial sessions with native-speaking informants, evaluation and program supervision.

Evaluation teams visited schools in four jurisdictions; each school jurisdiction provided a representative sample of 50 non-Francophone students at each of the grades 6, 9, and 11, and a sample of 25 dropouts from the program in each of the grades 6 and 11. Tests and questionnaires were designed to determine: the attitude of students and teachers to existing French programs; the reaction of students to proposed activities in revised French programs; the attitude of parents and students to the study of French in general; and students' levels of performance in aural comprehension and oral French expression. Specifically, students were tested on aural comprehension, question-answering ability, task completion,  descriptive ability, and question-asking ability. It was found that: (1) there is considerable support for learning French; (2) ability to use French effectively increases appreciably at each grade; (3) students do not think they will be sufficiently fluent by the end of grade 12; teachers tend to agree; (4) students at all grades are weakest in aural comprehension and question-asking skills; and (5) parents and elementary school students and teachers see cultural understanding as a major objective; secondary-level students do not. Five recommendations are made on the basis of this study. Statistical data is provided; and parent, student and teacher questionnaires are appended. (Author/CFM)",

This series of lessons is not a self-instruction course. A native speaker-teacher is needed to instruct the student in the subtleties of pronunciation, cadence, ryhthm and tone of the Kanouri language.

After identifying factors associated with language achievement, the study suggested improvements in American foreign language teaching, including the advocacy of Foreign Service Testing. The major conclusion was that generally the level of achievement among foreign language majors at the senior level and  that of teachers at the NDEA Language Institutes is poor. These findings are relevant to Peace Corps language trainees, whose level of proficiency is very high. (AM)",

The curriculum is divided into four main strands: native language, second language, concept development, and cultural awareness. The two investigators were teachers working as a team integrating the four strands at each grade level (kindergarten to three) during the period 1969 to 1975. The program has among its major aims the development of coordinate bilingualism not only for the Spanish-speaking Mexican-American student but for his native English-speaking peer as well. The major  conclusions reached in this study are: (1) a strong commitment to a maintenance philosophy of bilingual education approached in a team-teaching manner has created the environment for the Spanish language that allows coordinate bilingualism to develop; (2) the two separate language environments and models have encouraged students to use the languages independently of each other, thus producing a higher degree of bilingualism; (3) strong native language development has been shown to be the key to second language acquisition; and (4) Anglo students have become progressively more bilingual.

An evaluation of proficiency in an S language should reflect the intuitions of S's native speakers. It is found that native speakers do not regard all instances of interference in S usage of their mother tongue as equally deviant from its P usage. This study looks at the nature and depth of interference in S Afrikaans usage by native English speakers, and the attitudes towards this interference. A differential tolerance of interference is described, applying to the phonological, syntactic, and lexical levels of Afrikaans. Cases of interference recognized as maximally deviant are of the low  tolerance type, while minimally deviant cases are of the high tolerance type. Two principles underlie this differential tolerance: linguistic distance determines that the use of an element or rule not found in P usage will result in low tolerance interference, and vice-versa; stylistic connotation determines that interference coinciding with strongly marked stylistic or sociolinguistic variants in P usage will result in low tolerance, and vice-versa. The latter principle outweighs the former. (CLK)",

This report describes the relationships between students' social and demographic background and program placement in the elementary and secondary school in the Toronto school system. Its purpose is to examine the relationships between program placement and both ethnic background and parental occupational status. The survey upon which the report is based established that almost 50% of the 1975 school population in Toronto came from low socio-economic backgrounds; 46% had English as a second language, and almost 60 nations were claimed as &quot;country of birth&quot; by at least 25 students per nation. Approximately 7.5% of the elementary school population was served by special education programs, and  approximately 60% of the secondary school population was enrolled in the fifth level of secondary school. Students' background characteristics were consistently related to program placement. The socioeconomic background of students in the Toronto school was generally a far better predictor of both special class placement and level of study in the secondary school than either country of birth or mother tongue.

        "description":"The &quot;Language from Within&quot; program is a collation of Gestalt strategies based on the principles of confluent education and adapted for use in the foreign language classroom. The underlying principles of confluent education are: awareness of feelings as the source of personal meaning (subject matter is learned only when the student sees how it is related to his personal life); direct communication (the &quot;I-You&quot; encounter takes precedence in humanistic education and therefore many of the strategies call for the students to work with a partner and talk directly to that partner); the use of nonverbal forms of communication (the students use their bodies to express words); living in the &quot;here and now&quot; immediacy of the classroom (an actual situation becomes the content for language  practice); developing positive and helpful relationships with each other (students utilize many opportunities to give each other positive feedback, appreciations, affirmations and warm acknowledgements); the use of guided imagery (students close their eyes and allow themselves to be led on fantasy journeys); responsibility for choosing and accepting consequences of choices (students become aware of who they are and how they choose to act); the use of projection exercises (these exercises allow students to see themselves as objects); active listening (students learn the skills of listening to each other); and the use of art, music, dramatics, and poetry as means of expression. Eight units contain sample Gestalt strategies for language teaching: (1) introductory lessons for the first  months; (2) verbs in the present tense; (3) adjectives; (4) pronouns; (5) adverbs; (6) verb tenses; (7) reflexive verbs; imperative mood; (8) comparative and superlative. These strategies aim at providing energizing learning environments for self-discovery and positive growth. (CFM)",

        "description":"On the minds of all who serve higher education in administrative capacities is the acceleration in demands to be accountable to the federal government--that is, to give assurances that resources are being used prudently and effectively. This occurs primarily in two areas: in the increase in federal financial involvement in higher education, and in the increasing demands on higher education to respond to social changes. In the first case, institutions have generally cooperated well with the federal government. In the second case, costs of implementing federally mandated programs have increased at a high rate, disproportionate to other costs and revenues; institutions are now so dependent on federal funds that they may feel they do not have the option of rejecting new programs. It  is necessary for institutions to strike a balance between (1) the desirability of autonomy and (2) the reality of accountability to constituencies (state and federal governments, accrediting associations) as well as within the institution. Some authorities argue that simplified, annotated financial statements may be helpful, especially by bringing fiscal awareness to all sectors of the academic community. (Author/MSE)",

Trends toward getting a college education without going to college are discussed, with reference to the evaluation design of the input-environment-output model. College effects of college impact or environmental influences are defined as what is left after input differences have been accounted for. This model is criticized for suggesting that four years in college has no significant impact on a student. Suggestions are offered that depart from the common, experimental, cause-and-effect research model. A contextual model is proposed for evaluating student development in college. The basic features are  suggested by the words: experience and events, environment, and effort, leading to development and &quot;impress.&quot; (LBH)",

Questionnaires were sent to 39 major public universities believed to assess students in either of these ways. The national office of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, which annually collects data on student charges, provided from its 1974-75 survey information used to select the institutions to be included in this University of Missouri Survey. Responses from 33 institutions are reported, and statistical tables are provided. Eight universities assess undergraduate charges on a per-credit basis and two additional universities assess graduate student charges on a  pre-credit basis, while charging undergraduates by a traditional flat-rate scheme. Overall, 22 of the 33 sample universities (or over 25 percent of the survey population) charge graduate students at a higher rate than undergraduates. Four of these 22 make an additional differentiation between lower division (freshman-sophomore) and upper division students. Six additional universities assess graduate student charges at lower rates than undergraduate student charges. Evaluative comments from the universities are included. (LBH)",

This report interprets certain progress made by the colleges primarily within the last three years. It also presents certain findings regarding student enrollment, collections, staffing patterns, facilities, financial support, interinstitutional cooperation, services to students, and selected general information. Statistical tables relating to these areas are included. It is concluded that although progress is apparent, tremendous work is needed for these institutions to gain parity with comparable institutions. The solution resides in increased funding from four  sources: the state legislature, federal government, alumni association, and private foundations or other philanthropic organizations. One of the pressing problems of the traditionally public black colleges continues to be the elimination of deficiencies caused by the historic inequities of financial and professional support.

The basic concerns addressed in the study are: What major federal assistance programs affect postsecondary education? How should federal program assistance to states be measured? How much do WICHE states receive? and Where can additional information be obtained? The major federal programs examined are the Basic Opportunity Grants; the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants; College Work Study; National Direct Student Loans; Guaranteed Student Loans; Institutional Development; Social Security Student Benefits; Veteran's Education Benefits; and Federal Research and Development. New gains and losses of  federal funds for the entire WICHE region and for each state within the region by program are shown in a series of charts. Various methods of determining a measure for federal program assistance to analyze the impact of programs are given. The method used in this study is to identify reasonable measures of program intent, to develop hypothetical distributions of federal funds using these program intent measures, and finally to compare these hypothetical distributions with actual federal disbursal statistics.

        "description":"The Ohio legislature adopted a Bill calling for an evaluation of the performance of academic programs of state-assisted institutions of higher education. The selection of criteria utilized in evaluation is critical. A list of criterion statements was compiled from materials on hand, from accrediting agency information, and out of the experiences and inquiries of the committee. This study attempts to develop criteria other than the two standard types: &quot;cost-benefit&quot; and &quot;enrollment-driven.&quot; The model developed requires the identification of program objectives and relating those objectives to the expectations of the public to be served. A list of 33 criteria statements was developed by the committee and distributed to all department chairmen at the University of Toledo and to 1,116  students receiving degrees in June 1975. The responses were scaled and factor analysis used to determine the relationships among variables. The nine factors identified are: program size, understanding the program, description and objectives, academic standards, cost efficiency, innovative programs, employability, supportive nature of the program, public relations, and nonteaching work of the faculty. Comparison is made between department chairmen and students on these factors; of the scores for each factor for the department chairmen and students by college; and of scores for each factor for graduates and department chairmen by level of program.

Public criticism usually centers on the possible increased costs of education generated by union demands, while the college management complains that union grievance and other procedures are time consuming; union demands ignore financial budgets; and union insistence on seniority over merit in hiring and promotion discourages managerial decisions by the administration. Nonunion members argue that unions are unprofessional organizations and could ruin the quality of education. Union members criticize the slowness of change within the union structure and the need for uniformity at the expense of the individual. The  nature of the union leadership and the political structure of the union are controversial subjects causing intensive debate over the question of whether the faculty union is democratic or oligarchical in nature. Finally, the varying influence of union goals and faculty norms on the unions is discussed. (JMF)",

The government has had to depend on voluntary accrediting organizations as evaluators of educational quality. These organizations assess educational quality and encourage its improvement. Educational auditing and accountability is one approach toward improving accrediting organizations criteria and procedures and their responsiveness to the needs of users of accreditation. The concept is modeled on the auditing system developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for &quot;accrediting&quot; business. The auditing plan follows the same basic steps as current accrediting procedures with limited expansion of the research staffs of the  regional accrediting commissions and the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation. The basic steps in the accrediting process would include (1) the institution carrying on a self-study and preparing two formal reports, including the educational statements of the institution and a report for publication; (2) the regional commission appointing a visiting committee whose members each have specific responsibilities; (3) the team of educational auditors, specialized committee members, and the chairperson conducting an on-site investigation to verify the assertions in the educational and financial statements; (4) a report and evaluation submitted by the committee to the regional commission; (5) recommendations to the institution; and (6) regular annual self-study analysis reported back to the  commission.

The function has traditionally been performed by private agencies with the purpose of establishing common standards among colleges and universities. The function has recently expanded to include a concern for the welfare of society, and this has increased the necessity that the agencies that do the accreditation maintain their autonomy from the government and private interests. The justification and historical background for nongovernmental accrediting agencies is presented. Recent events have encouraged outside participation in accreditation, including unionization of professionals; the recognition of postsecondary education as a central issue in the political arena; the phenomena of\"groupthink,\" in which members are much less sensitive to the public interest; and the realization of the inevitable conflicts of goals among educational institutions of different types and among various professions. Some alternatives confronting accreditation are presented, including increased governmental involvement and restructuring of accrediting agencies. The latter alternative is favored generally and the advantages and disadvantages of outside participation on accrediting committees is outlined as are some of the problems to be resolved in appointments of public members: resistance, definition, source, and quality.

In an attempt to understand the dynamics of withdrawal, the Faculty Council on Academic Standards arranged a survey of students dropping classes in the spring quarter of 1973. It was found that, typically, students were motivated to withdraw by too heavy a course load, which, however, was not acted on until the last two weeks of the quarter. Juniors withdrew more often than other groups. Although, in general, students remained in class long after they were aware of a problem, less than half took any steps to solve it before dropping a course. Numerous graphs illustrate withdrawal trends according to week of withdrawal, class standing, reason for  course selection, reason given for withdrawal, and lag between problem onset and withdrawal time.

A variety of new degrees are described, including the extension degree offered to part-time students taking off-campus courses; the adult degree, which may depart from traditional degrees in admission, instruction, and evaluation, and is based on the idea that adult students are different from college youth; and the assessment degree, which emphasizes demonstration of competency. Examples of new degree programs are given. The increasing trend toward granting credit for experience is documented. Assessment and creditation has been done by the Cooperative  Assessment of Experiential Learning (CAEL) and the Commission on Accreditation of Service Experience (CASE). Programs for older people are designed to assist this part of the population to adjust to changing life patterns, to find outlets for skills and interests, and to make use of their desire to serve. Several issues that are unresolved are raised, including Who pays? Should the fee structure differ from the traditional? How should the unit of credit be defined?

Sixty-six universities were surveyed by means of a questionnaire and the results revealed similarities among the four groups of countries regarding the length of service prior to leave (generally 6 years); differences among the four groups, including the use of retraining leaves as a form of sabbatical; salary paid during regular sabbatical leave; and travel expenses. The conclusions  drawn from the data are that Canadian leave plans are not nearly as uniform as those in United States universities; Canadian plans have become more formalized and better documented since 1969; salary paid for full-year leaves in Canadian universities has improved since 1969 and is now substantially better than in the United States, but not as good as in Australia and New Zealand; and participation rates in all countries appear to be higher than those reported prior to 1965 by Ingraham.

To do this, the Board of Regents developed a Model Program Expenditure Budget. This procedure depends upon two fundamental processes: (1) a uniform program classification of instructional offerings by the public institutions of higher education, and (2) an on-going resource analysis by which the actual expenditure experience of each public institution of higher education for instruction in these different programs can be determined and models for future expenditure requirements can be devised. The importance of these model  budgets by program is threefold: (1) They provide a framework within which to establish state subsidy support and a corresponding level of needed student fees. (2) They make possible an equitable distribution of available state appropriation support among all public institutions of higher education. (3) They provide guidelines to public institutions of higher education in their utilization of available financial resources. (LBH)",

        "description":"Student development is seen as a set of variables that can be used by a college to assess its social contribution to the region, state, or community in which it resides. In doing so, it is important to consider student characteristics upon admission. A total of 1,927 student records from three colleges and universities were combined to study college outcomes in the context of admissions variables. College outcomes in the career areas were studied, including curricular major and letter occupation. It was found that students generally implemented their plans at college entrance, suggesting that college helps students achieve their career goals. Income was also examined. College students expect to earn over $6,000 more per year than their parents. A third outcome area studied was  educational behavior. Most college students earn a baccalaureate, and college plans at admission are related to persistence. While student educational plans at admission are potent predictors of what the student will do in college, the college experience itself is seen as reinforcing the importance of education and raising educational aspirations.

Black students at UTK, like the nonblack, are younger and more recent high school graduates than PBC students. The B's also come from a more affluent background than PCB and have less financial worries; the parents of Bs are better educated than those of PCB. The degree aspirations of B and PCB were similar, although more B than PCB aimed at the medical professions and less toward business education. More B than NB or PBC anticipated satisfaction with college. The life objectives of B and PBC were similar.  There was considerably more concern by NB than B or PBC that large families should be discouraged. PBC and, to a lesser degree, B had concern that the government was not encouraging desegregation quickly enough and students from disadvantaged social backgrounds should be given preferential treatment in college admissions.

The study was replicated to test certain anomalies. Via video screen, 50 undergraduate volunteers were delivered stimuli consisting of seven attributes: number, color, form, shading, vertical or horizontal bar, border, and field orientation. Subjects were given five tasks involving the learning of one pair of concepts. Five treatments differed in terms of the sequence of stimuli used to present the training. Results showed that:  (1) when adjacent trials contained the same relevant cue, learning was maximized; and (2) the effects of alternate and constant series are conditional upon the number of stimulus attributes that change from trial to trial.

Since the results of the two methods have proven to be somewhat inconsistent, a study was designed which examined the relationship between the two methods by presenting a list of 20 stimulus words three times in different random orders to 96 college student subjects. Tabulations were kept for the frequency with which associations given on the first trial were repeated in subsequent trials. It was hypothesized that the frequency would increase as the cultural frequency of the association increased. In general, it was found  that cultural frequencies do predict the index of repetition of associates, and hence, they represent individual association hierarchies. (EMH)",

The test analysis program determined scales of test item difficulty and evaluated the discriminatory power of test items. Options provided by the test scoring service include reporting test results by teaching objectives, comparison of results with mastery criteria, and providing group distributions and other descriptive statistics. The programs were developed on a 20K storage computer with an Opscan 17 scanner as  the primary input mechanism. Software was written in Fortran II with a package developed specifically for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 machine.

One proposed bill encouraged affiliation of local libraries with their county library, standardized local governing boards, and mandated services to all county residents regardless of governmental affiliation by all libraries within a county. The State Board for Libraries was given responsibility for setting goals and objectives for local and system libraries. Various state aid provisions were specified, including use of penal fines as a deduction from the balance  between local tax and state aid equalization for libraries. The proposal also mandated a single system where two system libraries exist within a single county, and it restricted state aid and system grants to system activities, and encouraged system libraries to operate in regional affiliations. The second piece of proposed legislation allocated funds for data collection on the planning and funding of public college and university libraries in the state and for the establishment of a centralized access office for Michigan academic libraries.

The focus of the ten projects being pursued by the children's group is on the effect of the broadcast media on children of various ages. The research concerns the perceptual and cognitive abilities of children, as well as the effects of various programing features. The ten information studies aim at investigating the preconditions for transmitting public information via radio and television and identifying the relative role of these media as sources of knowledge. The format and content of programs and the varying characteristics of audiences are of  interest. Eleven audience projects seek to describe the size and composition of audiences and to explain program selection processes. Three adult education studies are being undertaken for the Committee for Radio and Television in Education (TRU), the National Board of Education, and the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA). They aim to identify those who participate in various adult education classes.

Two non-random groups of students with equivalent learning ability in chemistry were established. The total group was also divided according to reading level. Groups alternatively received traditional instruction and programmed instruction for each of five learning modules. Each group was pre-tested at the outset of each instructional module. Post-tests were administered at the conclusion of the modules and average gain scores were tabulated. Scores were also tabulated for the high and low reading  groups. Findings of the study included: (1) no significant differences were found in achievement between the two methods of instruction; (2) approximately 60% of the subjects preferred programmed instruction while the remainder preferred traditional instruction; (3) there were no significant differences in achievement, according to teaching method, of high or low reading level students.

American postsecondary education has a role to play in making this transition less difficult, and in integrating the educational process into the world of work. This sourcebook focuses on the problems associated with transition and suggests some possible facilitating steps that educational institutions, particularly community colleges, might take. The articles presented deal with the issues associated with school-to-work transition: alienation of young people, the need for affective career education, work experiences for youth, cooperative education, placement services and career development, international  examples of school-to-work transition, and factors influencing the growth and decline of higher education.

        "description":"The Mexican-American Studies Curriculum at San Jose City College (California) was analyzed in order to determine appropriate means and purposes for implementing an interdisciplinary multicultural studies program for neighboring Evergreen Valley College. Results indicated that ethnic peoples face cultural conflict and isolation in contemporary North American society and that an environment that creates integrative experiences between the individual and his group is essential to the success of most Mexican-American students. A multicultural studies model comprising four curriculum stages was subsequently developed. Stages of the model focus on (1) skills, (2) core, (3) emphases, and (4) synthesis. A rationale for each stage and evaluation procedures for use with the model were  developed. While the multicultural studies model was initially formulated for use in implementing a Mexican-American Studies program, it should be noted that it is equally applicable to other ethnic or cultural studies. Appended is a statement of Evergreen Valley's philosophy and goals, a description of courses and units appropriate to the suggested model, and an analysis of the district-wide Mexican-American studies curriculum.

Data analyzed were grades issued by LACCD colleges during the fall semesters 1966 through 1975. Official grading policy was determined through review of current and past college catalogs and faculty handbooks. Major findings were: (1) grade point averages (GPA's) had risen over the past 10 years from 2.24 to 2.64; (2) GPA's dipped for the first time in 10 years in the fall of 1975 (2.64) from fall 1974  (2.66); (3) total percentage of A's and B's awarded rose from 40.4% in 1966 to 57.2% in 1975; (4) total percentage of D's and F's declined from 18.8% to 10.6%; (5) only slight differences in distribution of grades was found between LACCD colleges; and (6) considerable diversity between colleges was found regarding grading policies. A number of factors were suggested as being associated with the rise in mean GPA across the LACCD. Recommendations for further study and for a clearer delineation of grading policies were made. Appended are summaries of LACCD policies on withdrawal, repetition of courses, and incomplete course work. (Author/JDS)",

The study design assumed that 51% or more of the tutors were in agreement with a given item on the survey, such would indicate that the policy issue reflective of the item was not worthy of review or consideration for change. It was also assumed that should a chi-square comparison of the responses of two sub-groups, tutor interns and peer tutors, prove to be significantly different in any item, priority would be given to the perceptions of the peer  tutors, who are more experienced. Treatment of the data revealed that policies involving (1) tutorial meetings, (2) tutorial pay scales, (3) group tutoring, and (4) tutor training were deserving of review and possible revision or abandonment. Recommendations concerning the policy development process governing these four aspects were made as well as implications and recommendations for tutorial policies at the regional and national level.

Community college design offers an opportunity for development of an environment that is complementary to the larger environment of which the college is an integral part. Actual practice has not always resulted in such environmental harmony. Yet, several colleges of design excellence can be noted, including Foothill College in California, Allegheny College in Pittsburgh, Miami-Dade College in Florida, Seward County College in Kansas, Pima College in Arizona, and Mount Vernon College in Washington, D. C. It appears that the future of the community college, in terms  of design, will be closely associated with the concepts of flexibility and adaptability.

Data for the study were obtained through the administration of an open-ended questionnaire to 345 students enrolled in day-time credit courses. A total of 1,894 factors were identified by those surveyed. These factors were subsequently collapsed into more general categories and subcategories for purposes of manageable analysis. The three most frequently identified important factors in choosing a good instructor were: (1) teacher is willing to help students; (2) what other students say about the teacher; and (3) teacher explains clearly so students can understand. Least  frequently identified as important factors were: (1) size of class; (2) race of teacher; (3) teacher's rank; (4) geographic background of teacher; and (5) the location of the class. A profile of desirable instructor characteristics was constructed and is appended, as are an extensive bibliography, the survey instrument, and survey data in tabular form. (Author/JDS)",

Staff of 14 North Carolina community colleges and technical institutes were trained for roles as change agents. Developmental or remedial programs for non-traditional students were selected as targets for the development of EDT plans at each institution. Project evaluation included analyses of the EDT plans developed and the attainment of plan objectives, and case studies at seven of the participating institutions to determine how the EDT construct was perceived by college administrators. Results indicated that the team change agent strategy for educational development was viable. However, EDT's  whose membership included those with higher decision-making positions had markedly greater success in achieving their plan objectives than did those with lower positions. Decision-making level rather than collegiate responsibility appeared to be the most important factor in EDT success. On the basis of the findings, a revised EDT model for planned change is recommended. EDT plans submitted by participating institutions are appended. (JDS)",

Study subjects were all students (n= 241) who had ACT test scores on file and who were enrolled at SWVCC. Correlational analyses yielded coefficients of such low magnitude as to conclude that there is no significant relationship between ACT test scores and academic performance at SWVCC. Based on these findings, it was recommended that use of the ACT be discontinued and that a more suitable instrument such as the College Qualifying Test or the Comparative Guidance and Placement Test, both of which have been  developed for and normed on community college students, be used.

        "description":"Schools and educators are being called to task so that students will be able to achieve academically and gain basic skills. While few people argue with the need for gradual, reasonable, and proven changes in curricula, the massive infusion of innovative curricula and teaching methods often intended to maximize affective learning may have had a substantially negative effect in that the cognitive development of students may have been neglected. Such innovations as mastery learning may train students on a specific or limited group of problems but may not enhance the ability of the student to generalize to a larger domain. Over-use of objective testing at the expense of subjective examination may be partially responsible for lack of adequate development of writing skills in students.  Among the things that educators can do to begin to address these and similar problems are: (1) place greater emphasis on subjective testing and development of writing skills; (2) accommodate low achieving students through guided studies; (3) maintain or strengthen academic standards; (4) primarily emphasize basic skills and cognitive development; and (5) mix traditional education with proven innovative concepts. A solution to the crisis in the schools and colleges will not be attained soon. (Author/JDS)",

Twenty-five from each group were male, and five were female; 32 freshmen and 28 sophomores were included in the sample. All subjects were administered the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule under standardized conditions to determine individual personality traits. Results of data analysis indicated: (1) the degree of activism or extent of involvement in the Black movement among Black junior college students was associated with personality characteristics; (2) Black student activists were psychologically healthier than non-activists; (3) the personality structure of the study groups differed along  identifiable personality dimensions--activists had more positive self-esteem, were more self-enhancing behaviorally, and were more aware of their motives; (4) the activists appeared to have superior ego-strengths; and (5) the values held by activists were independently chosen. The data suggested that there was no psychopathology involved in the Black movement, merely personality differences. Because of the sample size, however, the results should not be generalized to the entire Black protest movement. Data are presented in tabular form and a bibliography is appended. (Author/JDS)",

As each pair of objects was presented, children were asked to select the object that was \"big,\"\"little,\"\"fat,\"\"thin,\"\"tall,\"\"short.\" They were also asked to pick one of two index cards with \"more\" or \"less\" buttons painted on it and to choose one of a pair of identical objects \"before\" or \"after\" a transformation had been performed on it (such as a pair of sneakers, one of which had been tied). The overall performance of the younger and older children was not very different. They were fairly successful with all concepts except \"thin,\"\"less,\" and \"before.\" In follow-up questions with the choice object it came out that the children appear to make more choices in terms of big or little.

Five teachers, all of whom had contact with the students in the sample, were asked to place these students in categories labeled accepting, concerned, indifferent, and rejecting. Measures of interpersonal proximity and teacher-pupil size ratios were obtained for the drawings. Student attitudinal data were analyzed  with analysis of variance. A procedure suggested by Hoyt was employed to analyze the reliability of the teacher ratings. Results are listed for all analyses run. Results tend to support the hypotheses that: (1) children with high DYS scores would position themselves closer to the teacher in situational drawings, and (2) as the ratio of teacher height to pupil height approached 1.00, the pupil nomination into a teacher perception group would approach the accepted category and the pupil's DYS score would increase. The significance of the method is discussed. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the ethical and practical issues involved in the development and implementation of a preschool screening battery. A screening program is described and the resulting data presented in an attempt to illustrate the investment in time, money, and energy required. The ethical questions that arise because of the lack of cross-validation studies are discussed. It is suggested that the effectiveness of screening batteries has not been compared with other approaches which might be more economical and equally effective. In particular, the use of parent questionnaires offers possibilities because they provide the practitioner with more information than the simple referral of a child who has been identified by an informed parent, nursery school director, or primary grade  teacher. The ability to generalize from any research data to the specific population to be considered for screening is open to question and validation of any screening technique is still needed to ensure that the effectiveness reported in the normative studies applies to the population being studied.

A pluralist view is advocated. It is suggested that a psychology of childhood must be: (1) a developmental psychology; (2) a psychology concerned with adaptation which contains an evolutionary perspective and an ecological point of view; (3) a cross-cultural psychology; (4) a psychology of social systems as well as of socializing individuals; and (5) a psychology with a historical point of  view. A brief review of research in these various areas is included. (Author/MS)",

Conducted from August 1975 through July 1976 at the Lenox Elementary School, the program focused primarily on training the parent to regularly provide informal learning experiences in the home for children from 2.9 to 3.9 years old who were eligible for prekindergarten classes the following September. The follow objectives of the program were established: (1) project children will achieve better in school, (2) the home environment will be reinforcing to the school environment, (3) teachers will work cooperatively with parents in pinpointing and meeting children's needs,  (4)tutors will serve as models for parents as teachers and introduce preschool children to activities for increasing readiness skills, (5) parent-teacher aides will provide valuable assistance in the Child-Parent Center and serve as liaison between staff and community, and (6) the project director will assist parents in modifying their expectations so that school and home goals are more harmonious. Evaluation methods and procedures are described and teacher questionnaire and parent survey response findings are reported. Conclusions and recommendations are discussed.

Seven propositions about the needs of children are advanced: (1) The young child has to have a deep sense of safety; (2) every child has to have adequate--not excessive--self esteem; (3) every child has to feel or experience his/her life as worth living, reasonably satisfying, interesting and authentic; (4) young children need adults or older children who help them make sense of their own experiences; (5) young children have to have adults who accept the authority that is theirs by virtue of their greater experience, knowledge and wisdom; (6) young children need optimum  association with adults and older children who exemplify the personal qualities we want them to acquire; (7) children need relationships or experiences with adults who are willing to take a stand on what is worth doing, having, knowing and caring about.

This was interpreted as indicating that about half of the variation among people in a broad spectrum of psychological traits is due to differences among the people in genetic characteristics. The data also suggest that the environmental influences on ability affect twins reared together in the same way, while the environmental influences on personality and interests affect twins in the same family differently. The implications of these findings for psychological theory, for the nature-nurture controversy, for the explanation of the recent national decline in  aptitude test scores, and for future human evolution are discussed.

The five-part strategy has been implemented through: (1) a proposal phase, for three comprehensive-program centers for low-income families and (2) a four-year model-development, implementation and evaluation phase, and is now in (3) a replication phase for programs in new sites. Remaining phases will provide for (4) external evaluation of programs and (5) overall assessment of results, prior to wider dissemination. The three original PCDCs are described. Birmingham and New Orleans programs, described briefly, are center-based, with children from 2-3 months to three years of age. The Houston PCDC is  described in detail. Involving urban Mexican-American families, the two-year program begins at the age of one year with home-based mother and family involvement. The second year, for two-year-olds, is center-based, with a bilingual staff. Common elements are seen in evaluations of all three centers. (Approximately 80 to 100 experimental subjects and comparable numbers of controls are involved for each center.) At the end of a program, significant intellectual differences were found, with program children ahead of controls in general intelligence, language development and conceptual usage. Significant evaluation results have been obtained with mothers, their behavior meeting desired goals in all three centers. Houston program mothers, compared with controls, showed more positive behavior  and obtained higher scores related to the home as a learning environment. (BF)",

        "description":"This study investigated the relationship between dialect usage and performance on four language tasks designed to reflect features developmental in nature: articulation, grammatical closure, auditory discrimination, and sentence comprehension. Predictor and criterion language tasks were administered to 90 kindergarten, first-, and second-grade children randomly selected from a Northcentral Florida elementary school with a racial group ratio of 40 percent black and 60 percent white. All children were from rural families of low and lower-middle socioeconomic status backgrounds. When the variance attributed to cognitive development and language facility scores was systematically covaried, results indicated that dialect usage was significantly related to receptive performance but not  significantly related to expressive performance. This finding bears two interpretations: (1) the basilect speaking child is deficient in comprehending developmental language forms; and (2) he is in addition demonstrating a basic deficiency in comprehending standard dialect. The later interpretation would contend that the kindergarten through second grade basilect-speaking children examined in this study have not as yet acquired the skill of bi-dialectic comprehension, i.e., the ability to translate standard English into their own dialect for processing. The question of dialect interference, then, appears to be a locallizing phenomenon. The amount of basilect used seemingly interferes with some specific language skills, and not with others.

Twenty American early childhood education specialists participated in the tour, which included visits to five cities and to rural areas. The possibility that any or all of the schools visited may be showcase institutions is discussed. The most noticeable feature of schooling in China was the emphasis on moral education or the direct teaching of explicit values. Also of interest to the observers: the formal pedagogical style (children in art class, for example, all copy the same picture) and the emphasis on physical education. The children appeared happy and alert,  paying close attention to all that went on. There was little sign of the restiveness many have come to expect in a formal school setting. (MS)",

The research strategy involved two phases: (1) identifying the national trend in all Head Start programs that had converted from part day operation to full day operation in 1969, 1970 and 1971, (2) selecting a representative sample of programs that had made the conversion. In the entire sample, only 19 had converted to day care, 10 of which were selected for intensive study.

The Project combines psychoanalytic and anthropological insights and techniques to study child development and the psychodynamics of varying family systems in so-called &quot;normal families&quot; during the first five years of life of the newborn. Another aim of the Project is to refine an intervention model for monitoring the psychodynamic and cognitive progress of children during this span. The structure for this longitudinal involvement is a group consisting of 12 families (with heterogeneous  socioeconomic, ethnic and family structures) and members of a multidisciplinary team which forms before the birth or adoption of an infant and continues to meet weekly until the child enters kindergarten. The Project target is the infant, and the long-term goal is facilitating each child's mastery of the major phases inherent in the first five years of life in order to prevent or ameliorate developmental impediments to proper ego functioning. Several case studies are presented. (Author/MS)",

The current position that environment and heredity contribute interactively to intelligence obscures the greater vulnerability and exposure of males to environmental influences and the reciprocal lack of equivalent environmental stimulation which leads by default to a larger genetic component of intelligence for females. Several hypotheses related to the sex-differentiated interaction of environmental and hereditary determinants of intelligence are discussed. (Author/MS)",

At the end of the tasks session, and one month later, the children were asked to recall stimulus materials based on two Piagetian tasks and on the questions task. Analyses of variance yielded significant F's for all main effects and no significant interaction terms. Implications for instructional intervention are made. One instructional implication of this study is the need to match teachers' questions to children's questions to facilitate  their recall of meaningful material. (Author/MS)",

Once the route and landmarks along the route were learned, children were tested on their ability to (1) travel the route in reverse (route reversal knowledge), (2) name the sequence of landmarks along the reverse route (landmark reversal knowledge), (3) infer the relationship between parts of the environment not directly traveled between (inference), and (4) construct a model of the environment. Results indicated that route-knowledge develops before landmark reversal knowledge, and inference ability develops last; also supported was the  suggestion that young children's spatial representations are route-like and poorly integrated in comparison with those of older children. In their models, children often exaggerated the route they travelled. No sex differences were found on any of the measures. (Author/MS)",

Two questionnaires were administered to 72 Indian students enrolled in 4-year colleges and universities during the spring of 1957. Data analysis centered on the comparison of the problems of two pair of groups: Indian vs non-Indians and &quot;Indian-like&quot; Indians vs &quot;non-Indian-like&quot; Indians. In the first set of comparisons, certain data from this study were compared with results of similar studies of college students in general in a Wisconsin State Teachers College and the University of Illinois. The second set of comparisons was based on a division of the Indian students into two groups on the basis of ability or lack of ability to speak an Indian  language. The two sets of comparisons yielded essentially the same results. The one general and overriding finding was that Indian students have more problems that are troublesome and serious than do non-Indian students. Among the special problems of the Indian student were: poor academic training for college, especially in the areas of mathematics and science, but also in social studies and English; insufficient monetary funds, especially for clothing and &quot;spending money&quot;; inability to relate himself to the future, particularly as this involved his educational and vocational objectives; and concern about moral and religious questions and about family members.

Its goals are to: (1) develop health manpower training programs appropriate to support the development of the American Indian Medical School and to meet the needs of the American Indians in staffing their health care systems; and (2) foster, guide and assist in the planning, development, cooperation and evaluation of a health service system for the Navajo people which will be exemplary and a model for the American Indian community. During the past year, NHA secured a land site at Shiprock, New Mexico, for the American Indian School of Medicine; organized a Governmental Liaison Committee, with representation from all the major,  health-related departments of the Federal government; initiated a Family Practice Health Center and Residency Training Program at Shiprock; and prepared the draft legislation for the establishment and funding of the American Indian School of Medicine. This annual report presents data on NHA's progress. Topics covered are: legislative and community liaisons, the Joint Interagency Liaison Committee, the Medical School Planning Committee, administration and support services, Office of Student Affairs, Native Healing Sciences, preventive medicine, family and community medicine, health education, nursing office, emergency medical services, and health statistics and research.

        "description":"Since the birth of school integration efforts in America, the mixing of children of different races and ethnicities has gone through segregation, desegregation, and resegregation. Just as the popular misbelief was that Black Americans were segregated in the South where they numerically concentrated and rarely in the North, so too the stereotypic view is that Mexican Americans are segregated in the Southwest only. The fact is that Chicanos are still habitually separated in the Northwest, Midwest, and Great Plains states. But the school segregation of the Spanish speaking population goes beyond Chicanos; it extends in numerical and geographical scope with the addition of Puerto Ricans in the Northeast, Cubans in the Southeast, and Latin Americans pocketed throughout the country.  Because of the national magnitude and major impact segregation has on this population and the proportional void of recorded literature on desegregation affecting Latinos in the United States, this paper identifies resegregation processes occurring in multi-ethnic/multicultural settings in the United States where Spanish speaking students are concentrated. Topics discussed are: (1) incidence of ethnic intraschool isolation, (2) minority student discipline, (3) Spanish-surname teacher/administrator distribution, (4) selection and promotion as they impact on school and classroom environment, and (5) possible intervention strategies of a general nature.

        "description":"Notably isolated from the large metropolitan centers by geography and predominantly agricultural in its economy, Kern County is California's third largest county in land area. About one-third of the county is situated on the flat valley floor at the extreme southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. The area relies heavily on Chicano and Black manual labor. The educational background and mean annual income is low. On a county level, the median income in the county is $11,925 and the median school years completed is 12.1. The disparity in educational attainment, type of employment, and income level for ethnic minorities is evident, and to the ethnic minorities, it is a continuing source of aggravation. This is a major problem because the minorities see it as a part of an unwritten  plan that does not allow any possibility for their own betterment. To the Chicanos and Blacks in the area, employment is related to education which in turn is related to income. The issue of school segregation in this rich agricultural land has recently reached a new level of concern. This paper reviews the status of desegregation/integration in Kern County, identifies the desegregation problem areas in the county, and offers some suggestions for the improvement of this desegregation/integration problem area.

        "description":"Based on an in-depth study of 125 mothers of young infants in both urban and rural areas of Wisconsin, this study analyzed the utilization of preventive medical services for the infant. The hypothesis that &quot;mothers who are more socially integrated will be more likely to use preventive medical services than those who are less integrated, controlling for socioeconomic status&quot; was tested. Ninety-one urban and 34 rural mothers were interviewed when their babies were approximately 3-months old. Data were obtained on the mother's state of health, attitudes and feelings toward her life, use of the system for both well and sick care for herself and her infant, happiness, social activities, who she called on for help with the baby, and contacts with friends and relatives. Items were  basically of three types: baby's preventive medical services--baby physical checkup since leaving the hospital (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio shots received); social integration item--family and secondary ties; and background characteristics--residence, mother's education, family income, poverty level of family, whether the mother had private health insurance, medicaid, or no health insurance. Findings included: the hypothesis was not confirmed; rural-urban differences emerged which seemed to be related to availability and accessibility of services; and mother's education was the only factor which helped explain utilization patterns.

        "description":"In considering whether subcultural values were associated with violence, it was critical to determine both the precise content of such values and the way in which the subculture interacts with structural forces to affect the level of violence. Based on interview and observational materials, this qualitative study examined the role of &quot;machismo&quot; and the incidence of gang violence in the Chicano &quot;barrios&quot; of East Los Angeles, under two structural circumstances--the more common state of disenfranchisement and the conditions of the late 1960s and early 1970s in which a strong locally based political movement existed. More than 25 open-ended interviews were conducted with Chicano males, aged 15-30, who lived in one of the East Los Angeles barrios and who currently participated or had  participated extensively in gang activity. For all the Chicanos interviewed, &quot;machismo&quot; meant &quot;having courage&quot;, &quot;not backing down&quot;, or &quot;being ready to fight&quot;. However, violence in itself was not directly a &quot;macho&quot; trait. Estrangement fostered a strong identity with the peer group in the barrio, because the peer group was the most readily available source of identity. This resulted in a strong sense of turf, which in turn greatly increased the potential for conflict and thus for violence. The change in group identity and in the incidence of violence occurred in the period from late 1967 to early 1972, when a strong locally based political movement succeeded in greatly reducing the level of estrangement.

Using the same rating sheet, this survey determined the Council members' present attitudes. An influence questionnaire was also designed to investigate the influence of people, places and events on the 1975 attitudes. A rating sheet and an influence questionnaire were mailed to 100 of the 107 members; 71 were returned. The raw data of the rating sheet was submitted to two factor analytic programs. Twenty-five significant factors which were statistically insignificant were identified. Since the 1968 population had only three factors, it was concluded that there seemed to have been an influence exerted upon the  population causing the attitudes to change significantly enough so as to negate the validity of the rating sheet. Kendall's coefficient of concordance was used on the raw data from the influence questionnaire. It was found that the respondents did not significantly agree on influences upon their attitudes. Based on sex, faculty status and council membership, the respondents were divided into three sets of mutually exclusive subgroups. None of the six coefficients were statistically significant indicating that the influences upon the attitudes were very diversified. Results of both instruments supported each other. From the data, it was not possible to distinguish what the population discerned as the meaning of &quot;outdoor education&quot;. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Four kinds of U.S. anti-poverty programs were analyzed in terms of their impact upon the rural poor. Examination of 13 rural Community Development Corporations (CDC) in terms of prior and present poverty of non-manager employees indicated the effect of these programs was one of merely changing the source of income rather than the stratification system, since the unemployed simply became employed in low skill, low wage jobs. A 1971 evaluation of five rural Concentrated Employment Programs indicated such programs could be characterized as manpower training for low wage work, since local institutions impeded the influx of competing industries and migration became necessary for workers to obtain adequate wage jobs utilizing their new skills. Critics have suggested that Nixon's  proposed Family Assistance Plan failed because the Southern politicians recognized the fact that it was a program designed to affect the majority of the rural poor, particularly the rural black, and would, therefore, threaten the Southern status quo. Examination of rural cooperatives indicated that local business and political leaders generally opposed such efforts in order to maintain the status quo and that these same people also influenced funding. It was concluded that rural economic development programs must somehow circumvent the influence of those high on the stratification ladder. (JC)",

Using the Leadership Opinion Questionnaire (LOQ), the subjects were tested on the first day of the course and again five weeks later at its conclusion. To establish a baseline criterion with which comparisons could be made, the leadership instrument was also administered to the NOLS Director, General Manager, and Assistant General Manager, and a NOLS Staff Model was established which provided a leadership norm of high in consideration and average in structure. Subjects were classified  by course, type of expedition (wilderness, mountaineering, or biology), age group, education level, previous camp experience, and age. Data were analyzed according to these characteristics by applying a t-test for paired samples, using pre- and post-course scores. Results indicated there was: no positive change in the students' attitudes toward leadership behavior; a decrease in consideration scores among those who had graduated from college, had had previous camp experiences, and had participated in the Wilderness Expedition. It was suggested that the results might have been different had the subjects been tested at a later date. (JC)",

Using the 1970 criteria for progressiveness (most progressive, upper middle, lower middle, and least progressive), the socioeconomic status of Tetu farmers was examined for 1973 in terms of: total and agricultural income; average number of laborers in different types of employment; percent owning selected household items; percent giving at least one child primary or secondary education; mean number of extension contacts; and frequency of visits to a Farmer Training Center. Indicators used to examine inequities were:  diffusion of innovations; quality of innovations; scale at which farmers innovated; farm size; and sources of information. Results indicated: considerable disparity between the socioeconomic status of the progressive and the less progressive farmer; rapid diffusion of hybrid maize and grade cattle; no discernible deterioration in the quality of innovation or the scale of operations as the less progressive farmers adopted; greatest increases in farm size among the smallest farmers; and no discernible monopolization of information sources by the more progressive.

        "description":"Employing 6 eligibility criteria (a family unit, income less than 1.5 times the official poverty level, rural residence, and head of family physically able to work and between 18 and 49 years having completed sixth grade), an assessment was made of the size and characteristics of the potential client population for family-based, residential career education programs similar to the Mountain-Plains Career Education Program at Glasgow Air Force Base in Montana. Eligible families were then compared with national family averages in terms of ethnic composition, education level, family status, housing, employment, and income. Some major findings were: 2.3 million families were eligible; public assistance accounted for only 2% of the eligible family's total income; the eligible heads of  families were fairly similar to those of the nation in ethnicity, though 5% more of the eligibles were black; less than 13% of the eligibles had completed any education beyond high school as compared to 24% in the nation; over 1 eligible family in 5 was headed by a female, and eligible families were larger than the national average by 1 person; over 38% of the eligible families paid more than 33% of their total income in rent; eligible families had nearly 2 persons more per dwelling than the national average; the national average family income was $11,000 as compared to $3,100 for eligibles; 13% of the eligibles were not in the labor force vs 18% of all family heads.

        "description":"The problems associated with small villages are among the most difficult in Dutch physical planning, for they encompass the support of minimum social services in small towns and villages; the preservation of areas of ecological and scenic value; the acommodation of a growing population desirous of a home in the country or continued country living; and accommodation of radical changes in the social structure of small towns and villages caused by migration. Within the Netherlands there are currently three major phenomena which must be addressed independently and, preferably, on a regional basis. These phenomena include: the withering village (due, principally, to the decrease of working populations in agriculture and a general decline in the Dutch birth rate); the suburbanizing  village (increasing populations due to proximity to urban centers and the desire of urban dwellers to live outside the urban center); urban migration to withering villages (due to increasing nostalgia for the country and nature). Planning for these phenomena must be handled differently, for the withering village needs sustaining facilities and organizations, while the suburbanizing town needs provisions which facilitate the expectations of the in-coming urbanites and those of the established rural population, and migration to withering villages must be viewed as a manifestation of social change.

        "author":["Arciniega, Tomas A."],
        "description":"One of the principal obstacles to equalizing educational opportunities in the public schools has been the difficulty in achieving consensus among educational leaders on what is meant by \"equal educational opportunity\". This shortcoming is critical because how one defines equality determines and shapes the approaches used to attack the problems perceived in the system. The few actual changes and reforms that have been brought about in the education of minorities have resulted from court imposed mandates. Education has failed to respond more effectively to the needs of minorities because of its insistence on continuing old value assumptions about the nature of minority cultures, a basic unwillingness to institute major changes, and the flat refusal of schools and universities to  collaborate and involve in a meaningful way the ethnic communities. Teacher educators need to begin facing the reality that the focus of current reform efforts has to be the schools and universities. This monograph focuses on the implications of this imperative for teacher preparation programs which purport to serve the needs of Mexican Americans. The monograph addresses: (1) the problems and issues in equalizing educational opportunities in this country; (2) the state of the art in preparing teachers of Mexican Americans; and (3) the need for change and an alternative model.

A major conclusion of the conference was that new marine education opportunities would have to be developed as existing activities are insufficient in scope to serve the whole state nor can they be expanded to serve the entire state. The report includes sections on a rationale for a curriculum, basic considerations in curriculum design, social sciences in marine affairs, the humanities and marine affairs, the teacher and marine affairs, constraints and problems, and a check  list for possible action.

Part I defines the major components of Asian population growth as the rapid decline in mortality after 1945, relative increases in the population of less developed regions, accelerated fertility potential, and unequal distribution of wealth. Education is characterized by unequal opportunity and a high dropout rate in primary grades. Part II views rapid population growth as an obstacle to progress and discusses the shortage of capital, the employment dilemma, rising costs of services, social development, and the difficulties of setting educational priorities. Case studies are presented which focus on educational expansion and equality in Japan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Thailand,  and Singapore. Part III focuses on rural-urban migration and highlights the problems of this migration with case studies of India, Japan, and Indonesia. Part IV discusses the need for educational innovation and suggests that planners redefine educational objectives more democratically. This section discusses international cooperation in education, radical policies for rural areas, local input into the educational system, and the importance of family planning.

        "description":"A study was conducted to ascertain which dimensions of children's classroom behavior are seen to be important by teachers and how accurate teachers' perceptions are of children's behavior in terms of such dimensions. Teachers in six suburban fourth-grade classrooms rated classroom behavior of each of their students (105 boys and 78 girls) using 5-point scales to rate 30 items. Five factors were identified which can be categorized as relating to either \"task\" or \"social-emotional\" aspects of behavior. The factors are (1) autonomous intellectual orientation; (2) democratic, cooperative behavior; (3) perseverant achievement behavior; (4) involvement in class activities; and (5) undisciplined activities. Girls were found to be more cooperative, better behaved, and harder working than  boys, a finding corroborated by other studies on sex differences among elementary school children. Negative and positive correlations between teachers' rating factors and other indices of children's orientations, values, and achievement-related indices provide evidence that teachers' perceptions of their students form clear and coherent dimensions which, when compared with other measures of similar orientations or behaviors, appear to be quite accurate.

The approach used cluster analysis to identify student and classroom &quot;types&quot; whose interactions were then examined in an analysis of variance framework. About 1,300 fourth graders from 50 classrooms were involved in the study which incorporated classroom observations, teacher comments, student questionnaires, and achievement tests. Cluster analysis resulted in the identification of six classroom types ranging from permissive, warm, individualized atmospheres to highly controlled, cold, nonindividualized atmospheres. Three student types were low achievers lacking self-direction and confidence, highly motivated self-confident achievers, and strongly  autonomous self-directed moderate achievers. A summary of major trends shows that low achieving boys did best in warm classes with moderate control, highly motivated boys did best in controlled classes which allow for student initiative, and autonomous boys did best in permissive classes which allow for student initiative. Low achieving girls did best in warm and individualized classes; high achieving girls did best in classes combining warmth, control, and orderliness; and autonomous girls did best in warm classes emphasizing student expressiveness. Major sex differences are enumerated, also. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"A study team was commissioned to critically review three independent reports on youth and schooling: \"Youth: Transition to Adulthood\"; \"The Education of Adolescents\"; and \"The Reform of Secondary Education.\" The study team examined the reports in light of the most recent available social science evidence. The three reports, presenting similar analyses of the status of American youth and the institutions serving them at the end of the 1960s, proposed a direction for reform: (1) dispersion of youth from schools to work place and community; (2) individualization and diversification of high school programs; (3) curricular reforms; and (4) new methods of school governance. This report is arranged into five major sections. The first three sections contain parallel and detailed analyses  of the reports. Section I reviews the reports. Section II deals with some constraints of the adolescent life stage depicted by the reports, such as age segregation, prolongation of adolescence, and peer group development. Section III focuses on school youth's encounters with the labor market and Section IV covers findings and proposals that concern the organization and performance of high schools. Each chapter also spells out major considerations that the reports slight or omit. Section V attempts to define policy steps that seem feasible and sensible based on the review and events that have occurred since the three reports were written. The study team suggests that some findings of the three reports were overdrawn, the findings rest on a weak research base, and some proposed reforms may  be less necessary or feasible than stated or would have effects other than those intended.

A branching style program in which written responses were required was compared with a program in which the same material was presented in straight narrative style. The project compiled and analyzed test results from 115 fifth-grade students. The students were divided into two groups, one of which was assigned a programmed text on evolution; the other was assigned a parallel narrative version. Results from a posttest and retention test indicated the programmed text to be significantly superior to the nonprogrammed text in teaching elementary school students about evolution. The results of a questionnaire on attitudes of the children toward presentation of the material on evolution indicated that they  viewed both texts favorably, with slightly greater preference for the programmed text. The author concludes that the overall favorable attitude of the students to both texts could possibly be attributed to a novel approach. Tables and references on works relating to programmed instruction, audiovisual communication, and learning processes are included. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The Anthropology Curriculum Project (ACP) of the University of Georgia for the period 1964-65 is evaluated. The report is presented in three sections. Section I discusses the project hypothesis that pupil achievement would not differ according to the level of teacher training in anthropology. The experimental group consisted of 12 first-grade classes (355 pupils) and 13 fourth-grade classes (374 pupils) that were taught by teachers with no special anthropology training. Section II describes test tabulations, corrections, and analyses. Section III presents conclusions and recommendations. The following conclusions are offered: (1) anthropology can successfully be taught in grades 1 and 4; (2) anthropology was not included in elementary social studies; (3) some teacher  characteristics affect student achievement; (4) specially prepared achievement tests are necessary; and (5) student achievement differs between grades. It is recommended that curriculum evaluation be continued with revised test instruments and that curriculum development be continued for inclusion of anthropological subject matter content in the elementary social studies program.

The project sample consisted of 2,183 students in grades 1, 2, 4, and 5. Two forms of the anthropology achievement test were administered as pretest and posttest measures to experimental and control groups of students within each grade. Test results were analyzed to determine differences in anthropology achievement among students by controlling for sex, group identification, and pretest scores. Two conclusions are that students in elementary school can learn the content of the materials presented by the Sequential Anthropology Curriculum Project and that the effect of special training in anthropology for teachers on the achievement of  students remains unknown. Eighteen tables showing means and standard deviations of pretest scores and posttest scores and analysis of variance for posttest scores are presented. (Author/DB)",

The FAMES project was concerned with global mindedness and global education for primary grades. The experimental group was composed of 509 third graders exposed to &quot;Family of Man&quot; for three years, and 233 third graders exposed to other social studies programs comprised the control group. Measurement instruments employed in the study included description of nations, agreement with chauvinistic statements, description of pictures of people, attitude scale, and achievement test. Seven conclusions were drawn in light of the review of literature and the study's rationale: (1) a carefully designed  primary grade social studies program with a strong global education dimension can have a significant impact on children's attitudes toward foreign people; (2) the program can have a significant effect on children's understanding of foreign people; (3) well-defined objectives, specific materials, and sequencing achieve better results than an unstructured or poorly defined program; (4) global education does not need to be postponed until ages 9-10; (5) effective techniques can be developed to measure children's views of foreign people; (6) a carefully designed program can simultaneously develop multiple objectives; and (7) additional research is needed, such as conducting foreign use of the materials and a longitudinal study.

Intended for use by counselors of children ages 5-8, the DUSO program is designed to help children understand social-emotional behavior through listening, inquiry, discussion, and role play. The DUSO Affectivity Device, containing 51 Yes/No items was administered to students in 14 classrooms. Classes were randomly assigned to treatment and nontreatment groups. Results indicated that exposure to DUSO produced desired results among children participating in the program when comparing the experimental and control group means, using the number of children participating as the sample size. The author states, however, that the proper sample size for the study  design used is the number of classes, not the number of students, since the classes, not the students, were randomly assigned. Using this correct data analysis method, it was found that the experimental group was not significantly different from the control group in accomplishing DUSO objectives. (Author/DB)",

In the first evaluation, conducted in Minnesota from 1967-69, taped interviews relating experimental and control group childrens' perceptions of other peoples were compared. Six major differences were noted between the groups, including an increased understanding of children in the experimental group that ways of living are learned. In the second evaluation, students in Bellevue, Washington, were queried about their knowledge of and interest in social studies. Experimental group children generally knew more and were more interested. In the third evaluation, the Speedier project in Pennsylvania, researchers concluded that teachers and students involved in The Family of Man  project were more interested in social studies than ever before. In the Chelmsford, Massachusetts study, scores of fourth grade students using The Family of Man program were significantly higher than the national norm. In the fifth evaluation, test results of 700 first and second grade students in Fairfax County, Virginia, schools indicated that children in the experimental group outperformed control group children in 36 of the 40 test items. In the final evaluation, researchers concluded from data in the November 1973 issue of &quot;Social Education&quot; that The Family of Man had the best possible scores of any primary grade social studies program for which reports were received.

        "description":"This study was designed to determine the effectiveness of 18 selected lessons from Dupont's Toward Affective Development (TAD) program for creating an awareness in students of alternatives to psycho-social situations. Using a sample of 60 subjects randomly selected from 111 sixth-grade students in northwest Wisconsin, two experimental and two control groups were formed. The experimental groups were presented with lessons from the TAD program. A Solomon Four-Group design was used. Pre- and posttesting involved presenting three discussion pictures which depict different psycho-social conflict situations involving dependency and aggression. Individual responses to the pictures were scored. Posttest data showed a positive effect of treatment upon the ability of students participating  in the TAD program to generate alternatives to psycho-social situations. Thus, the hypothesis that the experimental groups would make positive gains over the control groups in developing alternatives to psycho-social situations proved true. Analysis of variance indicated that some of the participants minimized the use of responses already given in the pretest situation. Limitations of the study include the location and characteristics of the community, sample size and description, and the newness of the materials. A review of related literature and research and the implications of the findings are included in the document. (Author/ND)",

The American history unit is designed to promote understanding of price and production of goods and services and of supply and demand. The world history unit focuses on the evolution of economic systems including the New Stone Age, the Middle Ages, and early modern times. The world geography unit  emphasizes problems faced by societies in allocating relatively scarce resources. In the American government unit, students learn how government plays a limited but necessary role in the American free enterprise system. All units contain charts of student objectives, related classroom activities and resources, and bibliographies of state-adopted textbooks and other reading materials. (AV)",

The purpose is to examine the introductory course in light of the need for clearly defined educational goals which will provide systematic guidelines for the selection of appropriate content, methods, and resource aids for teaching. The first paper comments on reasons for the growing dissatisfaction with the introductory course and discusses ways in which the \"eclectic\" approach to teaching may improve economics teaching. In the second paper, six different philosophies of economic education are described. The third paper describes the objectives and goals of a course which has as its primary  goal the development of students' abilities to think critically about economic objectives. A student-centered, real problem-solving approach in economics teaching is presented in the fourth paper. The fifth essay reinforces the importance of having a philosophy and a set of goals for teaching economics. In the last essay, the authors identify the basic core of concepts and relationships that form the structure of economics. (RM)",

Some general concerns emerged from the presentations: (1) change is so rapid and unprecedented that no  one knows what kind of world youth should be prepared for or the form the family will take in the future; (2) during adolescence, tremendous anxiety develops in both parents and children and they do not know how to handle it; (3) there is no right way to parent, but the results of parenting begin appearing in the adolescent; and (4) we must find out more since the family will continue to exist in some form for a long time.

        "description":"The ethics and conduct of social studies teachers are discussed and the values that should guide their classroom behavior are articulated. Two sources of values are integrated to derive the value base for ethical conduct. The first source utilizes the three criteria for education presented by the educational philosopher, R. S. Peters--character and intellectual development, conceptual development, and learner consciousness. The second draws on the democratic ethic and gives paramount emphasis to human dignity and rational processes. Guided by these values, the purpose of schooling for the social studies teacher is to develop educated and ethical citizens who possess the knowledge, values, and skills to be effective participants in a democratic society. A portion of the paper is  devoted to the dilemmas that arise among parents, teachers, and students regarding the purpose of schooling. The role that teachers play in preserving the equilibrium of power between parents, teachers, and students is delineated. Case studies of tense situations are presented, and there are suggestions on actions social studies teachers might take in each situation. A section on knowledge and methods of study emphasizes that teachers have a responsibility to act when values inherent in democratic education are challenged. Teachers need to foster educated and ethical decision-making action while protecting student rights to learn and to privacy. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Student rights and responsibilities vis-a-vis knowledge (methods of study) and purposes of schooling are dealt with. In the area of knowledge, there are two important ethical concerns: students must be able to pursue truth and students have a right to privacy. Turning to the purposes of schooling, it is clear that in social studies education, the rationales seem beyond reproach. Citizenship, awareness of cultural heritage, and economic literacy are only three of many reasons stated relative to the purposes of social studies programs. Yet, because of involvement in the total schooling process and because of the almost mindless acceptance of the contradictions between stated purposes and the classroom, school administration, and societal practices, some ethical problems arise. Some  concerns reflecting this condition include using children to change society, grading students for societal convenience, and training students with utilitarian skills deemed necessary by society's need for workers, parents, and citizens. At the core of this dilemma is the ethical issue of whether or not the school should prepare the student directly for society. Educators and society should consider possible ethical implications of educational developments which stress social needs and utilitarian skills at the expense of student rights. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"This module contains two African folk tales about death, two descriptions of African funerals, a lesson plan with 11 questions exploring the finality of and customs surrounding death, and a bibliography of five books which deal with African religious beliefs. The folk tales present concepts of death and immortality of the soul. The descriptions of funerals document traditional and modern customs surrounding the death of an individual, including cleansing the body, preparing special foods, burial, and recognizing &quot;the living dead.&quot; The questions for discussion are based on the idea that death is feared in every society, although it is known to be inevitable. Some questions encourage children to examine psychological reasons for the African views of death and funeral customs; other  questions involve a comparative study of African and Western attitudes toward death. A film is recommended which shows the funeral of the leader of the Ashanti nation. (AV)",

        "description":"Two modules comprise this document--one on the Aba women's rebellion in Nigeria and one on the Egyptian feminist movement. The paper on the Aba women's rebellion in Nigeria presents a background discussion of the women's movement and colonialism in Nigeria. The larger part of the paper is a lesson plan which investigates the women's rebellion through a question-answer exercise. Questions asked include (1) why did the women revolt? (2) what factors facilitated the Aba rebellion? (3) why did the women attack their own chiefs as well as the British? and (4) is the right to resist unqualified? Two enrichment activities dealing with international civil rights are suggested. Intended for use in teaching students about nationalism in Egypt, the Egyptian feminist paper focuses on a woman  named Hoda Sha'arawi who carried her convictions from the nationalist to the feminist struggle in 1919. The objective of the paper is to enable students to describe the characteristics of colonialism and nationalism and their links to feminism. An historical sketch of the activities of Hoda Sha'arawi is presented and questions and activities are suggested. (Author/DB)",

The first module discusses various life-styles of African women, including warrior, queen, ruler, and matriarch. A lesson plan uses a question-and-answer format to encourage discussion of the effects of tradition, society, and nation upon African women. Questions asked include: what is the traditional role of African women? how is that role changing? how does the market woman differ from the traditional woman and are African women basically different from women in the West? A bibliography and film list are included. The second module presents an oral history exercise of the pilgrimage of a 14th-century Muslim from Mali to Mecca. Students investigate the history of Mali, the characteristics of the Mali ruler,  and the validity of oral history. The third module presents information on a Nigerian naming ceremony, a lesson plan with suggestions on reenacting the ceremony, and a list of Yoruba names and their meanings. The fourth module compares and contrasts problems of urbanization in Lagos, Nigeria, and Miami Beach, Florida. In the lesson plan which accompanies the fourth module, a summary enrichment question asks students to think about which city they would rather live in and why. (Author/DB)",

The musical selections in the booklet focus on the inflectionary character of the Nigerian Yoruba language and the proverbial nature of most African songs, in which speech, melody, rhythm, and dance are interrelated. The multidimensional character of African music is portrayed through singing and dancing exercises, including a Yoruba rendition of &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.&quot; The following questions, with  suggested answers, are offered as a framework for teaching: (1) how does African music compare and contrast with American music? (2) how does music function in traditional African societies? (3) how has African music influenced American music? and (4) how has American music influenced African music?

Directed toward educators and students, the program covers news, features, policy, and people in the field of education and is available for broadcasting to member stations of National Public Radio. Seventeen montages deal with values clarification, morality, moral dilemmas, alienation, secular humanism, and controversial curriculum materials. Discussants include students, teachers, professors, school board members, authors, and directors of national associations including the National Education Association, the Street Law Program, the National Right to Life Movement, and Planned Parenthood. Subjects that are dramatized focus on the right to lie and steal under  extreme conditions, the appropriateness of transmitting moral values through public education, values clarification versus traditional American values, teacher values versus student values, conflict between parental and societal values, teaching sex education in school, and controversial textbooks.

        "description":"Preparing the individual for the future is the ultimate goal of education. However, this goal is increasingly unmet as education becomes fragmented into disciplines which divide learning into a collection of unrelated situations. One solution to this fragmented learning is an interdisciplinary approach which is characterized by a concern for individual growth and the capacity to look at learning as a process. Three skills needed for future competence are creativity, reasoning, and decision making. An example of how creative decision making has been applied in a classroom setting is the nondisciplinary futurology program at Milford Junior High School in Milford, Ohio. Five aspects of creative decision making in this program include the ability of students to (1) recognize the  significance of a given situation; (2) arrive at a variety of alternative approaches to deal with the situation; (3) examine the potential effects of any choice or decision; (4) make a decision based on available information; and (5) accept responsibility for decisions. The attitude of students involved in the program has been highly favorable. Students have often commented that they enjoy the class because it permits them to study subjects in a new and interesting way. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The role of history in a modern social studies program is unclear. The reason for the weakening of history's place in the curriculum is also unclear since educators generally agree that history and literature should be the core subjects in any humanities or cultural studies program. The problems posed by history instruction in a modern educational setting and in making history courses relevant stem both from the nature of the discipline and from the way history is often taught. History can contribute various levels of generalization and understanding to an issues-oriented social studies course. Although history does lend itself to narration, description, and chronology, many prospective social studies teachers find it difficult to relate history to behavioral sciences and to the  present. In spite of numerous problems related to the teaching of history, historians should not despair that their subject will be removed from the junior and senior high school curriculum. Instead, they should look forward to a future in which history will be incorporated into the social studies in an innovative manner. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The report on values education in cross-cultural studies applies the methods of cultural anthropology to values education and provides guidelines for the selection, organization, and application of values education. It is designed for use by teachers and curriculum developers. The major features of five approaches to values education are described. The values clarification approach helps students select values which can serve as satisfactory guides for their lives. The moral development approach is derived from the work of Lawrence Kohlberg who identified and explained six stages of sequential moral reasoning. The values analysis approach teaches students to apply logical thinking and scientific inquiry to the resolution of value problems. The public issues approach helps  students formulate clear and defensible viewpoints for the resolution of public policy disputes. Wilson's moral education approach, developed by British philosopher John Wilson, presents an analysis and rationale for a particular view of moral education. Student discussion topics and information on suggested teacher roles are presented for each approach. These five analytical approaches suggest three general uses to which information on other cultures may be carried out in a way consistent with values education: (1) providing relevant factual information; (2) developing case studies and scenarios; and (3) illustrating the variety of human thought and activity.

        "description":"Micronesia is a multicultural society which must develop an educational system to meet viable cultural options. The society harmoniously blends Spanish, Oriental, German, and American influences in its language, racial structure, religion, and architecture, but not in its educational system. Education has traditionally been tailored to the needs of the political or religious authority in power rather than to an intercultural commitment. Education for self-identity will have to make accommodations with the contradictory contributions of past administering authorities as well as foster respect for indigenous institutions. A present shortcoming of both the formal and nonformal educational systems is the stereotyping of various minority cultures. To combat this problem, Micronesian  schools should stress curriculum which incorporates material on outer islanders, placing particular emphasis on biographies of Micronesians who have achieved stature. On the nonformal level, wider exposure of museum collections, applications for grants for cultural preservation, and emphasis on the relevance of historical Micronesian sites can encourage cultural pluralism. Micronesia has always been a multicultural society, and education must awaken to this fact and contribute to the building of a new social order. (Author/DB)",

The theoretical framework adopted for the study is one in which political learning is seen as evolving through an invariant sequence of developmental stages dependent on physical and intellectual growth. After the theory and method of the study are discussed, the cognitive-developmental approach of Jean Piaget is presented as a valid study of socialization. A civic education questionnaire was administered to 314 white students in grades 3-6 every year from 1973-76. The questions examined children's attitudes toward the president and political authority, plus their feelings about trust and confidence in government and the administrative body.  Political environment is recognized as an important independent variable. Findings show the development of less positive attitudes toward the president, particularly regarding performance capabilities, that decline steadily from grades 3 to 6. It is concluded that negative attitudes toward political authority and institutions develop sequentially and in an accelerated manner; therefore, rapidly changing political events do have an impact on children's attitudes toward the president.

Technological control creates a psychological paradox for man, making him feel helpless and incompetent. The dilemma of helplessness is emphasized because man's main environment is social and/or interpersonal rather than physical. Individual competence in the social environment is established through interpersonal relations with others. Technology offers success to man as a tool maker and controller, but technological control of the physical environment holds several dangers for the individual's relationship to others. The dangers concern personal freedom, dignity, and control. One danger is that man becomes deluded into forgetting chance, points in time, and kinds of events. Another  danger is that technology contributes to man's expectancies of control or power and distorts his perspective of loving or caring from what he is and what he can do as a man. Thus, the risk of technological creativity lies in ignoring or interfering with the need for individual competence in relationships. Examples of current events are provided. (ND)",

Historians of technology need to ask questions about the nontechnological aspects of society which have influenced technical change in the past. In the realm of ideas, historians should check whether the main normative and descriptive assumptions used by innovators were, in fact, dominant ideas in the societies in which they lived. In short, historians need to write a social history of the ideas that encouraged investigations of techniques, made the discovery of new techniques possible, and guided the uses of these techniques. As an example, the story of the relationship between the chemist Joseph Black and James Watt, inventor  of the separate condenser for the steam engine, is presented. The story shows the integration of technology, society, and culture. The relationship between the men is examined for scientific discoveries that were transmitted between them, the general character of the society supporting their activities, and common areas of understanding and knowledge. In this case, an important technical innovation depended upon a close and friendly relationship between the men. (Author/ND)",

It deals with the consequences for individuals living in an environment shaped by modern technology. The main focus is that technology has acted as a leveling force--a destroyer of unique differences of regional diversities and national identities, and of environments that complement an individual's life-style. Modern technology has created environments with characteristics of mass production, mass distribution, and mass consumption. Illustrations of environments that have been altered by technology are cited. Using urbanity as its vehicle, technology has created an environment containing technological  problems which man can barely control. It is man's responsibility to solve these problems in order to regain control over his environment. The use of technology has become a moral issue, involving values and choices of technological advance versus survival in changed environments. Although man has used technology to better his life, he has not controlled technology. Thus, man has become the victim of technology and his resultant environment. He must correct the problems it has created before his environment is destroyed. (ND)",

The control program was the normal program of supervision that is typically employed by the college supervisor. The experimental program involved a considerably larger number of student teachers under the supervision of one college supervisor. The college supervisor utilized special approaches with the experimental supervising teachers and student teachers to make accommodations for the large number of students. An evaluative questionnaire was administered to the student teachers and supervising teachers at the  end of the quarter. It was found that the large-group program was affected to some extent by the lack of classroom observations by the college supervisor, especially in his ability to evaluate and write recommendations. However, the progress of the student teacher did not appear to be influenced by the type of supervisory program, and both college supervisors were rated highly. It was concluded that teachers and students seemed to respond to the expectations of the particular supervisory program and accept the approach provided. The hypothesis was rejected. Tables illustrate methods of comparison of groups and means of scoring and evaluation. Appendixes give examples of final questionnaires given to the participants in the program. (Author/JD)",

        "description":"This booklet contains institutional capability profiles on the 17 educational laboratories and R&amp;D centers primarily supported by the National Institute of Education, Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Each institution presents its capabilities in terms of mission, programs, resources, staff, and facilities. The original university-based research and development centers were created under provisions of the Cooperative Research Act of 1963. The regional educational laboratories were funded under provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. These institutions maintain multidisciplinary staffs and specialized facilities for conducting research, development, evaluation, and training. Many of the institutions have a substantive mission focus (e.g.,  reading, school organization, and vocational education). Others have strong regional ties. Their expertise spans early elementary through adult education and basic research through product development and dissemination. All have experience performing both small-scale projects and large, multi-year programs. Although funded largely through contracts administered by NIE, the institutions also perform work for other federal, state, and local agencies. Additional funding sources include foundations, industries, and foreign countries. Further information can be obtained by contacting the director of each institution. (Editor/MB)",

        "description":"The Ideal Student Description Q-Sort was developed originally as a predictive instrument to determine probable success rates as teachers based upon the teacher candidate's perceptions of students in general. The Q-Sort consists of 84 items describing &quot;openness&quot; and &quot;closedness&quot; in a student and reveals the extent to which a teacher perceives students as either flexible (positive) or rigid (negative) in their interpersonal relationships, and also suggests whether the teacher is more open in his/her perceptions of students. Results of administering the Q-Sort over a four-year period indicated that participants in secondary education programs had a more negative perception of students at the outset, remained more rigid in their views, and tended to become increasingly negative over  the four-year period and into their first year of teaching. The opposite was found true for students in the elementary education programs. It became apparent to the investigator that measuring student characteristics for screening purposes at a definite point in time was contrary to the concept of developmental teaching and learning, and that perceptions can be changed over a period of time provided sequences of learning activities are made available (even though secondary teaching candidates are more inflexible). The ISD Q-Sort, instead of becoming a screening device, may evolve into a counseling instrument used in planning the sequence of interpersonal relationships in teacher education indicated by the candidate's individual needs.

In addition, the study attempted to determine preservice teacher attitudes toward competency based teacher education (CBTE). The method used involved three groups of preservice teachers (two control and one experimental) a pretest, instructional sequences (with CBTE methods being the independent variable), and a posttest. Analysis of the data indicates that the control group, utilizing conventional teaching strategies, had a significantly higher level of achievement than the experimental group. Additional data from the student opinion survey indicate the following learning  activities in the competency based approach were considered beneficial by the participants: seminars, resource people, field experiences, and class tutors. Generally, students found the competency based approach more enjoyable and rewarding, yet more time consuming. In view of the literature, the research, and the trends in education, the competency based approach represents no panacea, but it is a viable alternative for the future. (MB)",

        "description":"Two experiments were completed to determine whether providing classroom teachers with feedback would result in changes in both teacher and student behavior. The first experiment was designed to extend the validity of an earlier investigation by Moore et al. (1974) through replication with a new teacher population and a larger sample of male teachers. The second experiment was designed to test whether teaching effectiveness would be increased if appropriate feedback involved with generating instructional sequences appropriate for individual learners was given. In the first experiment, teachers received feedback related to their ability to control their teaching behavior and their ability to apply a theoretically based rationale in the resolution of learner problems. The  experimental teachers demonstrated greater control of their teaching behavior as evidenced by the low discrepancy between their ratings of the need for intervention and their satisfaction of that need. Teachers in experiment two received feedback associated with their abilities to (1) engage in diagnostic procedures when a student incorrectly answered a question and (2) utilize appropriate diagnostic sequences to resolve the problem. There were significant differences in the direction of the experimental group, indicating that (1) experimental teachers engaged in diagnosis more often; (2) they conceptualized and employed more appropriate processes for diagnosis; and (3) their students correctly answered more previously missed items than did participants in the control group. In summary,  the study demonstrated the importance of conceptually appropriate feedback in bringing about changes in teacher behavior. (MB)",

The procedure involves the following steps: (1) determining the topics present in all current texts at the level desired; (2) constructing an instrument listing the topics; (3) allowing affected teachers to rate the topics as to importance and relevance; (4) analyzing the results and constructing an instrument containing only the highly rated topics; (5) having affected teachers rate the texts remaining after those whose copyright date, cost, or lack of content in  the areas rated as important and relevant have been eliminated. After analysis of the fifth step, each book or series can be ranked. A top text or series closely fitting the local philosophy and curriculum can thus be selected. If multi-texts are to be used in the classroom, two or more of the top texts or series may be chosen. The study discusses the procedure and its illustration, also noting related factors, and describes accompanying findings.

This report focuses on one of these hypotheses--that when asked to assess in writing an event that allowed for a variety of points of view, inservice teachers after value clarification training would signal more concern for the needs and interests of students than before training and would signal less concern for the needs and interests of authority figures in the classroom and school settings. The subjects were inservice administrators and/or teachers in grades K-8 in small Roman Catholic, parochial schools. Value clarification training consisted of numerous activities presented in six three-hour sessions and one six-hour session  over the course of seven weeks. Before and after training, subjects were asked to observe and assess classroom events portrayed in a nine-minute film. The film was selected because of its ability to stimulate a variety of viewer responses. It depicted teacher interaction with groups of students and one-to-one interaction between the teacher and individual students. The major finding of the study was that the percentage of assessment statements showing concern for the students as individuals was significantly higher after the value clarification training program.

These projects incorporate into their design the results of research, empirical practices and processes that have proven effective and relevant to the educational processes for schools serving low-income populations. Chapter I provides an overview. Chapter II presents an in-depth look at the evaluation process and discusses the differences between impact and process evaluations. A comparison is made among projects that focus on either student outcomes, teacher outcomes, or institutional outcomes, and the implications of these different foci are discussed. Considerations of where to begin to conceptualize the evaluation process  are presented in Chapter III. The fourth chapter discusses the design of impact evaluation studies and presents some alternative approaches to evaluation such as quasi-experimental designs and the establishment of criterion standards. Chapter V discusses the design and selection of evaluation instruments. A variety of instruments are considered as well as behavioral indicators that can be used to evaluate project outcomes. Chapter VI argues that the process of evaluating ongoing activities during the course of the project is of critical importance both to the management of the project and to the eventual sharing of the project's outcomes. The importance of careful preparation of data gathered during the evaluation process is considered in Chapter VII, and the importance of the  organization, display, and interpretation of data in order to maximize usefulness is emphasized. Chapter VIII focuses on some of the major problems that arise in the impact evaluation process. The final chapter summarizes the importance of both process and impact evaluations. (MM)",

Section two examines the failures and successes of teacher training institutions in the field of handicapped pupils, critiques one model of preservice and inservice teacher training, and  presents some challenges an individual classroom teacher will be called upon to meet. Chapter three examines the mainstreaming concept from technical assistance perspectives; suggests a semi-autonomous, government-funded, technical assistance program; critiques a model for educational administrator training; and reports on one effort of state administrators to collaborate on their problems. Section four examines various ongoing regional, state, and local mainstreaming programs. Section five presents problems in evaluating mainstreaming programs, concentrating on the lack of suitable instrumentation and the diversity of opinions as to what the term &quot;mainstreaming&quot; actually encompasses.

As a structured portion of education, it has been in existence only about 100 years when a department of Physical Education and Hygiene was established at Amherst College in 1861. As an integral part of the educational system, it affects students at all levels, from the basic activities class in which all students are required to participate, through the intra- and extra-mural levels to the interscholastic level, in which only the most proficient participate. Preparatio of educational leaders for the field has been a problem, in that the physical educator was  also expected (and in most cases required) to be involved in the coaching of extramural sports. With the development of the concept of \"coaching internship,\" an individual who wishes to coach an athletic sport while teaching in another dicipline will be able to do that. This approach also opens the employment field to those who wish to teach physical education, but not coach sports. Success in a program of physical education can be judged only by the totality of its effects on the biological, psychological,sociological, and mental needs of the individual. With continued concern on the part of the professionals in the field, the role of physical education in the school for assisting every student reach his or her full potential as a citizen of this country can be realized.

The rationale for the visiting teacher program is outlined first followed by an explanation of who the visiting teacher is. Twenty functions of the visiting teacher are then listed. The visiting teacher's function as a member of an interdisciplinary team is diagramed. Finally, some guidelines and procedures for initiation of visiting teacher program are offered. Topics covered in discussion of guiding principles for program initiation are: planning; organizing; implementation; allocation and the Texas School Code; qualifications; certification; and special assignment areas.

        "description":"This project sought to demonstrate that: (1) teams of educational personnel could be trained to serve the needs of certain handicapped children exhibiting marked behavior disorders; (2) members could be trained to identify behaviors of their children and themselves which may appear to cause classroom disorder; and (3) techniques could be devised to modify such behavior disorders. The sixteen teams formed consisted of a regular education teacher, a special education teacher, and at least one administrator, counselor, and psychologist; each participated in a forty-five hour program of orientation, teaching, and counseling. Findings obtained are the result of team observations and suggestions, clinical reports, remarks by parents, control data strategies, teaching attempts, actual  outcomes, and a variety of results from using many alternatives for many disruptive teaching situations. The findings confirmed that the three objectives could be attained. In addition, the teams were able to identify a variety of teaching alternatives when working with handicapped children who demonstrated marked behavior disorders. Also, the team members expressed a desire to be considered for future projects of this nature. Appendixes to the report consist of a 168-item list of disruptive classroom behaviors on the part of students, 35 disruptive behaviors of team members identified by themselves, seven clinical supervision forms, clinical supervision reward systems, a &quot;control of strategy&quot; outline, and vitae on the author.

        "description":"This study investigated systematic relationships among teacher personality types (Ambitious, Conscientious, and Indulgent), preservice educational beliefs, and intern classroom practices. The investigation traced the theoretical and empirical linkage from personality structure though educational ideology and finally to perceptions of teacher priorities and behaviors as seen by students. During pre-service education, 32 subjects were classified by way of a word association test and assigned to one of the typologies listed above-- A, C, or I--and then were tested on five dimensions of the Wehling-Charters Teacher Conceptions of the Educative Process instrument. After seven months of intern-year teaching, a Student Perceptions Test was administered to 1,023 pupils of the interns.  Students measured intern motivations and practices on three corresponding test scales: Achievement (Ambitious), Conformity (Conscientious), and Nurturance (Indulgent). A, C, and I types were hypothesized to hold differing educational beliefs and to adopt differing teaching goals and strategies in practice. These differences were hypothesized to be a function of personality structure. The results indicate that pupils: (1) perceive differences in style and behaviors between A and C types; (2) accept both A and C type teachers and teaching priorities; and (3) reject individuals of any typology who present confusing and/or conflicting sets of educational beliefs and teaching strategies.

Data was gathered from the Teachers Concerns Checklist and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire completed by both groups of student teachers. Non-center student teachers were placed in metropolitan school settings with no enrichment program input from the university. The teacher education center student teachers participated in a program consisting of: (1) content seminars on discipline, reinforcement strategies, and questioning techniques; (2) an  orientation day to acquaint the student teacher with the center prior to the student teaching experience and to facilitate placement with the cooperating teacher; (3) analysis of their teaching through the use of audio and video tapes several times during the teaching experience; (4) individualized student teaching programs through the use of objectives that were summarized as a basis for their final evaluation; and (5) daily contact with the center coordinator while at work for supervision and counsel. A final consideration in placing this research in perspective is the lack of a well-developed program at the teacher education center used for this research. Results indicate that in order to make a significant difference, a teacher education program needs to provide experiences that will  result in behavioral changes. (MM)",

During the terminal two weeks of student teaching, three groups of student teachers, one each in elementary education, physical education, and secondary social studies, were asked to identify effective cooperating teacher behaviors and to rate them on a need scale. Those behaviors rated &quot;definitely needed&quot; by a majority of the students were determined to be competency requirements for that group. All groups considered the cooperating teachers'&quot;development of student teachers perception of the teaching-learning process&quot; as the most important major category of  behavior. Twenty-seven competencies divided into three large categories (perceptions of the teaching-learning process, understanding pupils, developing behaviors of a professional) were constructed from the student teacher responses. Agreement was noted at the level of major categories and subcategories, but a lack of agreement as to particular competencies emphasized the need for investigations in the various curricular areas to develop more curricular-specific competencies.

        "description":"This document is the result of an investigation sponsored by the Council of Europe into the state of multinational cooperation on the part of council member nations in the field of educational research. Questionnaires sent to research facility administrators and staff revealed a certain hesitation to cooperate on an institutional/administrative level if other, more flexible, forms of cooperation could be evolved. Major concern was evidenced in the fields of (1) the conduct of research, (2) the classification of research methodologies, and (3) the synthesis of educational research findings. Several ongoing cooperative programs were examined to discern the ways in which international research is conducted, what the organizational strongpoints and weaknesses are, and what  possibilities exist for future development. Cooperation in the field of a European outlook in educational research might take as a starting point the European Documentation and Information System for Education (EUDISED), changing it from a passive, information cataloging system to a more active accumulation system such as the ERIC (United States) system. Most important should be cooperation in analytical criticism and information synthesis at the interinstitutional and multinational level, funded by national contributions. The authors present a ten-year plan for the development of a coordinated program involving an assured and continuing budget, a pan-European system of documentation, analysis, and diffusion, and a European organizational network developed from national research  coordinating units.

        "description":"This discourse suggests that there are nine categories of client publics (or education consumers) which individually or collectively hold expectations of accreditation and accrediting agencies: (1) the institutions, their students, faculty, and trustees; (2) the federal agencies; (3) agencies that recognize accrediting bodies, specifically the U.S. Office of Education and the Council on Postsecondary Accreditation; (4) the national organizations that represent various interest groups in education; (5) the regulatory agencies; (6) consumer protection groups; (7) elected officials; (8) general and academic critics and the investigators of accreditation; and (9) parents, the average citizen, and the taxpayer. Over the past decade, there have been three periods of consumer (client  publics) attention to accreditation--1968-71, 1972-73, and 1974-76. The first period, 1968-71, was a form of consciousness-raising on the part of the accrediting establishment related to the concerns of outside forces. During this period, skeptical and hostile publics emerged, and accreditors and defenders of accreditation reacted with despair. The period 1972-73 began with accrediting agencies filled with enthusiasm to demonstrate that accrediting is accountability for stewardship of a public trust and that the system is open to constructive change and valid reform. Four studies were undertaken to provide a reexamination of the field of accrediting--the Puffer, Ward, Ash, and Seldon reports. During this period when the accrediting community was attempting to respond constructively to the  range of issues raised earlier, its public began to regroup and new issues began to surface. These new issues, which characterize the period 1974-76, are: (1) the role of accreditation in education consumer protection; (2) the role of accreditation in the Federal eligibility system; and (3) the system's accountability.

        "description":"This report by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports examines the effects of various forms of physical exercise on the knee joint which, because of its vulnerability, is especially subject to injury. Discussion centers around the physical characteristics of the joint, commonly used measurements for determining knee stability, muscular and ligament strength. The deep knee bend, an exercise of highly questionable value in conditioning regimens, is criticized on the grounds that it contributes to chronic synovitis, promotes early arthritic onset, and produces gross knee instability. Exercise regimens are proposed and discussed for the treatment and prevention of knee injuries. Practical advice for the development of physical education and athletic programs  justifiable from this review of knee joint exercise is given, and includes: (1) Exercises that unduly stretch or damage the ligaments of the knee should be avoided; (2) The deep knee bend should be used sparingly, if at all, in physical education and athletic conditioning, and substitutes should be developed such as bench stepping and weight training routines; (3) In performing knee bends for developing and maintaining the strength and endurance of the quadriceps muscles, a half knee bend is recommended; (4) Progressive resistance exercises of the muscles activating the knee joint should be routinely employed for the prevention of knee injuries and for the rehabilitation of the knee during postinjury or postsurgical rehabilitation.

        "description":"Student teaching is examined in relation to Maslow's theory of human motivation that proposes an inherent human tendency toward self-actualization. It is pointed out that the majority of student teachers operate in fear as they enter their final phase of teacher training, and according to Maslow, they are operating at the safety level, concerned with their own survival at a time when they are asked to give to others. At least one study suggests student teaching does not have to be this way. A team of researchers identified six developmental stages during the student teaching experience that parallel the intermediate sequence of Maslow's theory (safety, love and belongingness, and esteem): (1) concerns with placements, school rules, identifying and ascertaining the expectations of  supervisory personnel; (2) concerns about the student teachers' perceptions of their adequacy in the teaching role; (3) desires to determine the causes of deviant behavior on the parts of their students; (4) desires for evaluation and feedback from supervisors, parents, principals, and other teachers; (5) concerns for what their pupils are learning as opposed to what they are being taught; and finally (6) concerns for their pupils and the achievement of new understandings of themselves through relationships with their pupils. Results from research suggest that most student teachers do not advance beyond the fourth developmental stage--concerns for feedback and evaluation. It is suggested that (1) microteaching and simulation prior to student teaching have potential toward gratifying a  number of the safety related concerns of the student teacher; (2) that student teachers should have the opportunity to establish close personal relationships with at least one teacher educator to promote feelings of belonging; and (3) that prior experience with pupils would promote feelings of comfort when student teaching. A three-phase program of exploration, skill acquisition, and skill-testing and revision is also suggested to help gratify student teachers' needs. (MM)",

Pupils were placed in categories by their teachers: (1) accepting, (2) concerned, (3) indifferent, and (4) rejecting. Objectives of the investigation included: (1) to investigate physical proximity as a quantifiable dimension of nonverbal behavior; (2) to continue the exploration of the situational  frame contextual approach to the study of nonverbal behavior; (3) to attempt to simultaneously record verbal and nonverbal behaviors using trained observers; (4) to validate the pupil categories that are currently being employed in investigations of teacher behavior; and (5) to examine the relationships between observed verbal and nonverbal teacher behaviors and the pupil category system developed by Silberman (1969) and used by Willis and Brophy (1974). Significant aspects of the study are that: (1) it presented an expanded view of observable teacher behavior; (2) it quantified the verbal and nonverbal behavior of teachers within the context of student-initiated questions; and (3) it appeared to validate, with additional data, the pupil category system.

This report presents analyses whose function is to construct a data file with these characteristics. Internal consistency reliabilities of both human  organization (survey) data and performance (total variable expenses and absenteeism rate) are shown to be high, and a pattern of human organization-to-performance coefficients results which is eminently usable.

Now, researchers must explain, clarify, and obtain permission from the parents of children with a written release before they  can conduct studies, once those studies are approved by the school district. The new laws are not seen as posing any problems for public school based research, evaluation, and development staff; they do prohibit research that is merely interesting and of no benefit to anyone, save the researcher.

        "description":"The Philadelphia Prekindergarten Head Start program is a child development program for three and four-year-old children from low income families which stresses an interacting and multi-disciplinary attempt to improve the child's physical and emotional health, his family relationships, and his abilities to function better as a person. The program was designed from the beginning to implement five different early childhood educational models (Bank Street, Behavior Analysis, Montessori, Open Classroom, and Responsive Learning). The 1975-1976 evaluation activities for Philadelphia's Prekindergarten Head Start program continued to focus on the major goals for children. There was found to be some range in practices among centers in terms of (1) extent of model implementation, (2)  classroom differences within a model, (3) number of parent volunteers, (4) grouping practices, and (5) provisioning. Observation data yielding the above information are summarized according to model and across the total program. The Denver Developmental Screening Test (D.D.S.T.) was administered during October and April to 82% and 84% of the population respectively. In April only 1.8% of the population was identified as having a developmental delay as defined by the D.D.S.T., a decrease of about 40% from the Fall administration. While Prekindergarten Head Start children are from families of low socio-economic status, the April D.D.S.T. results confirmed, as was the case in 1974-1975, that the population screened had improved after a year of program participation so that there were far  fewer children &quot;at risk&quot; than were found in the norming population.

        "description":"This volume is introduced by Sid Simon's discussion of the \"Wad-Ja-Get?\" syndrome--society's obsession with grades--and where it has led. Simon also explains each author's strong identification with the grading issue, and presents seven major questions that the authors, in the book, attempt to answer. His overview provides a perspective for considering all the material to follow. Part I presents the problem, beginning with Art Combs' stage-setting comments about the nature of learning and his discussion of four criteria for determining procedures in grading. Later in this section, Sid Simon looks at the many ingenious methods of cheating that students use in grade-getting. Part II provides a quick review of what research has to say on the subject of grading and offers references.  The pros and cons of several alternative grading/evaluating schemes are also reviewed. Although most of the research presented confirms the fact that grading is, indeed, a problem, much attention is given to the typical humanistic concerns. Five successful alternative (non-common) grading procedures are presented in Part III. These case studies range from a personal report about procedures in a college classroom, to notes on a computerized grading system, to a faculty-developed evaluation plan for an entire school district.

This law mandates that each student entering the first year in any primary grade in any public school must be evaluated for the purpose of identifying learning disabilities. Further, it is stated that the schools are to develop programs specifically adapted to meet the needs of the children after they have been assessed. A basic plan for implementing this mandate includes conducting early screening of all students, administering continuous assessment of students, and developing instructional strategies based on the screening and/or assessment findings.  Information relating to the different aspects of this implementation process is provided in the various sections of this handbook. As a child enters a primary grade, the teacher uses a variety of sources to learn about the child's developmental level in order to plan appropriate programs. Classroom teacher observation is one of the best sources of information about children's levels of achievement. Utilizing this knowledge, the Maryland Systematic Teacher Observation Instrument was designed. It summarizes each child's performance and can be completed by the teacher as daily classroom routines are in progress. A copy of this instrument is included. (MV)",

This investigation compared scores achieved by approximately 150 youngsters residing in East and Central Harlem on the Revised version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) with scores achieved by a comparable population on the 1949 version of the WISC. Contrary to expectations, the revised version (supposedly standardized, unlike its predecessor, to reflect the 1970 census for the critical variables of race,  occupational head of household, geographic region and the urban rural distribution) produced significantly lower scaled scores on several subtests which, in turn, significantly lowered full scale IQ scores. This fact seemingly penalized the very population which, it was indicated, was most likely to gain. Appropriate statistical measures were applied to determine the true significance of these results, taking into account sex and age of subjects. Implications for continued use of this new instrument were discussed and conclusions drawn. (Author/MV)",

Cross-sectional analyses of February, 1975 achievement data indicate that Total Follow Through exceeds Total Non-Follow Through performance in all test areas in kindergarten through second grade, but not in third grade. Behavior Analysis and Parent Implemented Models generally exceed their district non-Follow Through groupings at all grade levels, and rank first and second respectively, with the Bank Street Model in third place. Quasi-longitudinal analyses reveal that Head Start or equivalent experience, length of program exposure, and low absence rates are consistently associated with higher performance in reading and mathematics at all grade levels,  K-6. Apparently there was sufficient program continuity to produce its intended longitudinal effect as 59% of the teachers and 64% of the pupils remained in the program over the four year span. In the program as a whole, 54% of all children had absence rates of 15 days or less. And, Head Start or equivalent experience is consistently associated with higher attendance. Supportive services information indicates that 71% of those referred were treated for medical problems and dental treatment was provided for 85% of the referrals. Pre-program questionnaires completed by principals, teachers and aides indicate that the majority of principals and teachers had positive attitudes towards the prospective program. (MV)",

Methods used to identify and document innovations and to assess student achievement are highlighted and include selection of schools and students, sample description, and data collection instruments and schedule. The present report did not attempt an exhaustive analysis of all the data collected during the three implementation years of the study. Rather, the analysis focused on the extent to which intensive innovation was associated with substantial differences in student outcomes. The Project LONGSTEP findings should not be viewed as a sweeping criticism of the concepts  of innovation or individualization. However, they should serve as a reminder to educators--as well as to parents and legislators--that educational innovation per se will not necessarily produce dramatic effects on student achievement. Educational quality is not synonymous with innovation or individualization. Individualization of instruction may represent a valuable approach for the improvement of American education, but the findings here suggest that individualization as a program strategy should not be viewed as the final or complete answer. &quot;Data Collection Instruments and Guidelines&quot; developed for Project LONGSTEP referenced in Vol. I, Chapter II, Section C, will be accessioned TM 005 987 in RIEMAY77.

This volume explores the possibility that growth in student achievement test performance and positive changes in school-related attitudes were highly associated with highly innovative school environments. Both student outcome scores and treatment data in language arts, mathematics, social studies, and science were aggregated to the school level so that the more general question of the relation between school environments and outcomes could be explored. Important differences among schools with respect to the achievement test performance and attitudes of their students existed in a number of samples analyzed.  Greater average growth in achievement test performance and positive changes in attitude were not associated with school-level emphasis on innovation and individualization. Measures of growth in achievement were typically not related to quantity of schooling indices. There was, however, a tendency for these indices to be positively related to student attitudes toward schooling. In general, changes in average student attitudes toward school were not significantly related to average growth in achievement. However, the majority of correlations were positive. In respect to the primary hypothesis, the results of this study indicate that innovative school environments did not demonstrate a substantially positive impact on either achievement or student attitudes. &quot;Data Collection Instruments and  Guidelines&quot; developed for Project LONGSTEP referenced in Vol. I, Chapter II, Section C, will be accessioned TM 005 987 in RIEMAY77.

Of particular interest were the congruence between parental expectations and the children's perceptions of these expectations and the impact of this congruence on student achievement and attitudes toward school. The data for the present study came from an earlier investigation designed to determine the dependability of the Project LONGSTEP questionnaire responses. Students represented a 2% stratified random sample (by grade within each school) of the students participating in Project LONGSTEP during the 1971-72 school year. It appeared that parental expectations  concerning both how far in school they wanted their children to go and how good a student they wanted their children to be can influence student attitudes toward school; however, such expectations did not appear to influence student achievement test performance. In the case of how far in school they wanted their children to go, no special effort may be needed to communicate these expectations. On the other hand, it appeared that parents with high expectations concerning how good a student they want their children to be would be well advised to make a special effort to communicate these expectations to their children. &quot;Data Collection Instruments and Guidelines&quot; developed for Project LONGSTEP referenced in Vol. I, Chapter II, Section C, will be accessioned TM 005 987 in RIEMAY77.

In addition, the students in Family Life Education did not exhibit significantly different attitudes from those of students in Grade 12. Forty-nine percent of the students felt that Family Life Education had improved their ability to communicate; 42% felt greater  self-confidence as a result of the course; 37% found it easier to discuss attitudes with the opposite sex. There was no indication that the value systems of the students were influenced either in a positive or negative direction, although many were positively oriented before taking the course. Further, the course provided new information, and students found it to be stimulating. (Author/MV)",

It evaluated these techniques using two criteria: their effectiveness in improving returns and their cost-effectiveness. The results suggest that a school district planning to conduct such a study should orient those who will be involved prior to their leaving school. It further suggests that prior to receiving the instrument those involved in the study should be contacted by telephone, to elicit their cooperation, particularly when the geographic area is small and local calls can be made. The writer concludes that there is a need to study more complex methods for improving the rate of  returns of follow-up studies, with a strong probability that telephoning ahead, and using a follow-up that includes a second copy of the instrument and a second cover letter, would produce both greater cost effectiveness and a higher rate of return.

Briefly illustrated are some implications for social policy when one views the person as a complex open system existing through transactions with multiple contexts, and when one adopts positive development as the highest priority human objective, with remediation as the backup system.

Consistent with Jensen's theory, SES groups differed most on Level II (conceptual or problem solving ability) measures.

The functional dependence of II on I and the stronger relation of I and II in the middle-SES population were not supported.

        "description":"The paper offers a brief definition of open education from a framework which is designed to be descriptive rather than proscriptive, and then considers the problem of how educators can evaluate the effectiveness of open educational practices. Open education policies are looked at from a historical and philosophical perspective, a psychological perspective, a sociological perspective, a practical perspective, and an evaluative perspective. Then, six steps are suggested for doing evaluative research in open classroom settings: (1) define competencies, achievements, or operational-behavioral objectives that one expects to be learned by the participants in the program; (2) choose measures that are directly relevant to the expected outcomes; (3) measure the children's performance on  these criteria as they begin the program; (4) observe children as they participate in the program to get a clear empirical view of what they actually did in the program; (5) remeasure the children's performance on criteria after they participate in the program; and (6) relate observed child behavior to measured change on the related criteria. These steps are explained further. It is argued that it is possible to evaluate open education if we consider educational evaluation research as &quot;treatment effect research&quot; and carefully define outcomes and carefully describe treatment, and then demonstrate the relationship between the two.

        "description":"Testing with minority and disadvantaged populations in America has resulted in widespread abuse. Theorists have historically viewed tests as instruments for upward mobility in a system in which doors are often opened by parental wealth and status. Predictive validity of tests has not properly accounted for problems in correlational techniques which accrue when low socioeconomic minority groups who tend to live in homogeneous clusters are considered within the general population. One solution to the lack of norm referenced groups which reflect the homogeneity of minority groups is the use of criterion referenced tests which are useful for both diagnosis and teaching. A criterion referenced approach has been developed over a five year period. The results have been used for pre and  post measures for assessing efficacy, for individual instruction, for screening children for further assessment, and as a general guide to help teachers understand individual needs. The test was developed by the Head Start staff and is periodically updated. Factor analysis suggests a specific language factor and a general readiness factor. Internal consistency has run consistently over .88 for administration by college sophomores. Problems of design and implementation are discussed. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"Program evaluation methodology as an investigatory strategy has been developed to generate information as to the capabilities of human service programs to produce maximal desired effects in client populations with minimal resource use. Experience with the procedures, however, has disclosed multiple difficulties attendant upon their use, doubt as to the validity of the information which they generate, and a legitimate questioning as to the impact which such findings have upon upgrading human services. An alternative strategy for program testing has been in established use in industrial, agricultural and medical contexts, where the lesson has already been learned not to install a program first, and then mount an evaluation effort to see whether what has been built proves to have  any merit. The utilization of such a Research and Development (R&D) strategy calls for a sharp separation of the processes of program development from program operations in the world-of-use. Some major differences between the two strategies are enumerated. It is argued that continued pursuit of contemporary procedures for program evaluation will not only prove excessively costly in the long-run, but will also be unlikely to produce operational services and systems with the high effect/low cost characteristics which are sought, and that a shift in the field of human service program development should be made toward an R&D strategy instead.

The intended purpose of the investigation was to evaluate and analyze the reliability and validity of measurements that are predictive of competence and proficiency at entry levels in occupational therapy. Each level of the Proficiency Examination (PE) was evaluated with a number of independent measures of occupational therapy knowledge and practice. Existing measures, the National Certification Examination (NCE), and the Field Work Performance Report (FWPR), were compared with the therapist level examination, the Qualitative Assessment of Field Work Competency (QAFWC). The FWPR, a measure of frequency of performance of required skills, was revised to  include a qualitative dimension of performance. The Qualitative Assessment of Field Work Performance (QAFWP), a measure of field work performance at the assistant level, was developed as an independent measure for the evaluation of the assistant level PE. Information on the data collection phases; general descriptive data; the factor analysis of the PE and the NCE; the relationship between grade point average and the PE, QAFWC, and FWPR; and the comparative score performance between therapists and assistant therapists on the therapist level PE is given.

        "description":"Concommitant with changes in education, health care roles, and evaluation in recent years, a new six year combined B.S. and M.D. program was inititated at the University of Missouri at Kansas City. Evaluation was integrated into the academic plan in order to assess student progress toward the overall goal of becoming a safe physician, as well as achievement in specific areas of the curriculum. Although several evaluation procedures are in place at this institution, this paper describes only the Item Library. The Item Library is a computerized information retrieval system containing, at this time, 10,000 test questions and support information. Each entry of the Item Library consists of the test question, Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) code, date submitted, source, history of use  and update, item analysis data, and a specific bibliographic reference. The psychometric data indicate that the Quarterly Profile Exams generated from the Item Library are reliable and valid measures. Extending the computer assisted testing procedures of the Item Library into other allied health fields is in progress. (Author/RC)",

This paper considers the relevance of anthropological method and theory to such research. A detailed examination of the author's evaluation of a federal program demonstrates that while problems exist and new middle-level theory must be developed, anthropological perspectives do provide important insights and understandings. Future prospects for such anthropological research look exceedingly bright. (Author)",

The study reported here investigates the development of interracial interaction patterns in a public school which approaches the Allport criteria. The study utilized a behavioral measure of the amount of voluntary association between students--student seating patterns in the school cafeteria--to assess interracial interaction patterns. Wexler Middle School, which serves 1500 students in grades six through eight, opened in the fall of 1976. The student body, which is 48 percent black, was obtained through open enrollment  of students from a large district in a Northeastern industrial city. Analysis of seating patterns suggested the following: (a) race is an extremely important grouping criterion; (b) however, in the sixth and seventh grades, sex is an even more important grouping criterion; (c) racial aggregation decreased over time in the sixth and seventh grades but increased in the eighth grade which had a predominantly white accelerated academic track and a predominantly black regular track, and (d) changes in racial aggregation over time, both positive and negative, were stronger among males than females.

A parent education component was implemented. In the 1975 summer session, the main areas of reading and mathematics were emphasized with additional inputs into the institutions and early childhood programs. A sizeable portion of the summer school budget was allocated for tuition scholarships. Five thousand six hundred and two pupils were involved in regular year programs. There were 3048 pupils in corrective reading with 2454 in  mathematics, some of whom may have been in both programs. Seventy-six percent of the pupils met or exceeded the stated major performance for reading that pupils should gain .8 of a month on the California Reading Test for each month of instruction. Fifty-five percent of 2,054 pupils with pretest and posttest scores met the mathematics performance objectives on posttests. These objectives were measured by criterion referenced basic skills tests.

The public school system consists of early childhood education (ECE), elementary education, secondary education, and special education. In the 1975-76 school year, ECE operated 145 village centers. In addition to these centers, five year-old children from village and home centers were transported into an ECE training center on a rotating basis to experience more sophisticated learning activities and to profit from field experience. Twenty-six consolidated schools in the islands of Tutuila, Aunu'u, Ta'u Olosega, and Ofu were in operation during FY76. Special education operated two classroom centers in addition to three other classes operated in three consolidated schools in the Bay area. In summarizing  the educational activities of American Samoa for 1975-76, the report focuses on the following areas: those who need education, the organization of schools, costs of education, goals of education, other services such as instructional development, library services, and financial aid, and statistical information relating to the profiles of the department of education and its instructional personnel, and to income of the department of education.

        "description":"When the paraprofessional in bilingual education is used effectively, individual needs and individual differences of the students are met. An approach to the training of the paraprofessional has been developed at the Merrimack Education Center (MEC). The training program involves active participation of all paraprofessionals. Understanding and synthesizing child growth and development principles as well as knowing the specific duties of the paraprofessional are necessary components of the training program. Over the past five years, MEC, acting in the role of an educational brokerage center, has continuously interacted between professionals and paraprofessionals in order to reassess the needs of communities continuously for the formulation of new immediate and long term behavioral  objectives. Based on these objectives a variety of programs has been prepared for workshops of varying sizes and lengths of time, and semester courses to meet the variety of needs. The bulk of this document describes one program designed to meet the specific needs of instructional aides in an urban area. Program instruction is couched within a framework of understanding the process of human behavior and how children learn within a social-psychological environment. Reinforced consistently in the role of instructional aide is the need for the pupils to identify with elements and people within the community. Instructional aides can be adequately trained in ten weeks. (Author)",

        "description":"This discussion places the ten years of the war on poverty in perspective and, on the basis of both the experiment in policy intervention and some recent trends, speculates on the nature and course of social policy over the next decade. The basis of and motivations for the war on poverty are reviewed as the primary concern of the first part of this discussion. The premises used to justify the strategies chosen are recounted, and the progress against poverty during the 1965-1975 decade is appraised. A proposition this paper explores is that many important policy developments affecting the poor during this decade were not found on the agenda of the war on poverty planners in the sixties. While poverty was reduced, it is difficult to directly attribute this result to those programs  that played an explicit part in the war. The second part of this paper comments on some recent developments in the nation's political and social structure and reflects on the legacy of past social policy, serving as the basis for a few speculations on the future course of social policy. It is held that increased attention to the implifications of such underlying changes may well be the appropriate response of social scientists disillusioned over the failure of planned social change and the naive belief in the power of rational public policy.

The distribution of attainments, or the structure of inequality, is assumed fixed and described by a simple exponential or geometric distribution function, depending on whether attainment levels are assumed discrete or continuous. Persons leaving the labor force create chains of vacancies in this structure that present mobility opportunities for persons entering the labor force. The implications of the model for the attainment process derived from these considerations for status attainment research and stochastic models for job-mobility are discussed. (Author/JM)",

It then focuses on four ethnic heritage groups that frequently populate urban areas--Afro-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Arab-Americans, and Irish-Americans. These four ethnic groups are used as case studies and examples for examining issues and problems in developing ethnic education for our multicultural and highly diverse society. The theroetical models and approaches are introduced by noting that Andrew Greeley has made a distinct contribution by detailing various perspectives for the study of ethnicity. His various models for describing the dynamics of ethnicity are presented here, as well as one developed by the staff of the  Ethnic Heritage Studies Project, for use in preparing curriculum materials. As a conclusion for this paper, several of the student activities from the project which are currently being developed are included as an example of the impact of ethnicity and teaching in multicultural, urbanized society.

The Harding school would continue as a city wide open enrollment school. Burton school, exempted by court, would not be balanced. Wayne school would be an elementary school in transition, housing only grades 3-6. The district's middle schools would house grades 6-8. The academic high schools would house grades 9-12. The report compares projected pupil statistics under the proposed plan and actual pupil enrollment.  Also presented are implementation activities for the Emergency School Aid Act; desegregation plan for the second year; and the conceptualization, design, and implementation of an evaluation to measure the effect (if any) of desegregation on pupil achievement, interest in school, and self esteem.

A list of area agencies within walking distance of the YWCA there was compiled. A questionnaire was administered via interview. It was found that agencies within the YWCA area have a history of using volunteers. Agencies not currently using volunteers were interested in using them. Consequently there was a need for volunteer services. The contacted agencies were in favor of a centralized recruitment pool. The areas of significant need were clerical, tutoring, and recreation. The type of volunteer that has succeeded in the past was said to have motivation, competence, commitment, rapport, and social  maturity. A program design was presented that described two alternatives: the all-inclusive approach and the focussed approach. The design further elaborated upon these alternatives. Special consideration was given to union and administrative volunteers. Three appendices are included as further amplification of the study, covering material obtained on community perceptions of needs, and both human and written resources useful in operating volunteer programs.

A 59-item &quot;Role Expectations Instrument&quot; was to give to 472 teachers in 11 conventional high schools, each having a mini-school associated with it, and in five independent alternative high schools. In addition, 11 principals of conventional high schools and five directors of independent alternative high schools completed a related questionnaire. The independent alternative schools had the youngest and most inexperienced staff with the least advanced academic educational credits. Mini-school staffs, on the other hand, greatly resembled the high school faculty group from which they had been derived. In conclusion, independent alternative school staffs, both  attitudinally and demographically, perceived themselves very differently from mini-school alternative staffs who had self-selected themselves from their older conventional high school parental organizations. On many dimensions, mini-school faculties showed greater positivity and greater statistically significant differences from regular high school staffs than did their independent alternative colleagues.

        "description":"The primary goal of this study was to evaluate two of the Upward Bound (UB) program's major objectives: (1) increasing the high school completion rate of its participants, and (2) increasing the rate of entry of its participants into postsecondary institutions. Evaluation of attainment of actual skills and motivation was a secondary goal of the study. Another secondary goal was to provide a detailed national description of the UB program. Major findings were as follows. The UB program participants did not exhibit an increased rate of high school completion. High school completion, however, was reasonably high for both the UB student sample and a comparison group of similar non-UB students. There was no apparent relationship between UB participation and improvement on measures of  academic performance. The UB program does appear to be increasing entry into postsecondary education. Rate of entry to postsecondary education was found to be positively related to length of participation in UB. About 76 percent of the UB students beginning postsecondary education entered four-year colleges and universities; about 17 percent entered two-year colleges; and the rest entered vocational, trade, or other schools.

By September 1973, enrollment had increased to 275. The school reflects major departures in educational attitudes, techniques and programs, with children being brought together from different educational, cultural, racial and ethnic backgrounds. One of the basic tenets followed at WIS is that chronological age is not the basic determiner of readiness for learning. Another implemented concept is that learning takes place best through active involvement, while greater interest in learning is stimulated through Inquiry and Discovery. Success is measured at WIS in terms of the children's excitement and enthusiasm for learning and their  progress toward self-direction and responsibility for their own learning. The make-up of the school is 50 percent Caucasian and 50 percent minority. The following educational practices characterize WIS: (1) Learning is individualized for each child. (2) Each child is given the opportunity to progress at rates, and through routes, best suited to his needs and abilities. (3) Each child is provided with opportunities and environments conducive to inquiry and discovery. (4) Each child has continuous contact with a number of adults in a variety of environments. Urban parents are responding well to the WIS approach as evidenced by large waiting lists. (Author/JM)",

The course is organized into six modules: Trends and Issues in Contemporary Education, Philosophical and Historical Foundations of Education, Administrative Structure and Financing of Public Education, Curriculum/Instruction, Students with Special Needs, and Legal Aspects of Public Education. Module One examines current writers and crucial questions in American education. Options for study within this module also include examination of these questions: What could evaluation be? Is education a profession? What's \"in\"? Whose values? How can we foster creativity? Module Two is an overview of the development of education in  the United States and how major schools of educational thought have affected it. Module Three examines patterns of organization and ways of financing the educational process. Module Four is an overview of organizational concepts in today's schools including alternatives to traditional schooling. Module Five is an opportunity to become acquainted with problems faced by students of various cultures and by students designated \"exceptional\" as they experience public schooling. Module Six is an introduction to crucial components of current North Carolina law about which all prospective teachers should be knowledgeable. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"The present paper is part of a long range research project in Developmental Kinesics. The gist of the project is empirical: the object is to find out what happens rather than look for anything in particular or test a hypothesis. The methodology for the analysis is ethological in approach. Empirical observations are carefully described. Subsequently, attempts are made to classify these observations according to the structure which emerges from the data, and to discern possible causes and effects. This specific paper presents the results of the sub-project dealing with Black Kinesics. Ten hours of live video tape were recorded. The subjects were 36 Black children, ranging from three to eighteen years of age. All children were healthy, of good intelligence, residents of Nashville,  Tennessee, and from three different social backgrounds: professional, skilled and unskilled labor. Subjects were told stories by an adult and were asked to retell the story to other subjects. Interactants were randomly mixed and grouped according to age, sex, sibling status, and socioeconomic status. Most subjects appeared in three situations--as hearer to adult speaker, as speaker to another child, and as hearer to a child. The story teller and all the children were Black, as were all the technicians on the television crew who did the taping. Observations made as a result of the project show that the child's non-verbal behavior follows a developmental curve depending on age and that there are striking differences in behavior according to sex.

They tended to agree most strongly that they were certain of their vocational goal, that there was at least one person in their department they could talk to regularly, that black students usually take longer to get their degrees than white students, that black faculty seem interested in black students, and that the racial climate on campus is generally tense. They tended to disagree most strongly with statements that students have ample opportunity to participate in policy making, that channels for expressing student complaints are readily available, that social  life for black students on campus is good, that most administrators act like they really care about students, and that there is good communication between black students and the administration. Students reported that what they like most about the University was the location (29 percent) and the quality of education (27 percent). They liked least the racism they encountered (23 percent), the bureaucracy and red tape (23 percent), and the lack of an intellectual atmosphere (14 percent). Forty-seven percent reported that there were no black faculty in their department. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Underlying this report on Asian Americans in Central Washington State is the concept that Asian Americans do have common problems, experiences and needs. An extension of this concept is that Asians should point out institutional racism when appropriate, and take their place as members of American society in the dual spirit of self-determination and cultural pluralism. Included in this report are statistics on Yakima Valley Asian Americans, a brief look at the historical process, and a special section headed &quot;Attitudes and Employment&quot;. This final section, divided into three topics, is the most important. The employment attitudes toward Yakima Valley Asians are examined in light of the jobs Asians presently occupy, the general employment picture in the Valley, and the area's&quot;Affirmative Action&quot; programs. The problem outlined in the final section requires the concern of Asian Americans and non-Asian Americans. Information was culled from government documents and research, area publications, and from people. Interviews were recorded with representatives of wide sectors of the social environment: city, county, and state government officials, private agencies, local newspapermen, produce middlemen, a minister, small farm workers, laborers, farmers, students, and community people. Asian American and non-Asian Americans, community leaders and community people were interviewed. (Author/JM)",

From testimony of participants during a three-day open meeting in Farmington and from extensive field investigation, the Advisory Committee has concluded that Native Americans in almost every area suffer from injustice and maltreatment. Recommendations are  addressed to local, county, State, and Federal agencies. They include: establishing a human relations committee in Farmington; developing a comprehensive alcohol abuse and alcoholism program; coordination between public and private health facilities to provide adequate services to Navajos; upgrading the community relations program of the Farmington Police Department; affirmative action by private and public employers; and compliance with the &quot;Indian Preference&quot; clause by private employers on the reservations.

The present report describes how NIE's research strategy dealt with Congress' instructions and also discusses the fundamental purposes of compensatory education programs and the manner in which NIE is assessing the  effectiveness of current programs and the consequences of possible changes. The research strategy according to which NIE is conducting its overall study consists of 35 projects organized into the four areas of funds allocation, compensatory services, student development, and administration. Findings from the NIE survey include the following: that in the 1975-76 school year, ESEA Title I represented 3% of total national expenditures and that 90% of the nation's school districts received Title I funds; that the services provided by Title I funds were quite diverse and varied with SES of the school district populations; that students in Title I districts appeared to be concentrated in grades 1-6; and that many students received instruction in more than one subject area--the average amount of  time spent in compensatory education being five and one-half hours per week.

The project will address three major problem areas: The need for work-oriented counselors, realistic and current occupational information, and the need for a more meaningful student-counselor ratio through which the student can be provided with the opportunity to obtain data to make meaningful occupational choices. The Board of Regional Community Colleges (Massachusetts) proposes to implement the concepts and methodology developed through Project Reach in a minimum of three community colleges.  At each of the colleges selected, the project will function in or in close relationship with the existing guidance and counseling offices. Initial and operational phases of the project are described, and a work plan schedule and target dates are outlined for a 12-month period.

Evaluation assessed observable curriculum changes, guidance services in response to the career development needs of all students, greater community involvement, and commitment to career education. While specific objectives were written in terms of elementary career awareness, junior high career orientation, senior high preparation, postsecondary liaison and improved career guidance, the overall plan was to provide leadership and resources for substantial philosophical and instructional changes in the schools. These goals have been achieved. Major curriculum  changes and a restructured guidance program has resulted from the project. The district has committed its operational funds to the support of many of the career education concepts. Professionals have been assigned responsibilities designed to insure that the changes achieved are long-lasting. Future directions should include monitoring of the sequential plan for career education, dissemination of the results, and teacher inservice education. (TA)",

Teachers of ABE were queried as to their (1) attitudes toward their jobs, (2) feelings about ABE teaching as a career, (3) perceived training needs, and (4) current teaching competencies. Data was gathered through a mailed survey in May of 1975. One hundred fifty-one teachers in local ABE programs responded to the survey representing 80% of the total population. A pilot test using the  assessment instrument was made and a test-retest measure demonstrated 99.8 reliability. Personal observations and interviews as well as content analysis by experts were used to rate the validity of the instrument. The report contains six chapters: (1) an introduction; (2) an examination of the literature related to employee attitudes and job satisfaction; (3) a description of the design of the study, methodology, the pilot study, and procedures; (4) a report of the data and analysis of the data; (5) interpretation of the results of the data, with a summary of the results; and (6) a discussion of the implications and recommendations of the study.

The position was taken that administrative roles derive from, and exist within, the total, generic complex of administration in any organization. This conceptualization led to the seven objectives of the study. Although data concerning all of the objectives are included in this report, the bulk of this document is concerned with objectives 1, 2, and 5, which are: (1) to describe and analyze administration in certain group practice forms of health care  delivery, (2) to identify basic differences that occur in administration under different payment plans and under different sizes of group practices, as well as other identified factors, and (5) to describe and analyze the potential future roles of administrators in the management of group practice forms of health care delivery. Chapter headings are Methodological Approach, The Study Participants (And Nonparticipants), Generic Administration in Medical Groups, The Roles (Professional Administrator, Medical Director, and Governing Body), Effects of Size and Payment Mechanism, The Future of Health Care, Future Roles, Summary of Results, Educational Implications, and Conclusions and Recommendations. The annotated data tables consisting of all the data compiled for this final report are  organized in a supplementary document. (HD)",

The review revealed that little is known about the educational and vocational needs of the returning adult. A second phase of the Adult Counseling Project involved (1) a survey of students enrolled in postsecondary vocational institutions ranging in age from 21 to over 50, and (2) a survey of those considering a return to school who also ranged in age from 21 to over 50. This survey involved administering a questionnaire to 650 students enrolled in three VTAE (Vocational, Technical, and Adult Education) schools in Wisconsin--Green Bay,  LaCrosse, and Milwaukee, and to 100 nonstudents in the communities. Both the literature review and the results of the survey suggest that adults returning to school have academic and guidance needs which are only gradually being recognized and met. In particular, effective career guidance and study skill programs need to be developed and implemented for older students, since the bulk of existing study skills programs and career guidance strategies appears to be geared to adolescents and very young adults.

        "description":"In an attempt to identify the discrepancy between work and training programs for a beginning accountant or bookkeeping worker, and thereby provide either verification of the current curriculum or needed direction for change, this study posed three questions. The procedures were divided into three areas to coincide with the three questions. To determine the job tasks performed by the beginning accounting and bookkeeping worker (question 1), a comprehensive search of the literature was made covering the 1968-1975 period. Sixty-four studies were identified. To determine the job tasks included in the conventional high school accounting and bookkeeping curriculum (question 2), the textbooks most commonly used in the curriculum were identified and analyzed. To determine the extent to  which the high school curriculum includes and prioritizes the job tasks of the beginning accounting and bookkeeping worker (question 3), rank correlation statistics and comparisons were applied to two lists, one representing job tasks performed by the worker, the other representing the curriculum. Two of the major findings were (1) no significant relationship was found when statistical applications were applied to the two lists grouped either by general accounting categories or by specific job tasks common to both lists and (2) 52% of textbook volume contained none of the job tasks taken from the list representing real work. The study is presented in chapter form: Chapter 1 presents general introductory material; chapters 2 through 4 each cover separately the three questions posed at the  beginning of the study; chapter 5 presents detailed conclusions and recommendations.

Each training plan, or occupation, identifies the target population. The format shows approximate time needed to learn the job skill, a list of learning activities, on-the-job training needed, in-school time needed, and spaces for evaluation  and for the individual study assignment. The training plans include assembly line worker, automobile-service-station attendant, bus boy, carpenter's helper, cook helper, dishwasher, general farm hand, general housekeeper, grocery cashier, laundry worker, lawnmower repairman, machinest helper, mail clerk, physical therapy aide, steam table server, and stock clerk.

Recommendations cover the areas of differentiation of workers, common base of knowledge, levels of knowledge, Associate Degree curriculum, the Baccalaureate curriculum, the graduate program, continuing education, accommodating the learners, transcending institutional boundaries, and transcending disciplinary boundaries. The conclusion points out that if the Nursing Curriculum Project as a whole has a single message, it is  that nursing must firmly reject its old image of simple dependency and substitute a true image of its complexity and dependability.

More than 300 persons actively involved in curriculum development in public education, business and industry, and government responded to a questionnaire based upon a list of 68 curriculum development activities in five categories: (1) Curriculum management and administration, (2) selection and organization of content, (3) selection and organization of materials, (4) design of instructional plan and alternative strategies, and (5) evaluation of curriculum. Ratings were given for the degree of problem/need encountered in the performance of each activity, and the relative importance of each to the respondent's job. In  addition, background data were obtained from each respondent. In analyzing the data, the importance and problem/need ratings provided by respondents were combined to produce a summary &quot;criticality&quot; score for each activity. For the respondent group taken as a whole, the most critical activities were found to be in the categories of curriculum management and administration, content selection and organization, and evaluation. Eight groups of related activities were also identified, with differing criticalities for curriculum developers in local, state, and national R &amp; D lab situations. (Author/HD)",

Some major findings from data on intern evaluations revealed that (1) the internship provided an educationally meaningful experience, (2) understanding of their field was enhanced through learning about job attitudes and expectations, and experience with new equipment, (3) personnel at the work sites were willing and able to provide needed assistance, and (4) time to accomplish the internship was difficult to find. Evaluations from employers were positive, indicating that the interns sought out activities and were satisfied by their performance as  professionals seeking to attain skills for later use in the classroom.

        "description":"This report describes a workshop designed and implemented as a team effort by teachers from the vocational education and special education departments at the University of Illinois and the University of Kansas. It is noted that activities at the workshop revolved around meeting the unique needs of ten university-state department teams in developing and/or expanding their programs. In addition to being useful to vocational and special educators interested in the personnel preparation process, this report is also designed for use by those individuals in local educational agencies who have the responsibility for staff development and inservice education. Part I describes the presentations and activities of the workshop, pre-workshop planning, and post-workshop followup. An  evaluation of each of these major phases is also included. Part II is a description and analysis of the professional tasks which were identified as critical for personnel involved in vocational programming for special needs students. The personnel preparation models prepared by the ten attending teams are included in Part III. A list of participants, bibliography, and 11 appendixes (relating to the workshop and special education) are included. (HD)",

        "description":"This paper discusses discrepancies between the observable labor market and the idealized world which is assumed in theory. The proposed solutions are focused on the development of an empirical model applicable to data on prime-age males from the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics, but the author notes that many of these issues are relevant for the construction of models for other groups. The discussion covers five basic areas: (1) The potential limitations of the simple labor supply model, based only on income-leisure tradeoffs, are discussed. (2) Sources of randomness in observed labor supply behavior and its consequences for the stimulation of systematic labor supply responses are considered, and the intertemporal variation are discussed. (3) The model is extended to  accommodate earnings opportunities other than a simple constant wage rate, with increasing marginal income tax rates and overtime premiums being the major factors considered. (4) Demand-related factors that prevent workers from achieving marginal equilibrium at their marginal wage rates are explored, and criteria are suggested for the selection of a sample of workers who are less seriously affected by these problems. (5) The treatment of time lost due to unemployment and illness is discussed in the context of a model developed by Samuel Rea, which is also applied to time spent commuting to work. (Author/HD)",

        "description":"Twelve different career education bilingual (Spanish-English) curriculum units were the results of a project designed to develop educational materials, for use in classrooms, which would simultaneously provide career information to the Spanish-speaking migrant student at the elementary level. Each Curriculum unit, containing three booklets, was developed at different levels of student reading ability--Level A (nonreader), Level B (beginning reader) and Level C (advanced reader), for a total of 36 different books (modules). Each book was designed as a self-contained learning module comprised of a teacher manual, two student activities, and a set of criterion referenced tests. These materials were field tested using a national advisory panel, and 78 teachers and 1,488 students from  seven states representing three major migrant streams--western, central, and eastern. The students were representative of the two main Spanish-speaking groups, Mexican-American and Puerto Rican. Results showed that the objectives of the project had been met and that the materials (1) are useful for interstate, intrastate, or settled out migrants, (2) are useful for non-migrant Spanish-speaking students, including those beyond the sixth grade, (3) can be infused by teachers into the traditional school curriculum, or by parents, resource teachers, and teacher aides in separate programs, i.e., summer school, (4) are useful over a wider geographical area due to their bilingual quality, and (5) have a demonstrable ability to help the student relate positively to his local school and home  environment.

        "description":"Differences between the earnings of men and women suggest that women are being paid less for doing the same job. Factors that attribute to the wage differences are (1) women are concentrated in those occupations which are less skilled and in which wages are relatively low, (2) women working on full-time schedules tend to work less overtime than men, (3) although women are as well educated as their male counterparts in terms of median years of schooling completed, there are differences in the kinds of education, training, and counseling they receive, which directs them into traditional and low-paying jobs, and (4) women on the average have fewer years of worklife experience than men. Studies have shown, however, that even after adjusting for some of these and other factors such as  age, region, and industrial concentration, much of the male-female earnings differential remains unexplained representing a maximum measure of discrimination. Discussion of wage differences is covered in the topics (1) Occupational Status, (2) Educational Attainment, (3) Work Experience, (4) Overtime Work, and (5) Differentials by Race. Eight tables, covering half the document, show different comparative aspects of male and female earnings. (WL)",

        "description":"Using certain criteria, 4 out of 35 voluntary and nongovernmental organizations in Bangladesh, which were engaged in nonformal education among economically disadvantaged women, were selected and surveyed to identify and document their nonformal activities. Data were generated through field visits, personal interviews, observations, and examination of institutional records and reports. Analysis of data revealed that although the organizations are not yet fully stabilized, interest and attitudes among the organizers as well as the participants are positive. Participants felt that they were being benefited through the programs while the organizations found that their objectives were being achieved. Both parties realized that there are alternatives to formal schooling to help solve  problems of distressed women. This report provides a complete description of the study in four chapters: Chapter 1 provides an overview of the women's organizational movement in Bangladesh, with reference to nonformal education programs; chapter 2 contains detailed case studies of 35 organizations that are involved in nonformal education; chapter 3 enumerates the general features of the case studies; and chapter 4 is a discussion on the trends of institutionalization of the programs. A bibliography and a list of exchange publications are appended. (WL)",

The methodologies presented, chosen after a review of the documents identified in the Inventory of Health Manpower Planning Activities of 1973 in the Bureau of Health Manpower, are considered practical with regard to the resources available to state and local health planners. This volume is a practical manual that describes the methodologies step-by-step, including questionnaire samples and selected tables for estimating health manpower supply and requirements. A list of tables and a  bibliography are also included. (Volume I provides the analytical perspective including definition of terms, discussion of concepts that underlie the methodological approach, and discussion of the uses and limitations of health manpower statistics within the context of the subject area.)

        "description":"With the overall objective of gathering information concerning employer's attitudes, perceptions, and opinions of Ohio's vocational education program, along with insights as to the strengths and weaknesses of the program and how it might be improved to more fully meet the needs of Ohio employers, mail questionnaires were sent to the personnel departments of 1,000 firms randomly selected from the &quot;Directory of Ohio Manufacturers.&quot; The sample included both employers who utilize and those who do not utilize vocational education graduates. The five basic types of question sets developed to provide the data base were attitude questions, attribute importance questions, employee rating questions, open-ended questions, and classification questions. After gathering the data, the  attitudinal statements, rankings of employee attributes, and ratings of vocational education and other graduates on each employee attribute were analyzed first for the total sample of 251 respondents and then for individual employer classification variables such as size of firm, percentage of employees who are vocational education graduates, and types of employees utilized. Results showed that attitudes toward and perceptions of vocational education were, in general, quite favorable. Percentages of agreement on some key statements were (1) about 60%--experience with vocational education graduates has been quite favorable, (2) 76%--vocational education students should be given more practical experience in their training, (3) 13%--vocational education students are poorly trained in school,  (4) 74%--vocational education needs to have an improved image, and (5) 73%--I would like to know more about this State's vocational education program. This report contains complete explanations of the objectives, research methodology, results, conclusions, and recommendations. (WL)",

Chapter 1 summarizes the total project and its objective to facilitate the effective use of training technology through the development of a model for matching training approaches or innovations with specific training settings. Chapter 2 summarizes the final phase in which researchers selected six different training efforts at three different schools of applied aerospace science and observed the work of Air Force training developers, closely interacting with them and discussing the nature and problems of the training development process. Chapter 3 describes revision of the previously developed model on the basis of this research. Chapter 4  presents suggestions for use of the model noting critical factors in a training setting and comparing the model (AFTEC) with the MODIA system. Chapter 5 (half of the guide) presents the model in its two phases: Phase I, intended to be used early in the process of planning and developing a training program, e.g., developing the lists of tasks and blocking out the major sections of the training course (Major headings are Objectives, Resources, Instructional Design and Management, Instructional Personnel, Student Characteristics, and Training Content), and Phase II, to be used in the actual development of the course when the detailed decisions are made concerning learning activities of the students: the preparation of a plan of instruction, study guides, workbooks, lesson plans, etc. (Major  headings are Instructional Personnel, Student Characteristics, and Training Content).

Consequently, a new program (involving seminars, field trips, individual and group counseling, and followup counseling) for the provision and dissemination of career information was designed which included eight specific objectives. To test the effectiveness of the program objectives, a research design was established which used one treatment group and six control groups (composed of Indian and non-Indian youth) matched according to grade, sex, age, I.Q., and achievement. Highlights  of significant findings are these: (1) There was increased awareness of services offered by the Colorado River Indian Tribes and of how school problems may be related to cultural factors, and a general impression that Indian students' attitudes toward school were much improved; (2) a significant reduction in school dropouts; (3) significant improvement in vocational awareness; (4) increased motivation toward future vocational opportunities; (5) reduced contacts with the law; (6) increased awareness of future employers; and (7) exposure to successfully employed Indians and Tribal members.

        "description":"Designed for health services planners and decisionmakers on the local level, this guide describes and explains a relatively low-cost short-term approach by which communities can estimate their needs for ambulatory health care services, determine the adequacy of resources to meet those needs, and understand major factors for improving ambulatory health care service delivery. The guide is one product of a demonstration study of ambulatory health care needs, resources, and priorities conducted in Boston, Massachusetts. Part One discusses the Boston study and briefly describes the basic approach presented in terms of its selection, limitations, and how it can be implemented. Part Two is a detailed description of the basic approach which involves a study comparing the actual use made  of ambulatory care visits against use which would be expected from national and prepaid plan utilization experience. Explanations are provided for each of the 17 steps involved in conducting the six phases of the study. Part Three addresses things to consider in conducting the study, such as sources of information, potential problems and how to deal with them, and cost. Five appendixes are included: Data Needs and Availability Summary Chart, Listing of Tables Included in the Boston Study, Sample of Parts of Tables Used to Determine Use of Medical Services in Boston, Sample Neighborhood Profile, and Sample Scheduling and Staffing Needs and Cost Worksheet.

Methodology involved gathering, compiling, and analyzing data from Federal report forms, and from interviews and information gathered from the appropriate State departments. Some of the major goals accomplished by the study were the identification of the clientele and the degree to which they are served by vocational education and placed on jobs in each State; the determination of expenditures for vocational  education and the sources of these funds; the identification of State and local structures that accomplish the delivery of vocational education in each State; and the determination of programs and procedures for vocational education personnel development and ways in which vocational education is reaching those in need. Fourteen council recommendations precede the description and discussion of the study, which is presented in six chapters: (1) Background of the Study, (2) Vocational Education Student Enrollments and Placement--Follow-up Activities, (3) Funding For Vocational Education in the Midwest, (4) State and Local Structures Effecting Vocational Education Delivery, (5) Career Education, and (6) Teachers, Teacher Education, and Certification.

(The eight institutions are Camp Hill, Dallas, Graterford, Greensburg, Huntingdon, Muncy, Pittsburgh, and Rockview.) After analyzing data collected from two forms (Educational Evaluation Form and the Training Survey) completed by the subjects, it was generally concluded that the lack of resource materials and some supportive  services (i.e. limited library materials and counseling services) is a problem. However, offenders have positive values and attitudes toward the education programs in terms of entering, opportunity, benefits, and self-reliance. The document presents 18 specific conclusions and discusses four institutional recommendations. Twenty-four tables supplement the discussion of the study, and brief descriptions of each institution's educational program are also provided. (WL)",

Evaluation of the career education program in tenth grade social studies and language arts courses was carried out through a subjective student rating and an objective analysis of Career Maturity Inventory (CMI) scores. Analysis of the student evaluations include the following: (1) Students perceived that their teachers discussed careers principally in the language arts and social studies classes, and (2) students perceived an active involvement and support of career education on the part of teachers, counselors, and through school programing. Analysis of CMI data shows evidence in support of a positive effect of the career education program on tenth grade  students' career maturity. As a result of the first year's success, the following is planned: Social studies classes will be used exclusively for the program to accomplish greater classroom consistency. Counselors will be involved in classroom activities for all high school grades, integrating the counselor's activities more fully in the curricular program of the schools. These activities will relate curriculum to general career choices, develop an understanding of students' personal characteristics and values, and focus on individual career choices. A career record file will be maintained for each student in grades 7-12 including career goals, career plans, skills needed to learn, and jobs held. (TA)",

The operational plan included four systems: (1) Academic mainstream system, designed to assist in the development of separate programs within the colleges and departments, (2) support system, to aid the mainstream effort by providing auxillary services and materials, (3) outreach system, to promote a school-community bond, and (4) management system, to coordinate program efforts. The first-year evaluation effort focused on two areas. The first is a description of the actual operation of the project with emphasis given to the project director and three mainstream areas. The second area is baseline data for faculty and  students. Faculty attitude toward career development could improve, as indicated by baseline data which reports positive responses from 35% of the total faculty (700). Student baseline data indicate that students feel they need career information and career development, yet most do not know where to seek assistance. Action suggested includes sending career information materials to selected classes at the freshman and sophomore level, in addition to having faculty members discuss career implications of their areas. Future effects of the project should be revealed through changes in the data. Appendixes include letters and survey instruments used in the study. (TA)",

In \"Setting the Record Straight: A Reply to Grubb and Lazerson,\" discussion centers around what the author considers major errors in Grubb and Lazerson's \"Harvard Educational Review\" article on career education. \"Obstacles and Opportunities in Career Education\" identifies and comments on five major obstacles facing the implementation of career education and offers alternative solutions for overcoming these obstacles. \"Next Steps for Career Education\" comments on solidifying the career education concept at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels.

The first paper, \"Career Education for Minority and Low-Income Persons,\" states that for this segment of the population, career education has been a matter of over-promise and under-delivery. Promises and problems are discussed in three categories: (1) Conceptual assumptions of career education, (2) process assumptions of career development, and (3) programmatic assumptions of career education. The second paper, \"Career Education for Gifted and Talented Persons,\" discusses some of the special problems involved in developing career education programs for gifted and talented  students, such as career decisionmaking, the development of talent, and work experience. In the third paper, \"Career Education and the Handicapped Person,\" statistical predictions concerning underemployment and unemployment of handicapped high school graduates during the next four years are cited to emphasize the need for making career education opportunities available. Stressed as particularly relevant for the handicapped are basic career education principles such as the right to choose from a wide range of personally meaningful work opportunities and emphasis on accomplishments and discovery of an individual's talents rather than his limitations.

        "description":"Many economists have tried to explain existing wage differentials between men and women. A new approach compares the relative importance of occupational discrimination with that of wage discrimination. This model allows for variation both in occupational distribution and in wages resulting from differences in job qualifications and productivity indicators. It was demonstrated that the usual approach to wage discrimination is a special case of this general model with some restrictive implicit assumptions. A multinomial logit model was used to stimulate the occupational distribution of women that would exist if they faced the same structure of occupational determination as men. Results indicate that there would be more women in managerial and skilled labor jobs and fewer women  clerical and service workers. Wages were then estimated as a function of productivity measures for men and women in each occupation so that the components of the wage differential could be calculated. Results indicate that almost the entire differential could be eliminated by ending both forms of discrimination, with occupational discrimination accounting for one-third to one-half of the differential and pure wage discrimination the remainder.

        "description":"Since research on sex differences in occupational attainment suggests that working men and women attain essentially the same mean level of occupational attainment and do so through quite similar processes, the censoring problem as a potential source of bias in estimating equations for these comparative occupational attainments is investigated. (The censoring problem is defined as a sampling problem in that the sample of working women contains an overrepresentation of successful women, since women who can afford not to work will stay out of the labor force unless they find a job commensurate with their education.) After reviewing and rejecting some alternatives that could correct this problem, a model (developed from an extension of Heckman's set of equations that relate to  women's occupational characteristics) is presented for obtaining the structural parameters for the whole female population by accounting for the censoring problem. The censoring problem was found to be minimal and not a reasonable explanation for the apparent similarities between men and women in the process of occupational attainment. It was concluded that before accepting the finding of sexual equality in occupational rewards, the following possibilities should be explored: (1) That the model is misspecified and if certain variables (for example, the status of first job) were included, the process of occupational attainment for the sexes would differ, and (2) that certain dimensions of sexual inequality in occupational rewards are not being tapped by the concept, occupational status.

A benefit-cost analysis of the Pittsburgh Plan is presented. The significance of the results and its shortcomings are discussed and parametric variations on all significant parameters are performed to test its sensitivity. On the macro or program level, descriptive analyses are presented and alternate program structures derived. Analyses of the historical costs involved in all phases of the Pittsburgh Plan are performed and reported from different perspectives. On the micro level, attention is focused on the individual being served by  this program. Multivariate statistical tools are used in analyzing such characteristics as seen to govern or indicate individual success. Based upon the results of analyses on both the individual level and the program level, alternate program structures and program content are explored. In order to permit easier and more explicit investigation of the ramifications of alternate program policies, structures, and content, two simple linear programing models are developed and their range of applicability demonstrated. A &quot;weighted sum of benefit-cost ratios&quot; criterion is used as another means of selecting alternate program recruitment and selection policies. (Author/WL)",

The teachers is seen as a catalyst and facilitator, promoting self discovery and interaction, and enlarging the child's horizon with alternatives. Developing Understanding of Self and Others (DUSO), an educational program developed by the author, is described. It focuses on helping the child become goal-and process-oriented via eight developmental tasks. These tasks focus on self-understanding,  awareness of self and others, and resultant purposeful motivational involvement in the tasks of life. The author insists that the adequate personality will not emerge by chance, but by design, and therefore emotional development needs must be noted in establishing educational priorities. (KS)",

The sample of 8 schools was chosen from 18 elementary schools in Southern California. These schools had been rated on the degree to which they developed a goal-attaining process, referred to as Dialogue, Decision-Making, and Action. All teachers and principals were administered the Differential Values Inventory. Thirty  families, chosen at random in each school, were also sent a copy of the questionnaire. Two-tailed t-tests and the Mann-Whitney U Test were utilized to test the null hypotheses. Two of the major findings were as follows: (1) teachers, principals, and parents were shown to have significantly different values; however, while parents had the most traditional values, teachers had more traditional values than principals; and (2) no significant differences were found in value congruency among teachers, principals, and parents for the two types of schools.

The study is divided into two parts: a descriptive section which presents the data to be analyzed and the classical regression techniques to be used, and the analytic section which compares a principal component regression approach to an a priori grouping of predictors. The results indicate that socioeconomic factors are more important than school or teacher considerations in influencing student performance. The study also suggests that the energy of a young teaching staff is important in improving student attitudes toward schooling. With regard to retention of teachers, results suggest that teachers born in the area served by the  district are more likely to stay with a district over a period of time.

It is hypothesized that it is possible to identify development in a field along the lines of productivity of research, development of accretive studies, changes in research treatment, and changes in the boundary of the field. Based on these criteria, 161 papers were analyzed. Results indicate that there has been an increase in marriage counseling research which, however, has not been accompanied by increased scientific sophistication in terms of growth by accretion or by greater rigor in research treatment. The author feels these findings might be interpreted as being due to the  immaturity of the field or to basic differences between this field and general science. (Author/MPJ)",

This study investigated the applicability of Holland's theory to women employed full-time. The relationship of the criterion variables of achievement (salary) and job satisfaction to the predictor variables of homogeneity, consistency, congruency and role choice were investigated. A stratified sample of 348 women employed as factory workers, research scientists, teachers, bank employees, managers and supervisors, and commercial artists, interior decorators, writers represented Holland's six occupational types. An inverse relationship existed between homogeneity and salaries for Social and Artistic sub-groups. No relationship existed between homogeneity and salaries  for the Total group or the Realistic, Investigative, Conventional, and Enterprising sub-groups. Moderately satisfied women in the Total group had significantly higher homogeneity scores than either the satisfied or dissatisfied women in the Total group. No significant difference was apparent between satisfaction and homogeneity when the group was divided into sub-groups. (Author)",

Validation of instrumentation to evaluate the attainment of cognitive behavioral objectives was an essential first step in a state-wide educational needs assessment study conducted by the investigators. A total of 3,365 behavioral objectives in 23 cognitive subjects were selected or developed by academic specialists and authorities. Attainment was assessed by the state mandated testing program utilizing nationally standardized tests. The tests were administered to a sample of 20,000 pupils in grades four, seven and eleven within Virginia schools. The assessment of the test's content validities was accomplished by inspectional analyses which  compared test items with selected behavioral objectives. The findings are described in light of the limitations of using nationally standardized tests to measure local performance outcomes.

They have little concrete information about the requirements of the work world and are unmotivated to seek out such information. Because adequate information is the basis of sound decision-making, it is important that counselors take active steps to motivate girls and women to gather information. Berlygn's theory of motivation to seek information can be used by counselors as a guideline for developing intervention strategies. The author concludes that steps be taken to increase girls and women's uncertainity about their futures which will lead to active information seeking behavior. After motivation has been developed, the counselor can teach the decision-making process. (Author)",

The study examined five independent groups in a bi-directional control group design. Volunteer migraine sufferers served as subjects, each participating for 12 weeks. The first four weeks of the study were used to collect physiological baselines and headache symptom and personality data. During the remaining eight weeks two groups attempted to learn hand warming at home by listening daily to an autogenic cassette. Similarly, two groups attempted to learn hand cooling, while the fifth group continued only to keep the headache diary and visit the laboratory. Migraine frequency, intensity and duration all decreased significantly over the  course of the study, but these decreases were not related to physiological control, which the subjects did not exhibit. The amount of headache reduction (1/3) was equal to the characteristic benefits of placebo drug treatment. Relaxation training and biofeedback are probably more effective placebos for the treatment of migraine than experimenter attention and headache record keeping. (Author)",

Trainees were predominantly females. Findings indicated that longer training was related to higher levels of satisfaction with supervisors, indicating effectiveness of praise/reinforcement by dentists working with them. Promotions were cited as affecting satisfaction and leading to longer job tenure. Short-term training was associated with inability to evaluate performance of self. (Author/SBP)",

Statistical treatment of the data indicates a positive and significant relationship between life satisfaction and leisure satisfaction, and some positive but not significant relationship between life satisfaction and health satisfaction. Satisfaction with use of leisure time is found to be the best predictor of life satisfaction, followed by self-rated health and health satisfaction, the latter supporting the findings of earlier research. Gender differences are suggested indicating that leisure time satisfaction is  more important to life satisfaction among females than among males. (Author/SBP)",

Some specific research is cited to support the major thesis that faculty and staff do not influence students in affective areas. The hypothesis that colleges can fulfill their stated objectives only by taking advantage of affective opportunities and by overtly influencing the values of students, a hitherto heretical position from the student personnel point of view, is developed. That we must continuously avail ourselves of \"teaching moments\" to reach students and to have a positive impact upon their values to counter the negative impact of today's \"value-less\" college student society is considered. That the future of student services will witness its demise is postulated. The current perception of the  profession is confronted by the notion that changed working relations will necessitate the abolition of long-term careers and the introduction of caretaker administrators who are ad-hoc generalists as replacements. The final major hypothesis holds that personnel within the field can do nothing to alter the negative impacts of reorganization, reallocation of resources, collective bargaining and harsh budget realities.

Several conclusions that express a full sense of the Commission sessions and where there is a concensus are as follows: In the year 2000, fraternities will generally be strong and vital; able to adapt themselves effectively to major changes in both higher education and in American society at large; continue to maintain some definite relationship with academic institutions; continue to affirm their essential principles and traditions; continue to be self-governing groups; center their  activities in some physical locus at an institution but not necessarily a chapter house; continue to attract superior and outstanding persons; increasingly receive support through the involvement of their alumni; continue to provide important experiences in leadership training; continue to serve as important agencies for personal development; strengthen their identities as communities of shared values; continue their commitment to the ethnic of service; gradually become more diverse and heterogeneous in their memberships; continue to base their existence on the lessons of their rituals.

Following a review of existing research and literature and a critical discussion of the state of knowledge in this area, the report presents implications for policy and modes to implement needed changes. The primary focus is vocational guidance and counseling. Personal-social counseling and mental health are examined briefly. Six issues are identified to reflect the areas of inquiry vital to sex discrimination in guidance and counseling: (1) socialization reflects the sex-role biases of the surrounding society; (2) the counselor training field reflects the biases and sex-role stereotypes of the larger society; (3) counselor trainers and training rationales may reinforce  existing biases or produce attitudes and values that interfere with equitable counseling practices; (4) tests (personality, interest) and other source materials used to assess clients and assist them with their educational, vocational, and personal decisions reflect sex-role biases; (5) negative outcomes of counseling are reflected in students' educational and career decisions which indicate acceptance of sex-role stereotypes; and (6) existing counseling programs can be freed of sex biases through implementing new approaches in counselor training and procedures. The report presents implications and recommendations in the areas of socialization, self concept and sex-role attitudes, counselor training and characteristics, materials and theories, nontraditional counseling, and research and  legislative recommendations.

Evidence suggests that the impact of Project MARC is significant in that it emphasizes early intervention and a sequential, developmental reading approach; it provides a viable alternative program for rural or low-socioeconomic, low-achieving students for whom commercial materials might not be suitable; it meets the critical need for reading achievement; and  it is capable of teaching skills during the school year which are maintained over the summer months.

Level of attention can be associated with ability to ignore unrelated stimuli, interest in the reading material, perceptual problems, and the sex of the reader. It is suggested that sex differences in attending behavior may be a result of the content of reading materials in the primary grades; that is, girls' higher performance is due to their greater interest in what is usually female-oriented subject matter. Teachers should therefore take care to provide material which interests both sexes and should encourage reading tasks which necessitate active attention. They should utilize a multisensory approach when appropriate, teach  attending skills prior to formal reading instruction, and become aware of possible distracting influences and perceptual problems.

In addition, high correlations exist between test scores in reading and listening. Stages in the development of a model language-arts curriculum designed to teach critical thinking by developing listening and reading skills would include the identification and selection of mental processes believed to be most useful and most capable of being  approached through language, the translation of these processes into reading and listening skills, and the assembling of a collection of teaching strategies.

The data show that, in mastering reading skills, pupils are helped by a &quot;wide&quot; teaching method--flexible teaching aimed at high-level objectives such as reasoning, understanding, imagination, and expression. The research shows that teachers who have used a certain method for several years obtain better results in the second year of primary school than do teachers with less experience and that it is beneficial for the teacher to work with the same pupils in the first and second years. In addition, it is suggested that the reading be constructed on the basis of the child's oral language, since oral language comes  chronologically and psychologically before written language. The report concludes that the teaching of reading cannot be reduced to one method but must consist of a series of principles which allow each teacher to follow a coherent line of teaching.

Subjects were three groups of 16 pupils who were participating in a reading-center tutorial program. During the two-month instructional period, half of the students were given behavioral objectives and half were not. For the post-instruction assessment, two tasks were developed for each pupil. On one task, the pupil was informed of the specific behavioral objective; on the other, similar task, no information about objectives was given. Results indicated that pupils who had been informed of behavioral objectives during the two-month period prior to assessment performed at a high level on both tasks, whereas those who had not been previously informed of behavioral objectives did less  well on the tasks for which no objective was given. This was interpreted as supporting the assumption that information about behavioral objectives increases pupils' performance. (AA)",

Instead of assuming the quasi-administrative role which is traditional, the consultant should be made a special administrator with power equal to that of the building prinicpal; he or she should fully understand the forces operating within the school environment. A broad knowledge of both reading methodology and theories of administration is recommended. In addition, the consultant should assume a helpful stance, to facilitate the clients' progress toward mutually established goals. (Author/KS)",

Various tasks were used in the experiments, including discrimination of line orientations, checking letters in three-letter words against a fourth letter, discrimination of letter pairs occurring in various contexts, auditory-visual integration, and letter matching and word-to-picture matching under different cueing conditions. Results in general indicated that differences between good and poor readers at these grades lie in the reaction times required to perform the discriminations, and sometimes the patterns across various tasks, rather than in error  rates. It was hypothesized that proficient processing reaches an asymptotically equal reaction time for simple, well-rehearsed discriminations, but that poor readers even by third grade have not reached this level.

Results from statewide telephone surveys in Mississippi and North Carolina indicated that significantly fewer blacks than whites watched public television. However, most of the differences disappeared when education was held constant. A similar survey in predominantly black areas of Columbus, Ohio, found that viewing was heavier among blacks than among whites. The saturation of black households by television was considered a possible explanation for the high level of use of public television among blacks in that study.

Table I indicates levels of reading difficulty for editions of the story according to Fry's readability technique. Table II presents a linguistic analysis of 16 of the 27 versions of the folktale. This analysis reveals that, from 1697 to 1974, sentences have become shorter, the use of complex and complex-compound sentences has decreased, and simple sentences have become more usual. Moreover, it suggests that the level of literary sophistication--evidenced by use  of subplots, interior monologue, multiple morals, and imagery--has declined since the 1856 version. It further suggests that children be exposed to more and different kinds of literature during their formative years. (LL)",

The doctorate is now the modal degree in the field, although emphasis continues to be placed on the professional experience of the teacher, with newspaper experience the norm. Teaching specialties tend to follow professional lines, but there is an apparent interest in such teaching specialties as mass communication and society, theory and methodology, and history.

Observations are given for each student, in eight stages of the composing process: prewriting, planning, starting, following a program of style, reformulating, stopping, contemplating, and composing silently. Findings showed that these students do no planning, find starting easy--especially with personal narratives, show preoccupation with technical matters at the expense of content, are syntactically immature writers, omit words and phrases, and do not revise. The author concludes that since students perceive teachers to be editors and proofreaders only and view writing as a joyless chore, teachers need to become coaches and empathetic listeners who provide  students with opportunities for pleasurable writing experiences.

In an attempt to determine whether individuals are affected by the awareness that they are being televised, this study, while maintaining experimental control, simulated some of the pressures placed on witnesses in a courtroom setting. Subjects, 36 volunteers enrolled in a media-and-society class at the University of Wisconsin, were shown a brief film and then were asked specific questions about the content of the film. While answering these questions, some subjects faced a conspicuous television camera which was purported to be recording their answers for viewing by a large number of people, some faced an  unobtrusive camera hidden behind a mirror, and some faced no camera at all. The subjects' answers were recorded and the content analyzed. No significant differences were found between the verbal behavior of respondents who faced a hidden television camera and the behavior of those who did not face a camera. However, those who faced the obtrusive camera talked longer, used more words, paused less, and included more information in their answers. There were no differences in the amount of incorrect information in the answers. (LL)",

        "author":["Avery, Robert K."],
        "description":"A three-part petition was filed in December 1974 with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which presented the first serious threat to public broadcasters' exemption from the FCC's multiple-ownership rules. The petition requested a revision of the rules that permit multiple ownership of noncommercial educational stations within a single market and a &quot;freeze&quot; on all applications for reserved educational channels made by government-owned and controlled groups and by religious schools and institutes. This paper traces the evaluation of the FCC's multiple-ownership rules and the issues surrounding the application of these rules to public broadcasting. The paper concludes that, since the FCC decided to allow public broadcasters to continue to receive preferential treatment  through the duopoly exemption, and if this exemption is vital to the future development of public telecommunications, it is time to explore the maximum use of existing second channels.

The paper concludes that, in exploring the functional development of children's communicative abilities, the communication-based model should be used to examine the stages through which children move to communicate  both material needs and affective needs.

A brief review of recent research suggests that the concept of agenda setting may be usefully superimposed on the Westley-MacLean model to reveal partial answers to some of these important questions and to suggest some implications. Some consequents and some determinants of agenda setting have been revealed, while additional investigations are needed. The paper reports an instance which emphasizes both the implications of the agenda-setting concept and the fact that the low priority assigned by media to routine electoral matters will affect the salience of these matters for consumers of media reports. This instance  also offers evidence that political news is currently emphasized less by the media than in previous years. (Author/JM)",

Differentiating this undergraduate program from others in communication is the fact that its approach to communication skills training involves both writing and speaking, as well as graphics. Moreover, communication must be coupled with another applied field where the graduate may acquire basic skills for job entry into business, industry, or public service organizations. The application of competencies in communication is therefore seen within the context of scientific and technical fields. To accomplish this practical orientation, a cooperative education or internship program has been developed. As a result of this  program, the faculty has become more involved in ongoing communication programs outside the university, and, subsequently, the department's approach to communication teaching and research has become more vital, practical, and problem oriented, with an emphasis on &quot;applied communication.&quot; (LL)",

Learning to use communication skills can be a values-clarifying process in itself and can occur in speech areas viewed as primarily cognitive: argumentation, persuasion, discussion, and so on. In addition, teachers must be able to apply effective interpersonal skills to their own teaching and to recognize that many of these skills will be for listening, responding, and questioning, as well as for informing. Finally, student evaluation can be approached using the principles of personal growth and can range from brief feedback to a complex set of criterion-referenced assignments or contracts.

The activities of NCCB under Chairman Thomas P. Hoving are described. In 1968 Hoving charged that the commercial television networks and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company were in collusion to dominate technical facilities for the coast-to-coast relay of video \"trivia.\" As a result of Hoving's attacks on commercial broadcasters, several members of the committee and of the board of trustees resigned. In 1970 Hoving  resigned and, amidst much controversy, the NCCB began to reorganize. In 1974 Nicholas Johnson became chairman and chief executive officer of the organization. At this time, the NCCB began to publish a magazine entitled \"access\" in an attempt to encourage a sense of common purpose to those involved in the citizens media-reform movement. (LL)",

The observation system which was designed attempts to account for all factors of a communication situation and to outline detailed functions of verbal behavior. Five primary functional categories were developed and three levels of functional analysis were employed. The system was used to observe ten hours of naturally occurring communications in the classroom. From these observations, five communication situations were selected and described in detail. The most important finding of the study was that this system of observation produced rich and  relevant data with regard to communication interactions. Teacher/student interactions proved to be quite different from peer interactions. A functional system does not need to assume that an utterance serves only one function or works at only one system level. Furthermore, a functional system can account for culturally defined realizations of utterances. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"In order to determine the status of speech and drama education in Illinois secondary schools, a detailed questionnaire was mailed to each Illinois high school during the 1973-1974 school year. This study analyzes the responses to that questionnaire, which asked basic research questions concerning the extent of the speech/drama curriculum, the nature of cocurricular activities, the role of the teacher, and the facilities and equipment available for use in speech/drama education. Results showed a great variation in speech/drama education which, in many cases, seems dependent upon the geographic location of the school, the student enrollment, and the kind of school--public or private. This document discusses specific data for each category of the questionnaire and contains a table  showing the breakdown of respondents and nonrespondents, a bibliography, the questionnaire and accompanying letter, and a map of Illinois with regions indicated.

In humanized organizations, members are treated justly, are engaged in meaningful work, encouraged to develop their potential, and are treated as ends rather than as means. That these ideals have rarely been achieved is in large part the result of the role that power plays, especially in private economic organizations. The author proposes four postulates that relate to power and its exercise within organizations and that indicate why humanization is a yet-to-be-realized goal. First, organizations are composed of coalitions competing with each other for resources and influence. Second, coalitions, particularly the dominant ones,  seek to protect their interests and power by affecting environmental factors. Third, the unequal distribution of power itself has nonhumanizing effects on both the powerful and the unpowerful. And finally, the exercise of power within organizations is one crucial aspect of the exercise of power within the larger social system. (Author/DS)",

The study deals with the analytical phase of the design problem, relates the initial analysis to the specific laboratory design problem, and applies it to two design situations. A multiscience laboratory design for Ceylon includes a storage unit, but no fixed services are needed or provided. The transport of equipment between the storage unit and the work stations is facilitated by the use of mobile service  units that can be attached to the work tables in different positions. An integrated science laboratory design for Malaysia provides fixed services installed in fixed units, but with movable oak tables. (Author/MLF)",

Population, housing, social, demographic, and economic information by school district was available. This large, comprehensive, and consistent data base permitted investigation of the choices of the electorate with respect to school taxes and formulation of a better understanding of the reality behind the notion of taxpayer revolt. School districts that pass and fail tax elections have very similar characteristics; only a few variables were significantly different. Most important, the proposed tax, the existing tax, and tax change were all smaller in the passing districts. Taxpayer revolt--that is, a shift in observed behavioral patterns against the paying of  higher taxes--was investigated for the years 1966-72. During this period, no evidence turned up that was consistent with the notion of revolt; voter behavior did not shift over this period. However, after taking higher taxes into account, underlying behavioral patterns were shown to have shifted between the 1950s and 1960s. (Author/IRT)",

Superintendents, principals, and teachers in 188 schools from 34 districts filled out questionnaires and were interviewed about organizational patterns at their respective levels. A number of classrooms were also observed, and third-grade students completed questionnaires. Separate  chapters analyze the effects of organizational features on classroom complexity, the connection between classroom staffing patterns and instructional technology, the weak links among different organizational levels, the relationship between organizational patterns and teacher satisfaction, and the effect of the organization on children's satisfaction with school.

Although much of the information in this book applies to all public employee collective bargaining, the author chooses to focus on teachers' unions and their interaction with the negotiating team of the school board. Metzler describes the bargaining process, focusing on negotiating teams, bargaining techniques, communication during bargaining, and negotiability. The book also includes chapters on grievance procedures, mediation, strikes, arbitration, and fact-finding. A specific analysis of New Jersey labor legislation governing public employee bargaining is  appended, along with the text of the New Jersey Employer-Employee Relations Act and relevant court cases. A glossary of collective bargaining terms is also included. (DS)",

The books also compel one to look at the management of aggression and its corollary, the management of dependency. Empirical, simplistic, circumscribed cross-sectional methods are not likely to lead to a comprehensive understanding of the leadership function. Nor are they likely to help understand and predict leadership behavior or offer a valid body of knowledge for the consultative guidance of persons in leadership roles. A series of longitudinal studies of leaders or top level executives is needed. We should have comprehensive personal data and clinical evaluation to begin with. We should delineate a range of environmental, organizational, interpersonal, and behavioral variables that  can be sampled at defined intervals and in times of crisis. A consortium of psychologists working in different parts of the country, even the world, using the same design and instruments, could assemble systematic behavioral data from which we could then more adequately come to understand the interactional phenomena that govern the multiple expressions of aggression that constitute the fundamentals of the leadership role.

The paper discusses the role of internal and external elements that affect organizational effectiveness and the role of constituencies in establishing constraints, goals, and referents.

The six steps are proposal development, executive recommendation (performed by the superintendent), legislative action (by the school board), supplementary change, implementation, and review. The six potential participants in this process are the school board, the superintendent, the central administrative staff, other professionals (teachers, principals), the public, and other governmental units. In practice, educational governance is not conducted according to either traditional democratic theory or according to a democratic model of administrative representation. Instead, the executive (the superintendent and his or her professional staff) carries the most weight in  educational decision-making. In all six policy formation steps, administrators dominate the school board, which frequently looks to the superintendent for advice and information that it cannot assemble by itself. For example, the superintendent usually sets the agenda and defines the issues that the board will consider. Citizen participation in school district governance is, therefore, even further restricted, since direct input from the public is already minimal.

For example, to judge school boards according to traditional political concepts of responsiveness and representativeness is to ignore the insular nature of most boards of education, as well as to fail to take into account the at least partially successful attempts of the reformers to remove the schools from the influence of \"politics.\" Systems theory has been applied to educational management with little substantive results, since systems theory offers no propositions that can be empirically tested. Although educational governance did not in the past receive the kind of attention it deserved from researchers, this area is a fruitful area of investigation,  especially as the demands of technology increasingly strain the traditional notions of democratic governance in education.

This production function constitutes the supply side of jobs. The demand side is derived from utility functions that contain one parameter indicating the quality of the individual, here represented by his level of education. In addition the utility function contains a variable indicating the type of job taken. A  distinction is made between primary labor income and secondary income, that is, income after direct taxes. The model is based on a few more assumptions replacing lacking information. The model is tested with the aid of figures collected for the Netherlands around 1960-66. (Author/MLF)",

The public sector will increase in scope and size and operate as the established educational system. The private sector will decrease in size, be more distinctive and less influenced by prevailing public school standards, and be less church related. Cooperation between the two systems will stem largely from specific legislation that calls for formal cooperation. Dual enrollment and other forms of sharing will not increase. Project cooperation will continue in areas related to social concerns and educational technology. The most dramatic increases in public-private cooperation in education will take place in the area of special  education. Experimental approaches that attempt to offer alternatives, such as the voucher system, have little prospect of widespread success. Finally, despite busing and court ordered desegregation, the differentiation in public education based on social class will continue as an important factor in maintaining influential support for public education.

Given the course of the last two decades, James Conant's optimistic predictions that the educational system could be all things to all people seems naive. Schools are the focal points--the places where national social concerns and policies are acted out. The result has been that while the school was used as a stage to play out great conflicts deriving from the culture, little attention has been given to educational issues. Educators have continued to operate much as they always  have. The author does not expect the educational system to change much in the immediate future, and he anticipates that schools will continue to reflect cultural concerns. (DS)",

Matrix organization puts the personnel and the resources where they are needed to get the job done. This management efficiency is brought about by dividing all organizational activities into two areas: (1) input or maintenance services are dubbed &quot;functions,&quot; that is, research, marketing, legal services, program development, evaluation, financial, and (2) output or product results that come directly from &quot;program management,&quot; that is, the personnel and resources on the &quot;line&quot; that actually do the needed job for the client--the student. Functions tend to be &quot;staff&quot; responsibilities; project management or matrix modes tend to be &quot;line&quot; or production  responsibilities. Matrix organizational theory focuses management's attention on productivity rather than on institutional maintenance. This paper proposes an analysis of how existing practices judged effective in the New Jersey Department of Education can be maintained or expanded, and how those management practices judged less than effective may be changed or discontinued.

Based on his analysis, the author concludes that the type of supplementary Jewish education received by over 80 percent of those Jews who have received any form of Jewish education has not had any lasting impact on their adult religious involvement. Statistical analysis showed that the relationship between Jewish schooling and adult religious involvement is not wholly linear. Schooling exhibits threshold, plateau, and ceiling effects; it begins to have an impact at 2,000 hours, reaches a plateau between 3,000 and 4,000 hours, and obtains a maximum effect at 10,000 hours  when reinforced by other agents of religious socialization.

It compares data on the impact of Jewish schooling on adult religiosity with similar data from a study of Catholic schooling. Like previous studies on other types of schools, the main effect of Jewish schooling seems to be an accentuation of parental influences. This effect is diminished substantially if not supported by marriage to a religious spouse. However, on some types of religiosity, extensive Jewish schooling produces \"conversion\" effects, which persist even when preschool and postschool support are lacking. The implications of these findings are discussed. (Author)",

Two sets of 12 criteria were developed, based on the responses, to distinguish adequate and substandard school plants. City systems had more adequate plants than county systems. Secondary and middle schools had more adequate plants than elementary schools. Categorized by size, organizational level, and type of system, medium-sized middle schools in city systems had the largest percentage of adequate plants. Using national enrollment standards, more than one-fourth of all Tennessee schools were too small to permit efficient operation, and one-third contained too many students. Recommendations included consolidation of some of the state's one-, two-, and  three-teacher schools and subdivision of some of the largest schools. New construction to alleviate overcrowding and improved building maintenance were priority needs identified by principals. (Author/MLF)",

        "description":"This handbook is concerned with one specialized form of participation: participatory planning. It is based on several years of experience in participatory planning and is infused with the bias that sees a great deal of potential good in expanded participation in general and in participatory planning in particular. It is also recognized that participatory planning is difficult, time-consuming, and requires skills and methods that may not be present at the moment. The first part of the handbook spells out some arguments for forms of participatory planning. In the second section, the important background considerations relating to participatory planning are discussed. The third section is on organizing and managing a participatory planning process. This section includes a discussion  of the relationship between participatory planning activities and the rest of the school system decision-making processes. (Author/IRT)",

This manual will help administrators reflect on these questions in the context of their own schools. The manual reviews several of the most popular forms of moral education--inculcation, values analysis, and values clarification; presents a rationale and process for a program of moral reasoning; suggests some ways to deal with the administrative requirements involved in implementing a moral reasoning approach to moral education; and notes some places to find more information and resources. The moral reasoning materials and processes described in this manual were created and tested as part of the Responsible Citizenship Project. Over the past two years the project has helped social studies teachers of  11 school districts in the suburban Pittsburgh area work with their students to deal with social and moral issues.

        "description":"The Knox County extended school year (ESY) program emphasized K-12 curriculum improvement. During the trial of the ESY scheduling and curriculum changes, there was an increase in English and social studies scores at the high school, an increase at all levels in the extent to which students perceived that individualization of instruction was taking place, no change in average daily attendance (even during the summer quinmester), a decline in the high school dropout rate, an increase in the use of library references, and an improvement in an already favorable attitude toward school at all levels. It was not possible to isolate the effects of ESY in these areas from the effects of other factors. However, the data indicate that ESY was certainly not a negative influence, and in some  cases the effect appeared to be quite positive. Parents at all levels and many staff and administrators responded positively to the ESY changes. The planned three-year project was cut short after two years because school board members did not feel the extra expenditures associated with the summer quinmesters were justified for such a small proportion of the students (13 percent one summer, 11 the next).

Power motivation, characteristics of the exercise of influence, and influence effectiveness were studied. A sample of elementary school principals indicated their perceptions and behavioral intentions relevant to the exercise of upward influence in several common decision situations. The results of the study suggest that principals who were rated high in influence activity can be characterized by both high instrumental and intrinsic power motivation, as well as high self-perceptions of power. Several situational factors surrounding the exercise of influence were found to be related to choices among alternative influence targets and the likelihood of using various methods of influence.  The likelihood of using \"manipulation\" as a method of influence was found to most consistently differentiate between principals rated high and low in influence effectiveness, with high effectiveness principals indicating they were more likely to use this method.

The author concentrates on two areas. First is the entry of women into management (including women's career choices, choice of organization, and the effects of these choices on the organization. These effects include the impact on recruitment procedures and male job applicants). The second area concerns the socialization and development of women managers once they have gained entry. The research in this area deals with the personal needs, values, and skills of women managers, as well as with the physical-technological environment and the social-interpersonal environment that women managers must face. The author suggests that researchers  should conduct more longitudinal field research and should investigate the effects of women in management on the society as a whole. (Author/DS)",

Action research is geared to help people think clearly about an issue and find the resources they need to face it. In such a project, citizens develop skills in organizing, finding resources, gathering data, and analyzing the facts. They learn to evaluate data objectively, propose solutions, and act collectively to bring about change. Action research narrows the gap between social research and social change. This handbook details the process for getting the facts, organizing support, and following through. Chapter 1 explains how groups can organize for action research on an issue that concerns them. Chapter 2 describes  fact-finding methods for action research, from stating the issue as a researchable problem to analyzing the facts. Chapter 3 suggests strategies for followup, from developing proposals to dealing with opposition. Action research aids and a resource directory complete the text. (Author/IRT)",

After listing the obstacles to change, the author presents the principal tenets of the new ideology on care of the mentally retarded: retarded persons should be viewed developmentally, capable of growth and learning, regardless of level of retardation or age; retarded persons should live like nonretarded persons to the greatest degree possible; consumers and their representatives should be maximally involved in  planning, programming, and decision-making; legal and human rights of retarded persons must be recognized and protected; national standards should be developed to ensure quality of residential services for the mentally retarded; expanding technology should continue to improve residential services and to decrease the need for institutionalization; and wherever possible, retarded persons should be integrated into society and participate as fully as possible in the activities of the culture to which they belong.

The peculiar nature of the problem and certain structural and organizational attributes of present day special education programs make it difficult to translate legal reform into educational reality. Thus far, the courts that have spoken to the rights of special children have done so in quite broad terms. This is less the case with respect to due process, where judges can rely on well-established precedents in other institutional contexts, than with respect to substantive remedies. Courts can insist on adherence to constitutional  standards in defining the minimum obligation of school districts. But school district practice will have profound influence on what role courts ultimately play. If bridges between the special and regular school worlds can be constructed and if children can be assured of discrete (and discreet) help without having to bear the label \"special,\" then many of the concerns will simply vanish.

Part 1 is focused on some long-range trends related to individuals' decisions to embark on careers in the field of education. Part 2 is an exploration of some long-range trends related to the various stages of a career in education. Part 3 concerns some more recent trends and their possible impact on careers in education. Part 4, the concluding section, contains speculations about  trend projections into the future as well as some recommendations for action. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"The significant increase in the role of the federal government in educational policy-making has provoked a crisis; at the least, it has unleashed a gamut of opinions as to the balance and appropriateness of the roles to be played by the main jurisdictional elements of the system--federal government, states, localities, and public and private institutions of higher learning. To some observers, the threat of domination by an insensitive federal superbeast is near at hand and requires urgent, concerted counteraction. In the minds of others, the states and, by extension, their constitutionally subordinate localities have, by inadequate performances, forfeited their right to make all but the most mechanical educational decisions. In between is the largest number, those who respect but  have not thought much about the problems of federalism. When pressed to do so, the Institute for Educational Leadership believes they will share our conviction that the federal system--with balanced roles and dispersed powers--is one of the wisest creations of modern statecraft and that it can be made to work effectively. This anthology of articles, edited speeches, and other readings contains information on alternative proposals and other forms of wisdom emerging about federalism. (Author/IRT)",

There are restrictions that must be placed on the use of corporal punishment so that it is a beneficial and not a destructive force. No physical harm should be done to students. The grievant should not do the punishing. Corporal punishment should be a last resort, and students should be given the choice between it and permanent suspension. Careful records must be kept, and there should always be a witness present. Corporal punishment should be administered only once unless the undesirable behavior decreases for a period following its initial use. Teachers and administrators alike would prefer to be concerned with  teaching, not with discipline. Corporal punishment can offer one way of deterring disruption of the educational process.

        "description":"One of the major purposes of values education is to help students develop more complex ways of reasoning--to facilitate cognitive development. The purpose of moral education in a cognitive developmental framework becomes the stimulation of the student's capacity for moral judgment. With this goal in mind, the teacher must first be prepared to carefully examine his or her own moral values before entering the classroom. The teacher must have knowledge of the pedagogy of moral discussion. This paper outlines briefly certain characteristics of teaching methods to be used in values education. The teacher must be adept at utilizing questioning techniques to elicit from students constructive social interaction and respect for others' opinions and positions. The teacher should recognize  the various developmental stages manifest by his or her students. Values education actually teaches students a cognitive developmental approach for pursuing their own education after the formal educational process has ended. (Author/DS)",

Enrollment in New York schools is no longer growing at a predictable rate as it did for so many years. School districts need to establish a different perspective on enrollment decline in order to formulate adequate and creative means of coping with this phenomenon. The district must first collect demographic information to define the decline problem. Current and future needs must be analyzed, future facility needs outlined, and the fiscal requirements of future program, staff, and facilities must be determined. This volume's appendixes contain data on enrollment decline and building  requirements for the state of New York. Chapters discuss analyzing programs, staff, facilities, and educational finance, as well as determining study strategy for enrollment decline. Declining enrollment is a complex problem, and it is not likely that districts can adequately cope with it if they deal with it in a fragmented manner. (Author/DS)",

Selected characteristics of peer associates, measures of academic achievement, and three subjective outcome variables--educational plans, self-conceptions of academic competence, and intellectual orientations--are considered. The analysis, based on questionnaire and testing data for a sample of high school seniors, identifies academic ability and status origins as important determinants of curriculum placement. Curriculum enrollment and other school process variables, including characteristics of peer associates and academic performance, both contribute uniquely to the explanation of subjective orientations and serve as important mediators of background  influence. Evidence is provided for the substantial importance of curriculum enrollment for both cognitive and noncognitive outcomes of schooling, as well as for retention in school. (Author)",

In Volume I, the evaluators answer the specific evaluative questions posed by the National Institute of Education, the primary funding agency for the alternative schools project. Out of an initial 23 alternative schools, only two programs survived the five years of BESP. The evaluators conclude that this educational alternatives program failed to produce the &quot;comprehensive change&quot; in the Berkeley school district that it was supposed to produce. Although community involvement in the experimental schools project was fairly high at first, in the end the degree of involvement was no higher than in traditional public schools. The experimental schools also  failed to achieve the &quot;racial-economic-academic mix for students and staff&quot; that they set out to achieve. In Volume II, the evaluators deal with the larger issues raised by the application of federal research and development to education. They conclude that a lack of coordination between the federal funding agency and the local Berkeley school district, including a difference in definition of educational change, led to what might be described as a $6 million misunderstanding.

But declining enrollment aid provisions should be directed only at those districts with the highest rates of decline. The authors also suggest that districts encourage retirement for school staff by lowering the retirement age and by eliminating penalties for early retirement. Inservice training should be provided to keep the staff informed. State boards should provide technical assistance to local  districts to encourage more effective management of limited resources.

The document contains three sections: an index to the developmental disabilities law as amended; the compiled legislation; and the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference of the Congress. The provisions of the law are listed briefly by section number in the index. Included in part II are sections covering the following major areas (sample section topics are in parentheses): general provisions (definitions, employment of handicapped individuals--affirmative action, and protection and advocacy of individual rights); university affiliated facilities  (demonstration and training grants, authorization of appropriations, and projects authorized); grants for planning, provision of services, and construction and operation of facilities for the developmentally disabled (state allotments; withholding of payments for planning, construction, administration, and services; and judicial review); special project grants; and additional provisions (studies and recommendations, conforming amendments, and effective date). The explanatory statement in the final section is noted to provide two important insights: how conflicting provisions proposed by the House and Senate were resolved, and what is the intent of Congress in enacting certain provisions.

The author describes basic concepts in the functionalist approach to social forms and the application of these concepts to the functions of asylum and custody.

Reviewed in section 4 are such model program components as no-fail grading systems, outdoor education, orientation brochures, and family modules. Discussed in section 5 are recommendations made by project staff for research and demonstration activities in teacher training, information dissemination, formation of a professional association,  development of community involvement programs, implementation of a vocational education program, and development of assessment instruments.

        "description":"Presented is the final report of a project to increase academic performance and social interaction in 52 retarded or normal children (3-18 years old) through training teachers in the use of three social skills: exchange, competition, and cooperation. The following project objectives are discussed: operational identification of the three social patterns; isolation of conditions that produce the patterns; development of exchange, cooperation, and competition skills within the context of academic tasks; and development of findings into a program to increase academic performance and improve social behavior. Described in the section on methodology are the basic research phase, a developmental research phase, and the applied research phase. Discussed are project findings including: 1)  operational conceptualizations of the three social patterns, social contingencies, and related feedback behaviors; 2) motivational effects of exchange, cooperative, and competitive contingencies; 3) reinforcing effects of social feedback on task performance; 4) the effects of antecedent task conditions and consequent social contingencies in the development of cooperative and competitive behavior in retarded children; and 5) the effects of assessing social interaction deficits in retarded children by monitoring rates of social interaction. The project is reported to have resulted in the following products: an instrumentation system for comparing the three social contingencies of the three social patterns; a word discrimination program which uses social contingencies to develop both social  interaction and word identification skills in retarded children; a set of procedures for assessing social interaction deficits in classrooms for the retarded; and a program for establishing motivational control, remediating social deficits, and developing social skills in retarded children. More than half of the report consists of Appendices. (DB)",

Brief introductory sections cover the three major project components (the instructional curriculum, the teacher training materials, and the classroom management handbook), the five replication sites in Texas, and the evaluation design. The bulk of the document is organized around 10 elements--academic achievement, student attendance, student dropouts, parent involvement, community information dissemination, teacher training, Project Echo dissemination, activity audit, instructional content mastery, and teacher perception. For each element, a report is provided which outlines the following:  evaluation question of interest, instrumentation, design configuration, data analysis model, design implementation, and evaluation findings. The findings are noted to indicate that the effects of Project Echo intervention on secondary learning disabled students was positive and that the development of additional instructional minimodules in more subject areas should be seriously considered. Technical attachments are provided which include a paper on a screening process related to Project Echo; sample data collection forms; information on the methodology used to investigate student achievement, student attendance, and student dropouts.

Reviewed are the early studies of A. Petrie, M. Buchsbaum, and J. Silverman using the electroencephalograph to obtain AER (average evoked response) records of schizophrenics. The use of the AER to investigate how the brain reacts to changes in stimulus intensity is explained. Summarized are major findings concerning AER abnormalities in schizophrenics, manic-depressives, pure depressives, hyperactive children, and in normal behavior. It is proposed that stimulus intensity control serves as an adaptive protective role in the face of potentially excessive stimulation; that schizophrenics might be  representing this adaptive tendency to an exaggerated degree; and that hyperactive children who improve with drug therapy are those who, prior to treatment, have the most abnormal AER patterns.

It was hypothesized that it should be possible to develop programed instruction using visuals and vocabulary appropriate for a given designated group which could be individually presented to a student with a degree of learning to be expected to take place. Ten multiple-meaning words with 40 meanings were programed, with accompanying pre-post-tests. The programs were presented by means of a teaching machine which provided both visual and auditory stimuli, the latter, individually amplified for each testee. Inadequate allotment of time for the project precluded full developmental field testing. The presentation of the  programs and tests differed in that in one school they were given by the program director. In the schools in which the programs and testing were a part of the regular school program--i.e., presented by the classroom teacher, scores increased to a statistical significance. Results indicated that individualized program instruction can be productive in teaching vocabulary and linguistics to hearing-impaired children if made a part of the regular program.

Differences in learning processes between normal and exceptional children were examined, and various skill development areas were outlined. A list of desired product attributes (such as simplicity and ease of manipulation) were drawn up as an initial step in product development. Five of the learning devices developed (the visual discrimination puzzle, perceptual  development cards, body parts puzzle, number puzzle, and measuring device) were tested with 17 children (5 1/2-13 years old) attending primary and intermediate classes for the trainable mentally retarded. Results indicated that use of each of the learning devices increases Ss ability to perform on these devices as well as to apply the skills and concepts to similar, more practical situations. In addition, performance improvement was maintained over time without further contact with four of the five devices (some forgetting over time did occur with the measuring device). (SBH)",

Eight chapters cover the following: organization, administration, and delivery of services; a comparison of the efficacy of resource and itinerant programs; a hierarchical grouping approach to the characteristics of the Ss; a developmental first grade program; the social behaviors of LD children; three selected case studies; remediation; and a summary of the findings. It is noted that the program is based on a diagnostic-remedial model involving the regular classroom teachers. Among conclusions reported are that LD Ss in the itinerant program  appeared to do better than resource room children, that Ward's hierarchical grouping technique appeared to be a suitable technique for handling data on handicapped children, and that subgroups of LD children were described using this method.

        "description":"A study involving 25 deaf students mainstreamed in a community college was conducted to investigate differences in cognitive styles between deaf and hearing students. Both normal hearing and deaf students responded to a cognitive style inventory which consisted of 216 descriptive statements with which each student assessed himself in terms of \"usually\", \"sometimes\", or \"rarely\". Cognitive style was studied in terms of three sets of influences: (1) symbols and their meanings, (2) cultural determinants of the meanings of symbols, and (3) modalities of inference. Among findings were that deaf students tend to receive theoretical information more readily if presented and/or interpreted in an auditory quantitative format; that culturally, deaf students are more associate oriented than  hearing students, while hearing students are more individual oriented than deaf students; and that hearing students tend to be appraisers in making inferences while deaf students infer more from relationships. Findings pointed out some major differences in cognitive styles that could greatly affect the teaching and learning processes. (Author/SBH)",

The program is described in terms of rationale, replication, children served, staff activities (educational diagnosis, prescriptive programing, implementing instruction, and educational evaluation), and operating costs. Data from evaluation of the seven replication units is noted to reveal that considerable variation as to the comprehensiveness and organization of the diagnostic work-up was evidenced; that there was some evidence that some activities were being recommended for all children without regard to the specific needs of the children involved; and that evaluators varied  considerably from carefully observing student performance and charting progress to little or no attention to student performance and emerging needs. Recommendations are summarized which pertain to program operation, adoption or implementation, and further study. Appended are a typical case study of a learning disabled kindergarten child which includes a diagnostician's report, a programer's report, an implementer's report, and an evaluator's report; information which includes program documents, program role statements, and program typical forms used; and an outline on evaluation methodology.

The report is divided into four sections: part I, which covers the purpose and origins of the study, the methodology used, a summary of results, and a framework for further programing; part II, which contains the information concerning USOE programs serving gifted and talented students that was uncovered through interviewing USOE personnel; part III, which includes descriptions of what happens operationally to program priorities and decisions at each level within the hierarchy of a delivery system, starting at the federal level, with the end purpose of affecting the classroom activities  and programs of elementary and secondary school children; and part IV, in which lists are provided of a series of strategies that USOE might follow in setting up an internal agency for gifted and talented students. It is concluded that there is virtually no USOE delivery system of educational programs for the gifted and talented students in the county. Major factors accounting for this situation are noted to include lack of public support for emphasis on gifted and talented children except by parents of such children; no categorical federal legislation which establishes gifted and talented children as a targeted population; the nonintervention relationship of the federal government to state and local educational agencies; and lack of federal or national educational focus on and leadership  within the area.

        "description":"A team led by the author developed and implemented a model program to aid the learning disabled (LD) child in a small school district remote from an intermediate service unit. The program's aims were to help the LD child achieve grade level more readily in the basic skills; to assist him in achieving a higher opinion of himself, his peers, his family, and his school; and to remediate his physical coordination problems. The program contained four basic components: screening, services, evaluation, and refinements. After pscyhological screening and educational prescriptions for classroom use, students were placed in heterogeneous classrooms for general class work and sent to resource rooms for specialized treatment of their disabilities. Parents and staff surveyed at the conclusion  of the program commented on students' improved cognitive, affective, and psychomotor performance/behavior. The model was recommended for institutionalization as a school district program for the learning disabled incorporating 12 specific suggestions to enhance future program development. (Appendixes, making up half of the document, include a list of meetings, visits, and conferences; a sample case report; tables on program costs; information on administrative policy regarding psychological referrals; sample referral forms; and annual summaries on several students.)

The model is reported as beneficial in that it supports the mother and encourages the teachers to be more like parents, is more appropriate developmentally for the needs of infants, and provides a view of child rearing which stresses the family rather than institutions.

        "description":"Research in bilingualism has shown that the balance between a bilingual's two languages is rarely even and that there is something special about the mother tongue. Theories concerning separate storage of the two languages and first language primacy predict that: (1) the meanings of translation-equivalent words are not identical, and (2) the meanings in the first language are more saturated with meaning than their counterparts in the second language. This paper reports on a study designed to measure the affective meaning of translation-equivalent words both verbally and non-verbally. For the verbal measurement, twenty-two native Japanese speakers rated a set of carefully controlled words on three seven-step evaluative semantic differential scales for Japanese and English. A  similar task with pictographic opposites was used for the non-verbal measurement. The study provided evidence for greater emotional meaning in the subjects of words in their mother tongue, and for a separation in cognitive storage for translation-equivalent words in the Japanese-English bilinguals of the study.

The present paper establishes this distinction and justifies the differential status of the two types of bilingual instruction on the basis of sociolinguistic, socio-cultural and psychological considerations. To establish the independent status of the \"education of bilinguals,\" an innovative design for a bicultural and bilingual program is proposed that will lend itself to implementation in any area of the U.S. where stable bilingualism is operative, particularly South Texas. A set of token materials  appropriate for such a program are provided, materials that will make ample use of \"code-shifting\" techniques that are sociolinguistically and psychologically significant and would better help the students relate to the classroom, since such strategies are part of their everyday verbal behavior. It is concluded that bilinguals will perform better if they are allowed to carry their usual bilingual strategies in to the classroom and are allowed to retain as well as distribute their two languages in a functionally significant way.

The program is based on the relationship between language teaching and language learning, that is, between the methods classes in the teaching of English as a second language, and the language classes aimed at giving the volunteers a practical knowledge of Amharic. The present materials serve as the basis for TESL lectures and the joint sessions involving the English and Amharic staffs. There are five English lessons; four introduce new material while the fifth is a detailed review. These five lessons match the first five Amharic lessons in the amount of material covered: by the end of lesson four, students have been  introduced to simple affirmative, negative and interrogative sentences with the verb \"to be.\" By comparing the sentences they learn in Amharic with those they teach in English, students increase their awareness of the need for control in structure and vocabulary. Each lesson is followed by a pronunciation lesson and a section for contrastive comments, intended as a brief introduction to the application of contrastive analysis in a practical classroom situation.

There should be less emphasis on linguistic accuracy and more on truly spontaneous and creative language. In the author's experience students who had been given the opportunity for innovative self-expression from the very beginning of their study of French far outperformed students who had not had such an experience in situations requiring spontaneous interaction with a native speaker. This experience also gives a sense of achievement to students, who therefore develop a very positive attitude toward language learning. Role playing, discussion topics  and games all represent strategies for providing the emotional involvement necessary for authentic interaction in the classroom. Radio broadcasts from other countries can be incorporated into the language program to provide up-to-date commentary on a variety of topics in language that is fresh and real. A system of \"phone pals\" can be set up whereby students exchange messages with each other or with native speakers in the community. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"An adequate description of the total reading process would have to deal with reading in at least three dimensions comprising three different sets of relationships. A model of the process might well take the form of three concentric spheres: an outer, sociolinguistic shell in which text and reader respectively could be related to a particular universe of texts and a particular society of readers; an intermediate, linguistic sphere in which the texts could be related to the functions and forms of a given human language, and the reader to his functional knowledge of that language; and an inner, psycholinguistic core where text and reader come together in the mind of a single human being. Thus the focus narrows, as the spheres become smaller and increasingly specific, from a culture,  to a language, to the reader himself. Approaching second-language reading in this way means a willingness to draw on work from many fields. At the broadest level the two disciplines are sociolinguistics and ethnomethodology; at the linguistic level, structural linguistics and certain kinds of discourse analysis; and at the basic level, information theory and the study of the psycholinguistic behavior of individual second language readers. This paper is a first attempt to provide at least a framework for such a theory. Better theories of language are an absolute necessity for the teacher of second language reading. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"This paper reports on a study of the acquisition of subject and object relative clauses by monolingual French speaking children aged 4-10 years, in Rimouski, Quebec. The children were tested for their comprehension of six types of relative sentences. A coordinate sentence control test was administered. An adult control group was also tested on the relative sentence test. The results are discussed within the framework of two principles proposed to account for language learning. Slobin's (1971) putative universal principle claims that the interruption and rearrangement of linguistic units is hard for both the child language learner and the adult. Sheldon (1974) has proposed the Parallel Function Hypothesis, which claims that sentences in which the identical NPs have the same  grammatical function in their respective clauses are easier than sentences in which the identical NPs have different grammatical functions. The results of both the child and the adult study support the Parallel Function Hypothesis. The acquisition of French relative clauses follows the same order of acquisition that has been found for English relative clauses (Sheldon, 1974, Legum, 1975) and provides additional evidence for a parallel function constraint in language learning. An analysis of the errors that were made indicates other similarities and differences in the acquisition of French and English. (Author/CLK)",

It reports the extent to which these children are handicapped in their use of the English language and identifies their placement needs within the school system. Questionnaires were distributed to all school principals and the information provided by them is summarized in the report. There are nearly 19,000 pupils in Vancouver for whom English is a second language; nearly 34% of the elementary enrollment and approximately 21% of the secondary enrollment. Chinese is the &quot;first language&quot; for nearly half of these pupils and Italian, German, Punjabi and Portuguese are the &quot;first languages&quot; for another 30%. While a  majority of these pupils have functional literacy, many are handicapped in school by their limited facility with English and approximately 10% are unable to read or write English. While the needs of the large majority of these pupils can be met in regular classrooms (particularly if class size and program are modified), approximately 15% require placement in a special English language class and another 4% require help in addition to such special placement. The report clearly establishes the need in Vancouver schools for a comprehensive program of English language instruction for the large number of pupils for whom English is a second language.

The functional roles of English are discussed and the formal influences of Indian cultural and linguistic contexts are illustrated from the sound system, grammar, lexis and semantics of Indian English. These formal characteristics manifest themselves in what may be termed the &quot;Indianness&quot; in this variety of English. The crucial questions of &quot;intelligibility&quot; and &quot;variation&quot; are examined with reference to the functions of English in India. The development of, and attitudes toward, Indian writing in English is briefly  discussed. The role of English in India's language planning is related to various linguistic and political pressure groups in pre- and post-Independence India.

        "description":"This guide describes well-established and practical pedagogical behaviors for a foreign language teacher in an ordinary situation, a classroom with 20-35 pupils who are beginning the study of a foreign language in school or college. The first chapter, \"The Five Stages,\" discusses the stages through which an item (a word, construction, or idiom) in a language is learned: recognition, imitation, repetition, variation, and selection. The second chapter, \"The First Day in the FL class: the Teacher's Presentation,\" emphasizes the importance of teaching communicative competence and, therefore, of placing the student in real-life situations. The student must learn real FL sentences and use a natural speed for speaking. Tactics of presenting material for oral habit formation are  considered in the third chapter. When presenting new material it is wise to begin with choral practice before calling on various sections, rows, or individual students. When dealing with longer sentences it is best to use the backward build up, for structural and psychological reasons. Suggestions are given on ways to teach rounded front vowels. The fourth chapter, \"Some Tactics of Oral Practice,\" discusses techniques such as chain practice, reversed roles (student interrogates teacher), minimum responses, and dramatic reading and discusses what procedure to follow when a student hesitates or fumbles. The final chapter \"From Oral Practice to Oral Skill: the Intermediate Levels\" considers oral accuracy and oral fluency. In first-level work oral accuracy has a higher priority; at the second  level fluency begins to become a main objective. The teacher must distinguish between times when accuracy should be insisted upon and times when fluency is the main goal. Restraint must always be used, however, in correction. (CFM)",

        "description":"In &quot;Suggestologiia,&quot; Georgi Lozanov discusses his theories of Suggestology, the scientific study of suggestion, and Suggestopedia, the application of suggestion to pedagogy. The Lozanov thesis cannot properly be understood in isolation, however, and Suggestology and Suggestopedia should be considered in relation to yoga, Soviet and Western work in suggestion and psychotherapy, the Russian school of physiological psychology and the Soviet concept of the unconscious, Soviet linguistics and pedagogy. Suggestology investigates the subsensory signals or subliminal stimuli which come from the physical or social environment and which are absorbed into the unconscious mind before receiving a conscious expression. Suggestion, especially spoken suggestion, activates the reserve capacities  of the mind or the memory. Suggestopedia increases memorization capacities. Hypermnesia is facilitated by relaxation techniques (derived from yoga and autogenic therapy) which increase the subject's suggestibility to spoken suggestions or unconscious stimuli. The principal theoretical elements of Suggestopedia are: authority, infantilization, double-planeness, intonation, rhythm, and concert pseudo-passivity. The lack of scientific data in &quot;Sugestologiia&quot; may lead to a negative reaction to the Lozanov thesis. The right way to approach the thesis, however, may be to translate the underlying original ideas and to reconstruct the statistical evidence in accordance with the more rigorous and less ideologically oriented methods used in Western science.

        "description":"The notion of language dependency presupposes that there is a hierarchy of languages in a multilingual society, and that each language is assigned a functional role in a multilingual individual's restricted or extended spheres of linguistic interaction. In South Asia, language dependency has resulted in linguistic convergence of two types: (1) convergence within the inner language circle, that is, within South Asian languages; (2) outer linguistic imposition, or dependency on languages outside the South Asian language periphery. This type of convergence is seen in the Persianization and the Anglicization of the inner circle languages. This study is concerned with an aspect of the convergence with English, code-mixing, or the use of one or more languages for consistent transfer of  linguistic units from one language into another, resulting in a new code of linguistic interaction. Code-mixing is role-dependent because the religious, social, economic, and regional characteristics of the participants are crucial in understanding the event. It is function-dependent because the specialized use to which a language is being put determines code-mixing. The study explores the formal manisfestations and motivations for code-mixing, the acceptability constraints on it, and its influence on South Asian languages. (CLK)",

Its primary goal is to bring some order to the teaching of vocabulary in the first two years of Tamil instruction. A secondary goal is to help the student through the vocabulary maze of Tamil diglossia. Three main criteria were employed in selecting words for the list: high frequency, usage, and semantic adequacy. The list is primarily in Modern Literary Tamil (MLT) and is glossed in both Colloquial Tamil (CT) and in English. High Literary Tamil (HLT) words have been entered in brackets after or under the main MLT entry as a third variant. As the normal script used for MLT is in many ways ambiguous for colloquial pronunciation, a system of diacritics has been added to make the pronunciation  clear. Appendix 1 groups the words by semantics and usage and allows for access to the list through CT or English. Appendix II gives the few words which have a high frequency in LT but were not included in the main list because of a more common synonym. (Author/AM)",

Replies were received from 2,494 institutions, of which 2,313 reported registrations in one or more foreign languages. The fall 1974 survey shows a decline of 6.2% in total foreign language registrations between 1972, the year of the last previous survey conducted by the MLA, and 1974. Registrations declined by more than ten percent in French, German, and Russian, but by less than one percent in Italian and Spanish. There were increases for Latin, Ancient Greek, and a number of the so-called &quot;other&quot; or less commonly taught languages. Spanish continues to be the leading language in U.S. colleges, accounting for over 38% of the total.  The report consists of an introduction, five summary tables, thirteen detailed tables, and an institutional directory. The detailed tables present data by state or by region for the seven most commonly taught languages and for the aggregate of &quot;other&quot; languages, as well as detailed comparative figures from surveys undertaken in 1965, 1970, and 1972.

The findings of this survey may be useful in the selection of the most efficient ways to communicate information to educators about new instructional products and practices. A survey form was distributed which asked the purchasers to indicate the following: (1) how they first became aware of the SEDL bilingual instructional materials; (2) other sources by which they obtained information; (3) what single information source was most influential; (4) the degree of their personal involvement in this decision; (5) others within their school district or  agency who participated in the decision making; (6) availability for further survey information-gathering assistance; (7) current use of the purchased SEDL materials in the classroom; (8) general comments regarding the purchase of the materials. Results and discussion with respect to each of the eight issues are reviewed in turn. The major conclusions were: (1) adopters most often obtain initial information about new instructional products from personal information sources; (2) few purchasers based their adoption-decision on the single initial product information source; (3) the most influential factors were observation of the products in use and personal communication with SEDL personnel; and (4) decisions are most often group decisions.

The program consists of four stages, roughly coinciding with the first four elementary grades. During the first stage, the child becomes literate in the vernacular, is exposed to beginning content material, and learns to speak English through oral lessons. At the second stage, reading skills in the vernacular are developed, and the child begins to read and write English. In the third and fourth stages, the child learns in both languages and is ultimately instructed in English with some classes in the vernacular. The linguist has several roles is such a program. There is a need for a survey to determine how many vernaculars are spoken by the  children, which should be taught, and which is the central dialect in an area where several dialects are spoken. Linguistic descriptions of the aboriginal vernaculars are needed as well as an assessment of a child's language competence in the vernacular and English at the outset of the program. Linguists are needed for the accurate preparation of educational materials. The advantages of training aborigines as linguists and literacy workers are also discussed. (CLK)",

The observations in the paper are based on twelve years of linguistic and field experience in Queensland, supplemented by papers by Spolsky and Shuy delivered at the Third International Congress of Applied Linguistics in 1972, and briefly outlined here. The sociolinguistic problems associated with the education of aboriginals in Australia are discussed, particularly the implications of  linguistic variety for the choice of instructional medium. In this area, three choices are apparent: (1) instruction at least at the primary level in the aboriginal vernacular; (2) instruction in the Aboriginal English L or familiar form; (3) instruction in Standard English H or General Australian English. The best basis for planning and developing educational programs is formed by research into language attitudes and language maintenance initiated by government authorities and administered by community leaders. The linguist's role in language planning is discussed, and specific language planning efforts in Australia are briefly mentioned. (CLK)",

        "description":"The language situation of immigrants to Australia, or social bilinguals, is distinguished from that of second language learners, or cultural bilinguals. The former lag behind in employment and school achievement. The solution proposed entails learning English, though both children and adults appear to reach a plateau in learning after initial progress. This study suggests mother tongue maintenance as a solution. Evidence from linguistic theory is cited from Fillmore and McCawley. Bilinguals should be given the opportunity to observe norms in both of their languages, and bilingual education is seen as a program that takes the student's two languages in his social environment into account. Four bilingual education models are described (transitional, emphasis on the native language,  emphasis on the second language, and balanced), the balanced model being seen as most suitable for Australia. The Multilingual Project described here, a form of bilingual education primarily concerned with concept learning, has developed independent study units in social studies. 600 students in fifteen secondary schools are participating, and materials are provided in English and Arabic, Greek, Italian, Turkish, Serbian and Croatian. The goal of the project is to allow students to opt for aspects of each heritage rather than totally rejecting or accepting either one. (CLK)",

Questionnaires designed to evaluate the program in general were sent to F.L.A. teachers; questions concentrated on the areas of organization and curriculum. Questionnaires were also sent to current and former students in one school in order to ascertain their reactions to the program. The results showed an overall satisfaction with and approval of the F.L.A. program on the part of both teachers and students. Some problem areas that needed consideration were: (1) the current curriculum guide; (2) certain organizational and scheduling patterns; (3) the need for uniformity among  teachers in the maintenance of classroom discipline and correlation of materials selected; (4) the need for additional materials; (5) the mandatory aspect of the program. Some strong points were identified, such as the greater number of students exposed to the cultures and languages of other countries and the improved ability of a student to form a preference for a language to be studied in the future. The questionnaires and a statistical interpretation of the responses are given in appendices. (CFM)",

        "description":"This document reports on a workshop held to develop the curriculum for a foreign language appreciation program. The first chapter discusses the general educational concerns in preparing a FLA curriculum: course content, the student, and the foreign language teacher. Cultural appreciation is the dominant theme and the rationale for the FLA program. The language, however, is still the primary medium for expressing the very essence of that culture. The basic belief of those committed to an exploratory program is that all students can learn a foreign language if given enough time and the right kind of environment. Language teachers must accept the fact that foreign language study must be made available to every student, not only to the better students. The topic of the second chapter  is supervisory considerations. The way the new program is organized and presented to the teachers is of utmost importance. The &quot;new&quot; student in the middle grades is discussed in the third chapter. The curriculum must be planned with this student's principal characteristic in mind: an increasing resistance to the established educational procedures and goals. The fourth chapter is devoted to disciplinary considerations. Language teachers will now have many low-ability students whose background in discipline is usually poor. In the fifth chapter performance objectives and tasks are considered, and examples follow in the sixth chapter. The seventh chapter presents models of possible lesson plans and learning experiences for curriculum consideration. The final chapter gives guidelines for  pre-assessment of the program. A short bibliography is provided. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"Foreign language programs in America have not tried to meet the specific needs of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in professional schools who are preparing for an international career in law, marketing, accounting, hotel management, or engineering. These students need to be able to use the language in the performance of their professional duties. For them a foreign language is an auxiliary skill that allows them to do their job in the foreign country efficiently. Since most of these professionals stay in the foreign country for extended periods, they must be able to speak the foreign tongue with some fluency, must know enough about the foreign culture to integrate smoothly into the social environment and, most important, must have mastered the professional vocabulary  they need to carry on their business. The proposed twelve-months, semi-intensive program achieves these goals through a combination of well tested and innovative methods in language instruction. These include a modular approach to the teaching of social-linguistic situations, culture, and the basic vocabulary essential to each student's professional area. A vital component of the program is an eight-to-twelve week practicum in the student's professional field in the target language country. (Author)",

        "description":"It seems highly likely that many of the features of Black American English can be traced back to the Afro-Portuguese Creole dialects that sprang up in the fifteenth century in Portuguese slave camps along the West African coast, particularly in the Gulf of Guinea area, the area of greatest concentration of activity during the slave trade. This Creole was used for communication by the Portuguese slave traders and the slaves on the one hand, and by the slaves themselves on the other hand, since these latter were drawn from many different African tribes speaking mutually unintelligible languages. Some of the early features of Black English have disappeared, due to contact with Standard English. For example, negation with \"no\" and the use of \"me\" as a subject pronoun are almost  undoubtedly of Afro-Portuguese origin and are echoed in Jamaican Creole English. Other features of Black American English have remained and have exact parallels in the speech of certain blacks in the Caribbean, for instance, whose Creole dialects neglect gender distinctions, shun the \"redundant\" plural, and merge verb forms into one single form. Similarly, a Black English noun-deriving process is seen in the Creole dialects, as are other features commonly seen in Black English. (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"One of the most important capacities which children employ when learning language is the capacity to generalize. A child who hears an utterance of a verbal expression while perceiving a particular object (or action, aspect, etc.) becomes normally able to apply the expression not only to this object but also to all those objects which, for him, are similar to the original one. These objects constitute his generalization class relative to the original object. Two kinds of generalization classes can be distinguished: species-determined, or innate, and species-indetermined, or acquired. Whereas children are born with the capacity to generalize in accordance with the former classes, they must undergo certain kinds of experiences in order to learn to generalize according to the latter  classes. In the paper, it is shown that the capacity of children to generalize in accordance with both innate and acquired generalization classes plays a fundamental role in language acquisition. In particular, this capacity enables children to learn to associate a large number of words with the correct classes of objects and to acquire the creative ability of understanding and producing new sentences.

English is not the medium of instruction, and is not extensively used except in university English departments and other departments where much of the reading matter is in English. In most school districts English is begun in the third year, although in some schools it is being introduced earlier. Textbooks and other instructional materials are controlled by the Ministry of Education, leading to a rigid system allowing for little experimentation. English for special purposes is in use at some universities. Teacher training, including inservice training, and examinations, vary regionally and according to the educational level, but are generally state-controlled. Various types of private  schools also contribute to English instruction. The British Council provides lecturers, teacher exchange, counselling, and other services towards the support of EFL; some contribution is also made by the United States Information Service. The outline ends with a bibliography of current relevant research and instructional materials. (AM)",

These studies will culminate in a statewide plan for Georgia postsecondary learning that is planned for 1976. The first four studies are major data collection and analysis activities. They are: (1) the enrollment study, which recommends a comprehensive, 5- to 10-year historical analysis of enrollment trends; (2) the accessibility study, which provides several potential methodologies for gauging the accessibility of Georgia educational institutions in terms of geography, tuition, and the nature of the region; (3) the potential program duplication study, which recommends techniques for constructing a program inventory; and  (4) the proprietary school report, providing a critique and analysis of a previous proprietary school survey. The fifth study reported, the issues and problems study, suggests how the GPEC can combine public hearings and small group meetings to provide additional data on educational issues. In the final section of this report suggestions are made on how informational and attitudinal inputs can be combined to produce a statewide plan for postsecondary learning in Georgia. (LBH)",

The economy was the big issue in the 1976 legislative session in each of these states. Falling state revenues made increases in higher education as well as in other state agencies virtually impossible. Topics related to education that were handled by the legislatures include enrollment increases caused by the tight job market; proposed tuition increases to supplement the state appropriations; coordination and governance of higher education; medical education programs; veterinary medicine programs; collective bargaining; aid to private education; student  aid; and faculty salary increases. These topics are detailed in this state-by-state legislative report. (JMF)",

This study is part of a large study of the background characteristics of executives from South Carolina, Mississippi, North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The major conclusions are: (1) Over half of the executives had graduate level education, and 48 percent had graduate level degrees, a finding that indicates the declining value of a bachelor's degree. (2) Three primary areas at the undergraduate level allow maximum executive mobility--the physical and biological sciences, business, finance and economics, and engineering--and these are areas  in which women and minorities are less likely to major. (3) A select few colleges and universities in the region provide the greatest opportunity for mobility, especially in terms of graduate degree program offerings. (4) The educational system poses barriers for the mobility of women into the executive ranks of government that few policy-makers have adequately analyzed. Recommendations are made for expanding opportunities. (LBH)",

The major goals of this pioneering survey were to assess the nature and use of existing, under construction, and planned facilities, and to forecast the anticipated replacement or expansion of facilities in the following decade. At the time of this writing, three years after the first survey, very few of the data are obsolete. Information on nonclinical instruction facilities has to do with amount, condition, and perceived needs for room types: classrooms, class laboratories, research and research training  space, library space, auditoria, faculty offices, administrative areas, animal facilities, and other kinds of space. Clinical teaching facilities available to the schools are also inventoried in square footage and in terms of beds, examination rooms, and ambulatory patient stations. Analyses are made of resource utilization. Census data are projected to determine use of facilities and output of health professionals in future years. (Author/MSE)",

The principal finding of the study was that major field is strongly associated with the grades students receive in courses throughout the curriculum. This and previous grade studies support the proposition that the various parts of the curriculum have different grading standards. There has been a shift of course enrollments and majors away from the traditional curricula to the newer curricula. It is suggested that many students have been avoiding courses with traditionally stringent grading practices, creating a  condition which might be called &quot;degree inflation&quot;; that is, more students are moving into degree programs which they find have grading standards reflecting their abilities and/or interests.

Pechman and Sharkansky's critique, &quot;The Distributional Effects of Public Higher Education in California,&quot; appears in the &quot;Journal of Human Resources,&quot; v5 n3 page 361-370, Summer 1970. The Hansen-Weisbrod approach involved comparing the distributional pattern of subsidies for higher education in California with the distribution of state and local taxes. It was emphasized that the final work as to the redistributional effects of all government programs cannot be written on the basis of a study of any one public service. A major objection of  Pechman and Sharkansky centered on the authors' treatment of the distribution of the burden of taxes that support higher education. This issue is discussed, along with those of classifying beneficiaries and general policy implications. (LBH)",

Three approaches are used here to display data, each providing a different perspective on enrollment patterns and trends. Some of the general findings are as follows: total state enrollment reached an all-time high in 1975 of nearly one million students; both full-time and part-time undergraduate enrollments increased, but part-time enrollment grew more rapidly; full-time graduate enrollment increased slightly, while part-time enrollment decreased slightly;  the State University and private sector enrollments increased at about the same rate, while City University enrollments decreased; private and state community colleges experienced substantial increase in both full-time and part-time undergraduate enrollments; private engineering technical colleges grew substantially in enrollments; and the proportion of New York State high school graduates going on to postsecondary education in the state has remained stable over the first half of this decade.

Academic and nonacademic groups were represented. The results indicated that there are differences in the way the university's employees feel about their job situations. There are also distinctions in job satisfaction between academic and nonacademic employees and within each of these groups. Employees as a whole are well satisfied with the following factors: the work itself; co-workers; the feeling of being liked, respected, and needed; the boss; opportunities to use and improve one's skills and training; opportunities  to control how the job is done; availability of needed supporting services, supplies, and equipment; and job-related information received. The lowest level of satisfaction involved: opportunities for promotion and promotional advancement; prospects for a comfortable retirement; earnings and prospects for financial security; and chances of bringing about needed changes in one's unit.

Professional identity is defined as the process of acquiring the values, attitudes, and skills of the single chosen profession. The process takes place on both the graduate and undergraduate level. Outcomes include a high degree of goal consensus among institutional participants, the translation of this consensus into program goals and policies, the provision of one-to-one and small group interaction between faculty and students, and the provision of opportunities for the development of student subcultures. Also considered is the importance of the educational setting, faculty members as  socializing agents, and the student peer group. One of the conclusions is that undergraduate education should be restructured to provide more opportunities for the socialization process to take hold. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"Regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 were published in 1975 amid considerable speculation over their impact on college student affairs. More than one year later, there does not appear to be substantial understanding in the higher education community of what Title IX has meant for students and for administrators. Title IX regulations may already have had some impact on the treatment of women college students. At a minimum, it has compelled college officials to take a close and critical look at the effect of their policies and practices on students' college careers and on their postgraduate plans. At the same time, there may be other aspects of campus life where disparate treatment of men and women students continues to occur. One major issue  remains unexamined: the policies and procedures the Office of Civil Rights will use to monitor and enforce Title IX. Until an implementation plan is made known, compliance will depend on the good faith actions of college and university administrators; consequently, the full impact of Title IX cannot be known.

        "description":"This study was undertaken with the belief that financial need is not an isolated barrier to postsecondary education and that it is frequently accompanied by distinct motivational, academic, and geographic factors. The distribution of Alabama's poverty on a county level is shown and evaluated. It is noted that all of the countries with a predominantly black population in 1970 are included among those with the highest degree of poverty. The data show that the impact of poverty in Alabama is severe, with an inordinate number of persons and families in every county impoverished. Increasing cost of living and decreased purchasing power of the dollar intensify the hardship. Lack of educational training may be the most crippling disadvantage of poverty, since income, wages, occupation,  and employment are influenced by educational attainment. Social norms and values, academic procedures, and geographic variables can produce severe obstacles to postsecondary education. Postsecondary education must develop a flexibility to meet the financial, geographic, motivational, and academic needs of new students, as well as a social commitment exercised in a way that benefits the total community.

The group surveyed included Canadian students, foreign students, and students sponsored by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The students responded that they felt such a center should be a focal point for social and cultural interaction. A majority of the foreign and CIDA students were willing to make a financial commitment to such a center, while Canadian students were not. A majority of all three groups indicated that the Center  should be open to everyone on campus. A chi-square analysis of responses indicated that more foreign and CIDA students than could be expected felt they were completely prepared to handle work at the University of Alberta, while fewer Canadian students than expected felt themselves prepared. Students' perceptions of the functions of the Foreign Student Office were ranked, with the most commonly preceived function being to help the foreign student adjust to Canadian society. The problems in adjusting to Canada and the University were surveyed using open ended questions, and ranged from finding the way around the city and campus and getting a job for money and experience, to establishing a bank account and finding a babysitter.

Faculty members frequently voice doubts about using student evaluations, because it is not clear to what extent they measure the leniency of the instructors, the amount the instructors taught the students, or the performing ability of the instructors. Previous studies of the problem have not been satisfactory. This paper presents a sequential, three-equation model to determine the effects of learning and leniency on evaluations. The variables include: previous knowledge of the concepts of the course; amount of previous course study; amount of related course  study; previous academic average; academic year of the student; time the class meets; size of the class; and sex of the student. The model was applied to students in 14 sections of the microeconomics protion of the &quot;Principles of Economics&quot; course at the University of Western Ontario. The results indicate that evaluations do not depend on leniency. (LBH)",

Some general conclusions are drawn: (1) There is no set formula or checklist to provide an accurate assessment of institutional R&D capacity. (2) False negatives are more serious than false positives, so the selection criteria should be lenient to the point of flexibility, consistently favoring applicants or existing centers when there is some chance of success. (3) Leadership is significant, and the selection of a young scientist (35 to 45) with a history of successful contributions and favorable relationships with other people will help ensure a center's creativity. (4) The consortium form of research organization should be rejected  under rare circumstances. A research firm is necessary for a concerted attack on a narrow goal, as R&D should be defined. (5) The current economy is favorable to organized research, due to a tight labor market and the scarcity of research funds for projects. (Author/LBH)",

Third, what are the appropriate roles in the process for the public, legislators, state higher education agencies, governing boards, and institutional administrators, faculty, and students? Can we  devise a set of relationships that leave the central responsibility for the educational program with the educational institutions, but provides for appropriate consideration and input from the other concerned groups?

        "description":"Educators and politicians share a problem of communication that will have dire consequences for education. Legislators see that educators engage in much so-called evaluation, and collect carloads of data, but are rarely critical of existing programs or truly innovative in others. Legislators are accused of not understanding education, and of interfering with educational processes, while educators seem unable to give straightforward, factual answers. Legislators see educators fighting among themselves for money, and demanding more, but unable to take a stand on how money should be raised. While legislators may be supportive of postsecondary education, they feel betrayed because of the games educators play. However, legislative reform, budget reform, and program evaluation are  movements in need of one another. One element that is needed is a complete and mutually comprehensible information system; this may assist the dialogue and movement toward reform. (Author/MSE)",

        "author":["Micek, Sidney C."],
        "description":"A common concern of state-level and postsecondary institutional decisionmaking is the limitations of the state planning and budgeting process as it relates to educational change and accountability: increased regulations, the cost of obtaining information, the difficulty of assessing outcomes, the inability to discourage nonproductive programs, and lack of information about benefits to the taxpayer. Interest in performance- or outcome-oriented budgeting is increasing, and a number of states now have performance audit staffs. A variety of techniques are used by these staffs: outside consultants, institutional assessments, and combined audit and program review. NCHEMS has developed an Inventory of Higher Education Outcome Variables and Measures to be used by decisionmakers in  dealing with this problem. The most needed outcome measures were determined from two surveys of state-level and institutional administrators. Four major difficulties occur in collecting and using outcome information: (1) explicit measures of educational outcome have been hard to come by; (2) interpretation of information (to determine cause and effect) is difficult; (3) general goals often lack translation into specific objectives; and (4) the usual time span of a budget limits the assessment of higher education outcomes.

(2) What are the perceptions of individuals representing various interest groups relative to the use of data collected by the State Council? (3) From the State Council's point of view, what questions will be answered by the data-gathering process? Responses to these questions suggest that the Virginia General Assembly is well on its way in joining other states, such as New York, Michigan, Florida, and California, in setting into motion procedures for decreasing the cost  of higher education, for scrutinizing more closely the activities of faculty, and for assessing the status of tenure policies and procedures. Implications for initial appointment and review, reappointment, tenure, and post-tenure review are discussed. (LBH)",

        "description":"In most countries, it is the state that has been taking over the support of universities and of teaching hospitals, a trend that has accelerated rapidly over the past 25 years to meet the expanding needs of higher education and of health care. In medicine the problem of university autonomy is further complicated by the long-standing custom that license to practice, and even the curriculum that qualifies for this license, are regulated on a national or regional scale by some external body. Twenty-five years ago, most of the medical schools included in this survey received no significant financial support from the state, while today most are wholly dependent on the state for their survival. The purpose of this survey was to determine how the medical schools and their teaching  hospitals are faring under these changed circumstances. The report is based mainly on the United States, Britain, Canada, Sweden, and Australia; a brief account of New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, Denmark, Norway, and Finland is given in the appendixes. The topics discussed include operation expenses, capital expenditures, medical research and peer review, regulation of professional standards, medical schools, medical manpower, teaching hospitals, laboratory services in teaching hospitals, family practice and community medicine, undergraduate curriculum, and postgraduate education.

Data were collected on a comparison group of 35 state universities in order to place the Maryland activities in a national context. Most of the data presented in this report extend over a 10-year period, 1965 to l974. During this period, federal support for scientific research reached a peak and then declined; all the universities had an opportunity to expand their research programs. Four kinds of indicators for scientific research were used: National Science Foundation grants, publications in frequently-cited journals (in mathematics, physics, and chemistry), prestige of graduate programs, and members of advisory panels that review  applications for research grants. For social sciences and humanities, other fellowships and grants awarded were also included. General information is given for the 35 universities on number of doctoral degrees granted, faculty compensation and state support, library resources, prestige of graduate programs, and total federal funding. The highest ranking universities are then cited for each of these areas: mathematics, physical sciences, an engineering; life sciences; and behavioral and social sciences, and humanities. (LBH)",

        "description":"Two social changes are cited as particularly important to the projection of college enrollment trends. One is the rising educational attainment of the parents of future potential college attenders; the other is the fact that declines in fertility accompany declines in average family size. Overall, the illustration in this paper suggests that the decline in enrollment due to the decline in birthrates may be cushioned by increases in the proportion of a birth cohort attending college due to rising parental education and declining parity. How much of that cushion will be destroyed due to declining relative wages of college attenders operating through changing cohort parameters is not clear. The results of the analysis are interpreted to mean that there are some farily substantial  contemporary sociodemographic trends that influence educational attainment and are rather separate from changes in the relative wages of the more highly educated. In the past these sociodemographic changes have accounted for the majority of the change in college attendance and their future change is likely to impact attendance fairly considerably.

It was originally conceived out of perennial questions about personal outcomes of student learning such as can be separated from the academic fulfillment of degrees or from career preparation. Personal interviews and a short-answer questionnaire were used to gather data from two residential colleges in nonmetropolitan areas. Three basic questions were asked: (1) What do you see to be the principal purposes of this college and how does the college appear to be carrying them out? (2) How do students in the college perceive it as an organization? (3) Does college organization have impact on students? The findings  indicate that students: desire a liberal education, although they may choose majors with various career connections in mind; prefer teachers who have a concern for the individual; prefer a college whose organization keeps a human scale; regard highly an organization that can make its local decisions alone; see college administration as legitimate to the extent that it is responsive to its students and personnel; and more readily accept an adversary model of college governance.

Despite disagreement and lack of theory, budget professionals are moving slowly and pragmatically toward a more systematic approach to budgeting. The present study began in July 1973, when the Center for Research and Development in Higher Education undertook a three-year, 50-state study of the processes used by state agencies to formulate the budgets of colleges and universities. Its twofold purpose is to advance budgetary theory and to give state and institutional budget professionals a broader understanding of (1) the  interrelationships, roles, functions, and objectives of the several state agencies in the budgetary process; (2) the congruence or incongruence of such objectives among the several agencies; and (3) the practices and procedures that build confidence in the fairness of the budgetary process. Reports based on the study describe and analyze the organizational structures and staffing of state-level agencies and the progress of institutional budget requests through these agencies. The primary emphasis is on the budget review and analysis process and the procedures used by the state agencies; the study concentrates on the administrative interfaces among the several state agencies and between the agencies and the institutions of higher education.

        "description":"Between August 1973 and September 1976, a study was conducted of the process of assessing faculty in Oregon's colleges and universities. The two major objectives were to describe and analyze the factors influencing tenure and promotion decisions, and to develop incentive models to positively influence the quality of instruction. A faculty perception questionnaire and administrator survey were used to accomplish the first objective, and the questionnaire and results are presented. The present findings point to significant gaps between institutional policy statements regarding promotion/tenure criteria and the data collected to verify the attainment. In the short span of the study, some noteworthy efforts to improve faculty performance review procedures have been seen in the Oregon  system. Almost without exception, the impetus for these efforts came from highly placed administrators. Incentive models might be developed with a methodology similar to that used in this study: first, to review and thoroughly analyze the institution's policy and guideline statements on salary, tenure, and promotion decisions; second, to focus on faculty perceptions of what influences salary, tenure, and promotion decisions; and third, to simplify and improve evaluation procedures and provide more realistic incentives to faculty members. What this thorough review of the promotion process could accomplish, in part, is a visibility for the instructional function that has not been present on the campuses. With the high performance potential on campuses and potential for excellent leadership,  continued improvement is possible. (Author/MSE)",

A number of observations were made: (1) Although sports as entertainment can be expected to continue to play an increasingly important role in our society, big-time collegiate athletics can be expected to continue to lose ground, despite some appearance to the contrary; (2) today the definition of amateurism must be given in degrees of nonprofessionalism, and even so, the concept remains controversial; (3) national solutions will be difficult to develop in light of regional differences; and (4) colleges and universities are not at the same stage of development in the evolution of their athletic programs.  The findings of the inquiry are in six major categories: (1) individual attitudes of the parties-at-interest; (2) commericalism, entertainment, and ethics; (3) controlling competition; (4) economics; (5) the relationship of sports and education; and (6) issues to be considered in a study by a national Commission on Intercollegiate Sports.

The question is raised whether or not such factors as academic excellence, concern for human scale and individual personality, commitment to liberal learning, the college's role as a sanctuary of academic freedom, and its position as a standard setter shouldn't also be considered carefully. At Saint Mary College, whose mission is to provide for the Catholic liberal education of women, an outstanding evaluation team was brought in to assess the college's apostolic effectiveness within the religious community. The study evidenced that education for religious and ethical values and liberal education for full human development remain a strong foundation from  which Saint Mary can respond to new challenges. The value of the Saint Mary case study as a possible model for evaluation of so elusive a goal as spiritual progress may be in the manner in which the independent team established and applied criteria to the college.

What does make education extraordinary in a church-related college? Perhaps we believe that by simply adding the word \"Christian\" the difference is apparent. Will the college employ only committed Christians as faculty? Should worship be required on campus for all? The Christian church has problems enough with similar kinds of questions as well as semantics without making it complicated for higher education and its task. Four suggestions can be made for the faculty's role: first, faculty members should respect the college's professed conviction and uphold its right to exist; second, they should support the liberal  arts thrust of higher education, just as the Church should not attempt to make a church out of the college; third, they should pursue the humanistic endeavor in their teaching efforts, accepting doubt, error, and differences, and encouraging creativity; and fourth, they should strengthen themselves professionally, with the goal of increasing our measure of rationality in the search for truth and excellence.

The survey questionnaire was designed to provide an overview of several aspects of the commuting student's relationship with the university and was sent to a stratified random sample of 2,140 students who were enrolled for the spring 1975 semester. Highlights of the findings include the following: (1) Eighty percent of the commuters depend on their own or their family's automobile for transportation to campus. (2) Negligible use is made of public transportation. (3) Less than 5 percent of commuters use carpools, although more than half express a willingness to do so. (4) Commuters consistently underestimate the costs of driving a car to campus. (5) The greatest number of  cars are present on campus or in the vicinity around 10 a.m. (6) Many commuters do not purchase parking tickets for their cars. Recommendations for solving the parking problem for both students and staff are considered. (Author/LBH)",

CSQ-II was administered during the spring 1976 semester to a sample of seniors, with 479 students representing all sectors of the senior class responding. Results are presented in three sections: demographic characteristics, academic characteristics, and future plans. The discussion of demographic characteristics includes factual information usually associated with a demographic profile as well as scale scores describing orientations of seniors to family, friends, and society. Information about choices of major, grades, study habits, and satisfaction with UNC-G are covered in the  section on academic characteristics. The last part of the report presents the immediate and long-range plans seniors have for continuing their education and pursuing their careers. A primary focus of this report is a comparison of the characteristics of senior men and women. Some comparative data on commuting and dormitory residents and majors in arts and sciences and professional schools are also presented. A primary objective of a report such as this is to stimulate questions and requests for additional analyses of the data. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"The most important single outcome of the grant from the Mellon Trusts to the George Washington University (GW) was the development of the Division of Experimental Programs. This new division is centrally concerned with turning GW's Washington location to academic advantage. Under the terms of the grant, GW was to develop means to relate the &quot;total resources&quot; of the university to the needs of local communities, particularly poor communities. This report traces the development of the Division of Experimental Programs through the five-year life of the Mellon grant. Section 1 discusses the relationship that existed between the university and the surrounding Washington community prior to the receipt of the Mellon grant. Section 2 details the first year of the grant. Section 3  describes the attempts to take community-oriented courses out of the classroom. Section 4 tells of the advent of the first service-learning programs, which placed students in public, private, and other community agencies for firsthand observation and experience. Section 5 details the cooperative program established between GW and a Washington community (The Anacostia Project); early problems faced in attempting to match university resources with specific community needs are discussed. Section 6 traces the development of a new GW office to supervise grant-related activities. Section 7 evaluates GW's accomplishments during the five-year grant: lessons learned and observations made.

Another crisis is at hand: students, like others in our society, have developed a distrust of authority, and consequently of traditional education. Vocational schools are flourishing because they have weeded out the indigestibles and offer immediately useful skills. College teachers must learn to communicate higher education's worth to students. The major problem today in college teaching is boredom; this perception is borne out in a survey of student attitudes. Simple, unexaggerated concern for student welfare would improve the communication lines, as would a sincere effort to create interest. Another technique is for teachers to point out the  implications and modern-day importance of the materials discussed in class, and not leave that conceptual leap to the students alone. The four professorial myths to be debunked are that: (1) students are lazy and unintelligent; (2) the holder of the terminal degree automatically becomes a good teacher; (3) teachers must become like students in order to be effective; and (4) knowing the subject well precludes knowing how to teach it.

This, in turn, forces the employer to ask, Do I really have to bargain about these subjects? As more employers refuse to bargain, more unions charge them with failing to bargain in good faith, and the appropriate labor board is faced with another decision on the scope of bargaining. Recently, several states' labor boards have rendered new landmark decisions; to include these decisions, ACBIS decided to update its original scope report. The states involved are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Negotiation  areas affected include: dispute settlement; hours, calendar, and workload; employee perquisites; institutional direction and resources; personnel policies; technical aspects of the collective bargaining process; union security; wages and salaries; and miscellaneous considerations.

The variables included in the analysis are: demographic and background characteristics of students, initial indebtedness, anticipated indebtedness on graduation, specialty area, career activity preferences, planned residency training, geographic location preferences, and interest in physician shortage area practice. It was found that (1) students anticipating greatest indebtedness tend to be women, minority group members, married with children, from small towns or rural areas,  and from lower income families; (2) students interested in primary care or underserved area careers tend to be women, married with children, from small towns or rural areas, and from lower income families; (3) few significant relationships exist between indebtedness and preferred career plans when studied without regard to extreme levels of indebtedness or other personal characteristics; and (4) the relationships between indebtedness and career plans are somewhat higher when the focus is on students with a high level of indebtedness and when other selected personal characteristics are considered.

During the second year, the project objectives were to (1) extend the first year's work by additional analysis of demographic factors; (2) examine the impact of federal financial aid programs and policies on Oregon students; (3) predict changes in demand that might result from a change in the  state's community college tax base; and (4) use time series data in analyzing changing patterns of demand.

If the educational leadership will stimulate political leaders to cope constructively with six central problems, the remaining years of the 1970's could be an \"age of wisdom.\" The problems are: (1) the need for the assurance of greater resources in coming years; (2) the need for assistance to private institutions so that they may maintain or increase their share of total enrollment; (3) that the institutions themselves must prove they are capable of effective management of their considerable resources; (4) that higher education can no longer justify its existence with claims of the greater social mobility of college graduates; (5) that career-long education can no longer be sold simply as leisure-time activity;  and (6) the oppressive regulation of individual institutions. Much higher education decision-making is left-handed. The campaign ahead must be waged to reclaim public confidence and gain understanding and respect among federal and state officials.

Medical schools, teaching hospitals, and research institutes are included. The major problem of analysis in this report is to sort out the effects of federally-supported biomedical research from other influences on academic medical centers. The analysis addresses the question of the status of the academic medical community on a number of levels. It examines how centers appear to have adjusted their educational programs, their organizational structures, their scientific activity, and their budgets as a result of their involvement in federal biomedical research. The measurable effects of federal research on the educational programs of centers appear to be limited  largely to those components most involved in research. In general, the academic medical community is responsive to the influence of federal biomedical research programs. The analysis reported here confirms the interdependence between the federal agencies that sponsor research and the academic institutions performing it. Important characteristics of academic medical centers--Ph.D. programs, faculty size, budgets, and scientific activity--are directly related to the federal funding received by individual departments; and overall financial stability is often substantially affected by the stability of federal research funding.

It is based on a certifiable competency in a chosen profession or career. Credit for life and work experiences, technical/occupational credits from the two-year colleges, and noncollege learning experiences are considered for degree credit in the BCA program. The structure and value of the program as well as its philosophy and curriculum design are reviewed and changes are recommended as needed. A faculty/staff questionnaire and a student questionnaire were used. The study revealed that the students in the BCA program naturally differed in many ways from traditional college students, in that they were older, employed full-time, married, and highly motivated,  with most having previous college experience. In general the program increased the students' income and/or helped to develop a new career. The value of awarding credit for life/work experiences and other nontraditional experiences was also significant. The results indicate that the faculty, staff, and students have a very positive attitude toward the program and that its philosophy and structure are very compatible with all involved. (Author/LBH)",

The analysis of the data includes participation rates of women in various forms of postsecondary education, the impact of personal and background variables on access to education, institutional practices that may have discriminatory effects (especially in financial aid), and the special problems of adult women returning to postsecondary education. Recommendations are made for programmatic, research, and legislative efforts to ensure more equal educational access. The data sources used were: (1) research and theoretical literature; (2) statistical reports on high  school and college youth; and (3) special exploratory studies.

The implications of the study are that: (1) program efforts should be undertaken for high school preparation, participation in postsecondary  education, and institutional practices and policies; (2) there is a need for both periodic data collection from high school students and studies to identify the factors that affect women's career decisions; and (3) legislative efforts that go beyond Title IX are needed.

Selection was based on geographic location and budget categories. Following instructions for manual's use at workshops, participating libraries conducted a 3-day study, tabulated and summarized the resulting data. The Library Research Center prepared and sent a computerized profile of each library's scores and comparison statistics as well as questionnaires for feedback on the study. Most participating libraries were capable of conducting the study and summarizing data; most found reasonably clear with the instructions sufficiently easy to follow. Some  questioned the manual's relevance and validity for small libraries. The research center found the manual useful in providing data, but was disappointed in its traditional approach. They suggested research be done to refine the manual for use by small libraries. Also mentioned was the need for more detailed instructions, more subjective-type measures and follow-up activities for feedback. (KP)",

During the developmental phase searches averaged 91.4 each month. Requests came from 64 percent of teachers and 41 percent of administrators. Seventy-five percent of the clients evaluated the project. During the transition phase maintaining and expanding services to rural districts was undertaken. Change from  federal funds to local and state funding occurred. From the transition phase to the implementation phase the project saw a greater expansion of the information systems to 95 school districts, 14 colleges and universities.

Community colleges in California are especially dependent on part-time instructors. Based on a survey of 243 (46%) part-time instructors at Santa Monica College, this study shows that most part-time instructors are committed to the profession of teaching but prohibited from full-time jobs by the employment crisis. Their qualifications compare well with those of full-time faculty and they invest a substantial amount of time in preparation for class. They depend on their small salary from the college for a large proportion of their total income; many support themselves by holding a number of part-time assignments at various educational institutions. Part-time instructors are  aggrieved by their low salaries, lack of fringe benefits, and their low status. Most would accept a full-time job but half would prefer to remain part-time if their pay and status were improved. Part-time teachers are denied the opportunity to prove themselves and then penalized for failure to demonstrate their merit. Additionally, the disproportionate number of women on the part-time staff can be considered as an example of the discriminatory treatment of women in academia. The women are more qualified, invest more time in class preparation, and have fewer outside professional commitments. The survey instrument and tabulated responses are appended. (JDS)",

        "description":"A questionnaire was mailed to all members of the Montgomery County (Maryland) Bar Association in order to assess the need for trained legal assistants among practicing Montgomery County attorneys, and to elicit their opinions of functions legal assistants might perform and recommendations for coursework and other aspects of a legal assistant training program. Responses were received from 14% of the law practices, representing 29% of the practicing attorneys. Seventy-eight percent of the respondents indicated they would like to have their employees take additional training and 72% indicated an interest in hiring a legal assistant, but 86% would prefer to promote their own legal secretaries through legal assistant courses and on-the-job training. Only 54% had any interest in hiring  a new employee to serve as a legal assistant. Because of the very low response rate and overrepresentation of large law firms in the respondent group, it was recommended that the survey results be viewed cautiously. It was suggested that a series of courses in a certificate program might be more appropriate than a separate program leading to a degree. The survey instrument is appended. (JDS)",

Faculty load is computed by dividing weekly student contact hours per discipline by full-time equivalent faculty assigned to that discipline. Average faculty load within the Los Angeles Community College District for fall 1975 was 526, compared to a statewide average of 534. District load figures for the individual instructional disciplines for fall 1975 compared to fall 1974 reveal decreases in fifteen areas and increases in eight. Both districtwide and statewide, largest loads occurred in the social  science disciplines, while smallest loads occurred in the health professions, foreign languages, letters, and library science. From fall 1972 through fall 1975, average District load was lower than the statewide average in all years but 1974. Since 1972 the average District day load has increased 5.4% while day weekly student contact hours have increased 23%. Load data for the nine individual colleges in the District are included in this report. Additionally, graphic and tabular displays comparing District load with average statewide and average small and large college load by instructional disciplines are presented. (Author/JDS)",

The underlying theme of each of the programs has been to help students understand that the college faculty and administration are genuinely interested in the personal as well as academic growth of the student and know that incoming students may not have clear values or goals, and that it is natural for students to be apprehensive about things they are not familiar with. The programs include weekly &quot;rap&quot; sessions for Economic Opportunity Program students, a short-course in  achievement motivation training, locus of control counseling, an Early Orientation Program for students with undecided educational goals, training in affective/confluent education principles for technical career faculty, an in-service faculty program to facilitate student-centered classrooms, group counseling for high anxiety nursing students, and encounter groups to improve student self-concept. Evaluation data for program participants and controls show that these efforts in improving student performance and reducing attrition have been more effective than purely &quot;remedial&quot; programs in academic areas.

Results of the study indicated that the general public had, overall, a positive view of CEU. Factors most crucial in this group's opinions were (1) CEU social activities, (2) quality of academic instruction, (3) adequacy of technical training, (4) adequacy of transfer preparation, and (5) how modern the facilities were. Factors affecting educators' opinions were (1) CEU social activities, (2) quality of academic instruction, (3) convenience of CEU, (4) how modern the facilities were, and (5) length of time necessary at transfer institutions by CEU students  before they could graduate. Factors affecting the opinions of the business community were (1) amount of personal attention received by CEU students, (2) quality of academic instruction, (3) adequacy of technical training, (4) adequacy of transfer preparation, and (5) convenience of CEU. While it was found that CEU enjoys a generally favorable reception throughout the community, results of the survey indicated that the college should expend more effort in clarifying its objectives and role in the community.

The data used in generating this report were based on students registered in regular credit programs in Hawaii community colleges. A general increase in the number of courses, classes, and semester hours was noted at all campuses, due in part to the greater number of courses scheduled on a modular (short-term) basis. Average class size was smaller at most of the colleges. Faculty teaching figures indicated: a generally heavier workload in terms of average semester hours taught by instructors compared to 1975; a generally heavier workload in terms of weekly instructor contact  hours compared to 1974; a decline in productivity ratios for the system compared to 1975; and an unchanged faculty/student ratio of 1:23 for the system. Decline in productivity ratios and average class size are attributed to lighter credit loads carried by both full- and part-time students and the greater proportion of part-time students. Tabular data on courses, classes, semester hours, contact hours, class size by program, average semester and contact hours taught, productivity, and faculty/student ratios are included for each college and for the system.

Some specific activities that institutions involved in community education might engage in are: (1) cooperative program funding; (2) cooperative program supervision; (3) cooperative program/activity development; (4) use of volunteer teachers; (5) cooperative use of resources;  (6) development and conduct of joint community needs surveys; (7) establishment of information banks to be shared; and (8) expansion of efforts in the area of community development.

The four current patterns of state funding (negotiated budget funding, unit rate formula funding, minimum foundation funding, cost-based program funding) are described, followed by a review of the 1975-76 state fund allocation formulas and procedures utilized in each state. A three-part process model for community college funding is offered, including a college allocation formula model designed to redress the detrimental effects of currently utilized formulas under  conditions of decreasing enrollments. The allocation formula model recognizes economies of scale, program cost differences, and the operational cost differences between implementing new programs and maintaining existing ones. In particular it approximates the downward sloping cost curve. Speculation on the future effects of presently discernable trends comprises the final section of the report.

Further, when connected (consciously or unconsciously) to a norm-referenced approach to testing and a curve-based marking practice, the system can and does work serious injustices, requiring that some students \"fail\" and others be scored \"average\" in spite of their remarkable achievements and the fact that they have learned the material. These problems have not gone unnoticed. Beginning in the 1940's, increasing numbers of institutions at all levels of higher education began to experiment with innovative grading systems. This bibliography is not the first survey of the field of literature  relating to innovative grading practices. Rather, the purpose of the present bibliography has been to update foregoing efforts and tap research sources that appear to have been neglected. It focuses on grading innovations at all levels of undergraduate higher education: universities, colleges, and community/junior colleges.

Data for the study were obtained from local institutional personnel and through collection of transcripts of Associate transfer degree holders and of native and transfer baccalaureate degrees. Findings of the study indicated: (1) the development of interinstitutional agreements between most community colleges and senior institutions and establishment of transcript evaluation procedures have improved articulation overall; (2) those institutions which accept the AA degree in fulfillment of  general education requirements and those with well-developed evaluation procedures promote the progress of transfer students to graduation without excess credit accumulation; (3) students who transfer and graduate compare favorably with native students in terms of average grade point averages; and (4) a major impediment to a synchronized public postsecondary educational system stems from lack of agreement upon lower division course content. Recommendations for further improving articulation conclude this report. Study-related materials are appended. (JDS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of nontraditional and traditional counseling and instructional methods in meeting the socio-emotional and academic needs of nontraditional (\"high risk\") community college students. Individualized learner-oriented mastery instruction with emphasis on audiotutorial methods and a composite of counseling methods referred to as a \"counseling for internality\" strategy were selected as the treatment methods. Subjects were students enrolled in developmental studies programs at ten community colleges; colleges were assigned to one of four cells in the study design. Subjects were pre-tested with a variety of instruments to obtain measures of anxiety and locus of control, and subsequent measures were taken over a three-semester period. Data  analyses indicated that traditional counseling and instruction initially produced greater increases in internality and decreases in anxiety but after two semesters fostered a movement toward externality and increases in anxiety, while the nontraditional methods were more effective over the longer period of time. Additionally, the most positive changes occurred in schools where the most humanistic atmospheres prevailed. Data are analyzed by sex and ethnic group and are presented in extensive tables. A review of the literature and study-related materials are included. (JDS)",

In August 1976, an outside team of experts evaluated the MSBCC's self-study and made recommendations in each study area. Numerous positive accomplishments of the Board were noted. Among the recommendations were: continued major responsibility for community college planning, intensification of leadership in developing regional/statewide activities, expanded  utilization of computers, development of a comprehensive management information system, publicizing of alternative funding means, clarification of the community college role in the context of the continuing education function, development of expanded leadership in the area of student placement, renewal of effort in regard to student personnel services, leadership efforts in terms of legal issues and community services, and continued leadership and coordination of the community college sector.

Three matrices were created by matching a sample of student grade point averages against a sample of student scores on the School and College Aptitude Test (Verbal and Quantitative) and the Florida Twelfth Grade Test. Thus, for any given test score, the percentage of students achieving grades of &quot;C&quot; or better could be readily determined, and the minimum test scores associated with a specified percentage of student academic success could be identified. A selected cut-off score would then provide a minimum standard by which a student applicant could be deemed &quot;fully qualified&quot; for admission.  Two applicant pools, one of minority applicants and one of majority applicants, would be created and the top &quot;fully qualified&quot; applicants in each pool admitted in proportion to their representation in the general student body. While some minority applicants selected might have lower absolute scores than majority applicants not selected, all would have a probability of success. Before this method could be implemented, the decision in Bakke v. Regents of the University of California was announced, which precluded its use. Alternatives are suggested. (JDS)",

It was found that many similarities in procedures existed between the colleges. However, while PCC had nine steps in the course approval process including the involvement of its president, LAVC had two additional layers of procedure due to its membership in a multi-college district, and its president was not involved. Greater student involvement and community participation in the curriculum development/approval process  were recommended.

        "description":"Questionnaires were sent to 23 state directors of community college systems during fall 1976 to determine funding patterns for community college community services noncredit offerings. Eighteen responses were received. Results of the survey indicated that over half of the states do not support community services noncredit courses. At least three states distinguish between hobby/recreational courses (not funded) and general education/adult self-improvement courses (funded) although, in practice, this distinction seems to lead to some difficult judgments. Two interesting developments were noted: (1) transformation of noncredit courses into credit courses for the purposes of securing regular funding; and (2) emphasis on development and offering of courses around specific funding  sources. Overall, the survey information revealed a general decrease of state support for community services, confirming the peripheral status of many such programs in their specific institutions. A reversal of this trend might be accomplished through development of coordinating bodies designed to reduce duplication while increasing combined use of facilities, resource people, and publicity channels. Additionally, such a body might increase participation in programs while simultaneously becoming an effective lobbying organization. (Author/JDS)",

An historical review quickly reveals that the free school movement, even at the primary and secondary levels, has been a long, arduous struggle. Equally difficult is the effort to maintain low tuition in contemporary community colleges, particularly in light of rising operational costs and rising taxes. Yet interviews with students illustrate the difficulties or impossibilities of college attendance for many as a consequence of high student costs. The raising of  tuition fees threatens the second chance that our community colleges have represented. (JDS)",

The nucleus of the model is derived from and focused on a single source--that of Job Bank data maintained by the Florida Employment Security Agency. The model described in this report is capable of answering such questions as: What are area job needs and their associated training requirements? Are there major gaps  and shortages among jobs in our communities? Are our educational programs meeting the needs for special skills? What are the educational and economic trends in the community? What will be the economic balance given the present trends? Answers to such questions can aid in policy-making intended to reduce imbalances and to responsibly address determined and projected future needs. Curriculum planning can then be based on the future needs of the community. Overall, the model is intended to be useful in providing information to be applied in reducing the deleterious imbalances between what is and what ought to be. (JDS)",

Generally, coordinators would be responsible for laying out a student's educational program in accord with the student's objectives. Learning experiences could be obtained in a multi-modal manner including radio, TV, video-tape, readings, and independent study. Such experiences would not  have to be restricted to the campus. The concept of managed learning would demand a separate program for each student, taking into account the objectives of the student and the knowledge and skills already possessed by the student.

It is not advisable to draw  general conclusions from the legal decisions that are described since each case is a unique set of facts and circumstances. It is, however, valuable to recognize which cases have established precedents. It is also clear that Education Code 13337.5 has become the central focus of the preponderant number of cases covered in this report. Attorney general opinions and current case statuses are appended.

The model for organizing research consists of four subsystems: goal-setting, program development, cost-effectiveness, and program review. Each subsystem has a distinctive relationship to the decision-making process and to planning, and each has component data fields which identify and categorize information into seven subject categories: students, programs, community, facilities, finance, staff, and organization. The decision-making model describes an environment for converting research findings into planning concepts. Since planning should be a graduated process that involves the making of decisions which strike  an even balance between political considerations and research data, this model takes both competing staff interests and research findings into account through decision alternatives. In the absence of a decision-making apparatus, research is fragmented with no central integrating mechanism and political expediency becomes the dominant force in decisions. These models seek to address the need of translating research data into planning concepts and decision-making alternatives, the crux of the research enterprise. (JDS)",

A series of five cost sheets are presented which allow for cost calculations at differing levels of intra-institutional aggregation, each drawing upon the preceding sheets to process financial data into new information. An Instructor Cost Sheet enables calculation of cost per student contact hour. A Course Cost Sheet provides total cost, average cost per student, and average cost per student contact hour. A Discipline Cost Sheet provides total cost and average cost per student contact hour. A Division Cost Sheet calculates  instructional costs, division indirect costs, and average division indirect cost per student contact hour. A Curriculum Program Cost Sheet yields average cost per student. Use of the forms does not require rearrangement of existing accounting systems; rather, they allow persons outside of financial administration to collect, aggregate, and rearrange financial data and to apply it to the problems of concern to the decision maker.

The project was staffed through small working teams composed of ABE Aides recruited from among community college students, ABE Associate Professionals with 150 hours  of supervised experience as tutors or aides, and ABE Professionals and Specialists with varying combinations of experience and graduate training. During the course of the project, approximately 450 students attended and 265 completed from one to four ABE courses; the remainder either received instruction to develop a specific skill or left the program. Students were pre- and post-tested in reading and mathematics using the California Tests of Adult Basic Education, Level D.

Evaluation results revealed that from 85% to 99% of the  students involved were supportive of the program, although they wished it were more practical, and, overall, instructors were quite positive about the program. It was concluded that the sequential composition program was an extremely sophisticated, carefully constructed, creatively designed sequence of compositional activities sensitive to the needs of students and the philosophies of the college and division. An extensive bibliography and study-related materials are appended. (JDS)",

Areas focused on were financial resource development methods, staff organization and administrative support for development, and resource development efforts. A response rate of 73% was achieved. Results indicated: (1) 64.1% of the two-year colleges were engaged in some form of resource development; (2) approximately half of the colleges did not devote a full-time position to the development effort; (3) private schools utilized more personnel in development than did public schools; (4) nearly one-third of the colleges with development programs received endowments; (5) multi-campus colleges emphasized development more than single-campus colleges;  (6) alumni programs were in the greatest need of development/improvement; and (7) federal grants contributed to public two-year college development more than any other source, while in the private sector, federal grants were surpassed by gifts from individuals, alumni, trustees, and churches.

Characteristics studied were sex, entry status, full/part-time status, program, grade point average, credit completion ratio, and cumulative credits earned. Of 2,499 non-continuing students in spring 1976, 140 (6%) registered at another community college. Of these 140, 56% were males, 71% were new students, 56% were full-time students, 59% were liberal arts majors, 37% had grade point averages below 2.0, 40% had credit-completion ratios below .50, and 74% were students with less than l2 cumulative credits. Only 46% retained  the same major field of study. Significant differences were found between the total population of non-continuing students and those who registered at another college on five of the seven characteristics studied: full/part-time status, program, grade point average, credit-completion ratio, and cumulative credits.

The revised course consisted of individual study using a programmed text, short discussion periods, and one-to-one student/teacher interaction. A total of 1,824 students had received traditional math instruction between 1968 and 1971 at Manatee Junior College (Florida) while 1,297 students had received the modified form of math instruction between 1972 and 1974. Random samples of 60 students from each of these groups were drawn and the average achievement of each group in  basic mathematics compared. Results of the comparison indicated no significant differences in the performance levels or dropout rate of the two groups studied. Although the programmed text did not prove a cure for the problems of basic mathematics, it was found to be an equally effective learning device as lecture, and one which offered the instructor more flexibility in designing learning activities.

With a remarkable degree of consistency, two-year college entrants ranked more or less in the middle of a continuum bounded, on the upper end, by four-year college entrants, and, on the lower end, by those who only graduated from high school. Compared to the students entering the four-year college, two-year college entrants were of lower socioeconomic origin, lesser scholastic ability, and reported less peer/parental/high  school influence to continue their education; were less likely during high school to have been in the college-preparatory curriculum, to have participated in extra-curricular activities, to have had high academic motivation, positive attitudes toward education, or a superior record of academic performance; were less positive about themselves as human beings; and were somewhat more critical about selected aspects of the social, economic, and political system while, at the same time, were less involved or sympathetic toward those seeking systemic changes.

        "description":"This paper explores similarities and differences between Kohlberg's Piagetian or cognitive-developmental view of edcuation and Bruno Bettelheim's psychoanalytic view which stresses the motivational qualities of children's thought. Based on observations of his son, Kohlberg suggests that children's playful attitudes, like their serious ones, reflect their way of thinking, their conception of reality. Examples of children's fantasies are given that can be taken as motivationally or cognitively determined. Cited is the DeVries study which showed that a child's behavior and emotional reaction to the simulated change of a cat to a dog were largely determined by the child's level of thought about constancy, rather than by deeper emotions or fantasies. Children's primitive thinking is  seen as a reflection of their cognitive and adaptive reality-orientation. Kohlberg believes that intrinsically valuable educational goals are goals of universals of human development, higher levels of cognitive, moral, aesthetic, and philosophico-religious thoughts, experiences, and actions. He concludes by illustrating his belief that there are parallel stages of cognitive and social development. Social development represents more than cognitive development and has a more complicated logic, but it includes the logic of concepts of the physical world. The most compelling social stages which have their own logic are moral stages, and morality is based on empathy and justice. (JH)",

The first study assessed the effect of item content on error rate. Three multiple-choice tests, differing only in item content, were given to 38 kindergartners. The second study assessed scanning preferences of 80 preschoolers and kindergartners by a picture naming task. A significant increase in both uniformity and in right-to-left scanning was found between nursery and preschool subjects, but not between preschoolers and kindergartners. Preschoolers showed low uniformity and no clear directional preference. The third study explored directional preferences for visual scanning through a  multiple choice format with two correct alternatives. Each of 80 subjects received two versions of each test: one with target to the left of a horizontal row of alternatives and one with target to the right. The alternative closest to the target was preferred consistently, showing target position to be the major determinant of scanning direction in such formats. The fourth study explored the effect of target position on order reversal errors using (two formats of) the letter matching test: target to the left of horizontally arranged alternatives and target to the right. No significant difference was found in reversal errors for the two positions. (Author/SB)",

Subjects in Study 1 were 60 (kindergarten and first-grade) children. Classification skills were assessed by a pretest. Subjects were assigned to one of two conditions, free recall or cued recall, then were individually shown 20 slides representing familiar categories and items and were asked to recall as many as possible. When subjects in the free recall finished, a second presentation began. When subjects in the cued recall finished, category cues were provided in the form of four questions. This procedure was repeated three times with each child. A repeated measures analysis of variance found three main  effects significant (classifier type, recall condition, trials). Two groups of children were distinguished from the results: (1) those who could both generate and profit from a strategy; and (2) those who could profit from a strategy but were unable to generate it. In the second study, 93 preschool children were pretested on classification skills with a sort-resort task, and then given a shortened memory task. Results indicate that the main effect of classification skill was not significant, but that the main effect of the recall situation was significant. Both studies suggest that operations of class inclusion and hierarchical classification are at least correlated with the transition to efficient use of organization skills in memory. (Author/SB)",

Several hundred households were sampled in two upstate New York counties with strongly contrasting DIPOV Indices. Developed as an instrument for measuring the quality of child life, the DIPOV Index consists of five variables related to an underlying dimension termed &quot;disorganized poverty.&quot; These five are concerned with incidence of: (1) dependent children among families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, (2) children living in incomplete families, (3) premature births, (4) out-of-wedlock births, and (5) venereal disease among persons under twenty. In the major  anlaysis of the study, a hierarchical multiple regression model was used to determine relationships between several DIPOV Indices and a large number of child and parent variables. Evaluation took the form of a distal-to-proximal ecological progression: from counties to Primary Sampling Units (sub-county areas), to neighborhoods and families. It was found that the DIPOV Index is related to many child and parental problems at the sub-county and family levels, but is not as broadly successful as a county-level indicator. (BF)",

Using oral history is seen as a way of redressing traditional history's neglect of women, the popr and other second class citizens, as well as helping students realize that &quot;doing history&quot; is as risky as any other enterprise that attempts to arrive at the truth. Six oral history projects are discussed: (1) the Kent State shootings--interviews with children who were on campus at the time and adults who were actually involved; (2) American education, 1925-1976--American education as charted through the eyes of a first-grade teacher who remained at the same school for 50 years; (3) the Israeli War, 1973--a study  of the perceptions of Israeli school children present during the war; (4) the Akron Head Start program, 1965-1976--interviews with original teachers, parents, and pupils; (5) three generations of child rearing--interviews with grandmothers, mothers and grandchildren; (6) life in a concentration camp--interviews with elementary school children of concentration camp survivors.

        "description":"A study was conducted to determine criteria to measure successful language development and to determine what factors might be considered to be the determiners of this development. Subjects were 16 children, aged 3 years 3 months, selected on an intuitive basis from the 64 children in the older age group to represent the full range of development, from most advanced to most retarded. The data for comparison were of two kinds: samples of the children's spontaneous conversation recorded in their own homes on a time sampling basis over a complete day and subsequently transcribed and linguistically coded and scores on a test of comprehension. Measures considered were mean length of utterance, syntactic complexity, auxiliary verb system, semantic complexity, and pragmatic range.  Teachers' assessment of children's language development was also considered. It was concluded that the factor here called &quot;command of the language system&quot; could be readily discerned in the speech data and that the range of pragmatic functions in the speech addressed to the child was the best predictor of the child's language development. Study findings also suggested that there may not be a close relationship between command of the language and effective communication. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"The effects of spatial density on five styles of children's behavior (aggression, passivity, self-involved play, avoidance, and instability of activity) were studied. Subjects were 72 five-year-olds, half male, half female. Twelve groups of six children participated in 54-minute sessions of free play in an adult-free situation. A multivariate analysis of variance was performed on all five behavior style variables with five factors: density, personal space, sex, order, and group. A univariate analysis of variance for each behavior style was also performed. The multivariate analysis indicated significant effects for density, sex, order and group. The univariate analysis indicated that there are significant effects of density on children's behavior. Children demonstrate different  behavior styles in coping with spatial conditions. Where space is limited, they become more aggressive and interact less positively; they become vigilant onlookers who stand, rather than run, walk or sit; they use various methods of escape and avoidance; and their social play or toy-play activities are more unstable. There appear to be significant sex differences in response to crowding in which boys tend to show greater effects than girls. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"This paper summarizes evaluations of 28 preschool intervention programs designed to train parents to prepare their young children for school achievement. Evaluations selected for review were internal assessments by program staffs. The summary is organized around three questions: (1) Do parent training programs affect children's cognitive development and school achievement? (2) Are some programs more effective than others and why? (3) Do programs affect the parents? Parent training included: (1) direct, didactic teaching during home visits, (2) demonstration, with mothers observing teacher-child interaction, and (3) observation in preschool classrooms. Programs reviewed consistently produced significant gains in children's IQ scores, positively affected school performance and  influenced parents' behavior and attitudes. Some programs produced greater changes than others, depending upon the emphasis on parent-teacher relationship and the degree of structured activities parents used. Of eight programs carrying out follow-up testing, seven reported positive or significant differences favoring program children over controls. Gains of children in experimental programs were maintained into the elementary school years. Although the most complete data in these evaluations came from IQ tests, there is evidence that parent-training programs affect school achievement as well. (Author/BF)",

A five-step procedure is outlined for preparation of the model: (1) identifying the population, (2) pre-assessment evaluation of the three learner groups (students, teachers and parents), (3) identifying instructional program objectives for the three groups, (4) formative evaluation, and (5) summative evaluation. Population identification covers students (4-year-olds), parents and teachers. For pre-assessment, diagnostic evaluation instruments used for children were the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the Beery Test on Visual-Motor Integration and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Teacher pre-assessment measured educational background and instructional  skill development. For parents, instruments were designed to assess parent-child interaction and also to obtain information on children's home activities. Program objectives, based on results of the pre-assessment evaluation, relate to cognitive and affective domains for each of the three groups. Formative evaluation is used to determine the degree of mastery of the learning tasks and to pinpoint the part of the task not mastered. The final component is summative evaluation, to determine the degree of behavioral change in each group of learners and thus measure the effectiveness of the total program. (Author/BF)",

Studies investigating the effect of early entry into first grade on academic achievement have indicated that not only chronological age, but mental age, adjustment, and I.Q. are determining factors in success. Other researchers have stated that although achievement is related to entrance age, this does not mean that raising the minimum entrance age would prove profitable. Research contrasting children matched on sex, intelligence quotient, socioeconomic status, and schools attended has indicated that children who entered at a later chronological age scored  consistently higher on achievement ratings than their younger classmates; another study found that the difference in academic achievement between early and late school starters was not statistically significant. In research on early entry as related to school adjustment, findings reported showed that a greater percentage of children who entered kindergarten or first grade at an early age had adjustment problems compared to later entrants. Another study indicated that earlier entrants had more speech defects, nervous indications, and personal and social maladjustments than did older entrants. Sex differences in the variables influencing adjustment have also been found. (Author/SB)",

The doctrine that humankind is of an evil nature is seen to be a fundamental tenet of faith for the Puritan family; and the moral aspect of a child's personality is seen to occupy all the parent's attention. This view is heard in such phrases as &quot;You are a bad boy.&quot; Rationalism can be characterized by an assumption that life and the universe are rational and there is a solution to every problem. Parents are seen to insist on academic skills and book learning and regard reason as the one significant human characteristic.  Romantics have held the view that all people are to allow the child to find its inner voice untrammeled by the institutions of society. Romanticism emphasizes feeling and recognizes no finite limits to a child's capacities or to the parents' patience. Romanticism, however, sets no criteria for achievement of an adequate or livable human response. (Author/MS)",

An argument is presented against the concept that some children (particularly from minority groups) have &quot;no language&quot; and cites personal research with Maori children which suggests that the types of skills being tested make considerable differences in the results. It is also suggested that children in structured programs fail to maintain gains because these gains are simply an increase in vocabulary and older children, who are more mature, more socially confident and often better motivated to learn than  younger children, can rapidly catch up with gains made by younger children. It is also argued that it makes little difference whether children start their formal schooling at 5, 6 or 7 years of age and that the kind of &quot;structure&quot; which would be desirable in preschools is to have teachers who are well trained and possess an up to date knowledge about language development.

These differences are seen as arising from causes such as the special training of each group and the nature of the work they do, the distribution of the sexes in each group and the social institutions which back them. The concept of the whole child, generally supported in preschool teacher training, may conflict with the researcher's need to analyze and dissect. Emphasis on individual differences among children is noted as basic to general teacher thought, yet difficult to follow in research designed to develop programs for a wide range of children. Research workers' tendency to impose school-type models on preschools is attributed to their affiliation with  university departments of education and psychology rather than, for example, anthropology or linguistics. Cited as a major source of differing viewpoints between preschool personnel and researchers is that workers in the preschool establishment are almost all female, while workers in the educational research establishment are predominantly male. Differences in research topics related to researcher sex are discussed in detail and attitudes towards program evaluation and pupil testing are noted. The involvement of preschool personnel in the planning of research projects affecting them is urged. (BF)",

A list of competencies, generated and agreed upon by a large number of Child Development experts, is the starting point for the assessment procedure. The competency list was developed under the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Office of Child Development, by a task force, the Child Development Consortium, Incorporated. The task force established six major areas of responsibility for preschool teachers, developed a preliminary set of competencies under each of six major areas and added a set of  personal capacities necessary for relating to children. The competencies were then validated by means of a survey of practitioners and others in the field. An interdisciplinary team approach was used which might be a model for the development of other competency-based assessment procedures. Methodology is described in terms of professional expertise and roles and step-by-step procedures used. A few examples of competencies are appendixed. (Author/MS)",

Arguments in support of an AFT-proposed amendment to the Child and Family Services Act under Congressional consideration are based on a national need for expansion of day care, coinciding with recent public school staff surpluses and under-utilization of space. Growing child care needs of working women and single parents are cited. In the discussion of advantages of public school sponsorship, it is claimed that the overall picture of the field is one of inadequate services. Deficiencies in existing facilities are described, as well  as inadequate training and certification procedures and shortcommings of profit-making programs. Public school prime sponsorship is seen as simplifying administrative needs and promoting general accessibility. Related issues discussed include: costs of providing early childhood and day care programs; recommended standards for teacher education, certification and training; and parent involvement and education.

Currently the largest international organization concerned with preschool education, OMEP is presented with specific recommendations: (1) that members, possibly by regions, select and focus on one country or region, (2) that OMEP establish organizational linkages with other groups working in the area of cross-national studies, and (3) that OMEP foster the goal of cross-national studies as understanding and development of the field, rather than for purposes of comparison and criticism. Need is seen for developing systematic descriptive frameworks for organizing inquiry  and for observing programs. Some neglected areas are: cross-national study of policy formation; observation of teacher-child, child-child and child-material interaction in programs; and the study of regional and ethnic cultural variations and educational beliefs and practices where there is no homogeneous national pattern. It is stressed that observations of teacher practices and children's behavior be interpreted within the goals and concepts of the particular culture and society. (Author/BF)",

Early childhood is seen as the optimum time for acquiring certain musical skills, of which the ability to sing in tune is considered primary. The vocal productions of young children are grouped into two broad categories: the group chant and the private song. Children are to be encouraged to sing freely (not only at scheduled times), to share their songs with others and to listen to certain types of contemporary and primitive music which have musical characteristics similar to their own songs. The Kodaly method for sequential vocal development is described, and the importance of  developing aural perceptiveness is stressed. The focus of the music program should be to nurture music as a creative, self-expressive medium with technical help in skill development secondary. Development of a classroom music center with a variety of instruments is described. Group activities suggested include: experimentation with varying instrumental tone colors; &quot;aural walks&quot; in field, street and schoolyard; experiments with materials such as paper or water; rhythmic improvisations based on ordinary physical activities; and imitation of compositional devices heard on records.

The purpose of the project is to: (1) describe the situation of the child in school together with changes occurring in that situation; (2) describe outward conditions in the school environment which may have a bearing on the child's opportunities for developing self-perception; (3) try to understand the child's experience of itself and its surroundings and any changes occurring in that experience; (4) analyze the relationships between outward conditions and the child's opportunities for developing  self-perception. Theory and concepts are discussed such as: the rationale for the study of self-perception; some central concepts of the theory of identity: security, activity and dialogue; and premises of a theory concerning the relationship between school and society. Some empirical first impressions are noted and research methods (participant observation and interviews and conversations) are described. (MS)",

Covered in detail are: (1) the foster care system, its programs and goals; (2) foster children and their natural and foster families; (3) agency staffing and services; (4) fiscal considerations; and (5) community involvement. Emphasis is placed on the need to arouse public concern for action in improving foster care systems, which in the U.S. today involve some 400,000 children. Although differing in geographic location, ethnic composition and economic structure, all five states show similar inadequacies in their foster family service systems. Preventive and preplacement services  are seen as particularly inadequate: family problems go unaided until the crisis state, forcing otherwise unnecessary foster care placement. Numbers of children in foster care then become overwhelming and children's needs and problems are neglected and increase in complexity, requiring specialized care facilities which are lacking. It is suggested that other states might find this report useful. Synopses of the major studies are included in the appendix. (Author/BF)",

Correlations between the Kansas Reflectivity-Impulsivity Scale for Preschoolers (KRISP) and classroom behavior were computed for two groups of Head Start classes (121 children, ages 2 to 5) that differed on the amount of adult-imposed classroom structure. Classroom observations were collected using a time sampling procedure during a baseline period of approximately three months, and during a two-month period in which experimental treatments were introduced. The KRISP was administered during the last month of baseline observation and at the end of the experimental period. Results seem to indicate that correlations  between impulsivity and classroom behavior were limited to the low structure classrooms. In the low structure classes, impulsive children were less aggressive, less assertive, and less likely to show understanding of others or to engage in prosocial behavior such as cooperation, helping, and sharing than their reflective peers. Impulsive children were higher than reflectives on two indices of self-regulation: responsibility during pick up time and waiting patiently during delays. (Author/SB)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the influence of home and school environments on learning in children. Studies are cited which support the hypothesis that the home environment is the major predictor of school achievement. These studies deal with &quot;status&quot; variables such as father's occupation and education, mother's education, and social and economic status of the family. &quot;Status&quot; variables are contrasted with &quot;process&quot; variables, which indicate what parents do to encourage or support (directly or indirectly) the educational achievements and related attitudes of their children. Process variables in both home and school are of interest because they provide clues to structuring optimal learning environments. Research indicates a correlation between certain (process variables) in the home  environment and school achievement. These process variables can be seen as facets of three main conceptual dimensions of the home environment: (1) the verbal dimension, (2) activities congruent with the expectations and demands of school, and (3) the general cultural level of the home. Variables found in research to be important to the school environment are teacher competence, classroom teaching procedures, and the ability to elicit student motivation. It is suggested that in addition to considering process variables and what it is these process variables change, researchers should also look at the climate surrounding parent-child and teacher-student interactions.

The goals of the program are discussed together with a description of the role of the day care consultant. The steps by which the program was implemented are described in detail. The impact of the program was measured on several variables by comparing centers receiving consultation with those who did not. Measurements were taken (pre and post consultation) on the children's behavior and the expressed attitudes of the teachers. Post only measures were collected from the parents and from teachers as to their satisfaction with different aspects of the consultation process. It is concluded that mental health consultation to day care can be an effective way of furthering  the prevention of behavioral disturbance in young children, although the effects are difficult to demonstrate empirically. Specific suggestions are given in three areas for professionals interested in beginning a consultation program to day care. (Author/SB)",

Ten assistant teachers (most of whom began in Head Start as parents) in ten elementary schools accompany the children into kindergarten and the first three grades. A second project goal is to enable each assistant teacher to earn a B.A. degree and teaching credential. The retention rate of adults is seen as significant, while transiency among children has been high. An achievement of the program has been the emergence of a co-equal working relationship between  community people and professionals, with the administrative staff recruited from paraprofessionals from minority and inner-city communities. Four elements observed in the course of the program were (1) assurance of progress to participants, with help in attaining degrees and credentials, (2) support of development of each person, (3) facilitating communication and (4) fostering continuity of relationships, in line with the project's essential concept that a person, rather than a curriculum model, will provide a smooth Head Start-to-school transition.

Covariance analyses revealed the program school children (Buerkle) had a more positive self-competency, enjoyed a more positive attitude toward school, and received more positive  teacher support than the children who attended the control school. In addition to the programmatic main effects, the analyses revealed several developmental patterns by sex and by grade level. Data is presented in a number of graphs and charts. (Author/MS)",

A specific task of Developmental Services of the Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences was to optimize the utilization of professional staff in a development assessment clinic. Clinic procedures utilized force-field analysis principles adapted to a problem-oriented record and an interdisciplinary staff consisting of medical, social work, clinical psychology and child development specialists. Focus for the child developmentalist was primarily on screening of children from birth to six years. The unique perspective of each discipline was represented and incorporated into the management plan. Illustrations are  given of how the child developmentalist emphasizes the significance of developmental sequences and adds an understanding of the importance of the context in which behavior occurs as well as the context in which the child develops. The child developmentalist identifies critical points in parent-child and child-environment interaction patterns and indicates to the parents how they may be able to change the developmental outcome of their children.

        "description":"Two studies combining teacher questionnaires, classroom observation, and pupil interviews were conducted to contrast formal and informal teaching practices in open plan and conventional classrooms. Study I sampled 12 teachers of classes including second year junior pupils (8-9 years of age); Study II sampled 30 teachers, including 13 with mixed teaching styles. Instruments were chosen (or designed and piloted) to look at grouping patterns and organization within the classroom; organization and evaluation of the curriculum; patterns of movement and language in the classroom; and teaching styles and practices. Results indicated that formal teachers used class teaching significantly more than informal teachers; that there was a significantly greater proportion of teacher talk in the  formal class; and that movement at pupils' discretion was not permitted except for queuing for teacher attention. No framework for pupil choice was provided. Small groups were used occasionally as an organizational device, but did not include pupil planning. Informal teachers structured a network of activities, providing significantly more simultaneously occurring activities and opportunities for pupil choice, including small group work involving pupil planning. There was significantly more movement at the pupils' discretion. Pupil talk was more valued than in traditional classrooms; more than 80 percent of the language to which the pupil was expected to attend was from peers. Appendices include the instruments used in the studies. (Author/SB)",

Federal legislation concerning children is examined, and researchers discuss effects of day care programs on children. Jane Gold, author of &quot;Checking Out Childcare&quot;, describes the child care business, its dimensions and licensing practices. Peggy Pizzo, author of &quot;Infant Child Care Debate&quot;, discusses parents' guilt feelings in relation to outside child care. Advantages and disadvantages of public school sponsorship of day care are considered. Despite support for day care centers and child care in the public  schools, the fastest and most widely used form of child care appears to be home care. Psychologist Jerome Kagan has found home care, inside or outside the child's home, to be preferred over day care centers by most parents. He considers staff-child ratio the most important factor in day care quality, recommending ratios of 3 to 1 for children under 18 months and 6 to 1 for children 18 months to three years. A family home care teacher-trainer is interviewed on the advantages of the family-home environment. The director of a large day care center tells of long waiting lists and the social costs involved. The Federal role in preschool education, including prospects for comprehensive Federal child care legislation, are discussed by Congressman John Brademas and representatives of various  child care interest groups. The staffing-ratio controversy is discussed. (Author/BF)",

Transcribed from the National Public Radio weekly broadcast, &quot;Options in Education,&quot; the program includes a lengthy montage of children's voices, giving impressions of camp experiences. Interviews focus mainly on summer camp safety legislation. An official of the American Camping Association (ACA) discusses how parents should choose a child's camp, emphasizing the need for safety standards. Instances of fraud and misrepresentation in camp advertising are described by a day camp director. Comprehensive laws dealing with youth camp safety exist in only seven states, and nearly  one-half of the states have no regulations concerning personal health and medical services. Although the ACA provides strict standards, only half the camps in the United States are ACA-accredited. Legislation to create a national camp safety standard was introduced into Congress ten years ago, but has not been enacted. A coalition formed to promote camp safety legislation, consisting largely of agency camps such as Boy and Girl Scouts and the YMCA, is described. Arguments critical of Federal regulation, presented by camp directors, cite over-regulation and imposition of inappropriate or unnecessary standards. A summer camp for retarded children and a combination remedial school and day camp are also described briefly. (BF)",

According to the screening results of the Harris Tests of Lateral Dominance, 36 subjects ranging from 9-12 years were divided equally into three groups of left, right, and mixed lateral dominance. In order to measure divergent cognitive thought, the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, Verbal Tests, Form A and Figural Tests, Form A were administered and scores reported in terms of seven subscores of both verbal and figural fluency, flexibility and originality, and scores for figural elaboration only. A two-way analysis of variance procedure reported a significant difference existed between the lateral dominance of the individuals with regard to their mean scores on the  Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking at the .01 level of confidence. In order to locate the exact source of variance, further investigation was necessary. A one-way analysis of variance of the main effects was performed and results indicated that a significant difference existed within the two categories of verbal fluency and figural elaboration at the .05 level. That is, the group demonstrating left lateral dominance performed significantly better on those two subscores. (Author/MS)",

Subjects were 112 nursery school children. Teacher verbal behavior was measured by the Withall Social Climate Index resulting in a facilitative score and a directive score for each teacher. Child language change was determined by a pretesting and posttesting with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and with an Analysis of 50 Consecutive Statements. Within the limitations of this study and from the findings, it was concluded that teachers consistently used a pattern of facilitative or directive verbal behavior  in their classrooms; that language for 4-year-old children in this study, as measured by the instruments used, continued to change in the 6-month period; and that for children in this sample, change in use of complexity of sentences was greater in classrooms in which teachers used more directive verbal behavior. In the other aspects of language change studied, language of the children in this sample developed fairly consistently irrespective of teacher verbal behavior as measured by the Climate Index.

Major WSSSP objectives are identified as: developing ungraded programs (K-12); developing appropriate uses of programmed materials; providing teacher preparation for small schools and rural living; and developing approaches to school board members' orientation to the education problems of rural America. Using a case study approach to the evaluation of the total project, data collected at the beginning of the project and again at its completion are to be analyzed in terms of observable changes resulting from project activities in each participating school. Among the activities cited in  this Colorado report are: advisory meetings; regional workshops; a superintendent's conference; a scheduling conference; an amplified telephone project; and an annual summer workshop. Also, this report contains the names of administrators, teachers, and a short description of WSSSP proposals. Reports are presented for project activities which have progressed far enough to have some significant findings re: the utilization of programmed type materials in English; a general music class; independent study in science; individualized instruction in mathematics and language; and the telephone method of teaching in a non-graded school.

        "description":"During the 1963-64 school year, a secondary teacher from the rurally isolated area of Silverton, Colorado initiated an individualized program in problem solving for a senior social studies class (N=8-10). Utilizing community resources, the instructor planned several units on government, while the students selected resource materials from the library. Each unit involved a period of: investigation (individualized data gathering projects); group discussion and activities (hypotheses exploration); and individualized hypothesis evaluation. Evaluation criteria established by student-teacher consensus were used to evaluate each student in terms of: conflicting data; logical solutions; satisfaction of student curiosity; student stimulation; use of student ability; and student attitude.  Objective unit tests were designed to elicit the solution to a problem so that students would take a position making all answers relate to that position. Examining grading criteria, evaluative and open student questionnaires, and personal observations, the teacher evaluated the project in terms of student, teacher, school, and community improvement. Results indicated students: engaged in critical thinking; were interested and worked effectively in problem solving; better understood the areas covered; developed skills in decision making and research. Problems encountered were difficulties with: slow students and problem solving; covering desired material; keeping all students working; and finding sufficient resources. (JC)",

        "description":"Seventh grade students (N=9) from a small rural school in Ridgway, Colorado were exposed to a teacher-developed individualized program in modern math during the 1962-63 school year and again the following year. The students were divided into an average and above group and a below average group; group assignments were determined by IQ scores, the California Arithmetic Test for Junior High (grade placement and percentile standing), and consultations with the student's former math teacher. Classroom procedures involved: use of two texts (one for each group); a self-paced format wherein students had access to problem answers and were required to test themselves only when they felt ready (a score of 80 or above was generally required for all but the poorest students); and no assigned  homework. Each student was evaluated by September and May comparisons of SCAT, STEP, arithmetic, aptitude, and grade placement scores. Results indicated: the poorest student made an improvement of nearly one whole grade placement; the poorest improvement was .4% of a grade placement (slightly higher than average); and the two best students improved 2.4 and 3.4 grade placements. Changes affected during the 1963-64 school year involved: student goal setting; required homework (20 minutes); special projects; and different forms of the California test (results indicated gains, though not as large as those of the previous year).

Objectives were to: increase math offerings; decrease scheduling problems; increase motivation; provide for individual differences; meet requirements re: modern math and examining bodies; limit heavy grading duties; promote student development in formula solving, graph reading and construction, math nomenclature, etc.; and increase teacher time for individualized and/or group instruction. Employing a teacher's aide, a grading system built upon point accumulation, and student carrels, programmed courses in basic  math, beginning and advanced algebra, plane geometry, and trigonometry were offered twice daily in two 45 minute periods. Results indicated: high student interest at the beginning of the year with a gradual slow down, particularly among the slower students; difficulty in getting all students to work at a rate commensurate with their ability; most teacher attention directed at slow students; increased teaching demands; and increased course completion by graduating seniors (the appendices presents a 1959-65 breakdown of course completion, the grading system, and a student's evaluation of programmed instruction).

This study aimed to: build an overall social typology of the rural communities in Siberia; elucidate the role of employment structure among other type-forming factors of social differentiation; build a special typology of communities by employment structure; investigate the essence and intensity of the shifts in the employment structure between 1967 and 1972; and study the relationship of dynamic shifts in employment to its initial structure in 1967. Data were derived from 2 surveys which described 157 rural communities in Siberia by several social indicators in 1967 and 1972. A &quot;linguistic method&quot; of data processing on computer which combined factor  analysis with automatic classification of objects was used. It was shown that the differences in the social status of certain communities were reduced to differences by three factors: social-branch employment structure, educational level, and level of social services rendered to the population. Concurrent examination of the first two factors discerned community types with different social, industrial, and skill structure of employment. The analysis of dynamic shifts between 1967 and 1972 indicated that their nature was essentially different for those community types which were discerned according to the 1967 statistics.

        "description":"The contributions to societal integration of the flexible and diversified religious institution of rural Appalachia in the United States were compared and contrasted with the contributions of the more or less monolithic and state-controlled rural church in Greece. It was found that the process of integration of rural society into the larger social system has been better served in the U.S., particularly in rural Appalachia, than in European countries, especially Greece. Religious pluralism in Appalachia has functioned to alleviate the anxieties of the socially maladjusted whose needs are not met by other established social institutions, and also has displayed the flexibility needed to function as a status maintenance and stabilization vehicle for those who have done well (having  achieved social mobility) in society. Thus, in addition to its generally pluralistic nature, and skillfulness in securing membership and participation, the Appalachian rural religious institution has provided more opportunities than the rural Greek church (and probably other European churches) for the alleviation of anxieties produced by modern societal changes. These research findings offer support for surveys which indicate that the U.S. religious institution, as compared to other Christian nations, especially European ones, has been the most successful in this respect.

        "description":"In Norway, one of the world's most developed nations, a considerable proportion of households still obtain income from more than one source. From the time rural North Norway was settled, households have combined production for sale with production for their own consumption and have exploited various resources to do so. The household's requirements determine how its resources are to be allocated and the relative amounts of income it obtains in cash and kind from each source. Household priorities are thus translated into a pattern of consumption, defined broadly to include free time. The strategy adopted for obtaining an income of not only the required size, but also of the required composition, is determined by this desired consumption pattern. In an economic system such as this,  concepts such as job or occupation are limited in their usefulness. The activities performed in order to earn a living cannot be defined as jobs, or even part-time jobs. Of greater importance for the composition of the income spectrum is the &quot;Technological and Administrative Task Environment&quot; (TATE) which is defined as &quot;a social constellation within which any household decision-maker technically acts&quot;. A household which exploits more than one income source has the advantage of not being entirely constrained by the section of the TATE associated with any one of them. Generally it has enough flexibility to alter the balance of its activities if circumstances change. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"The theoretical differentiation of the village from the town is made on the basis of a complex of characteristics, which includes: the village was engaged mainly in agriculture; the culture, living conditions and organization of public services were far behind those of the town; the village did not exercise the functions of an administrative, cultural, financial and production center of other settlements; the village had up to 10,000 inhabitants; and the density of living was qualitatively lower compared to the town. However, today some changes have occurred in these characteristics and in their complex. Today the majority of the inhabitants are engaged in &quot;industrial&quot; labour (in factories, transport, public services) outside the village or in small enterprises in their own  village. The agricultural labour has become a subtype of the industrial labour. In terms of culture, living conditions, and organization of public services, the village has become equal to, or has an apparent tendency to become equal to, the town. The quantity of population loses much of its large community significance because today people travel much more and use other contemporary means of communication. As the village rises above agriculture, the town also &quot;rises above&quot; management since many of the city people occupying managerial posts can live in well organized nearby villages. Thus, the village way of life tends to become equal to the way of life in the town. (NQ)",

        "description":"The effects of land reform programs on community development and the overall socioeconomic development in the three Near Eastern countries of Jordan, Iraq, and Syria were assessed. Land reform was defined as the: redistribution of rights in land ownership and management; reform in the land tenancy patterns; and land settlements, including the transformation of nomadism to settled farming, particularly on newly reclaimed land. Measures taken by Lebanon and Saudi Arabia in the area of nomadic settlement and land reclamation were also analyzed. The analysis of the effects was only a preliminary one due to the lack of adequate empirical scientific evidence on the subject. It has shown that among the main purposes of undertaking land reform measures were: accomplishing an equal  distribution of agricultural wealth, alleviating social injustices in peasant societies, and economic growth. However, the majority of the measures in the region were not considered successful. Among the effects of land reform were: the regulation of the relationship of peasants with their landlords; the opportunity for peasants to become land owners; the substantial increase in agricultural land; an increase in the farmer's income and agricultural production; in Iraq and Syria drastic measures affected very deep rooted values and traditions; and since human development was not emphasized, social services were still lacking.

        "description":"There are 4,500 &quot;Cajuns&quot; occupying a rural area in southern Alabama which was once practically isolated from the surrounding society. Local residents regard these &quot;Cajuns&quot; as neither White nor Black. It is generally recognized that they are a recent mixture of several distinct peoples. There is no evidence that these people have a coherent set of customs, legends, traditions, festivals, special holidays, or other identifying symbols to unite them. The people do not have a unique religion of their own nor do all belong to the same religious denomination. The community represents a unique ethnic island in that the customary factors which unite a people are not present. However, they do have a sense of group consciousness which is derived from factors other than those traditionall  regarded as important. Probably the strongest single factor providing a sense of in-group consciousness, identification, and cohesiveness is the extensive kinship linkages which exist among this relatively large population. This paper discusses the historical events that led to the formation and subsequent development of the &quot;Cajuns&quot; in Alabama. Topics covered are their kinship linkages, their school situation, and their use of the term &quot;Cajun&quot;. (NQ)",

        "author":["Goldberg, Carole E."],
        "description":"In the past, courts have described American Indian sovereignty in ways that suggest the existence of power in the Navajo Tribe to tax the activities and property of non-Indians on their reservation. These judicial statements were made, however, at a time when tribal governments were viewed as transitional mechanisms for Indian assimilation, and contact between Indians and non-Indians on the reservation was minimal. Current efforts by non-Indians to develop energy resources on the Navajo Reservation will result in greater benefits for the Navajo people if the Navajos can exercise taxing power to the exclusion of the states. Since large-scale taxation assumes and permits the growth of a permanent, complex tribal government, legal doctrine and legislative schemes may alter as the  Navajos assert themselves. Changes in the definition of tribal sovereignty and the extent of Federal and state limitations on taxing and other tribal powers should be anticipated if the Tribe begins taxing non-Indians. Navajo taxing power over non-Indians seems to have a firm basis in current judicial doctrine. There are few Federal restraints on such tribal power, but Federal restraints may be increased via the Indian Civil Rights Act, especially in terms of homogenizing tribal with state/local government wherein freedom from state taxation would require the Tribe to assume some state functions.

        "description":"Divided into three sections, this research bulletin presents: (1) a brief review of changes in the American Indian mortality and fertility rates, illustrating a transition process much like that experienced by developing nations; (2) an analysis of variations in the social and economic organization of different parts of the Navajo Reservation; (3) a study of the correlation between the Navajo economic variations and their mortality and fertility rates. The study employs data derived from U.S. Public Health Service Publications for the years 1968 and 1969 and examines the following variables: birth weight; birth order; age of mother and father; age of death; % of unknown fathers; % of male mortality; infant mortality; % on welfare; death rate per 1,000 population (accident, crude,  and infectious); and crude birth rate. Using the eight Indian Health Service Units located on the Navajo Reservation as regional designators, this study indicates that: the eastern end of the Reservation is more highly developed economically than the western end; there are higher mortality and fertility rates in the west; there are higher male death rates in the east; and there is a tendency for causes of death in the west to be infectious rather than man-made in origin. It is suggested that accidents, the most important cause of Navajo deaths, are not susceptible to the kind of curative medicine practiced so successfully in the past. (Author/JC)",

Attempting to differentiate between real lifestyle transformations within the affected areas and rural to urban migration, comparisons were made in terms of: (1) Demography (age and education of household heads and spouses; marriage patterns; religious affiliation; household size and composition; length of residence; location of prior residence); (2) Social Organization (camp size and composition; community residence after  marriage; livestock ownership and patterns of cooperation beyond the camp; hauling wood and water; cooperative arrangements for herding sheep; stock permits); (3) Economics (income; wage, unearned, livestock, agricultural, and craft income; major expenses; commercial transactions). Results indicated: incomes, levels of employment, and levels of education were all higher in the impact area around Lake Powell, while levels of unemployment and welfare expenditures were lower; household heads were younger and family groups were smaller in the impact areas; rural populations were unaffected; observed differences were not so much the result of transformation as the effect of migration of younger, more skilled workers.

        "description":"After surveying the vocational rehabilitation (VR) needs of disabled migratory and seasonal farmworkers in the U.S., a national plan to meet those needs was developed, in cooperation with designated state agencies. A random cluster sample of farmworkers was interviewed to determine service needs. Additional planning data were gathered by interviews with rehabilitation counselors and administrators, and with the staff of other agencies and organizations. Rehabilitation agencies were represented on the study's advisory committee. It was found that an estimated 293,000 farmworkers were eligible for VR services. Although their disability rate was three times that of the general U.S. population, farmworkers were less likely to receive VR services. Those receiving VR services were less  likely to be successfully rehabilitated. This report presents information pertaining to: background characteristics of migratory and seasonal farmworkers, incidence of disabilities among farmworkers, types and severity of disability, rehabilitation services for disabled migrants, racial/ethnic classification of farmworkers, income and household size, seasonal migration, resettlement for vocational purposes, education, language ability and preference, awareness of VR and other service programs, factors affecting service delivery, agency priorities and incentives for counselors, current VR programs for farmworkers, and barriers to successful rehabilitation. The proposed service delivery system is described. (NQ)",

Comprising one third of the total time alloted for the course, this home economics component involves the following units: (1) Life Style (2 weeks and 10 periods); (2) Individual and Family Roles (2 weeks and 10 periods); (3) Income Relating to Life Style (3 weeks and 15 periods including: sources of income; spending money; planned  buying; financial planning); (4) Facing the Possibility of Children (3 weeks and 15 periods including: the role of parenthood; the child as a family member; child care; quality of family life); (5) The Community (2 weeks and 10 periods). Each unit is presented in tabular form and includes the following: concept to be developed; a generalized assumption; specific objectives; supportive learning; the learning experience, including hand out suggestions, human resource suggestions, activities, etc.; and written resources. Additionally, a bibliography is presented following each unit. (JC)",

        "description":"The report presents data on the demographic, social, and economic characteristics of persons 14 years of age and over who did hired farmwork during 1975, and summarizes the pertinent changes and trends in the size, composition, earnings, and employment patterns of the hired farm working force. Information is given on the Spanish-origin, white, black, and other hired farmworkers. Data were obtained through a survey conducted by the Census Bureau as a supplementary part of the December 1975 Current Population Survey. Tabular data are organized into four areas--historical data, the 1975 data, earnings by source of employment, and information on those employed solely in hired farmwork during the year and those employed in hired nonfarm work in addition to their farmwork. In 1975,  there were about 2.6 million persons in the hired farm working force. The annual employment of farmworkers appeared to have stabilized after the long-term downward trend of prior years. Generally, hired farmworkers were young (median age 23 years), male (77%), and resided in nonfarm places (79%). Annual earnings averaged $2,552. About 72% were white, 11% were of Spanish origin, and 17% were blacks and others. Approximately 1.5 million worked only as farmworkers during the year; the remaining 1.1 million did both farm and nonfarm work. About 188,000 (7%) were migrant farmworkers. Annual earnings for these workers averaged $2,003, or $21.05 per day for 95 days of farmwork; 61% of all migrants did only farmwork during the year. (NQ)",

        "description":"Summarizing an Economic Research Service (ERS) publication, this guide to a balanced rural-urban growth describes the results of a computer based ERS model which examined seven strategies to improve rural economic development. Based on 1960-70 trends, the model is described as asking how much would be required of each of the following strategies to close the rural-urban income gap sooner than the 1960-70 trend indicates: (1) stop out-migration; (2) reduce natural increase of population; (3) expand labor force; (4) create jobs; (5) increase productivity of resources; (6) expand capital stock; (7) expand markets. As reported here, the seven strategies were analyzed via simulation in terms of the target year 1990, and the preferred strategies were then compared with changes in  economic activity observed between 1970-73. Results are presented as follows: each strategy has some potential for raising nonmetropolitan income, but in isolation each displays undesirable side effects on migration, dependency, wages, unemployment, or the level of general business activity; a mixed strategy which promotes joining the labor force, creating jobs, and increasing resource productivity can stimulate rural growth with few undesired side effects; strategies which enhance capital accumulation and expand markets have limited benefits; strategies which directly influence migration or natural population increase are not required.

        "description":"Home interviews were used to investigate the degree to which Mexican American parents have retained traditional Mexican family attitudes and childrearing practices. Respondents were 118 Mexican American and 148 Anglo American parents, residing in the same working-class neighborhoods in San Jose, California, who were married to persons of the same cultural background and had at least one young child. The typical respondent was a young mother who did not work outside the home and had four children. Mexican American parents were predominately second generation Americans. Interviewers were undergraduates; bilingual Mexican American students interviewed Mexican American respondents. Presented in three sections, the interviews gathered data on their: background, i.e., the number of  children, religious affiliation, number of years of formal education, occupation, language spoken at home, country of birth; attitudes toward close family ties; and parent-child relations, i.e., the rules the child was expected to follow, child's chores, parent's ways of punishing and rewarding the child. After statistically controlling for differences in socioeconomic status, it was found that Mexican American parents (1) felt close family relations were more important and visited their relatives more often and (2) encouraged similar family-centered attitudes in their children by restricting where they played and with whom.

The second phase encompasses program development which includes the statement of purpose and objectives, the role of the school site, and analysis of these roles for program development. The final phase concerns site design or a graphic representation combining site analysis and program development.

A second paper discusses visualizing in mathematics, while a third reports on a combined algebra-geometry curriculum for Japanese secondary schools. A fourth looks at the solution of problems by geometrical methods, giving 14 examples of problems, and a fifth paper discusses the solution of polynomial equations. A sixth paper advocates that topics from topology,  probability, and operations research be included in geometry. Among the seven papers written in German, one discusses recent trends in teaching geometry, a second is concerned with the role of intuition, a third looks at the place of descriptive geometry, and a fourth considers geometry at the primary school level. A fifth paper exhibits a variety of approaches to geometrical thinking through organized sets of problems, a sixth is concerned with a progressive pedagogy of mathematics, and a seventh paper reports on a problem oriented approach to geometry starting from combinatorial geometry. A final paper (also written in German) reports on the discussions in the working groups at the conference. (DT)",

However, any increase in creative drama within language arts programs is jeopardized by current conditions, which include limited economic resources, teacher cutbacks, declining enrollments, the back-to-basics movement, and the movement to provide additional funding for the gifted (which might appropriate whatever dramatics effort does exist). This paper points out that proponents of creative dramatics need to understand and experience some of the uses of language which spontaneous drama permits, discusses a schema for varying styles of language, and examines the use of these styles in  drama activity. The paper gives examples of participatory work in creative dramatics and states, in conclusion, that carefully controlled longitudinal research is needed to support the inclusion of creative drama in language arts programs.

        "description":"High school juniors and seniors participated in three studies of the effects of a thematic organizer on passage comprehension. Comprehension was measured using a cloze procedure in the first study and using a passage-reproduction task in the second and third studies. A thematic organizer (material presented to provide a context for the passage) was presented to the experimental groups before they read the passages; control groups were not given the thematic organizers. Inconsistent results were found between passages and between studies. This was interpreted as indicating that the type of material plays a major role in comprehension and in comprehension measures, limiting the generalizability of studies involving language samples.

Journal statements collected from 26 students in two classes were evaluated and assigned to the following categories: self and society; class discussion and activity; class discussion, activity, and self; readings; readings and meaning; readings and self; and imaginative writing. Because the journals required regular, almost daily, writing, they encouraged responsibility, close reading of texts, and attentiveness in class discussion. In addition, entries revealed that the teacher's attitude and presentation of material, as well as comments written in the journals, helped students to define their personal and social roles.

Children were interviewed individually after the presentations and were asked which misdemeanor in the stories was naughtiest, whether the punishment was fair, what punishment would be fair, and why. Results indicated a pattern of evolution from heteronomy to autonomy across the grade levels, substantiating Piaget's theory of moral development. However, all three grade levels were hampered by adult constraint. Second graders needed an atmosphere that would nurture spontaneous verbalizing and the expression of children's opinions. Fourth-graders, who had a cooperative attitude toward peers, indicated a need for equality in behavior between  children and adults. Sixth graders lacked mutual respect between children and adults in the area of determining fair punishment; they needed practice in self-governance. (Author/AA)",

The social distance variables investigated included race and sex of adult questioners, socioeconomic status of adult questioners, and socioeconomic status of subjects. The Semantic Differential Scale of Social Distance (SDSD), an original measurement instrument, was administered to 48 black, sixth-grade males from two socioeconomic groups. Later, subjects conversed on the topic of television with adult interviewers, of various sexes and races, to whom they were randomly assigned. A three-way interaction  design accommodated the three social distance factors, and SDSD attitude scores were correlated with mean length of communication unit and use of black English. Subjects conversing with black adults were found to use black English to a greater degree. No other main effects or interaction effects were found to be significant. It was hypothesized that mean length of communication unit and vocabulary diversity were governed by the subjects' underlying linguistic patterns, whereas the use of black English was governed by social rules which promoted solidarity with the black interviewers.

Almost half of the teachers responded. A second survey of needs, conducted in the fall of 1976, confirmed and updated the findings of the first survey. Both surveys led to the conclusion that college English programs generally seem to have disregarded actual teaching needs, and teachers seem not to have been trained to relate, adapt, or integrate the disparate materials and ideas they encountered in their course work. Among the needs  most frequently mentioned by teachers who responded to the surveys were better workshops, new materials (primarily in the areas of composition and reading), extension courses for graduate credit, realistic summer course offerings, better internships and methods programs, media courses, and professors who know the school situation.

Among these are considerations of the various aspects of the composition of literary works, such as sources of inspiration, authors' motives and methods in transforming life into art, and similarities and discrepancies between fact and fiction. Literary biographers relate literary criticism to their subject's life in diverse ways-sometimes for exegesis, sometimes to show the style of a literary mind or personality, and sometimes to find analogues between lives and works. Literary biography also shows the author's art in the perspective of his or her lifetime, illustrating the mechanical aspects of composition and, less often, the  creative aspects. Finally, literary temperament, the placement of the author and the author's works in historical and intellectual milieus, and the provision of the particulars of publication and bibliography are also goals of the literary biographer.

It is argued that illocutionary acts are performatives that occur within a complete communication situation in which the key element is the interaction of the speaker and listener in constituting the force of the utterance. The notion of &quot;force&quot; should be understood as the phenomenon of uptake which a speaker offers by speaking and which a listener achieves by understanding what he or she hears as a certain state of affairs. This account allows for a distinction between locutionary acts of merely uttering words and illocutionary acts where the utterance carries an effect within  one communicative situation. Finally, the notion of force as being primarily constituted by uptake allows a distinction between illocutionary effect and perlocutionary effect where the latter requires a secondary act in consequence of the original act of speaking. We discover that in communication a person may understand without being persuaded and that persuasion may be empty information. (AA)",

The progressive application of the three questions represents an explicit use of the phenomenological method, involving description, reduction and interpretation. The phenomenological reduction of the conscious experience of human communication yields the conclusion that rhetorical ethics (speech acts) are the relation between persons and their lived worlds. The phenomenological interpretation leads to the conclusion that human communication is a sign of conscious experience and, conversely, that the union of consciousness and experience constitutes human communication. In other words, our rhetoric generates our ethics; our  conscious experience communicates the person we are and the world we live. (AA)",

It is counterproductive to focus attention solely on discrete and often fragmentary differences between cultures; an approach is required which will permit the recognition of cultural similarities as well. A holistic frame of reference is necessary for conceptualizing the relationships between humans and culture, and between culture and communication. Models are presented that depict culture as an open system which comprises three subsystems: technological, sociological, and ideological. A definition is advanced which explicitly links communication and culture and which demonstrates that communication is the ingredient that binds humans and  culture. A focus for research and study based on this theory is also defined. (Author/KS)",

It consists of four stages: entering behavior, instructional objectives, instructional procedures, and evaluation. The students average 25 years of age; many are employed in either full-time or part-time work. The goals are to provide students with opportunities to analyze and experience communication in dyadic, small group, and public contexts; to provide opportunities to develop effective speaking abilities in both formal and informal situations; to enable students to use proper speech communication methods; and to encourage the exchange of information, to arrive at a group solution.

        "description":"Since broadcasters are mandated by the Federal Communication Commission to ascertain community needs prior to applying for or renewing licenses, their concern for finding effective audience-analysis tools is generally great. This paper briefly surveys the research conducted on expression of opinion through viewer and listener letter-writing and describes the results of a study of listener letter-writing following a radical format change in a Peoria, Illinois, radio station. Analysis of data, obtained from a questionnaire, was performed in two parts. First, the respondents surveyed were described according to traditional demographic variables. Second, one-time and &quot;chronic&quot; writers (those who had written more than once) were differentiated according to their responses to various  items gauging psychological factors and media use. Data suggested that letter writers were generally older, educated, white, female, and employed in a professional or white-collar occupation. Letters written by these respondents tended to stress complaints rather than praise. Roughly half of the letters received were written by &quot;chronic&quot; respondents; few differences between this group and one-time writers were found. (KS)",

In short, argumentation is the equivalent of hypothesis-testing. Forensics should offer laboratory experience in developing this perspective of communication; implications for theory, which concern the wording of the proposition, the role of presumption, the suspension of disbelief, case development, counterplans, and the nature of decision making, must also be taken into account. Because argumentation is a generative process, users' opinions differ as to its purpose and product. The choice of a rhetorical paradigm must finally depend on an assessment of its functionalism.

Suggestions for implementing GAP include ensuring that the group is representative of the people to be affected by the plan; familiarizing participants with one another; discovering if the group clearly understands its task; sensing if participants need to develop trust relationships; and determining a goal, means to accomplish the goal, and ways to tell if the goal has been achieved. Overall objectives of the GAP program are that the  learner will be able to (1) lead groups in planning; (2) train groups in planning; (3) teach and write performance objectives; and (4) list the steps in managing a system, problem-solving, and decision-making.

        "description":"There are many similarities in collective bargaining as it is carried on in different types of political subdivisions. Where organizations are competing for the right to represent a group of workers, the concept of \"majority rules\" generally prevails. The election and designation of a specific bargaining unit occasionally needs clarification in each local setting. After recognition comes the first step in the bargaining process, the presentation of proposals and demands to the board. This is customarily the responsibility of the persons chosen or hired as employee representatives. In order to assure that adversarial feelings do not hamper job performance, public governing boards are well advised to consider a third-party bargaining representative. However, some research indicates  limitations on negotiations in which boards are represented by outsiders. More often than not, the union has no options--its representatives will come from its ranks. The thread running throughout the entire process of proposal and demand negotiation must be good faith, but hard bargaining does not indicate lack of good faith. (Author/JG)",

As the instructional leader of the middle school, the principal faces the challenge of assisting both new and experienced teachers in developing teaching strategies that are consistent with the characteristics and needs of transescent students. At the same time, the principal must ensure that the pressures of the \"back-to-basics\" movement do not destroy the basic objectives of the middle school program. The use of sociodrama as an effective teaching strategy for the middle school exemplifies a strategy that is compatible with the philosophical goals of the middle school, and with the goals of the \"back-to-basics\" movement.

Rationale were presented for open space, nongrading, and multiage grouping. Results from the study suggest that teacher education  should make greater use of nontraditional approaches, more instructors should implement nontraditional approaches in their own teaching processes to serve as models for teacher trainees, teacher education programs should make a concerted effort to ensure that teacher candidates comprehend the underlying principles of personalized learning and programs, and initiative should be taken by teacher education programs to establish cooperative programs with schools in developing open environments within their systems through onsite support to the educational community as it develops an individualized approach to learning.

The program involved organization and use of resource persons already available in the school (including guidance counselors, the work experience coordinator, and the substance abuse specialist) to work with each student in the target group on a regular basis for the first nine-week term of the 1975-76 school year. Discipline records from the previous school year were used to identify participants. Each student's cumulative guidance record was reviewed. A personal visit to each child's residence was made by the assistant principal. Each student was  withdrawn from one of his regularly scheduled classes to participate in the program, and the progress of each pupil was monitored through the use of commercially available &quot;interim progress report&quot; forms. Results indicated that disciplinary referrals to the assistant principal for each student were reduced by 50 percent, that classroom conduct grades for each student and the overall group improved markedly, and that attitudes of participants (as measured by pretesting and posttesting with district-developed instruments designed to assess student morale) were generally more positive at the conclusion of the program than they had been at the outset.

Data were collected in 1975 at the convention of the National School Boards Association (NSBA). Self-administered questionnaires were randomly distributed by the NSBA staff members to board members and superintendents. This procedure generated a sample of 1,091 school board members and 116 superintendents. Three areas of board decisional behavior are studied--representation and representativeness, including the degree of representation of women on the board and whether the members of the boards view themselves as representatives or trustees and whether they view the  board as more like a corporation board or like a legislature; accessibility to groups and the public; and the decision-making style of the board. The latter topic is concerned with two broad areas--whether the superintendent or the board is dominant and whether the board is bipolar, unipolar, nonpolar, or concealed in its decisional conflicts. Generally, school board politics in the South is different from that found in other regions in several important ways. (Author/IRT)",

President Truman supported general aid for education as a policy consistent with the administration's overall objectives in domestic programs, but he avoided leadership because of the controversies surrounding it. Those controversies centered around issues such as federal aid to nonpublic schools and the form that such aid should take (Funds for school construction? Equalization funds for impacted areas? Across-the-board grants?). Leadership for the federal aid movement therefore shifted to Congress, and specifically to Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio. Although the movement for general aid to education failed to obtain legislative sanction, it  did leave behind a widespread conviction that a need existed for substantial federal aid to education in some form and stimulated new approaches to this objective.

Analysis of the data indicates that superintendents exhibiting openness experience fewer grievances; closed superintendents, more grievances. Further, in the latter case, a subordinate representative principal tends to screen some of the perceived superintendent closedness and effectively lowers grievance frequency.  (Author)",

The study, an organizational case study, investigated the exercise of discretion by the school disciplinarians in Integrated High in Chicago. Participant-observation, focused interviews, and administrative statistics yielded the data. Simple statistical analysis of the quantitative data yielded three hypotheses about the pattern of selective enforcement--(1) the more prominent the discipline administrator's concern with order-maintenance (control), the greater the likelihood students will be suspended; (2) the more prominent the discipline administrator's concern with individual treatment, the greater the likelihood students will be  treated leniently and not suspended; and (3) boys, posing as they seem to do a greater threat to the security and good order of the school, will be suspended systematically more frequently than girls. Analysis of quantitative data yielded rudimentary analogue models of the exercise of discretion by each administrator. Each model consists of a set of hypotheses stated verbally and diagrammatically. All hypotheses are grounded in data. (Author/IRT)",

School board &quot;culture&quot; dictates that the board behave in an elite, unresponsive fashion. The author lists five statements that describe the processes of dissatisfaction theory. (1) There is a culture of school boards that dictates that boards operate in elite fashion. (2) Since most communities are multicultural and varied, it is unlikely that a single point of view about public education will be satisfying over long periods of time. (3) The board and the superintendent view themselves and  are seen by the public as a single policy-making unit. (4) The public will turn to the ballot box in an attempt to unseat an incumbent and elect a board member who represents their positions. (5) A new school board member elected because of community dissatisfaction will usually carry a mandate to &quot;get rid&quot; of the superintendent. (Author/DS)",

Griffiths argued that improved \"homework\" by organizational theorists offers a realistic prospect for establishing \"a solid theoretical base for educational administration.\" This article argues that theory in administration treats the external trappings of organizations but fails to come to grips with their ideological content. The discussion focuses on four questions: 1) What are organizations? 2) What is theory in organizational studies? 3) How should organizational research proceed? and 4) What are the implications for training administrators?

        "description":"The growing interest in the anthropological approach to educational research raises some issues about the nature of educational anthropology and traditional educational research. The nature of these two methods of inquiry is different in that anthropology demands that the researcher use the field as the bases for theoretical, methodological, and even operational development. In traditional educational research, the researcher begins with an existing theory; analysis of data follows a pattern that was part of the original design based on the already existing theory. Educational administration is an applied profession. It has a unique field of social action that can be identified and subjected to observation and analysis. The use of field research techniques, which characterize the  anthropological approach, is particularly important as a means of first establishing and then validating a theory of educational administration practice.

Barr Greenfield's responding article in February 1976 illustrates the dispute between the \"naturalistic\" and \"phenomenological\" views of organizational theory, respectively. The binary opposition of naturalistic and phenomenological approaches is wrong-minded; a much more useful approach is to see them as complementary. Personal experience and critical analysis both lead to an appreciation of the traditional \"scientific\" contribution of the naturalistic approach and the \"humanizing\" influence of phenomenology. On this basis, both theorizing and the preparation of researchers and practitioners in educational administration can be advanced by a conceptualization that formulates social action as a dialectical  synthesis of scientific and humanistic modes of analysis. The approach may be captured under the broad label of scientific humanism. (Author/JG)",

A conflict is now arising between the need for equal job opportunities and seniority-based job layoffs. The &quot;last in first out&quot; (LIFO) layoff procedure is facing legal tests. In the private sector, the courts are willing to intrude on LIFO systems only if there is clear and convincing evidence that recently hired minority group employees have sustained personal injury as a result of their employer's prior discrimination.

The nongraded school allows for the progression of a student through the contents of a given subject independent of any fixed time boundaries. By virtue of its concern with the time factor in learning, John B. Carroll's model of school learning appears to be a viable theoretical basis for making decisions regarding the facilitation of individualized instruction via school organizational patterning. In this study the Carroll model was (a) utilized as a framework for individualizing instruction in a nongraded setting and (b) investigated as a  theoretical basis for educational decisions relative to individualized instructional strategies and school organizational patterning. Measures of degree of learning and perseverance were recorded under two levels of quality of instruction and three levels of ability to understand instruction. The employment of a mastery learning strategy encompassing feedback/correction procedures served to differentiate between the two treatments. The findings of the investigation supported Carroll's hypothesized interaction as well as additional hypotheses inherent within the model. (Author)",

The study sample included high school principals, school superintendents, and community college presidents within the 19-state North Central Association region. The results showed that administrators on all three levels highly rated their schools and colleges on important quality variables. Collective bargaining has apparently had minimal impact on students or instructional programs. But administrators perceived far more negative rather than positive effects associated with collective bargaining. In fact, the only positive effects of collective bargaining,  in the opinion of these administrators, have accrued to teachers in the form of salary increases, fringe benefits, and improved working conditions. The author concludes that the collective bargaining process has had either a neutral or, in some cases, a negative effect on the education enterprise, but not a positive one. (Author)",

        "description":"The General Accounting Office reviewed the overseas dependents school system to determine how schools for children overseas compare with schools in the United States in the areas of teacher salaries, student-teacher ratios, and cost of operations; if costs can be reduced; and whether the Department of Defense is complying with the congressional directive to centralize management. Teacher salaries and the student-teacher ratios in the two school systems compare favorably, but overseas schools incur costs that are unique to them and not all of these costs have been identified and reported. In some countries costs can be reduced by employing more United States citizens rather than foreign nationals primarily because of additional tax revenue from the incomes of citizens. It was  recommended that the Office of Dependents Schools revise functions assigned to school officer personnel; identify and report all costs of operating the schools; set up a new accounting system; ensure that cost and budget information is reliable; and initiate programs to employ more United States citizens and dependents and find alternative means of providing bus transportation that would reduce overall costs of overseas schools.

The study entailed (1) collection of enrollment, revenue, expenditure, and teacher assignment data from a stratified random sample of Minnesota districts for a seven-year period, 1969-70 through 1975-76; (2) reduction of data into indicators of demand, resource appropriation, resource allocation, and service capability; and (3) testing selected hypotheses to assess the sensitivity and effectiveness of the system or tentative model. The hypotheses tested were concerned with state-local share of school revenue, equalization of expenditures, and equal access to educational services. The stratification of the sample allowed consideration of the effects of  enrollment size, wealth (property valuation per weighted pupil unit), level of expenditure, and enrollment trends on unit revenues, unit costs, and service capability. The importance of this research and development effort lies in its attempt to establish a system whereby the impact of state-level legislative and regulatory policies on public school districts can be monitored. The major conclusion of the study was that the proposed system indicated sufficient sensitivity to merit further development. (Author/IRT)",

Some common features noted in the six adversary evaluation case studies were l) better communication between evaluators and decision makers, 2) greater attention to the formulation of key evaluation issues,  and 3) increased concern for meta-evaluation.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to explore some of the differential consequences of student acts of brinkmanship for the student role and the teacher role. A concomitant concern was to investigate the relationship between teacher perceptions of student brinkmanship and teacher pupil control ideology. Three hypotheses were tested in two junior high schools--one traditionally organized that emphasized custodial pupil control, the other with team teaching and modular scheduling that emphasized humanistic control. The instruments used were Osgood's semantic differential technique and the Pupil Control Ideology Form. Contrary to expectations, the students in the custodial school were more euphoric about both student brinkmanship and their everyday classroom life than were students in  the humanistic schools. As expected, teachers perceive acts of student brinkmanship as threatening to their social position in the school organization. The degree to which teachers perceive acts of student brinkmanship as threatening was directly related to the teacher's degree of custodial pupil control ideology. (Author/IRT)",

The program described demonstrates the ability of solar collectors to supplement the heating and hot water requirements of North View Junior High School in suburban Minneapolis. The report discusses in detail the collector design, system design, system operation, and system performance. The basic rationale for the program is the necessity of obtaining firm answers in three areas: (1) validation of system performance, (2) determination of overall system costs, and (3) acquisition of data to determine the benefits of such a system. The program is obtaining engineering data that may be used to improve collector performance and system  performance or design. In addition, data are being compiled that may be used to define investment requirements for similar installations. The program is also helping to determine community acceptance of solar heated school buildings. Testing at the site is continuing on a day-by-day basis to obtain additional data on system performance and benefits. (Author/MLF)",

The section on building interior design responses considers ways to minimize costs of property damage and maintenance through design and materials specification. The third section contains ways to cut property damage costs through administrative programs aimed at involving students in the school, at using personnel effectively, and at keeping \"eyes on the school.\" The fourth section, design  accountability checklists, presents one general question for every major design issue and then a series of specific \"yes-no\" questions to determine if the issue has been taken into account by the architect in the design.

The demographic data are a result of a survey of blacks who held administrative positions in large city school districts of 100,000 or more during the 1972-73 school year. From a total of 1,004 questionnaires returned, approximately 250 were from female administrators. The profile presented of the black female administrator  includes personal characteristics, professional experience and academic preparation, self-concept, perception of unrest, and perception of the school district. A section discusses issues peculiar to the black woman. The discussion is limited to her double \"negative\" status, institutional manipulation, and self-perception. (Author/MLF)",

A four-step sequence examining projects in developing countries is proposed as a way of solving problems that often arise in construction projects. The first step is the project as such--what normally is included in project administration, design, and construction--then analyzing the backgrounds: the building industry of which the project is a part, then the national scene on which the project itself as well as the building industry has to  play its role, and last the international surroundings and relationships that may influence the project. Using building methods and materials that generate development of the domestic building industry is stressed as a responsibility of the implementor and the organizational consequences of this responsibility are described.

The document is divided into five major sections representing broad subject areas in which LRCs might operate: planning and evaluation, management, appraisal and programing, materials support, and personnel support. The five major sections are each divided into 15 functions, with &quot;function&quot; being defined as a role which might be performed by the organization. Each function, in turn, is divided into strategies (&quot;strategy&quot; defined as a recommended behavioral event required to perform the roles or functions). Each of these  strategies is then divided into a number of tasks or activities for implementing the strategies. Finally, each task is divided into two suggested mechanisms for its accomplishment--considerations and step-by-step procedures. Step-by-step procedures provide an approach to the task, detailing the basic steps necessary for completion. Covered are the following functions: defining workscope, assessing needs, evaluating LRCs, planning, managing LRC, supervising personnel, managing physical resources, managing fiscal resources, coordinating appraisal services, delivering appraisal services, developing and evaluating materials, selecting and circulating materials, offering inservice training, delivering technical assistance, and providing information.

Initial diagnostic testing using criterion-referenced tests indicated target areas for basic skills instruction, which was implemented through the use of a prescriptive multi-modal teaching method. After retesting, for each of the four components involved--neurologically impaired/emotionally handicapped, emotionally handicapped (A and B classes), neurologically impaired and/or severely physically handicapped, and emotionally handicapped and neurologically impaired (demonstration classes)--it was found, in respective order, that 91%, 77%, 85%, and 78% of the students mastered  at least one math objective; and 93%, 78%, 87%, and 61% mastered at least one language objective. Furthermore, the results indicated that in either category the majority of participants could obtain from one to four instructional objectives.

The speech/language component, designed to improve academic skills through individual or small-group instruction, lacked good definition of the relationship between speech/language improvement concerns and attempts to improve reading skills and did not meet the evaluation objective of mastery of at least one instructional objective by 70% of the pupils. The mental retardation component, largely social-recreational in design, exceeded the evaluation objective of mastery of at least one instructional  objective formerly failed by 70% of the pupils, with nearly 88% mastering at least one new objective.

Among the evaluation objectives listed were statistically significant improvement of Ss in their reading grade level and mastery of eight previously failed instructional objectives in reading. Findings are reported in terms of evaluation objectives, field  evaluation check list, discrepancy analysis, and recommendations from the prior year's evaluation. It is concluded that the DSEPPS Reading Program did produce statistically significant improvement in children's reading level; that it was not demonstrated that 70% of any of the groups of children were able to master eight or more instructional objectives from the California Prescriptive Reading Inventory; that for the majority of children, participation in the program resulted in the mastery of instructional objectives which were failed on the pre-test; and that the program coincided with the project proposal.

The project goal was to diagnose the reading disabilities of the students, raise their level of reading proficiency, and ameliorate their reading disabilities. Teaching methods included one-to-one and small group instruction, and the use of multisensory instructional materials and equipment. Using pre- and post-test evaluation, it was determined that student participants in the program succeeded in raising their levels significantly beyond the level anticipated had they not participated. It was also found that diagnostic procedures were universally  applied and utilized. And fianlly, it was found that delays in funding shortened the treatment period, and that difficulties in hiring prevented much contribution by psychological support personnel to the success of the program. The aspects of the program which were observed to account for the highly positive results were the individually tailored remediative efforts made possible by small group and one-to-one instruction, and the skill with which teachers executed both diagnostic and remediative tasks.

Chapters three through five deal with practical teaching concerns. Behavioral objectives are discussed, and educational objectives are listed for each phase of the career education program (awareness, orientation, exploration, and preparation phases). Chapter four reviews two approaches to career education: the learning center approach (with two sample units for career awareness phase), and competency based instruction (with samples from career orientation and exploration phases). Chapter five presents information  on general considerations and career education implications of six disability areas: hearing impaired, learning disabled, mentally retarded, orthopedically handicapped and other health impaired, visually impaired, and emotionally disturbed. Chapter six focuses on such nonclassroom components of the model as counseling, work training, job placement and followup. Also cited is the importance of record keeping and occupational information systems. Chapter seven reviews the leisure occupations which are broken down into four subclusters (including tourism and hospitality services and environmental-based services) and 11 job families (such as travel services and resource conservation/preservation services). The final chapter presents a competency based inservice training program for teachers  in providing career education services to the handicapped. (CL)",

Changes in the program for the third year of operation are noted to have been an emphasis on the evaluation of the group counseling format (based on Reality Therapy and using a team of two co-facilitators) used with 69 of the students. Results of the evaluation, which are presented in tabular form, are discussed. Among the findings discussed are that there was a significant positive gain in English grades for those students involved in group counseling when compared to controls; and that work methods, teacher approval, education acceptance, study attitudes, and study orientation all showed significant gains made by the group counseling  students in relation to the control students.

The Synthesis of Abilities Model for Pupil Information is noted to be applicable to all pupils in all learning situations with the chief features being abilities, spheres of response, analyses, and synthesis. Ten abilities are identified in five spheres of performance and quantitative and  contrastive analyses are discussed. Emphasis in the model is placed on pupil performance elements in three phases of learning: preparation, acquisition, and use. Learning is defined as a measurable, verifiable change in performance. Program evaluators and managers at all levels of the governance structure of education are encouraged to work with consumers to clarify their information needs, specify the evidence required, and provide the resources necessary to supply accurate, timely, and helpful information.

In chapter 3, study findings are discussed in three areas (identification, programing, and support factors) and include that few schools have adequate identification programs, that there are two major alternatives (acceleration and regular versus special class arrangements) when considering the gifted and talented child's educational needs, and that respondents agreed that the most significant obstacles to development of gifted and talented educational programs were inadequate financial support, lack of trained personnel, and too many other priorities.

Descended from English sealers, whalers and ex-convicts and their Aboriginal wives, the inhabitants of Cape Barren Island, Tasmania, have lived in relative isolation for the last 150 years or more. Their dialect is not a creolized pidgin; it has a number of lexical and phonological elements traceable to the rural dialects of southwest England, which are not found elsewhere in Australia. There are also strong traces of Aboriginal &quot;foreign accent&quot; at a phonological level. The specialized terminology of whaling and sealing has been adapted to the insular environment, especially in the exploitation of mutton-bird rookeries. (Author)",

        "description":"Most textbooks for teaching foreign languages have as their basis a grammatical syllabus. The theory has been that it is easier for students to learn a language if they are exposed to one part of the grammatical system at a time. Recently critics have questioned this theory, arguing that the grammatical syllabus fails to provide the necessary conditions for the acquisition of communicative competence. An alternate approach which has been suggested is to construct a situational syllabus which would focus upon teaching what is most relevant to a particular group of learners. If teaching were based on particular types of situations, however, all of the learner's language needs would not be met. A possible solution is the creation of a semantic or notional syllabus which would  consider the content of probable utterances and from this determine which forms of language would be most valuable to the learner. The notional categories would be organized into two sections, the first made up of six semantico-grammatical categories: (1) time; (2) quantity; (3) space; (4) matter; (5) case; and (6) deixis. The second set is made up of eight categories of communicative function: (7) modality; (8) moral evaluation and discipline; (9) suasion; (10) argument; (11) rational enquiry and exposition; (12) personal emotions; (13) emotional relations; and (14) interpersonal relations. This notional framework is intended to provide the means by which a certain minimum level of communicative ability in European languages can be set up. (CFM)",

The language material to be learned will be organized into units and a learner will be awarded a specified number of credits on completion of each unit. The contents are to be defined with reference to the nature of the learners and their linguistic needs. This paper proposes a way of resolving, within a single framework, the problems of determining first what is grammatically necessary as a sound basis of all language use, and secondly what constitutes a speaker's communicative competence. The framework is organized in notional, or semantic, categories. By considering first what the content of utterances is likely to be, it is  possible to decide which forms of language will be most valuable. The notional information will need to be supplemented by information on grammatical categories which are obligatory for particular languages but possibly not predictable from the notional approach. Indications are given of notions needed at the threshold level and their formal realizations. A number of detailed examples are given of the varied ways in which some of the functional categories are expressed in English. (Author/CFM)",

Chapter 3, \"Intellectual Development and Cognitive Styles\" analyzes the numerous attempts to determine whether bilingualism enhances or depresses  performance on IQ tests. Chapter 4, \"Culture,\" deals with the bicultural element in bilingual education programs. The important question of when and what to assess in bilingual education is the subject of Chapter 5, \"Assessment,\" which also deals with assessment personnel, instruments and models.

Three tasks were constructed to investigate these three aspects. The effects of group, age, and sex were also examined. The children were drawn from two  contrasting populations: sample A consisted of 90 upper middle class urban/suburban white children attending a private nursery school and a private day school kindergarten; sample B comprised 46 lower class semi-rural black children in a public day care center and a public kindergarten. The findings revealed that preschool children do discriminate, categorize and express specific attitudes toward BE and SE. In all tasks, age and group were the most significant variables.

At this initial stage the linguistic material focused on is necessarily very limited and the conclusions arrived at are valid only with reservations. Similarly, only certain aspects are concentrated on. Chapters 2-4 presents the results of the experiment in acoustic terms. The rest of the report is devoted to an attempt to interpret the results of the  experiment in the light of articulatory and other physiological evidence. The latter part of the report is necessarily somewhat more speculative in nature. On the bsis of indirect or second-hand evidence, certain inferences about some aspects of the timing of physiological processes are made.

The approach was tested in an experiment in which several groups of people were given three sets of sentences with the  structure: &quot;A did X. B did Y.&quot; Subjects were asked to explain the situation in each set by drawing inferences about the relation between the two parts of each set. One clue to ways of relating the pairs of sentences is stress; another is argument-sharing. This type of analysis can teach us something about the structures underlying our inferences from the manifest content of texts. (Author/AM)",

There are six basic rules for the teacher to follow: (1) fill the frame; (2) suppress your ego; keep yourself and your relatives out of your picture; (3) leave the audience wishing for more slides, not fewer; (4) vary your viewpoints; (5) don't show slides with flaws; and (6) know your projection equipment. An effective picture show should be able to communicate without words. Narration should never be used to compensate for bad slides. A number of illustrations are provided as examples of photographic composition for a variety of subjects. (Author/CFM)",

Individual factors include language aptitude, personality, attitudes and motivation, and the role of the speaker's native language. Teacher factors involve the method of instruction, the sex of the teacher, and a teacher's training and competence, while sociocultural factors include the degree of urbanization, nationality, and socioeconomic status. Following a review of relevant literature, a study conducted in Sweden is described. During the spring of 1966, questionnaires were sent to local government school authorities in Sweden to determine how many, if any, immigrant children were receiving special instruction in Swedish, and to obtain information concerning the sex, nationality, place of  emigration, and the father's occupation. A battery of tests were then sent out. Six language tests covered pronunciation, dictation, oral comprehension, reading comprehension, free written composition, and free oral composition. Three intelligence tests were administered, and teacher attitudes were sampled. Results show sex differences in favor of girls. Teacher competence and students' age seem to influence second language learning to a significant degree, while the speaker's native language and socioeconomic status have less importance. (CHK)",

Anxiety is seen as the chief difficulty in the conventional training process. This anxiety, caused by fear of making mistakes, of losing job security, or of performing in public and being evaluated, can be minimized by a careful application of counseling principles in the interaction of the trainer and the trainee, most significantly following the trainee's early teaching demonstrations. Training processes hinge on the concept of the \"understanding response,\" requiring the trainer to not only evaluate the trainee, but also attempt to understand his anxiety. The training process described has two phases: (1) valuation, or understanding  of the trainee's experience; and (2) instruction, during which the trainee builds on what he has already learned and corrects mistakes. A detailed description of specific interactions and their likely consequences is provided. (CLK)",

The essence of this technique is the use of a combination of physical relaxation exercises, mental concentration and suggestive principles to strengthen a person's ego and expand his memory capabilities, and the use of relaxing music while material to be learned is presented dynamically. In experiments, students showed improved attitude, faster learning and better retention with this method. Elements of this learning procedure were first integrated by Dr. George Lozanov of Bulgaria. Three phases of this method are described: (1) Preliminary preparations involve creating a suggestive, positive atmosphere. The instructor's  attitude, intonation and verbal cadence conform to this. Hatha Yoga exercises and Zen breathing relax the body and mind. (2) Presentation of material is carefully sequenced as students receive and experience material actively and review it passively. (3) The practice and use phase involves role-playing and ungraded quizzes to eliminate fear of failure. The Lozanov Method is described and explained with complete classroom examples. The final section reviews research literature dealing with applications of suggestive-accelerative learning in the classroom and reviews learning research articles applying to this method. (CHK)",

Issues at hand include language standardization, bilingual education, the language problems of immigrants, the role of Gaelic as compared to the continuum of linguistic varieties that go from Standard English to Scots, the adoption of a distinctive linguistic symbol of national identity, and the identification and development of a distinct Scots language. Three actual or potential language standards exist: (1) Scots Gaelic, a Celtic language closely related to Irish Gaelic; (2) Standard Scottish English, differing phonologically and syntactically from the English of England; and (3) Scots (Lallans), a historic outgrowth of the English in England. The domains in  which each language is used are described, as well as the developments in education and the media regarding the use of Gaelic and Scots. A comparison is made with the language situation in Norway. Most immigrants to Scotland are Pakistanis living in Glasgow, and, as non-speakers of English, are not confronted with language attitude problems like those of West Indians in England who speak English-based Creoles. Lexicography, social and geographical dialectology, language attitude studies, and language policy in education and government are all areas requiring further attention. (CLK)",

Three techniques from Behavior Modification can be applied to overcome such anxieties and to further achievement in second language learning: (1) Systematic Desensitization; (2) Cognitive Restructuring; and (3) Modeling and Guided Participation. The goal of Systematic Desensitization is to give the person the opportunity to make a positive reaction in the face of the anxiety-causing situation and therefore experience a sense of achievement. Systematic exposure to the anxiety-causing situation without the occurence of anxiety is the decisive factor governing the elimination of the anxiety. The second technique is intended to promote awareness of the  anxious person's verbal and non-verbal behavior and cognitively restructure unrealistic anticipation, e.g. anticipation of failure or peer derision. The basic principle of the third technique involves arranging the environment and supporting the person so that the occurrence of anxiety is reduced sufficiently to ensure a successful experience.

The latter are useful since they reflect the culture, history, ideological concerns and environment of the people whose language is being taught. These films are directed at the native audience without concessions being made to the learner, and all parts of the film can be used for instructional purposes, including the script and the sound track. In discussing the organization of a film project in a second language course, a list of film distributors and films that are available is provided, as well as  guidelines for equipment, the use of the script as a textbook, and soundtrack preparation. A discussion of classroom techniques and teaching methods covers the use of the soundtrack, the screenplay, and the film itself.

Austin; and (2) performative verbs do not normally retain illocutionary force in embedded contexts. Various tests for illocutionary force are applied, such as substitution of another speech act within the same syntactic context, co-occurence with modifiers, and comparison with sequences of separate sentences, which constitute independent speech acts. It is proposed that the nearest paraphrase to indirectly expressed speech acts (e.g. May I request...) is a prefatory speech act followed by the &quot;main&quot; speech act, and that such a sequence in discourse may be the source of idiomatic indirect expressions. It is concluded that NP  modifiers, such as non-restrictive relative clauses, parentheticals, etc., do retain independent illocutionary force within another speech act, while modifiers of the speech act, such as prefatory clauses, do not.

The emphasis in this paper has been placed on the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic perspectives of the code-switching phenomenon. The data seem to lend support to the assumption that in fact not all language alternations can be considered \"code-switching strategies\" proper if we distinguish between utterances containing  relexification and others containing sentence constituents from two languages. The former are referred to as \"semi-codeswitching\" and the latter, true code-switching. The analysis of the examples of true code-switching have yielded some initial evidence that code-switching obeys certain rules of co-occurrence based upon the rules of grammar of the two languages involved in the sense that the code-switching is blocked if it requires the violation of a grammatical rule of either language. As far as linguistic performance is concerned, a total of eleven variables have been identified which seem to act as triggering forces favoring the language alternation. (Author/CFM)",

        "description":"Gestural behavior between mothers and young children was hypothesized to be important in the acquisition of communicative competence. It was presumed that a typology of gestural function could assess non-verbal behavior. Data consisted of sound film samples of feeding and bathing events of three subject pairs. Initially the children ranged in age from 19-21 months. The children exceeded their mothers in the use of gestural behavior at each time period and children's gestural behavior significantly decreased over time. Although maternal gestural behavior generally decreased over time, an increase at Time IV occurred. Mothers used gesture to assess and reinforce existing knowledge. Analysis of non-verbal behavior indicated that dissimilar gestural functions are expressed by similar  motor acts and, conversely, that dissimilar motor acts express similar functions. Analysis of gestural functions subsumed equivalent to complementary verbal functional categories showed that children's gestures support linguistic skills. Some gestures were believed to map symbolic behavior, other non-symbolic gestures demonstrated reliance on non-verbal behavior to acquire skills of communicative competence. (Author)",

The focus is on all German-speaking countries: West and East Germany, Austria and Switzerland. To provide an insight into the social role of women in the past and today, excerpts from works by the following writers are discussed: Bebel, Baeumer, Stefan Zweig, Nietzsche, Freud, Helwig, Friedan and Beauvoir. An extensive bibliography on women in German literature and culture completes the outline. (Author/CFM)",

Gaining early mastery of the FL sound inventory (starting with the \"dramatic items\") allows beginning students to quickly enjoy significant initial successes of a very personal nature which also enable the teacher to establish and maintain a supportive momentum at a stage of FL learning often held lacking in intrinsic value. In the adventure of self-extension that constitutes FL study, the experience of confronting the \"foreign\" and making it a part of one's individual behavior is a valuable part of the elementary FL course where our student constituency is greatest. Students should feel that precisely in the delicate matter of \"how one sounds,\"  a distinct expertise has been reached even in the first few weeks of study. Specific recommendations are made concerning teacher preparation, selection and sequencing of target sounds for greatest learning impact and some effective practical teaching procedures. (Author)",

Second language acquisition for adults is not identical to first language acquisition but research seems to support the theory that it is similar. Successful second language acquisition was found to take place when adult second language learners were immersed in a carefully planned yet informal English environment. In the classroom students should participate in activities which require language use following similar strategies and techniques young children appear to use, such as language games, dialogues, and skits. The course should therefore be planned situationally rather than  grammatically. (Author/CFM)",

Some of the main principles of the method are: (1) language learning does not result from studying textbooks or listening to recordings; (2) language is best acquired by living among native speakers of the target language and employing educationally sound methods developed by linguists; (3) rudimentary linguistic skills can be used by the layman to facilitate his acquisition of a second language; such skills as articulatory phonetics, phonetic inscription, and linguistic analysis enable the serious student  of a language to acquire it with near-native fluency in a relatively short period of time; (4) the concept of learning cycles must be understood and properly utilized to insure the student constant progress in acquiring a second language; and (5) language and culture acquisiton are inseparable. Appendices contain six sample Bemba lessons, information on choosing an informant, and information on recording procedures. (Author/AM)",

For speaking, the basic grammar text used is Mary Bruder's \"MMC: Developing Communicative Competence in English,\" which consists of dialogues and mechanical and communicative drills. The complementary texts are Kettering's \"Developing Communicative Competence: Interaction Activities in English as a Second Language\" and Paulston, Britton, Brunetti, and Hoover's \"Developing Communicative Competence: Role Plays  in English as a Second Language.\" Kettering's book contains three basic types of activities: social formulas and dialogues, community-oriented tasks, and problem-solving activities. \"Role Plays\" contains exercises where the student is assigned a fictitious role from which he has to improvise some kind of behavior toward the other characters in the exercise. Pronunciation is taught with a sound-symbol approach. The reading program is still in an experimental stage, but an integral part of it is teaching advanced grammatical patterns for decoding only. A set of materials for controlled composition is being developed for the teaching of writing. Several samples are provided. (CFM)",

        "description":"The diagnostic problem presented by children without obvious neurological, cognitive, genetic, emotional or environmental basis for their atypical or delayed language development is discussed. One unresolved issue is whether the deficits of such dysphasic children are linguistic or are more fundamental cognitive or perceptuomotor deficits. A second important issue is whether the differences in language capabilities between normal and language-disordered children are qualitative differences or quantitative ones. It is suggested here that language disabilities derive from genetic idiosyncracies leading to neural systems with differential capabilities for acquiring language. Children with deficits in language, because of their idiosyncratic makeup, may have to struggle to learn the  acquisition strategies innate for the majority. It is suggested that the needs of the speech clinician might better be met by recognizing that dysphasic children possess different patterns of neural organization that predispose them to approach language learning in an atypical fashion.

Middle Eastern students will show themselves to be highly adaptable, but they may demonstrate a formality of manner, particularly in initial social relationships, and a distrust of foreigners. Salient characteristics include respect for parents and elders, pride in one's heritage, and an attitude of fatalism conditioned by religious beliefs. Personal relationships are important and demand commitment, and the use of particular language forms, especially in formal situations, has significance. Needs particular to the Middle Eastern student include respect for his or  her culture, close personal relationships or friendships, relaxed social relationships, hospitality accompanied by the offering of food, interaction with fellow Arabs, having a mentor from the same background, and having a satisfactory relationship with faculty and administration advisors.

This paper suggests that teaching comprehensively for communicative competence will cater to a large extent to developing linguistic competence, whereas teaching for linguistic competence will tend to cater very little to developing communicative skills. Reorienting language teaching towards a major focus on communicative skills involves three basic elements: (1) samples of the target language; (2) guidance concerning the nature of the target language; and (3) management or directed learning activities. These elements can all be brought together in communication practice. A course at the Essex Language Centre is cited as  one model of an ESL course stressing communication. This course combined English and new student orientation, and stressed having the student retrieve information on his own rather than having information given to him. (AM)",

One cause may be the fact that language learners tend to need \"knowledge of second language use\" more than \"knowledge of a second language\" in their oral communication situations outside the classroom. This results in low transferability of interactional skills acquired through participation in the spoken discourse of second language classrooms. One suggestion for language teachers is the identification of those communicative purposes students have or will have in English. Another is the creation of as many and as varied opportunities as possible for learners to communicate inside the classroom, for purposes as similar as possible to those which they will have outside.

In considering the situation of English in Israel, it is essential to also consider the unique linguistic and cultural situation of the country. The population of Israel comprises people of diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, and includes native speakers of English, native speakers of Hebrew, and persons for whom both languages must be learned as second or third languages. An additional problem is the fact that the native English-speaking Israelis represent a wide range of varieties of English. Socially, English functions as an unofficial second language. In the school system, English is taught from Class 5 on, sometimes earlier. The emphasis is on oral-aural and reading skills, for  international communication. All Israeli universities have English departments and all students take a compulsory English language course. The Bagrut (matriculation) exam stresses communicative competence. Teacher standards are generally high but vary. Teacher training is in the form of 3-year college courses, or 1-year university education department courses for graduates in English. Inservice training is provided by the English Inspectorate. English literature is popular and widely read, even more than Hebrew literature. A reading program for advanced English classes completes the profile. (AM)",

Using recordings of radio broadcasts as data, a system of assigning pitch levels to syllables was devised, based on four pitches. The close relationship between stress placement and pitch level was considered. In order to test the hypothesis that the phonemic function of intonation was in some ways predictable, the phonetic description was related to sentence structure. A basic inventory of phonemic intonation contours was defined, including: (1) declarative sentences: small and large non-final syntactic groups, both types having rising and falling contours, and final groups, with falling contours; (2) yes-no questions, with both rising and falling  contours; (3) information questions, with both rising and falling contours; (4) commands, with one falling contour; and (5) exclamations, with one falling contour.

Students who learn English begin studying in primary school, continue into middle school, with the more talented of the politically qualified getting further study in Chinese institutions of higher learning and some being sent to the United Kingdom. As a member of the United Nations and seeking a major role among Third World nations, the PRC recognizes the need to communicate with foreign countries and the value of English for that purpose. The students of English are made aware of the need to be able to tell people of other countries about Chinese developments and points of view. In addition to teaching languages in  schools and work places, the regime is also offering English (and other foreign languages) by radio to the general public. Though the extent of this programming is not known, radio stations in the major cities apparently offer regular lessons and printed instruction booklets to listeners. All domestic teaching materials must meet strict standards, which means emphasis on political content. Teaching methods, too, concentrate on the immediate task of developing the language skills students will need to &quot;spread the revolution.&quot; (Author/CLK)",

        "description":"This article investigates the acquisition of a variety of standard English (SE) by children whose first language is Hawaii Creole English (HCE). The hypothesis was made that, in a speech community with high prestige and low prestige codes, learning the dominant code would not adversely affect performance in the first language. The subjects, in grades K-3, had no formal exposure to SE prior to entering school, and received no formal language training once in school. Their teachers used SE, but did not discourage the use of HCE. The subjects' performances over time in HCE and SE were measured by tests in HCE and SE. An analysis of the results shows that SE scores increased significantly in all four grades. Further, the subjects not only maintained HCE, but in three grades  significantly increased their performance. Thus the acquisition of SE by the subjects, presumably through constant exposure to it in the school setting, did not result in a decrease in linguistic ability in HCE. This finding may be of significance in planning educational policies and practices. Apparently the immerision of children speaking a low prestige, creolized language into a school setting where the standard language is used exclusively can result in the children acquiring the latter while maintaining the former.

Theories that have been presented to account for syntactic development (cognitive, cognitive-semantic and social-environmental) are discussed. Early developmental data indicate that there is not a semantic and then, later, a syntactic stage. As children acquire the meaning of a linguistic relation they simultaneously form hypotheses about the syntactic rules used to express this meaning. Abilities which play the most important role in development of comprehension of syntactic structures are the following: to process increasing amounts of parallel temporal-acoustic linguistic information and situational information, to form hypotheses  about structures represented in this information, and to hold information in short-term memory so that it can be decomposed by retrieval of structures from long-term memory. The production of utterances, in addition, requires the programming of this parallel information into articulatory movements. Thus, differing language disorders are a reflection of varying degrees of difficulty in these abilities. Social-environmental factors can enhance or retard development, and, to some extent, compensate for differences from the norm in these abilities. (Author)",

This study concentrates on the written manifestation of BEV, on explaining which features occur, how often they occur, why they occur, whether the occurrence of some features implies the occurrence of others, and why some individuals are more likely to write in the Vernacular than others. Major findings include: a wide divergence in linguistic performance; a lack of correlation between the occurrence of BEV features with extra-linguistic factors, including socio-economic status, mobility, and racial isolation; a lack of  correlation between occurrence of BEV features and scores on a standardized college entrance examination; the existence of an implicational relationship between several key features, the most significant of which is that deletion of the copula/auxiliary \"be\" implies the use of all other BEV features; and, most importantly, the significance of the degree and kind of motivation individuals have in determining their ability to write in Edited American English.

The effort continues as part of Furman's ongoing administrative operation. The resulting Management Planning Project at Furman is described in this conference speech. Focus is on the procedural aspects of the management-by-objectives (MBO) portion of the program and the accompanying personnel interactions. The MBO emphasis in Furman's systematic institutional planning process includes the major steps of (1) clarification and evaluation of mission, goals, and objectives; (2) development and execution of programs of action; and (3) allocation of essential resources. These steps are  incorporated into the other management planning activities. The scheme requires development of a program of action and the allocation of essential resources to support the particular objective. This distinction is the first step in reducing the number of worthwhile objectives to both a manageable number and to those objects that can have a meaningful effect on the administration of the college.

In New England the migration of students will continue to be a critical factor in the decades ahead. The data in this report encompass all full-time and part-time students or total headcount enrolled at all levels in degree-granting institutions in the New England states. The findings indicate that those institutions continue to attract significant numbers of students across state lines, but that there have been a number of changes in the patterns of migration since 1968. Although students are attracted in larger numbers to the region's higher educational institutions from outside New England, these students constitute a  smaller percentage of the region's total enrollment. Statistical tables are presented for: New England summary by state of residence, 1975 and l968; intra-New England migration, 1975 and 1968; and state tables for Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

The graduates' parents appeared to be of higher socioeconomic status and to have attained higher educational degrees than the general public, and nearly 25 percent of the graduates have interrupted their formal education for a significant period of time since the completion of high school. About 75 percent indicated plans for further education. Fewer than half of the graduates expected to be working in their career  occupations the fall after graduation. One-quarter expected to be employed in non-career jobs then; five years hence, 78 percent expected to be employed in full-time career jobs. Differences were found in male and female expectations. The anticipated primary activity for the fall was related to the graduate's major field of study. Fewer than half of all the graduates reported having received occupational or career counseling.

Factors involving both manpower supply and demand were investigated and educational and occupational areas in which major supply/demand imbalances exist were determined. The primary goal was to investigate the manpower supply/demand relationships between college graduates and the labor market demand in Indiana. It was found that most manpower studies in existence appeared to assess college-level manpower supply without taking into account the plans and aspirations of the students themselves. It was also common to estimate various types of manpower demand without considering the preferences of employers concerning the educational levels and fields of study for their new  employees. This report reviews the findings on: student career plans; business and industry hiring of college graduates; potential imbalances in supply/demand; liberal arts and social sciences fields; elementary and secondary school teachers; law and legal assistants; and medicine, nursing and allied health fields.

He focuses on the significance of such factors as: student ability and motivation; specified conditions or practice and instruction; meaningfulness of learning materials and tasks; degree and  quality of motivation; active participation of students and their levels of aspiration; concern for process as well as products of learning; class size; order of presentation; effectiveness of group discussion; student anxiety; and testing and grading methods.

Educators will face a challenge of trying to convince governors and legislators of the benefits of enrichment within the existing unclear economic picture where education must compete with other areas for existing funds, and higher education must compete with other areas of education, and where the general public is questioning the value of higher education. Program enrichment entails such factors as the balanced campus, improved libraries, teaching enrichment and faculty workload, and research. In addition to program enrichment, the next decade will also see an increased emphasis on the nontraditional student, the  distribution of student aid, and a new sphere of influence for coordinating bodies.

The author questions the usefulness of this approach because the nature of higher education differs from the nature of a profit-making business. However, rational planning to achieve efficiency is relevant if efficiency is not confined to values that are measured in money or traded in a market. Academic planning must take into account all the benefits whether or not they are readily quantifiable, and must consider all the costs whether or not they are quantifiable. An analogy between higher education institutions and the family is drawn to illustrate this. The point is also made that more knowledge is needed about the relation between the resources and technologies employed  and the true outcomes in human terms to make academic planning possible. Several examples of the decision-making process in long-range planning are given to illustrate the kinds of questions that must be answered in the planning activity. The main task of planning is to implement a coherent philosophy of higher education that sets the general costs and results and to communicate the plan to the academic community through a consistent pattern of decisions.

        "description":"Ohio Wesleyan University has demonstrated that a small private college can apply cost accounting to instructional activities. For more than six years, Ohio Wesleyan has calculated the unit cost of instruction per student and per credit until for each individual course section as well as the average unit costs for each academic discipline. Only instructional costs are included; support costs are not allocated to the academic disciplines. This data has become a factor in the decision-making process and usually serves to raise questions, not provide answers. The four instructional cost reports used by the University are described: faculty compensation analysis; instruction department cost grouping; course cost report; and instruction discipline cost report. The data was first used  by the ad hoc Long Range Planning Committee to establish objectives for the 1970s and the committee's recommendations reflected the data. It has continued to be used for multiyear comparisons and has pinpointed areas and programs that need change. (JMF)",

In order of importance as sources of funds for graduate support were: the federal government ($200 million), colleges and universities ($21 million), others ($20 million), and state governments ($10 million). The number of foreign students coming to America with support from public or private agencies in the United States is five times the number of American students going abroad with similar support. State and federal government aid has tended to carry more restrictions for the student than has the same type of aid when offered by private agencies, and financial  aid in general has been more restricted for graduate than undergraduate study. Historically, the colleges and universities have played the dominant supportive role for all kinds of student support programs, except for the period of about 10 years after World War II. The states were the first noncollege group to make major efforts in the student aid area; the federal government is only recently a major contributor to these activities. (Author/MSE)",

The analyses were carried out on existing longitudinal data files developed by the American Council on Education's Cooperative Institutional Research Program. The file used consisted of 1966 freshmen who were followed up as sophomores (1967) and seniors (1970). Variations in the aspirations of men and women were found after one year of college, but these differences appear to wash-out after four years in college. The significant  predictors of senior year academic self-concept are the same for men and women. The three most important predictors of senior year educational aspiration are also the same. For both men and women both relative deprivation and environmental press appear to be operating in influencing senior year educational aspirations. The relative deprivation effect is a strong one but, contrary to the theory, appears to operate directly through college grades and not through the intermediate psychological variable of academic self-concept. College selectivity is shown to have a significant and positive effect on educational aspirations, although this effect is noticeably stronger for men than for women. (JMF)",

From a random sample of 1,251 individuals, age 16 and over, 680 persons responded to and returned a 44-item questionnaire about various aspects of postsecondary education in Alabama. The survey results are analyzed from four perspectives: (1) previous national and regional surveys; (2) the survey methodology; (3) responses to each question, compared by race, sex, level of education, age, income, and geographic location of the respondents; and (4) the salient points of Alabama opinion emerging from the responses. Alabamians are found to be very positive about the quality of education in the state's postsecondary institutions. Although many expressed a limited knowledge of specific aspects of higher  education, their responses indicate that they view it as a valuable asset to the state; they feel it is important for themselves and their children; and they believe postsecondary education should be one of the top funding priorities of the legislature.

Major findings were: (1) only two percent of responding agencies had a full-time nurse researcher, while 13 percent reported having a nurse involved in part-time research; (2) the presence of a nurse researcher is related to agency size as measured by the number of visits per year and to administrative staff; (3) research support services are difficult to obtain for many of the agencies; (4) seven percent of the agencies report having a nursing research section; (5) less than two percent of the agencies report having  a budget designated for nursing research; (6) in spite of the lack of research support, there exists a very large interest in developing research, and the research atmosphere is generally rated as favorable; (7) there is a wide range of topics that respondents are interested in researching, and the greatest interest is in nursing care and the evaluation of its quality; and (8) the largest obstacle to implementing research is the lack of available funds.

The concept and practice of an advising contract is discussed. It is felt that advising can contribute to the major conditions for successful personal development during the college years: facilitation of personal autonomy of the student; opportunity to engage in actions that are useful to other people and to oneself; opportunity to develop competence and produce work thereby; and learning to act in concert with other people.

The study determined the extent to which faculty participate in the activities and programs of voluntary consortia and analyzed the incentives and rewards offered to faculty to induce their participation. The levels of faculty participation were found to be uniformly low in all but a few consortia. Faculty perceived a lack of positive incentives to be responsible for their low participation. Attitudes of administrators, lack of release time or compensation, and general organizational climate were cited most often by faculty as negative factors.

The primary concern is with the board's role prior to failure, the responsibility they bore for what happened, and the opportunities for service they may have overlooked. Eight surviving private colleges were also surveyed, and statistical comparisons were made. Characteristics of the defunct institutions' board members were found to include: role uncertainty; confrontation avoidance; personal characteristics almost identical to those of trustees whose institutions survived; fund-raising patterns identical to the other trustees; policy priorities similar to those of other trustees; a lower degree of  involvement in both development and implementation of college policies in eight of fourteen policy areas.

For a number of leading institutions, the research mission has become a major function alongside instruction and has provided a valuable adjunct to graduate education. A large part of the expansion required for federal research has been supported by reimbursements from the government. However, the government has not reimbursed universities for the full cost of federal programs and the institutions have had to use funds from instruction and other programs to cover the shortfall. Major research universities are unable to solve the problem by curtailing government  research without severe restructuring of the institutions and changing their role in the affairs of the nation. Therefore, they seek equitable treatment by the government. In spite of this need, there are now new pressures in the government that would have the institutions bear an even larger share of the cost of federal programs. (Author)",

The National Commission on United Methodist Higher Education identifies three basic public policy principles: recognition of the essential public service function of independent institutions and the need to preserve those services for society; maintenance of diversity in higher education by assuring the autonomy and viability of individual institutions; and alteration of public policies that inhibit students' access to institutions of their choice. The National Commission makes recommendations regarding: financial aid programs that recognize the tuition gap and facilitate student choice;  restructuring of Social Security and veterans' benefit programs; continuation of tax incentives for voluntary support of educational institutions; maintenance of the tax-exempt status of educational property; state coordination of higher education; revision of government regulations that excessively burden higher education institutions; and elimination of regulations that adversely affect institutional autonomy. United States Supreme Court decisions show that the federal and most state governments can develop programs to aid church-related and other independent institutions without violating the First Amendment.

That statement is supported by the four concept papers in Part Two. From a theological perspective, because the world is knowable and is the expression of God's Being and Will, the Christian should seek to understand the world. The Wesleyan tradition and heritage in education is one of concern for the education of all persons, regardless of ethnic, economic, or social background. The United Methodist Church places high value on the individual's spiritual, intellectual, esthetic, emotional, and physical resources. Liberal arts education is supported as the best means of  developing these capacities. Church-related institutions should emphasize value-centered inquiry. Institutions independent of the state, including colleges and universities, help to maintain personal and political freedom. Independent colleges can more readily serve the needs of particular ethnic, regional, or religious groups, therefore helping to maintain cultural pluralism diversity in educational opportunities, encourage educational excellence, and provide a bulwark against potential state infringement of academic freedom.

        "description":"Demographic data show that the size of the traditional college-age population will decline in the 1980's and may continue downward in the 1990's. College enrollment projections vary greatly. Enrollments will be influenced by demographic factors, the social priority of higher education, parental expectations and resources, economic trends, technological influences, trends in credentialing for specific occupations, desire for life-long learning, attendance by part-time and older students, value shifts among young people, and interest in acquiring skills for service. Many institutions will face steady or declining enrollments. Enrollment problems may be particularly severe at independent institutions. Institutional autonomy, mission, costs, and administrative burdens will be  affected by federal and state policies and regulations. Legal questions regarding personnel decisions and practices, collective bargaining, and the constitutionality of aid to church-related institutions will influence higher education. Inflation rates for higher education costs are higher than for the economy as a whole and adversely affect institutions. Institutions must assess their own specific environments and take positive action to deal with the problems and to take advantage of the opportunities. The United Methodist Church is an important aspect of the environment of colleges and universities related to it. The church's financial and moral support for its institutions shows its continuing concern for them. Patterns of support vary greatly with geographic area and type of  institution. (Author)",

Important to the United Methodist tradition are: education for all, regardless of social standing, ethnic identity, or gender; education that appropriately relates faith and reason; education that helps individuals make full use of their capabilities; education aimed at high standards of achievement. Several conclusions are drawn from the history of United Methodist action in higher education. First, the sheer magnitude of that involvement is extraordinary. Secondly, the development of United Methodist educational institutions paralleled the development of the country, moving west with the frontier and  emphasized the provision of educational opportunity for all. Thirdly, the system was dynamic, always responding to the changing society it served. Closings, disaffiliations, and mergers with other institutions were natural events in the evolution of a stronger, more viable system of institutions. Continued evolution of the system is both natural and desirable. Chronological histories of all educational institutions identified as at some time affiliated with the United Methodist Church and its forebear churches in America are provided. (Author)",

At the moment, a combination of forces would seem to be pushing both students and universities toward a still more narrowly conceived and utilitarian curriculum. This situation may be temporary, and concern about its effects on higher education is no doubt exaggerated in the press and then echoed in conversations on campus; but the sense of constraint felt by students is nonetheless real. The university assumes that college is a place where students discover what they can do well, and where they are encouraged to define their talents and to develop them in a concentrated way; it also assumes that college is where students are led to a certain self-consciousness about that discovery, and come to raise  questions about the relation their particular talents bear to other forms of knowledge and action. Finally, the university would like to see more courses that address themselves, both practically and reflectively, to student fluency and writing. The committee's recommendations for general education in the university are summarized and argued for at length in this report. (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"The rate of return on the student's investment in college is the measure of productivity which relates the costs of resources expended in instruction to the values of benefits produced by instruction. Costs, which are concentrated in a brief span of years in early adulthood, and the stream of benefits, which is spread over most of the remainder of a lifetime, are combined in the computation of the internal rate of return. Rate of return computations address one of two issues. The first issue is the economic payoff realized by persons making individual investments in college education. It is concluded that productivity of American college education has not declined appreciably since 1969, and is not now declining; however, it is anticipated that it will decline in the near future  and then recover and increase by the year 2000.

No significant differences in GPAs exist between native and two-year transfer students; but four-year transfer students had significantly higher GPAs than native students.

The means of costs analysis involve a simple issue: which costs to include. This decision depends on the purpose of the analysis. The actual effects of the usual variations in costs analysis methodologies on results is slight; the acceptability of results, however, is greatly enhanced by the use of standard methods. A student of investment theory would conclude that higher education investment policies (that is, the regularly recurring decisions that result in costs) have not been rational; he would probably suggest that higher education covary costs with benefits in accordance with the results of  cost studies. Doing so brings higher education face to face with the pricing issue, and the differences and similarities between this and other industries. Some careful reflection on tomorrow's policy issues may help in developing better methodologies today. (Author/MSE)",

Students were labeled academic drops if they were achieving below a 2.0 grade point average (GPA) at the time of withdrawal, and nonacademic drops if not below 2.0. Students entering in fall were much more persistent than spring entrants. Males were slightly more persistent than females. The largest number of dropouts was in the nonacademic category, and this group increased in percentage each year. Females, out-of-state students, non-urban residents, and student with non-alumni parents were most likely to be among the dropouts. Persisters and nonacademic dropouts were at similar levels on academic talent indicators  (SAT and high school rank), but academic dropouts tended to be lower on these indicators than did persisters or nonacademic dropouts. Students in the physical sciences were more likely to drop out than students in other majors; humanities students were a close second in dropout rate. Academic dropouts appeared to be working below their potential, in that their GPAs were somewhat below GPAs predicted from SAT and high school ranks. Persisters and nonacademic dropouts achieved very near their predicted level. A question arises from these findings: Why do so many students who are not in academic trouble leave the university?

One table purports to compare institutional costs and total cost for a full-time equivalent student for the B.C. colleges and universities. A detailed examination of the table in question indicates that: (1) a significant amount of the data reported was erroneous; (2) several of the underlying assumptions were fallacious;  and (3) the data were not comparable. The results of recalculation of the analysis and the original table are presented for examination. It is recommended that a study of the type undertaken by the B.C.

The authors believe that student goals and institutional goals differ, and that as students perceive the extent of the differences, they will expect institutions to more closely relate their activities to the objectives of students. This goal adjustment has been prompted by a harsh economic climate and changing federal attitudes about the form of delivery systems to support higher education. Students are primary recipients of state and federal aid and have the choice of where to spend that aid. They are also becoming more selective about institutional program offerings. This would suggest a future of substantively different institutional accommodations than higher education has known in the past.  However, the authors hypothesize that current incentives and decisionmaking structures of colleges tend to reflect a faculty and administrative concensus exclusive of student goals, which will probably widen the gap between institutional goals and student aspirations. This, in turn, will only lessen the student's willingness to pay the costs of meeting those institutional goals unless accommodations are made. (Editor)",

        "description":"Historically, the college administration was the president alone, and the essential, if not only, qualification for the position was that he be a scholar. To meet the multifarious demands of running today's institution of higher learning, the president has been joined by an administrative team, each member specializing in a particular aspect of administrative operation. The emergence of a considerable amount of literature dealing directly or indirectly with the evaluation of college and university administrators suggests a growing concern for the assessment of administrative performance. There would also appear to be concensus on the desirability of professional development for administrators, to the extent that it is financially feasible. The traditional approach to evaluation  has been the use of instruments for rating the various desirable characteristics or activities. Another approach is that of the evaluation committee. The evaluation process should be continuous and ongoing. No one method or model of evaluation is necessarily the correct approach, since each must be fashioned to meet the needs of the particular institution and its setting. But while the practice is still quite limited, the idea is alive, and the approaches are beginning to become more sophisticated. A bibliography is included. Faculty development will be considered in an upcoming issue of \"Research Currents.\" (Author/MSE)",

        "description":"When nonteaching professionals are members of a faculty union, what effect does it have on interstaff relationships and programs? Should campus administration opt for one union or for separate unions for nonteaching professionals? A study of these issues at 18 four-year higher education institutions (comprising 54 campuses) and 72 two-year institutions (with 84 campuses) focused on nonteaching professionals in admissions, financial aid, registrar's offices, counseling, placement and career planning, housing and residence halls, student unions and student activities, health services, and special programs for minorities, the disadvantaged, foreign students, and veterans. Negotiated contracts, professional tenure, working hours, union organization, and reasons for including or  excluding nonteachers in unions were considered. The data suggest that nonteaching professionals have a significant community of interest with members of the teaching faculty. This is particularly true at community colleges and among student personnel professionals. Contracts negotiated by unions comprised of faculty and nonteaching professionals have not, however, addressed a substantial number of nonteaching professional concerns. Union organizational structures do not guarantee representation of these concerns. It appears that nonteachers must make special efforts to actively participate in the affairs of the union or they may not receive the full benefits of union membership. (Author/MSE)",

The first is that faculty collective bargaining is somehow unprofessional and automatically harmful to educational purposes. The second is that bargaining erodes the authority of administrators and trustees, thereby preventing them from accomplishing their work with some degree of efficiency and leadership. Bargaining encourages strong executive leadership and the standardization of institutional procedures. Bargaining does not, per se, reduce the employer's right to make unilateral decisions about subjects not directly impacting conditions of faculty employment. On the other hand, faculty members have rights that should be vigorously upheld, with or without bargaining.  (Author/MSE)",

This shift in decision-making responsibilities is closely tied to recent changes in enrollment growth that has reached a static or declining stage. In view of this trend, administrators must be able to assess enrollment patterns more carefully. This paper covers the following topics of analysis with an example of applications to a large, urban public university: (1) identification of past seasonal, cyclical, and trend variations in enrollment; (2) correlation of cyclical enrollment variation with the business cycle; and (3) use of the information from (1) and (2) to develop a simple regression model to predict  short-run variations. The model is even more useful in focusing administrators' attention on the need for policy assumptions in even the most sophisticated, long-range projections. (Author/LBH)",

In the first case study, the Worcester Polytechnic Institute's revised engineering and science curriculum, called the WPI PLAN, is described. It attempts to prepare students for real-world problems and stresses the integration of the humanities and social sciences into the engineering curriculum. A second case study describes the involvement of Tufts University and the health services professions. Tufts encourages the maximum cross-registration of students in  its various colleges and programs by making crossovers between professional- and liberal-oriented courses as easy as possible. New programs like the Community Health Project mix traditional academic courses with off-campus courses and projects that expose liberal arts majors to professional work. In a third case study, Babson College focuses on increased integration of liberal arts and management studies. Three liberal arts-related majors have been introduced (society and technology, communications, and American studies) that integrate the humanities to real-world problems. (LBH)",

A systemwide Center for Professional Development was established to facilitate and monitor the various models. Nine CSUS campuses have such programs that utilize a variety of strategies and mechanisms to foster faculty and institutional renewal. Since one element of knowledge needed to effectively evaluate programs of professional development is increased understanding of faculty motivation, this study reports on hypotheses, data, and interpretations that should serve as the beginning of a theoretical and empirical approach to faculty  development in the CSUC system.

The flow of students into universities and higher vocational institutions is so great and the demand for education so varied that a new system of higher education is needed. A proposal is offered that would do away with the sharp division between the two systems, creating a single system. The new system would have as large a range of courses as possible and would feature flexibility and mobility.

In this survey respondents were asked to describe any educational programs or community services available through their institutions designed especially for older adults, and to indicate any requirements such as age or income for participation. Among the 556 colleges and universities responding to the survey, over half offered no instructional programs or community services designed specifically for older adults. Nearly 25 percent provided both instructional and community services, while 5 percent had only instructional services available and 20 percent had only community services available.  This report tabulates the types of instructional services, community services, forms of organization, primary sources of funding, and plans for programs and services. It concludes that in general most colleges and universities are still focused on their traditional objective of preparing the young for \"life,\" but that others, particularly the public-supported institutions, are alerted to the academic and service needs of older adults. More attention to older adults is promised for the future. (LBH)",

        "description":"This is one of five studies performed in 1976 to examine the characteristics of U.S. medical schools and the interrelationship among variables that describe them. A principal components analysis was performed and interpreted exploring the interrelationships of 33 selected variables that describe the faculty, student, curriculum, and other institutional characteristics of medical schools. A summary of the concepts underlying principal components analysis is presented, and the resulting factor pattern is presented and interpreted. Several speculative observations were made based solely on correlations in the data, and are suggested hypotheses for further analysis: (1) schools with an emphasis on graduate medical programs have proportionally fewer MD-program alumni going into  general practice; (2) larger and older schools have proportionally more alumni receiving board certification; (3) private schools receive greater proportions of their revenue from gifts and federal sources; (4) schools with greater proportions of female students have a greater rate of approval of their NIH research grant proposals; (5) schools that have receieved larger increases in research funding between l967 and l974 tend to be the schools that anticipate the most growth in enrollment in the next five years; and (6) schools receiving the most research grants and expending the larger proportions of their budgets for sponsored research expend smaller proportions of their budgets for administration and general expense.

The eight clusters in the final solution each had distinctive profiles on the six factor scores. There were five clusters that consisted completely or predominantly of public schools. Three of these clusters consisted of established schools with varying profiles, while the other two were composed of new and developing schools. Of the remaining three clusters, two were predominantly  private schools and one was an equal mix of public and private schools.

Descriptive information and qualitative data on funding, policies, and procedures were gathered for five regional interlibrary loan programs in New York State from three sources-- questionnaires sent to each member library, on-site visits, and a weighted sample of loan requests. A profile of population, socio-economic characteristics, and available library resources was created for each region. Quantitative data were analyzed by rank order correlation or a confidence test of significant similarities and differences. Conclusions were made concerning the impact on interlibrary loan effectiveness of three factors: (1) regional characteristics; (2) the  extent and nature of regional interlibrary loan; and (3) loan processing and funding. Fourteen general recommendations were made for funding and loan processing, specific suggestions and proposals were outlined for each regional interlibrary program, and a data collection method was suggested for future performance measurement.

Market structures such as monopolies and oligopolies can exist among automated services, brokered services, and in the relationship of the Library of Congress (LC) with these services. Cost structures of the automated service industry should be examined for existing monopolies. Librarians should take steps to prevent the barriers to competition which encourage monopolies. The LC, being a library, information center, and cataloging data market, could continuously monitor the economic effects of network activities. Possible effects of a network include:  (1) service and territorial monopolies; and (2) flexibility vs. standardization of data quality. Problems associated with sharing library technical services costs among libraries, government levels and private foundations are: (1) pricing arrangements; (2) research and development financing; and (3) intergovernment fiscal relations.

Interviews with library consortia representatives and librarians, and review of plans in other states reveal the strength of existing cooperative programs upon which proposals for new management procedures are built. Principal recommendations are: (1) better methods of library service delivery between cooperating  institutions--i.e., location of materials and administration of interlibrary loans; (2) more effective leadership emphasizing the central role of the State Library; and (3) evaluation methods for cooperative activities. Changes in legislation are proposed to enable any library in the State to obtain service from any state aided library. (Author/KP)",

The 1973 issues of all services were examined and statistics were obtained for periodical and non-periodical entries. Data were analyzed and the services compared by: (1) subject arrangement, (2) coverage and overlap of periodicals, (3) core periodicals, (4) coverage of nonjournal material and archives, (5) timeliness, (6) bibliographic description, and (7) origin of abstracts. Services were found to be uneven in coverage and timeliness. The authors concluded that: (1) each service's view of the scope of the field governs coverage of library science and/or information science literature, and periodical  and/or nonperiodical literature, and (2) the low circulation of the services may hinder financing of improvements. It was recommended that the editors and representatives of the publishers meet to explore the possibility of linking English language services into a single, comprehensive service.

The business of libraries being information, they need library services; however, they also need special information which only they can create, and they need to participate in the production and dissemination of these tools for their own individual and communal development. This study examines the problem from three perspectives: access to existing library services, development of native-run library services, and effective cooperation between the two. Band councils in rural regions can establish government funded or branch libraries; however, band librarians have little training, and hours and facilities are generally poor. Few urban natives  use available libraries due to lack of cultural understanding and the paucity of native materials in collections. Friendship Centres in cities and towns with native populations need to develop information services for natives. Ontario government funding is recommended for: (1) bookmobile services to native areas; (2) native Friendship Centres specializing in community information; (3) special resource centers; (4) native media materials for resource centers; (5) increased native publication and translations; (6) a clearinghouse for information on native materials; (7) recruitment of natives into library training programs; (8) seminars for public library administrators on special problems and needs in training native personnel; and (9) establishment of a native-run college with a library  technician program.

An instructional module was developed for each step consisting of description and practice exercises. The modules were tested in three graduate library school reference courses, and revised according to faculty and student  comments. The author recommended the development of guidelines for choosing lead-in tool search sequence and specific answer-providing tools, and stressed the need for empirical research.

Students exhibiting hearing, visual mental, or other learning disabilities were enrolled in math, reading, or language arts programs prepared by Computer Curriculum Corporation. Anecdotal and objective performance data of 198 students were collected for project evaluation. Subjective descriptions offered by participating teachers illustrate students' responses to and interactions with the computer, and their own positive feedback. Graphically presented performance data indicate growth by handicapping condition and  total average in each area. It is suggested that student progress is correlated with the amount of on-line exposure to the program. (SC)",

A dozen peer tutoring systems are documented, primarily, the \"Petites Ecoles\" in France; the \"Learning through Teaching,\"\"Youth Teaching Youth,\" and \"Keller Plan\" in the United States; the \"Madras System\" in India; and the \"Media--Activated Learning Groups\" program in Denmark. It is concluded that peer tutoring is a flexible method, adaptable to different educational situations and to highly varied socio-cultural environments. It is equally adaptable to every educational level  and is able to benefit from the most recent advancements in the field of media and from research findings in psychology and social psychology. It is thought to be a valid solution to certain problems in educational development in the countries of the Third World. (DAG)",

The methodology involved selecting a single, naturally occurring dialogue, instructing a human observer to extract certain aspects relative to its comprehension, and then using these aspects to guide the construction and verification of the model. The model assumes a theory of language which states that people use language to pursue their own goals. Effective communication occurs in dialogues as the result of a common body of interrelated, cooperative goal structures. The report contains a detailed statement of the problem, a review of the state of related research, a description of the contributions of this research to linguistic theory, and a description of the research methodology. It then  describes the model in its current state of development, discusses a detailed simulation, and explores the role of the observer in the research. (Author/WBC)",

The cost factor is also present in the potential conflict between the entrepreneurial and the scholarly functions of journals. Apart from costs, the time from submission to publication of journal articles has now reached up to three years in some cases, which exceeds the time required to publish a book, and eliminates one of the original advantages of journals. In an effort to overcome some of the financial problems, some journals have begun assessing page costs to authors. There may be alternatives to the present method of printing and circulating journals, including computer-based typesetting, and  circulating only abstracts of articles with the full text available on microfiche. Another area of concern is the potential involvement of the Federal Government in journal publication, and the implications of this for professional and scientific journals.

This specific chapter concerns the communication of information in the scientific community and the transfer of information to students and practical users (manufacturers). The number of different modes of communication (formal/informal, written/oral) and the number of channels are essentially uninfluenced by international boundaries. However, the roles and characteristics of these channels are quite different in China because of differing goals, conditions, and historical backgrounds. A brief narrative appraisal is provided on the following channels: exchange of personnel, seminars, conferences,  research journals, reports, travel and publication outside China, and libraries. The transfer of technology from research to production mainly involves personal contacts rather than reports and publications. The student- faculty groups at factories, student instruction at universities, and university staff product developments bear directly on the transfer of research to factory production. The dependence on person to person contacts for technology transfer works well given the relatively small scientific and technical establishments, and the small amount of information transfer between specialties.

Primary needs are identified as greater awareness of social science literature, and a less intuitive and more empirical rationale for strategy choice. Planning suggestions include pilot testing to match media with audience characteristics;  specifying desired outcomes to measure effectiveness; specifying contexts of the program to avoid ineffective settings; and finally, consideration of the language, length, and complexity of the entire message for maximum effectiveness. It is also suggested that a regularly commissioned large scale survey be used to determine knowledge, attitude, and reported behaviors; that workshops of effective strategies for teaching the public be organized regionally, or nationally; finally, that all planners should contribute to a guide on public communication strategy that other planners could use.

An experimental adult education program launched in 1975 by the college clearly indicated an untapped adult potential in the area, large numbers unaware of CLEP, fearful of taking tests, and of the academic world itself, and uneasy about study habits. The program utilized the resources of the library, individual faculty consultants and student tutors, and combined  academic preparation with a focus on the means of alleviating such fears.

Because funding is limited, people need to be made aware of the library's potential role in society. Society has become information rich with increased white collar jobs and growth of the information segment of education, research and development, communications media, information machines and services. Information must be selected, ordered, processed, and made available to satisfy all potential public demands. Improvements in technology, networking and bibliographic structure, and the introduction of systems concepts into libraries will determine the future of reference services. To improve the quality of services, new goals and standards in information delivery must be developed  and reference librarians must better anticipate user and nonuser needs. Research on information needs governed by societal trends can aid in developing reference programs. Current job, business information, information on women, on line reference retrieval, and community resource file services will expand and improve in the future to better meet user needs. (KP)",

The model served as the basis for the design of a CAI system, teaching problem-solving in an introductory course in digital systems design. The system individualizes the instruction which each student receives in accordance with its record of his past performance. In addition, a heuristic technique is used to determine the best path for each student through the tree of course concepts. The refinement of this method of concept  selection is described. An evaluation of the generative CAI system and results of classroom usage are also presented. (Author/DAG)",

It was suggested that the research findings would be useful for inducing effective change in educational systems. The sample was comprised of English departments in thirty-seven North Carolina high schools offering grades ten through twelve and employing at least fifty teachers. Data were collected from each department with respect to technology, work group structure, and teacher perceptions of organizational effectiveness. Teacher perceptions of effectiveness were measured by means of the Organizational Climate  Description Questionnaire (OCDQ), the Classroom Environment Scale (CES), and Job Description Index (JDI). Findings revealed a positive linear association between technological complexity and four measures of structure--departmental discretion, departmental power, lateral exchange, and vertical exchange. Additional findings, while inconclusive, revealed enough evidence of association between technological-structural congruence and teacher perceptions of effectiveness to warrant further investigation. Methodological limitations of the study are discussed, and suggestions for further study are offered. (Author/SC)",

Each problem module consists of an average of 14 problems arranged in increasing level of difficulty. The program also contains a report module designed for use by the course instructor to obtain an on-line summary of student performance in the problem modules. The program was tested by a group of 135 students in a formal course, and student performance data on the problem modules are reported. An evaluation of the program by the students indicated a highly favorable student reaction and an overwhelming preference for the computer problems as compared to problems and  solutions placed on library reserve. A slight, positive correlation was found between time spent by the students on the computer and the course numerical grade. The mean course numerical grade for students using the computer was found to be slightly higher than the corresponding mean from a previous quarter when the computer was not used, but the difference was not statistically significant.

The study found that the fragmentation of organizational responsibility limits the Board's ability to successfully meet its educational data requirements. It was also found that decision-makers within the Board did not use their educational data to full potential. Finally, fragmented administrative control and the inadequate computerization of the Board's data base created problems for the maintenance of data base integrity and security. The suggested  changes to the educational data process include creating a new Bureau of Educational Statistics, developing a new computer system, and adopting a proposed reorganization plan over an eighteen month period.

        "description":"Several methods of qualifying for enrollment in English 1A (Freshman English and Composition) at Reedley College exist: among them, a grade of C or better in English A (Remedial English), teacher recommendation in English 50 (a course for students not intending to transfer), SAT Verbal score of 466 or higher, ACT score of 20 or higher on the English or Composite section, a writing sample test administered and evaluated by the college English department, or grades of A or B in at least two years' work in high school English courses. A study was conducted to determine if any differences in academic performance in English 1A were associated with the method used by students to qualify for enrollment in the course. Subjects were students enrolled in English 1A during fall 1976.  Results of the study indicated that there were no significant differences in performance in English 1A based on method of student qualification for enrollment except in the cases of students who qualified by taking English A, less than half of whom successfully completed English 1A. It was recommended that a closer look be taken at using English A as a qualifier for English 1A, and some modifications in the criteria for using English A as a qualifier were suggested. (JDS)",

Such programs are expected to be increasingly necessary since high priority has been recently given to implementing new forms of care for the developmentally disabled. The first and second chapters of this publication define the population of developmentally disabled persons and the types of personnel which are currently relied upon to provide service and care to such individuals. The third chapter reviews specific questions which the community college must answer before it implements a program for the training of direct care personnel. The fourth chapter addresses, at a conceptual level, the  development of a direct care personnel training program in terms of program objectives, scope and content. The fifth and sixth chapters examine several model programs currently in operation, suggesting that while academic training is important, direct experience is also extremely valuable. The final chapter includes general recommendations relating to development of such programs at the community college level. A bibliography is included. (JDS)",

        "description":"A study was conducted in order to determine appropriate components for a full-time faculty workload policy at Central Florida Community College (CFCC). A questionnaire was utilized in a survey of 27 CFCC faculty on what should constitute workload, and workload data for fall term 1976-77 were tabulated. The faculty workload policies of other states were reviewed through the literature and telephone interviews with eight other Florida community colleges were conducted. Results of the survey and tabulation of data from the other sources indicated that full-time faculty workloads averaged fifteen semester hours. In addition, it was found that the average sum of student contact hours and semester hours assigned to full-time CFCC faculty was approximately 33. Because student contact  hours are a required portion of the instructor's responsibility and since the State of Florida mandates that a full-time instructional load consists of fifteen semester hours, recommendation was made that the faculty workload policy be quantified as the sum of semester and contact hours not to exceed 33. Additionally, it was recommended that workloads be continuously monitored in order that workloads which do not give instructors adequate preparation time be eliminated. Tabular data are presented throughout the report and a bibliography is appended. (JDS)",

The purpose of the study was to allow ECC to determine the areas of the community it served, the strengths and weaknesses of its students, and its effectiveness in meeting their academic and/or vocational needs. Data were compared with two-year college national norms. Analysis revealed: (1) new students were predominantly black; (2) more females than males continued to enroll with the consequence that female graduates outnumbered male graduates two to one; (3) estimated parental income of ECC  students fell far short of the national norm for two-year colleges; (4) students were found to have high academic motivation but performance as measured by grade point average did not reflect such motivation; (5) approximately three-fourths of the new students planned to complete the Associate degree and in terms of aspiration to the baccaluareate and the Master's degree, students at ECC exceeded the national norms for two-year colleges; and, (6) students appeared to be primarily influenced in their college choice by practical vocational considerations.

Among the conclusions reached were: (1) the current concept of the community college is inadequate and needs reconsideration, taking the increasing numbers of &quot;new&quot; students into account; (2) the state's community colleges and technical institutes tend to live up to their claim as &quot;people's colleges&quot;, but only when all students (credit, non-credit, full-time, part-time, and extension) are considered together; (3) the colleges are moving to serve  a broader cross-section of the population; (4) community colleges represent a major social force in providing educational opportunities; (5) students in different educational programs learn of program offerings and are influenced to enroll in particular institutions in different ways; (6) the charge that community colleges/technical institutes have socially stratified educational programs has some merit; and (7) the positive relationship found between student socioeconomic status and educational program area was neither consistent across all socioeconomic variables nor very strong. A study of the educational value orientations and of the institutional characteristics influencing college choice of the respondents is presented in the concluding section of the report. (JDS)",

A model for teaching in the technical community college is suggested, based on fundamental concepts and principles of vocational education. The model requires that the vocational-technical instructor place heavy emphasis on: facilitating behavioral changes in students, committing institutional management and evaluation resources to the training of students, exposure of students to opportunities in the world of work through career awareness and exploration, intensified guidance and placement services, systematic  occupational analysis and field-testing of programs, and approaches to delivery that will maximize student success in specific behavioral changes. Student services and placement personnel must be integrated into the total process of student recruitment, guidance, and job placement in order to insure that the opportunities offered by the technical community college are really available to prospective students. In addition to providing information and assistance as early as the junior high school level, placement personnel must aid in students' decision-making with regard to employment and continuing education.

A survey was distributed to the student body; a 50% rate of response was achieved. Results indicated that students felt they learned most from class discussion, lectures, and field trips, in that order, while independent study, movies, readings, and non-class rap sessions were ranked lower in terms of how much students felt they learned. For learning modes which offered students the most enjoyment, a plurality of students ranked field trips as being the most enjoyable, followed by movies and class discussions; independent study, non-class rap sessions, readings and lectures were  ranked as being less enjoyable. Overall, the survey data did not reveal that student levels of enjoyment regarding the various modes of learning were congruent with their preferences among these learning modes. A number of teaching/learning techniques were perceived by students to be either a preferred mode of learning and/or of preferred enjoyment value, thus indicating that a variety of teaching techniques is the expressed group preference of students.

The program embodies a wide variety of activities, such as classroom studies, informational lectures, transportation, counseling, and group meetings, which are intended to overcome or ameliorate the social isolation of the elderly. The majority of programs at each of the 16 participating community colleges fit into those activities classified as recreational, social, or cultural, with the most popular being those involving arts and crafts. In all areas, however, interest and enthusiasm of participants are high. Several of the Texas community colleges make counseling  services available to the elderly while all of the participating institutions provide some form of transportation services. In addition to serving the needs of the elderly, it is noted that the various programs have heightened the awareness of the public with regard to the activities available for the elderly. While the program was initially established as a demonstration, it has become a permanent program at many of the colleges. A brief bibliography, a statistical portrait of the elderly in Texas, and a list of participating colleges is appended. (JDS)",

        "author":["Howe, Ray A."],
        "description":"This paper summarizes the findings of a ten-year longitudinal research study of attitude changes among faculty resulting, at least partially, from their collective bargaining experience. The study focused on Henry Ford Community College (Michigan), using the participant-observation approach. A number of techniques for gathering qualitative information were employed, including direct observation, informant interviewing, document analysis, direct participation, and attitudinal survey. In addition, the study was based on the assumption that social conflict generated as a consequence of efforts toward a faculty constitution and a faculty contract, contains within itself certain elements which tend to ameliorate the conflict and give it a tolerable style. The study thus attempted to  apply the principles of Clark and the propositions of Coser. Results of the study are reported in an itemized fashion in accordance with the principles and propositions of Clark and Coser. Overall, the study found that faculty attitudes had shifted from hostile and conflict-oriented to aggressive and resolution-oriented, thereby lending support to the notion that collective bargaining, through the grievance process, can be viewed as a viable dispute-resolving mechanism. Further, and with few exceptions, the attitudes and perceptions of faculty and administration were found to be very similar on most matters. (Author/JDS)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to present and evaluate Bayesian-type models for estimating probabilities of program completion and for predicting first quarter grade point averages of community college students entering certain allied health fields. Two Bayesian models were tested. Bayesian Model 1--Estimating Probabilities of Program Completion--was developed from discrete cases of Bayes' formula with counselors' inputs as a priori probabilities and posterior probabilities of graduate status of the discriminant analysis function as likelihoods. The a priori probabilities and likelihood probabilities were combined in Bayes' Theorem to produce posterior probabilities of successful program completion. Bayesian Model 2--Predicting First Quarter Grade Point Averages--which was an  application and specialization of the Bayesian linear model developed by Lindley and Smith, involved the assumption of homogeneity of regression coefficients (but not intercepts) across groups. The efficiencies for both Bayesian models were compared and evaluated in terms of two counselor-selection models and two classical statistical models with the results showing that Bayesian Model 1 was most efficient in selecting successful students while no significant difference in efficiency was found for Bayesian Model 2 as compared to a classical statistical model.

Responses were received from 413 students. Among the findings were: (1) 64% of the respondents reported their transfer coursework was harder or much harder than their coursework had been at ECC; (2) 21% indicated they were having difficulty in reading, 28% in writing, and 29% in mathematics; (3) 39% felt that individual counseling would have helped them perform better at their transfer institution; (4) 88% felt ECC had prepared them adequately or very well for their present studies; (5) 8% felt ECC had  prepared them inadequately or very poorly for their present studies; and (6) mean grade point averages of transfer students from ECC declined by .65 points. In light of some indication that students were having academic difficulty at their transfer college, it was recommended that a college-wide review of academic standards for graduation be conducted and that more transfer counseling should be performed.

A comprehensive program includes instructional development (instructional evaluation, diagnosis, microteaching, methodology/technology, curriculum development), organizational development (departmental decision-making and conflict management, team building, management building), and personal development (life planning workshops, interpersonal skills training, personal growth workshops, supportive and therapeutic counseling) for all college staff. The institutional research office may be integrated into the total process by serving as a key  resource for assessing staff development needs, establishing program goals, and evaluating goal attainment. Data gathered and analyzed by the office of institutional research can be channeled into program planning and modification through continuing feedback. If staff development is to become a vital instrument in human resource development and utilization, planning for such programs must be an integral part of overall institutional planning. (JDS)",

It is noted that there are essentially two possible purposes for administrator evaluation: to increase the efficiency of the college, in which case the emphasis must be placed on the function of the position, or to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the incumbent administrator. It is recommended that evaluations be used to increase efficiency of the college, and secondarily to apprise the individual of his strengths and weaknesses. Some practical suggestions include maintaining an awareness that evaluation will undoubtedly produce tensions, that strict confidentiality must be maintained, and that administrative ratings should be signed by both the rater  and the ratee. Use of standardized rating instruments is not suggested since such instruments are generally not able to reflect the unique situations and circumstances of different institutions. It is recommended that each administrator develop a series of short- and long-range objectives and the means by which he plans to reach them. This activity should be performed in cooperation with his immediate superior, who should be his eventual rater. Development of an effective rating system is a time-consuming affair. The ERIC system is recommended as a source of assistance which may provide evaluation developers with ideas adaptable to their situation. (JDS)",

Currently, six schools have contractual relationships with JWCC, with the result that students of JWCC are able to select from among nearly 700 unique liberal arts and vocational-technical course sections each semester. Each student enrolling at JWCC individually plans his educational program with a counselor and then selects from among the &quot;common market&quot; colleges those courses which will lead him to achievement of his educational objective. The JWCC student attending a class at any of the cooperating institutions is  treated in the same manner as &quot;native&quot; students and has access to the activities and facilities of the cooperating schools. In addition to the courses offered through the common market colleges, JWCC maintains its own open learning center wherein developmental as well as college-level self-paced mastery courses are available. JWCC also has an ambitious outreach/community service program. While the advantages of the JWCC program are many, there still remain challenges which this innovative college must meet and solve.

Analysis of the resultant data showed: (1) the overall attrition rate was 33.4%; (2) new students who did not return most often cited family problems, disappointment with program of study, financial reasons and illness, in that order, as reasons for non-return, while continuing students most often cited illness, financial problems, family problems, and disappointment with program of study, in that order, as reasons for their non-return; and (3)  overall, no single reason such as academic difficulty could be isolated as a cause of attrition. Additional data analyses were performed examining the non-returning students according to their educational objectives, curriculum, academic status, future educational plans, number of credits attempted, level of education completed, and several attitudinal variables. Grade point averages of new students were analyzed against scores on the Comparative Guidance and Placement Test.

        "description":"All Top Administrators, Other Administrators, and Faculty at Central Florida Community College (n=101) were surveyed in order to ascertain their perceptions of the college's existing governance characteristics. Response rates from each of the three groups differed but were at least 70%. Results of the survey showed that the traditional bureaucratic organizational model of the college had produced a less than desirable profile of organizational characteristics. Perceptions of what takes place at the college were found to be quite different from the viewpoints of the various groups surveyed. Top Administrator's responses showed consistently high positive perceptions of interaction, decision-making, communication, leadership, motivation, and goals. Responses of Other Administrators  resembled those of Faculty in all but the areas of interaction and communication, although Other Administrators tended to have more positive perceptions than Faculty. Faculty perceptions were distinctly more negative in the areas of interaction, decision-making, and communication, and in certain areas of leadership and motivation. A more participatory governance model was recommended to enhance faculty/administrator relations. The survey instrument is appended. (JDS)",

        "author":["Houston, Charles A."],
        "description":"This paper presents three examples of nonparametric statistical tests that can aid certain decision-making processes in the community college by using basic student data to separate &quot;scientific&quot; decision-making from &quot;opinion&quot; decision-making. A brief example of each test in a decision-making situation is related to illustrate the utility of the test. The McNemar Test for Significance Change is presented in order to examine certain enrollment changes. The Kruskal-Wallis Test examines the population distribution of several independent samples of mathematics placement scores as they relate to the high schools that the students attended. A Chi-Square Analysis is used to test the independence of students' curriculum choices and high schools attended. These tests are recommended to the  beginning community college researcher because they are easily computed and explained, do not require samples drawn from a normally distributed population, and are easily understood both in terms of theory and application and thus are less likely to be used inappropriately than parametric statistical tests. A brief list of elementary statistical texts is included with the suggestion that the researcher review them when utilizing nonparametric statistics in the generation of decision-making information.

The current method of funding community colleges in general, and adult/continuing education programs offered by community colleges and school districts specifically, are examined, their shortcomings noted, and alternatives to the present method of funding suggested for consideration and legislative adoption. The report recommends replacing the current Foundation Aid Program with Percentage Equalizing as the way to finance adult/continuing education in the state. The proposed changes would eliminate the present &quot;enrollment cap&quot;, would achieve equal expenditure per pupil and equal tax effort per taxpayer throughout California, and would generally simplify community  college and adult school financing while constraining public expenditures for community colleges and adult education to a level consistent with increases on tax revenues. Detailed analysis of the current financing system and the proposed system constitutes the bulk of the report. (Author/JDS)",

        "description":"Between 1974 and 1976 the Two-Year College Development Center conducted a project to provide cognitive style information to faculty, counselors, and administrators at 21 two-year colleges in New York through a series of seminars and workshops. During 1976, the project focused on four questions identified as crucial to the application of cognitive style information at two-year colleges. These were: (1) Does a program in cognitive style information for students improve learning performance? (2) Is there a relationship between students' cognitive styles and their performance on written assignments? (3) Is there an inverse relationship between mismatching of cognitive style and performance in occupational curriculums? (4) Is cognitive style a determinant in the type of materials  students select in a learning laboratory? This document compiles the reports of studies undertaken by eleven of the participating colleges to provide answers to the four questions, and an additional study undertaken to investigate the relationship between cognitive style and career choices. Procedures and testing instruments used in the studies are reviewed by the project staff in a separate chapter. The concluding chapter summarizes the studies and makes suggestions for further research. (JDS)",

Among the problems that such reentering women face in the pursuit of a higher education are ambivalence and resistance from husbands, guilt feelings as a consequence of having to leave their children for extended periods, lack of institutional sensitivity to the unique needs of returning women, academic sexual stereotyping, and lack of sensitivity of male faculty members. In addition, the recent imposition of tuition charges in the City University of New York system poses an obstacle to program completion for working-class women, who typically  have no income independent of their spouses. The severe reduction of counseling and support personnel throughout the City University also impinges negatively on working-class women, who have special needs for counseling designed to encourage them. Response of the institution to the special needs of returning working-class women has been inadequate thus far. Improved levels of counseling are needed, both for the woman student, and in some instances, members of her family, as are career advocacy and vocational advocacy. It is notable that some women students have taken to political organizing to obtain needed educational opportunities. (JDS)",

It is suggested that senior institutions must investigate the development of alternative delivery systems to serve the place-bound potential transfer student. Robert L. Poorman recommends that students transferring from the community college to a four-year college or university be oriented to their new environment separately from new freshmen. Receiving institutions  should make an extra effort to enhance the experience of transfer students while simultaneously capitalizing upon their special talents, for example, in the area of student leadership. An addendum outlines the questions and issues which every transfer student should consider to facilitate the transfer process. (JDS)",

While maintaining traditional curricular offerings and classroom instructional patterns, noncampus colleges dispense with the fixed campus in favor of rented and donated facilities in many locations. The eight existing noncampus colleges vary in their responsibilities; some provide a full range of academic and occupational programs within a geographically large service area, while others are limited to special types of programs or consolidate all off-campus instruction within a multi-campus district. All maintain a headquarters for administrative and support  services. Noncampus colleges exist to serve nontraditional students, particularly adult part-time students, and thus may emphasize alternative learning experiences and instructional methods such as televised instruction or contract learning. However, they remain classroom oriented, and appear unlikely to embrace the external degree or college without walls format. Despite some problems, noncampus colleges provide an efficient and flexible organizational pattern for postsecondary outreach efforts. (JDS)",

Among the findings of the study were: (1) transfer growth between 1973-74 and 1974-75 alone was on the order of 25%; (2) transfer students accounted for a small segment (estimated at 6% to 7%) of four-year college undergraduate enrollments in 1974-75; (3) nearly 60% of transfers  entered the upper division while the remaining 40% were distributed equally among freshman and sophomore classes; (4) the majority (84%) of transfers went into public four-year colleges; and (5) 70% of the transfers enrolled in a four-year college in the same or adjacent county as their county college. It was concluded that continued growth in numbers of two-year college transfer students plus enrollment ceilings in four-year colleges may lead to increased competition for space between transfers and entering freshmen and to an intensification in selective admissions that may impair access to a public baccalaureate education via a transfer degree.

On 18 of the survey items which allowed for negative reactions to the impact of collective bargaining on the college environment, respondents registered negative concurrence on 15 items. Comparative analysis of deans' and associate deans' responses showed significant differences on only three of the twenty-seven survey items, indicating a congruence in perceptions independent of role. Respondents indicated  no certainty or unanimity that they were sufficiently knowledgeable about or comfortable with their new roles in the bargaining process, although they did not feel that the authority associated with their administrative roles would be greatly affected by the bargaining process.

        "description":"A study was conducted at Black Hawk College (Illinois) to examine the purpose and status of the award of academic credit for learning gained through life and employment experiences, by assessment means other than such national testing programs as the College Level Examination Program. Procedures and practices employed in other colleges in the assessment of prior, non-sponsored learning were reviewed as were causes of negative faculty reaction to such assessment at other institutions. Subsequently, a survey of Black Hawk College faculty was conducted to determine their knowledge of and attitudes toward such assessment and their opinions on what procedures should be part of the overall evaluation process. Survey findings revealed that the faculty were generally favorable; notably,  faculty from the career area were more positive toward assessment of prior learning than were university-parallel program faculty. Those faculty supporting the use of behavioral objectives also tended to view assessment of prior learning more favorably than other faculty. Specific procedures for the assessment of prior learning were recommended, reflecting faculty attitudes and opinions. The survey instrument and a bibliography are appended. (JDS)",

        "description":"This report, part of a series of studies on student flow in the seven Hawaii community colleges, contains an analysis of fall 1975 entering students in their fourth semester. Of a total of 8,979 entering students in fall 1975, 3,653 were registered in spring 1977 and 3,302 had been continuously enrolled over the four semesters. The continuation rate from the previous semester (fall 1976) was 80%. Overall, continuation rates were higher for males, for students aged 19 and under at the time of entry, for unmarried students, for graduates of island public high schools, for new students as compared to transfers, and for full-time students. The highest continuation rates were for students seeking the Associate of Science degree. Statistically significant differences in continuation  rates were found for the community college total on all of the 10 personal and academic characteristics studied but sex and marital status. However, characteristics found to be statistically significant between continuing and non-continuing students in the fall 1975 entering group for the community college total as well as for each of the seven campuses were, in spring 1976 (second semester)--age, entry status, full- or part-time status, grade point average, and credit-completion ratio; in fall 1976 (third semester)--grade point average and credit-completion ratio; and in spring 1977 (fourth semester)--grade point average and credit-completion ratio.

The regional Adult Education Coordinating Committee compiled a list of adult education courses and services offered by member institutions, devised newspaper and radio advertising, and established a central information service with an automatic telephone answering device. Queries received were answered by mail by the project staff. At the close of the project, 274 individuals had responded to the advertising and had requested further information concerning the adult education offerings within the region. A poll of those enrolled in adult education courses revealed that 26% were aware of the advertising  and/or had called the adult education telephone number. It was noted that the project surpassed any previous regional efforts to conduct a broadly based public information effort, and that although the number of responses was less than had been desired, it was felt to have been successful as a public information effort. Appended are advertising scripts, response forms, and a financial statement of the project. (JDS)",

Of these, finance was perceived to be of greatest importance. The third section, based on analysis of enacted legislation and proposed bills reported out of committee, summarizes legislative activity in the  areas of finance, administration, physical facilities, institutional growth, personnel, students, and academic programs. The fourth section provides a separate analysis of legislative action related to the legal bases for &quot;community-based, performance-oriented&quot; educational programs. Section five presents a summary of trends and conclusions. Appendices include an annotated list of enacted and proposed legislation for each state and a subject index to the legislation. (JDS)",

Comparative analysis of national averages for faculty salaries and compensation show that Washington institutions are below the national average in terms of faculty salaries, although the amount expended for salaries and fringe benefits combined closely approaches the national mean. In addition, it is noted that the &quot;double-digit&quot; inflation of previous years has eliminated any real salary increases for the average faculty member in most Washington institutions while faculty productivity, when measured by credit hour loads, has increased. In response to the need to narrow the gap in faculty purchasing power and to remain competitive with other states,  the Council recommends that the legislature provide funds to increase faculty salaries by from 5.4% to 13.9% in the 1977-78 academic year and that a further increase be provided for the 1978-79 academic year based on anticipated increases in the cost of living. Comparative salary data for Washington institutions, for a ranked sample of states, and for a ranked sample of representative out of state colleges is provided for each of the three types of postsecondary institutions considered.

        "description":"This paper reviews existing manpower training programs in light of the dual labor market theory, and discusses the implications for community colleges in addressing the needs of the unemployed within their service areas. The dual labor market theory postulates that there are two distinct spheres of employment: a primary labor market in which participants are highly skilled, have good work attitudes, are well-paid and have opportunities for advancement, and a secondary labor market in which the participants are unskilled, uneducated, transient, marginally compensated, have poor attitudes, and have limited chances for advancement. The most important differences between the two spheres are education and attitudes. Current manpower training programs typically focus only on job skills  education, with limited attention paid to training in attitude improvement and interpersonal skills. The success of such programs is dubious. On the other hand, some community colleges have programs which integrate personal development education and skills training, with the result proving better than job skills education alone. Several recommendations are included by means of which community colleges can more effectively respond to the needs of the participants in the secondary labor market. A bibliography is attached.

Of the 1,270 institutions surveyed, 644 responded (51%). Results of the survey showed: (1) 47 of the responding institutions had honors programs with formalized academic and administrative structures; (2) the bulk of institutions indicated that while they did not have formalized academic and administrative honors programs, they did have honors elements, such as honors classes, honor societies, colloquia, independent study provisions, or financial aid based at least partly on achievement; (3) 125 institutions indicated that they had  neither formalized honors programs nor honors elements; and (4) institutional size appeared to have little effect on whether or not a formal honors program or honors elements were available for students. The author concludes that the development of honors opportunities for gifted students in two-year colleges is a relatively new phenomenon and fledgling attempt to educate one constituency in an extremely heterogeneous student population.

Information concerning type of employment, state certification, salaries, types of duties, length of employment, future plans, and interest in continuing education was obtained from 47 of the 68 graduates of the program since its inception in 1972. Employment as an Animal Health Technician (AHT) was reported by 33 respondents, primarily in small animal care facilities; 14 respondents reported employment in related fields. Duties of the AHT's were concentrated in the areas of surgery and laboratory; only three respondents reported 50%  or more time spent in front-office duties. Area veterinarians were surveyed concerning type of practice, training of currently employed paraprofessionals, opinions concerning appropriate starting salaries for certificated AHT's, interest in refresher skills courses for employees, curriculum preferences for AHT training, preferred areas of veterinary office practice activity, and job skills currently being performed by AHT's. Over half of the 71 responding veterinarians had trained their own paraprofessionals, but most were enthusiastic about the Cosumnes program.

All applicants for admission to the college who score below 330 on either section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test are required to take the Comparative Guidance and Placement (CGP) test to determine their proficiency in various skills. Those falling below the institutional cut-off point on the CGP are required to complete Special Studies courses before being admitted to college credit courses. Students may exit from a Special Studies course by completing the course requirements and scoring above the cut-off point on the CGP in that area; otherwise they are advised to enroll in the next sequential developmental course. In order to  monitor student progress, an evaluation system is utilized which allows identification, testing, registration, and accounting for every Special Studies student. This system also allows followup studies of subsequent student progress in credit courses. Among the methods used to evaluate the program are analyses of CGP score differentials and retention rates in subsequent credit courses. Included in the paper are graphic representations of the Special Studies program and the evaluation system. Special Studies course descriptions and content objectives are appended. (JDS)",

Follow-up survey instruments for employed and transferred graduates and for  employers of graduates had to be revised to gather necessary data, and faculty had to produce carefully detailed course and program descriptions. Outside editorial assistance was required to produce the 15 program brochures resulting from the project. Ways in which the project benefitted the college as well as the students, general areas of concern, and specific problems encountered (such as dealing with faculty, survey administration, and dealing with unflattering information) are discussed.

Although the state does not currently require that PPBS be utilized by its public community colleges, there is some evidence that suggests that such a mandate may be forthcoming from the legislature. It is anticipated that the PPBS concept will result in the mandating of a maximum cost per student as a determinant of state aid to the institution, with the result that some high cost per student programs may not receive funding sufficient to allow their survival. Since technical programs tend to be more costly than general education programs, it appears that they are the most threatened by  implementation of PPBS. Some technical programs in community colleges, such as x-ray technology, currently cost from approximately four to ten times as much as general education programs when measured on a per student basis. It is suggested that unless PPBS is studied and mastered, curriculum planning may become an unintended budget function rather than the most stable feature of the institution. (JDS)",

In addition, educational statistics of the area populations and an analysis of constraining geographic and economic factors were considered. Findings indicated a need for additional postsecondary opportunities. A number of alternatives were considered for establishing community college programs in the region, and enrollment projections and cost estimates were prepared. The concept of a \"community college/technical institute without walls\" was recommended, in which classes and student services would be made available in existing facilities scattered throughout the  area. Initial enrollment of 700 full-time equivalent (FTE) students was projected for the first year, rising to 1,600 FTE in five years. Total operating costs were estimated at $894,900 for the first year and at $2,720,000 after five years. Summaries of survey responses, enrollment projections, area postsecondary resources, alternative courses of action, and financial considerations are described in the report. Appendices include the survey instruments and detailed survey responses. (JDS)",

All former students, both full- and part-time, who had been enrolled in a community college occupational-technical curriculum at any time from fall 1966 through fall 1969 were identified and sent a questionnaire designed to provide the necessary data for the study. A total of 11,623 former students were surveyed--3,422 graduates and 8,201 non-graduates. Response rates were 73% and 56% for graduates and non-graduates respectively. Among the findings  were: (1) the typical occupational-technical student was a state resident, 23 years old, white, and male; (2) grade-point averages were higher for graduates than non-graduates; (3) almost three-fourths of all respondents were working in full-time jobs related to their community college curricula; (4) salaries of those employed varied considerably by race, sex, and type of graduation credential; and (5) respondents generally rated the quality of their education as superior or good and also indicated satisfaction with their programs of study.

An experimental group received instruction in child psychology by means of the behavioral objectives approach while two control classes received traditional instruction in the same subject. Students were not randomly assigned to any of the three groups; the experimental and one of the control groups were similarly composed of traditional college sophomores, while the other control group consisted principally of mature upper-middle class females. All students were pre- and post-tested and tested on each of four course units. Additionally, an  analysis of student persistence was made for each of the three study groups. Results of the study showed: (1) students in the experimental group out-performed students in the control groups on both the post-test and the unit examinations; (2) more students persisted to the end of the course in the experimental group than in the control groups; and (3) students in the experimental class rated their instructor higher than did students in the control classes. It was suggested that the study be replicated to control for the variable of instructor personality in influencing such ratings. Tabular data are presented throughout the report relating to student performance on tests. (JDS)",

Children were administered the Operation Head Start Behavior Inventory and the Caldwell Preschool Inventory at the beginning and end of their kindergarten year and the Metropolitian Readiness Test, an optional Draw-A-Man test, and the Stanford-Binet in Grade I. School marks in arithmetic and reading at the end of Grade I were used as a measure of adjustment to the school situation and of academic achievement. Results of the first year follow-up indicate  that the nursery children started with an advantage in adjustment, and were scored higher by their teachers in industry and initiative, although there was no significant difference in scores on the Caldwell Preschool Inventory. Sex comparisons indicated that although all girls scored higher than all boys in achievement tests, nursery boys and girls did not differ significantly in the amount of gain made over the year. Nursery boys made significantly greater gains than non-nursery boys. In the second year follow-up, findings indicated that the nursery group was rated higher in industry by teachers, that nursery boys obtained higher marks in reading than non-nursery boys, and the nursery group scored higher on the Draw-A-Man test. There were no significant differences between groups on the  Metropolitan Readiness Test or the Stanford-Binet, but again, sex differences were evident. Results are summarized and discussed. (SB)",

The paper presents five basic assumptions related to the teaching of young handicapped children, discusses principles of teaching special children which may be helpful to teachers working in mainstreamed classrooms, and looks briefly at the unresolved questions associated with teaching special children. The principles of teaching young handicapped children are based on the assumptions that: (1) the handicapped child has the same basic needs as all children; (2) handicapping conditions involve the whole child, not just the affected organ, limb or function; (3) handicapped children are individuals; (4) a handicap cannot be overlooked; and (5) handicapped  children are entitled to equal opportunities to learn and develop. Teaching young handicapped children requires special knowledge and understanding, active intervention on behalf of the child, and orchestration of the many facets of a total program. The problems of mainstreaming, labeling, age of enrollment, and readiness are discussed. The selected ERIC bibliography on mainstreaming handicapped children includes resumes from \"Resources in Education\" (RIE), October 1976 through January 1977, and citations from \"Current Index to Journals in Education\" (CIJE), September 1976 through January 1977.

The 1972-74 programs are described, and plans for the following 3-year period are reviewed. The purpose of this pilot project of the Brookline Public Schools is to work with families throughout the preschool years to provide optimal health and environmental conditions. During the 1972-74 period, 282 children and their families participated in the program. The document presents detailed information on current and proposed diagnostic and educational services and on program evaluation and administration. The health and developmental diagnostic services emphasize an  interdisciplinary approach involving pediatricians, psychologists, social workers and teachers. The diagnostic programs consist of two basic sections: (1) an initial diagnostic battery, covering the prenatal period and the first two weeks after birth, and (2) health and developmental evaluations, given periodically through the first five years of life. Several case histories are given, illustrating BEEP's role in early detection, referral and family advocacy. The education program focuses on the family, involving home-based programs in most cases. Included in future plans is a professional training program in educational readiness and developmental health, with workshops for pediatricians, nurses and educators. (Author/BF)",

It is suggested that an ecological view of a day care center which considers all environmental factors helps draw attention to the importance of all staff members (including cooks, bus drivers, secretaries) in providing enriching experiences for the children. Total staff involvement may entail less hierarchical distinction between teachers and other staff members. Considerations for interviewing staff should thus include attitudes of personnel towards sharing roles and status. A variety of staff selection methods (interviewing, trial participation, and role playing) is recommended. Inservice training assumes importance once staff has been selected, and planning time and basic topics for inservice  training sessions must be considered in advance. Other inservice topics of importance are interpersonal skills, conceptualization of the program, morale, and relations with parents. Communication with parents can provide information needed to understand and deal effectively with children's behavior and problems. Formative evaluation can be used as an aid to training and can help supervisors monitor the effectiveness of inservice programs. Suggestions and examples of interviewing, training, and parent involvement methods are provided. (SB)",

Two problems were addressed: (1) the lack of appropriate competencies and training for administrators of early childhood education programs; (2) the lack of early education programs in rural communities. Persons holding administrative positions in early education were identified and a role study (listing role competencies for the administrator of an early education program) was conducted, using expert juries, interviews, surveys and a position analysis technique. Various training materials and educational experiences were devised, using the competency statements resulting from the  role study. Evaluation data suggest a great need for leadership development in early education.

        "description":"This study attempts to determine if individual differences in multitask performance are due in part to the cognitive competence (i.e., the consistent, rule-based strategy) the subject brings to the task. A battery of learning (discrimination shift, transposition, incidental learning and paired-associate learning), cognitive-developmental (seriation, conservation of amount and transitivity) and psychometric (Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices) measures were administered to 120 children from kindergarten and second grades. Similarities and differences underlying children's problem-solving performance during this time were then assessed. Subjects were categorized into one of three performance levels for the criterion tasks, e.g., conserver/nonconserver/inconsistent conserver.  Overall performance, as a function of age, sex and the respective performance categories, was assessed via canonical correlations and multiple regression analyses. The results indicated that performance on reversal shift and conservation alone predicted overall multitask performance (p<001). Moreover, there appeared to be a trend toward improved overall performance from nonperformers through inconsistent performers to perfect performers on the conservation task. The results suggest that while both reversal and conservation are indices of mediation, albeit rule-based strategies, conservation is a far more powerful predictor of overall task performance. These results suggest the feasibility of using multitask, multidomain research to better understand the nature of the development of  cognition in children. (Author/MS)",

        "author":["Ives, S. William"],
        "description":"In this study, two rival accounts of the mental operations used to solve Piaget's three-mountain perspective task are tested. One hypothesis is that if children use some form of mental rotation through anticipatory imagery, scores should improve as the angle of separation between the child and the other viewer is decreased. A second hypothesis is that if children simply construct a linguistic description of the view adjacent to the other viewer, scores should instead reflect the complexity of the linguistic description of the other's view. In addition, if a linguistic strategy is used, a linguistic response mode should optimize correct responses; if an imagery solution is employed, a non-linguistic response mode would presumably be more appropriate. A total of 120 children in  grades K, 2 and 4 were asked to identify another's view either verbally or by picture selection. Results indicate that the verbal response mode leads to substantially more correct responses (82% vs. 45%) and has a minimum of egocentric errors (4% vs. 38%). Correct responses in both verbal and pictorial modes are shown to increase as a function of the linguistic complexity, not the angle of separation. It is suggested that the egocentric perspective errors noted by Piaget can be seen as the by-product of a non-linguistic response mode which does not map onto the linguistic mental operations typically used to solve the task. Spatial egocentrism emerges as a function of one particular mode of response (pictorial) rather than as a general characteristic of pre-operational thought.  Analogously, perspective taking seems better described as the handling of increasingly complex linguistic descriptions rather than as a simple &quot;present/absent&quot; phenomenon. (Author/MS)",

In Study I, twenty 6- and 7-year-olds observed thirty 3-second exposures of a color, then participated in a 40-trial choice reaction time task in which the familiarized color and a novel color served as warning signals. Results supported the hypothesis that the stimulus familiarization effect (familiar stimuli elicit slower responses than do novel stimuli) is a result of a decrease in the alerting value of that stimulus. In Study II, 20 first graders were familiarized to a color and then given 40 choice reaction time trials in which the familiar color and novel color served as response cues. An unrelated warning signal was also used  just prior to each response cue to insure maximum alertness, regardless of the stimulus that followed. Results showed that a positive encoding effect could be observed when the alertness decrement was by-passed. In Study III, 22 kindergarteners were familiarized to a colored shape and were then given 36 straight reaction time trials with one of two shapes of one of two colors. A color-form preference test was also given to determine dimensional dominance. The results indicated that the familiarized stimulus was responded to more slowly than the completely different stimulus and that response speeds to partially different stimuli varied as a function of dimensional dominance. Findings from these studies are discussed in terms of the relationship between perception and cognition.  (JMB)",

Programs reviewed range from the federally funded Home Start program to non-funded programs run locally by volunteers. Evaluations of the 28 programs, which were designed and carried out by the program staffs, were examined for evidence of immediate and long-term impact on intelligence test performance and school achievement. The summary of evaluation results is organized by three major topics: the immediate and long-term effects of individual programs; the contribution of features of the parent participation activities to program effectiveness; and the effects of programs upon parent behavior. Nearly all programs produced significant  immediate gains; the programs that carried out follow-up testing showed that program children retained an advantage in IQ score and school achievement over comparison children in elementary school. The magnitude of gains was found to be only modestly related to five variables of program format and content.

Results are based on a pilot test of the program conducted during the 1974-75 school year. Mastery activities, constructed to serve as transfer tasks for several lesson sequences, were administered on a pre/post sequence basis to six kindergarten and three first-grade project classrooms and to three kindergarten and two first-grade comparison classrooms. Classrooms were ethnically mixed. Analyses of covariance demonstrated that both the kindergarten and first-grade project groups significantly outperformed their respective comparison groups in  the analytic thinking areas of observing, causal reasoning, and flexibility.

Fifty-five infants at two age levels (10 and 16 weeks) were familiarized with a category of stimuli, and then presented with another conceptual category that was familiar (f), similar (s), or novel (n) in comparison with the first category. Subjects in the f condition evidenced no significant recovery. Recovery at both age levels was demonstrated by the subjects in the s condition, this trend being more evident at the younger age level. Similar results were found in response to novel stimulus changes. The  greatest recovery in terms of magnitude of response recovery was demonstrated by the 10-week-olds in the n condition. These results indicate that infants will habituate to conceptual categories of visual stimuli, and that rerecruitment of visual attention can be elicited by the presentation of either novel or similar conceptual categories.

Data on more than 3400 Japanese and American children (approximately half male, half female) were used. Factorial analyses of variance revealed significant age x nationality interaction for both errors and latency. Japanese children made fewer errors at a younger age than did their American counterparts, and continued to do so until their level of accuracy approached that of 11- and 12-year-old American children. The interaction for errors indicates a decreasing difference in accuracy as age increases. The age x nationality interaction for latency showed an increase for Japanese children towards a stabilized level,  while the latency for American children continued to increase, eventually becoming slower than for the Japanese children. Developmental trends for both errors and latency in both groups of children are highly similar. There appears to be a typical &quot;developmental shift&quot; present, where these identical patterns are present; yet in Japanese children they occur from one to two years earlier than in American children. These results may be related to environmental and cultural differences such as the instruction Japanese children receive in the traditional symbolic character language, the traditional Eastern emphasis on patience, and other educational and cultural influences.

Children indicated how much they thought the peer should be punished (spanked). Older subjects put more emphasis on situational or personal information about the peer (including the presence of \"Mens Rea,\" the guilty mind or the state of mind of the peer) than did younger subjects in deciding how severely a child should be punished. The order of mitigation of information for the older subjects (from most to least mitigating) was: provocation, duress, emotional maladjustment, lack of chronic occurrence, and lack of emotional maladjustment, with chronic transgressors punished more than all other transgressors.  For 6-year-old children the only mitigating factor was provocation. External constraints were more mitigating than internal contraints. Male transgressors were punished more than female transgressors. Male subjects found duress and lack of chronic occurrence of transgressions to be more mitigating than did female subjects. The findings were discussed in terms of Piaget's moral judgment theory and the development of causal schemes of attribution. (Author/JMB)",

        "description":"This study was designed to examine the reinforcing contingencies of parents toward specific child behaviors, and at the same time to try to determine if the sex of the child performing the behavior influences the reaction of the parent. A total of 24 white families with only one child between the ages of 20 and 24 months participated in the study. Half of the families had one boy and half had one girl. A checklist of 46 child behaviors and 20 parent reactions was used to observe the parents with the child in their home. Five 60-minute periods of observation were completed for each family during a 5-week period. After the observations were complete, each parent was asked to rate the 46 child behaviors on the checklist as appropriate for girls, boys, or both sexes. Each parent also  filled out a short questionnaire concerning socialization practices and values concerning sex roles. The results indicated that when parental responses to all the behaviors on the checklist were considered, girls and boys were being treated in a very similar fashion. However, when only behaviors which one sex engaged in significantly more often than the other (i.e., sex-preferred behaviors) were considered, the findings showed quite distinct sex determined differences in parents' reactions. It was suggested that these sex determined differences with regard to sex-preferred behaviors could have significant socialization effects in spite of the overall similarity of parental treatment of boys and girls.

        "description":"In a study of the effects of an anticipated reward on the interaction between rewarder and rewardee, the hypothesis was advanced that the offer of a reward heightens a child's sense of outerdirectedness and dependency upon the rewarding adult. Twenty-nine preschoolers who had demonstrated some intrinsic interest in puzzles were asked to assemble a pair of puzzles under one of two conditions, reward promised (RP) or no reward promised (NRP). As predicted, children in the RP condition verbalized more often and glanced at the experimenter more than did children in the NRP condition. In addition, although treatment group differences in quality of puzzle performance and in subsequent interest in puzzles did not attain statistical significance, both measures showed significant negative  correlations with number of verbalizations among children in the RP condition. This finding suggests that the promise of reward per se may not inevitably undermine intrinsic motivation and task performance; instead, such undermining effects may depend upon the impact of the reward on the interaction between rewarded child and rewarding adult.

Two story versions were used: one depicted the woman as a \"nice\" person who was kind to children, the other as an unkind person.

Results indicate that each ability increased with age, although significant increases occurred only between certain successive ages. Similarly, a correlational analysis of the interrelationships among the abilities  indicates that they are significantly positively related only at certain ages. There was evidence that perspective can have a significant impact on moral reasoning at certain ages. These results lend support to the contention that perspective taking mediates moral judgment, and strongly suggest that the nature of the relationship varies with age and seems most pronounced from ages 5 to 7.

Sixteen infants (16-20 months old) in the 1-word stage were matched by age, sex, and linguistic level into two groups: those who comprehended, and those who did not comprehend, linguistic descriptions of the agent-action-recipient relationship. Subjects were shown narrated films depicting action-role changes. Each subject was  shown the baseline condition which determined comprehension status, and two of four experimental conditions in which the narration was an interaction between one speech modification (repetition and reduced length) and a semantic focus (agent or agent action). A habituation paradigm was used in which correct narrative descriptions of the events were presented until habituation, at which point the narrations were switched to incorrectly describe the role relation being depicited. Dishabituation (heart rate deceleration and visual fixation) at the change to incorrect narrations was viewed as evidence of semantic comprehension. A 2x2x2 analysis of variance with repeated measures showed a main effect for the comprehension status variable. Significant 2-way interactions were found, one between  semantic focus and comprehension status and another between speech modification and comprehension status. (Author/SB)",

Each child also completed a sociometric status test and was rated on his relative helpfulness by two teachers. It was found that help given by children was reliably reciprocated by peers. Reciprocity was stronger when the recipient was liked by the giver than when the recipient was disliked. High sociometric status children received more help than they gave while low sociometric status children gave more help than they received. A negative relationship was found between sociometric  status and both psychological and directed (solicited) help received. Helping behavior occurred primarily between same sex peers and consistent sex differences were found in favor of males on all observational measures of helping behavior. (Author/SB)",

Mothers of infants born after severe obstetric complications held their babies more but engaged them in less playful interaction than control mothers. Mothers who perceived their infants as difficult to handle interacted with their infants less and were less responsive to their social bids. These patterns were reasonably stable over time, and negative maternal perceptions persisted.

Longitudinal and cross-sectional age effects were also analyzed. In an earlier study the effect of two types of role-taking experiences on role-taking, altruism, empathy and aggression were investigated in 6- and 9-year-old boys. Results of this first study indicated that boys from the two training conditions showed increased role taking and altruistic behaviors when compared to the control group. In this study 17 of the original 20 children in the training conditions and eight of the original ten children in the control conditions were retested. In addition, a  new control group was established with ten 7- and ten 10-year-old boys who were not previously tested. They were given measures of role taking, empathy, altruism, and conservation. Significant cross-sectional and longitudinal age effects were found but no significant training effects. Correlational results indicated a relationship between role taking, altruism, and empathy. These results suggest that the original training promoted a change in performance rather than a structural change. The interrelationship of social and cognitive processes is also discussed.

        "author":["Drezek, Wendy"],
        "description":"This paper describes a study designed to collect quantified observational data on the behavior of children and teachers throughout the day at three typical quality day care centers. From 50 to 55 hours of observation were completed on five randomly-chosen 3-year-olds in each setting. While the number of subjects and centers was limited, the study's purpose was not to confirm experimental hypotheses but to provide data for generating further research. Instruments used included a day care director's interview, classroom activity logs, and the Human Interaction Scale. Factors considered included relative time spent in intellectual and non-intellectual activities, gross motor compared with small motor activity, proportion of time spent in teacher-selected activity, and  restrictiveness of environment. Analysis of data revealed differences between centers in percentages of time children spent in kinds of classroom activities and in interactions with others. Such differences suggest that existing research and conceptual models of day care are oversimplified. Day care is viewed as far from uniform in its treatment of children, and need is seen for: (1) study of a broader range of centers than is normally considered, and (2) examination of the entire span of the operational day rather than of brief portions of the day. University-associated model centers, commonly used for research on day care, are seen as atypical. It is suggested that \"quality\" in day care be assessed through the productiveness of individual children's behavior and the extent of individual  environment matches, rather than inferred from the presence of set characteristics in the centers.

        "description":"The purposes of this study were to learn about: (1) ways of identifying children not accepted by their peers, (2) the behavioral correlates of peer acceptance, and (3) strategies of teaching social skills to isolated children. Sociometric assessment, behavioral observations, and teacher and peer interviews were obtained in eight 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-grade classrooms. Within each classroom, three isolated children were selected. One child was instructed in social skills, using a standardized coaching procedure; another child received a more individualized version of coaching based upon the child's style of relating to peers; and the third child received no coaching. Results from the assessment phase of the experiment indicated that scores from a 1-5 rating scale, by means of which  children rated each of their classmates, correlated highly with both a positive peer nomination measure and a negative peer nomination measure. This suggests that the rating scale method may be a way of identifying rejected, as well as accepted, children without focusing on negative evaluation of peers. Data on behavioral correlates of peer acceptance were contrary to expectations. Behavioral observations in the classroom revealed no significant differences between children receiving high versus low sociometric ratings. Results from the intervention phase of the experiment suggest that individualized coaching is more effective than the standardized coaching procedure. (Author/BF)",

A longitudinal, repeated measure design was used, and data were collected from 33 subjects, 2 to 4 years old at first testing. Four tasks were used: one to assess semantic organization (the acquisition of the superordinate/hyponymic relation between \"color\" and various color terms); two to assess acquisition of correct specific referents for color terms; and one to assess acquisition of a more general reference (knowing that color terms refer to the dimension of color as opposed to another dimension such as size). Results indicate that semantic organization precedes acquisition of correct specific referential meaning. Results from the general referential task  show that most subjects had acquired an appropriate dimensional meaning. (Author/SB)",

Five possible types of misunderstandings are identified and discussed: (1) misunderstanding of a particular term in the instructions; (2) misinterpretation of a task because the instructions are difficult to interpret within the context of the task; (3) misunderstanding due to instructions which exceed the child's verbal competence; (4) misunderstanding due to problems with ecological validity of the task (i.e., a task unlike anything the child has experienced); and (5) misunderstanding which occurs when processes necessary to solve the problem are also required to decode the instructions. Methods of testing for each type of misunderstanding are  presented and discussed. Described is a series of experiments which tested these possible forms of misunderstanding in a task (Bruner and Kenney's fullness of a water jar problem) in which misunderstanding of the experimental instructions had been claimed to account for developmental differences in children's reasoning. Results showed little support for a misunderstanding of instructions hypothesis and instead suggested that the difficulty was in the children's inability to integrate component operations. (JMB)",

Forty-eight children in grades 1 and 4 were administered one of three conditions of a recognition task in which all study words were members of one of two familiar categories. Conditions were: (1) a fully categorizable list of words (animals and occupations) along with full information as to the categorizability of the list; (2) the same categorizable list but without such information; or (3) a partially categorizable list in which that category information could not function as an effective discriminative one. All children were given the same recognition test list that included old words, new words  taken from the study categories, and new words not from the study categories. Analyses of error patterns indicated that in all three conditions children extracted and used category information, but that only in the Categorizable Informed condition did category information function as a discriminative cue to avoid false recognition of new words outside the study categories.

Children were observed in a strange situation in one of three conditions: with a familiar peer (a group-mate), with an unfamiliar peer (a child from another group), or alone (without a peer). An adult stranger was present during two of the three 4-minute episodes. Results indicated that children with familiar peers were more comfortable than children with unfamiliar peers who, in turn, were more comfortable than children who were alone. Children paired with unfamiliar peers, but not children paired with familiar peers, were upset by the departure of the adult stranger. Alone condition subjects were more upset than other subjects  whether the adult stranger was present or absent. Children with familiar or unfamiliar peers made more attempts to catch the adult stranger's attention than each other's. Overt approaches were equally infrequent to familiar and unfamiliar peers. Nonetheless, partners' reactions to the strange situation were reliably similar, indicating that there was behavioral contagion. Girls were somewhat less distressed than boys. For both sexes, age was negatively correlated with the degree of distress. (Author/JMB)",

Mothers were administered three paper and pencil measures of sex-role identity and attitudes: the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Wellesley Role Orientation Scale, and the Traditional Family Ideology Scale. Children were seen in individual sessions and asked to act out a puppet drama centering around their perceptions of the sex-role attitudes of various family members and the division of labor in the family. As  predicted, children's attitudes toward sex roles were not simply related to whether or not their mothers worked, or to their own grade or sex, but were apparently related to their mothers' attitudes.

For a 10-second period, all social interactions between members of a group were recorded using an unobtrusive observational methodology. Observations were made in a broad range of public settings, including shopping centers, restaurants, clinic waiting rooms, and libraries, in the Minneapolis area. Results indicated that as the size of the observed groups increased from two to six individuals, the average number of cross-age interactions decreased significantly. More specifically, the decrease appeared to be in touching and talking, but not in smiling.  However, the decline in average number of interactions was primarily unidirectional, showing a strong decrease in child-to-adult interactions while the adult-to-child interactions were less strongly affected by group size.

Brief descriptions of each of these preschool models are included. Seventy-five children who met age, income and family history criteria and had no previous school experience were divided into groups matched on IQ, sex, and race. These groups were then randomly assigned to a particular intervention model. Differences in effectiveness among the models were assessed by means  of batteries of standardized tests which were administered prior to the intervention, following the preschool year, and at the end of the kindergarten year. Results from analyses of this data are presented and discussed. Follow-up data over three additional years were gathered on the Traditional, the Karnes, and the Bereiter-Engelmann models.

A series of three studies was designed so that grade level and stimulus difficulty would not be confounded. Different-aged subjects within each study (second, fourth and sixth graders) used the same stimulus materials. The difficulty of the stimulus list was increased for each successive study. Subjects were required to sort unrelated words into either 2, 4, or 6 categories until two identical sorting trials were produced. Recall followed. The overall results revealed a strong effect of categorical organization on recall. The increase in recall  associated with greater numbers of sorting categories was not a function of differential sorting time, as shown in partial correlations. The major finding of these studies was that the effect of number of categories on recall appeared to increase with increasing age, above the fourth grade level. This result suggests a developmental increase in the effect of categorical organization on recall which occurs mainly in later childhood and adolescence. (Author/SB)",

A total of 212 parents and 89 caregivers in 12 day care centers were interviewed. Data analyses revealed that as the frequency of parent-caregiver communication increases, the content of communication increases in complexity and diversity, and attitudes toward discussing childrearing values and parent/family-related information become positive. Variables were identified which appear to have a significant influence on parent communication frequency and which are predictive of caregiver communication frequency.  Day care centers with high parent-caregiver communication were found to be characterized by informal social networks among and between parents and caregivers. Both parent and caregiver samples showed considerable variability in childrearing preferences across situations, but intra-consistency when examining parallel childrearing situations differing in social context. Overall there was minimal consistency between parent and caregiver preferences, and the least consistency in situations involving a child's prosocial behavior. A negative relationship was found between parent-caregiver childrearing congruence and center communication frequency. Findings are discussed in relation to a child's construction of the social world and research issues. (Author/JMB)",

In Part I, Head Start effects are examined by comparing the Head Start group and the Non Head Start group of pupils within the maximum exposure category at each grade level. Evidence is presented for three effects: the effect of Head Start or equivalent preschool experience, the effect of maximum program exposure, and the effect of low absence. These effects were found to show a good degree of consistency for the Total Follow Through population. Model-specific variation is discussed. In Part II, the actual levels of performance were examined for four quasi-longitudinal groupings: the total  group tested (cross-sectional), pupils with maximum program exposure, pupils with maximum program exposure and Head Start or equivalent experience, and pupils with maximum exposure, Head Start or equivalent experience and fifteen or fewer days of absence. The general pattern of results indicates increasingly higher levels of performance with each increasingly restrictive grouping as expected. Model-specific variation is noted for three time-points: first program grade (kindergarten), final program grade (third), and highest grade of program &quot;graduates&quot; (sixth).

Data consists of naturalistic observations of sequences of social behavior collected and coded by trained Kenyan observers. A multivariate analysis for qualitative data was employed to analyze for differences in the duration, outcome, composition and complexity of each sequence of behaviors across age, sex, and dyadic context. Results show significant developmental effects on the duration and complexity of the sequences, in which  younger children show greater rigidity and lability than do older children. Contextual effects were also significant, and indicate that children are more likely to escalate their behavior after receiving noncompliance from younger children and more likely to de-escalate their behavior after receiving noncompliance from older children. Sex differences were shown in the strategies children use to escalate their demands. Results suggest the need to employ sequential analyses to more adequately describe interactive processes.

        "description":"To assess the effect of setting on mother-infant interaction, 24 twelve-month-old children and their middle class mothers were observed on two occasions, a week apart. Half of these dyads were seen twice at home under naturalistic conditions or twice in the lab in a free play situation. The remaining 12 pairs were observed once in each location (order counterbalanced). General level of maternal functioning, but not infant functioning, was greatly affected by setting; mothers attended to, talked to, responded to and stimulated their children more frequently in the lab than at home. In addition, a change in setting tended to disrupt the individual differences in maternal rates of responsiveness observed consistently within a given setting. These results are discussed in terms of  the differential demands placed upon mothers in each setting and their tendencies to behave in a more socially desirable manner in the lab. Individual differences in infant behaviors (e.g., vocalization, cry, smile) were more stable across settings than within settings, suggesting that infants were responding consistently to the strangeness inherent within each observational context. The total corpus of results is discussed in terms of the generalizability of laboratory findings to real world settings. (Author/MS)",

        "description":"This paper is a summary of results of two overlapping longitudinal studies tracing the development of mother-infant and father-infant attachments between 7 and 24 months of age. Interaction between 10 male and 10 female infants and their parents was observed in the subjects' homes. Interaction with parents was compared to interaction with an accessible and friendly investigator. Data concerning onset of attachment and presence of parental preferences were based on the occurrence of six attachment behaviors (proximity, touch, approach, reach, seek to be held, and fuss) and five affiliative behaviors (smile, vocalize, look, laugh and proffer). Frequency of parent vocalization to the child was recorded as an index of parental activity. Two classes of dyadic interaction were  considered: play and physical contact. Results indicate that: (1) infants are attached to both parents from the time they are first able to form relationships (around 6-8 months of age); (2) mother-infant and father-infant relationships involve different types of experiences, and mothers and fathers have significant, qualitatively different influences on the infant's psychosocial development; and (3) the father-son relationship appears to be especially important from the beginning of the second year of life. Emphasis is placed on the need for attention to the particular nature of father-infant interaction. (Author/BF)",

        "description":"This paper summarizes the findings of a series of studies on the effects of \"ecological variables\" on mother-father-sibling-infant interactions. Under consideration were: (1) the effects of stress on the parental preferences of young infants; (2) the effects of the presence of one parent on the interactions within the other parent-infant dyad; (3) the effects of the presence of one parent on sibling-infant and parent-child interaction; and (4) the effect of a sibling's presence on parent-infant interaction. Analyses of parent-child interaction focused on five affiliative behaviors (smile, vocalize, look, laugh and proffer) and six attachment behaviors (proximity, touch, approach, seek to be held, fuss and reach). For research on sibling-infant interaction, eight behavioral  measures were added. Parental vocalization to child was recorded as an index of parental activity. All studies involved at least 20 subjects, at different points in the 7- to 24-month age range. Significance of the stress factor is discussed in light of varying results at different ages. It is indicated that, while mothers are the primary attachment figures of young infants, the fact that distressed infants treat mothers and fathers similarly when only one is accessible, and the fact that infants of certain ages discriminate mother and father from friendly strangers, indicate that fathers are important attachment figures. Findings also indicate that infants from 12 to 24 months of age interact far more with either parent when alone with him or her than when both parents are present. The  effects of the entrance of a stranger sibling or other parent on affiliative interaction are also discussed. (Author/BF)",

Each child then participated in four delayed matching-to-sample tasks: (1) matching a visual stimulus with a previously seen visual stimulus, (2) matching an auditory stimulus with a  previously heard auditory stimulus; (3) matching an auditory stimulus with a previously seen visual stimulus and (4) matching a visual stimulus with a previously heard auditory stimulus. The stimuli were ten pronounceable nonsense trigrams and response choices were formed from systematic alterations of these trigrams. A few weeks after the trait measures and matching-task data were collected, all first graders took the SRA as part of the district testing program.

Videotape recordings of the unelicited male, female, parental, and conjugal role portrayals were examined in terms of the children's perception of those roles along the competence and nurturance dimensions, as well as in terms of the tasks and general attitudes associated with the roles. It was found that in the parental role the female is viewed as highly competent; but in the conjugal role, (within which the role relation shifts from the child to the husband) her competence diminishes dramatically. The male, in contrast, appears the more  competent in the conjugal role and the less competent in the parental role. The accuracy, depth, and breadth of the children's sex role portrayals is discussed, as well as the preference for same-sex role play. Also included is a discussion of the assimilative and accommodative functions of role play in the early acquisition of sex role and the degree of decentration required for the role play activities to occur.

        "description":"Children's self-control behavior in motor and cognitive tasks was examined in a series of two studies in which modeling and self-regulatory mechanisms were varied to assess the influence of each. In the first study, 6-, 7-, 9-, and 11-year-old children individually played a 20-trial game of 'Simon Says' (involving activation and inhibition trials) with a male model who (1) conducted the game in the traditional manner, (2) introduced the sanction, \"Don't\", on the inhibition trials, (3) performed an action that differed from the instructions, or (4) gave instructions only without action. Results indicated that activation latency and inhibition errors were influenced by age of the child and self-control condition. Activation errors also were affected by self-control condition, but  not by age. The same motor self-control task (\"Simon Says\") and a cognitive task (picture arrangement) were used as performance measures in a second study with children aged 5, 7, and 9 who were assigned to one of three self-regulation conditions (external control, cognitive modeling, or self-reinforcement) or a control condition. For the motor task of \"Simon Says\", activation latency, activation errors, and inhibition errors decreased across age. Inhibition errors also were influenced by the specific self-regulation treatment. Solution times and accuracy scores for the cognitive self-control task improved with age and were influenced somewhat by self-regulatory mechanisms. Age similarities across self-control tasks seemed to fit the notion of a developmental function. Differential  effects of the self regulatory mechanisms are discussed in the context of cognitive and behavioral competencies. (Author/MS)",

A task analysis was conducted to identify sources of inefficient performance on the Neimark-Lewis pattern matching problem among children aged 7, 9, and 11 years. Data indicated that failure to adequately retain orienting instructions, failure to formulate an efficient solution strategy and failure to consistently implement an efficient strategy once formulated all  represented potential sources of performance inefficiency. Conceptual tempo was not associated with failure to retain task instructions. However, \"reflective\" children were more likely than \"impulsives\" to formulate high quality solution strategies and consistently implement such strategies once formulated. These data appear to contribute to the clarification of the cognitive mechanisms underlying reflectivity and impulsivity. The task analysis diagnostic procedure yielded an individual \"deficiency profile\" for each child, thus demonstrating its potential clinical-research utility for analyzing cognitive performance deficits in children.

        "description":"The relationships among the perception, representation, and construction of series are examined within a model of the acquisition of seriation abilities. The model is then related to two experiments with three-, four- and five-year-olds. The key feature of the model is the delineation of parallels among developmental changes in three arenas: changes in the information that can be perceptually extracted from a series, changes in the information that can be represented and used without perceptual support, and changes in algorithms or procedures for constructing series. To examine the kind of information that can be perceptually extracted from series, a three-choice discrimination learning task was employed. Three sets of stimuli were employed: three nonseries, two nonseries and one  series, one ascending and one descending series and one nonseries. Performance improved with age. The two series stimulus set was the hardest and revealed confusion between the two series. To examine production skills, subjects were asked to perform several tasks involving selecting items, constructing small and large series, and inserting items into a series. Performance improved with age. Random construction procedures preceded systematic construction, which preceded insertion skills. These data were used to support a model of the development of seriation in which perceptual abilities precede or are coincident with representation skills which preceded or are coincident with construction skills. In addition, a parallel in the course of development across the three arenas was proposed.  (Author/MS)",

Recall was tested on nine-item lists which were either composed of three objects from each of three conceptual categories or nine objects from nine different conceptual categories. Age differences were observed in level of recall. However, there was no evidence of age-related increases in active or deliberate strategy use. Parallel serial position curves, and comparable levels of clustering were obtained over the entire age range studied. Conceptual category effects were found on recall of even the youngest subjects. The children recalled more items from conceptually related than unrelated lists, responded more rapidly between adjacent  pairs of conceptually related than unrelated items, produced above chance level conceptual clustering, profited from categorical blocking at presentation and from category cues at retrieval. A reliable Age X List Type interaction indicated that the presence of semantic relations in list materials facilitated older children's performance somewhat more than younger children's. Results suggest that early development of memory may be related to growth in the \"knowing\" component itself, rather than to growth in \"knowing how to know.\" (Author/MS)",

The study treats the family triad as a system that is dynamic, examining the interactive behavior of mother, father, and child as they change over time. Data are drawn from a 1972-1973 longitudinal study of 14 children from 1 to 2 1/2 years of age. Children in the study were randomly selected from hospital birth records. All families were white, but a range of socioeconomic levels from working class to professional class was  represented. All mothers were nonworking and were their children's primary caregivers. Data was gathered from: unstructured observations of child and family at home, semi-structured situations, questionnaires (daily records kept by the mother) as to the child's activities as well as questionnaires investigating parental attitudes towards the child; and assessments of the child's intellectual competence. A number of results were found and are discussed in some detail, including differences in amounts of child's interaction with mother and father, parent-initiated behavior, mother's and father's social-physical play with the child, mother's and father's verbal interaction, and effects of mother's and father's behavior on the child's development.

A total of 23 infants were observed twice a month in their own homes starting at 12 months of age and continuing through 24 months of age. These observations were subsequently coded into 30 item categories which were derived from the Purdue Home Stimulation Inventory and which reflected the physical environment. The Binet was administered at 31 months in the child's own home. Data were anlayzed by means of correlations between Binet performance and physical environment indices for each 3-month time block between 12 and 24 months. Results indicated that the amount of verbal interaction directed toward the child and the physical  responsivity of the environment were consistently and positively related to Binet performance across all time blocks. Other physical environment items, including the presence of noise/confusion in the home, environmental predictability, variety of objects available to the child and a lack of physical restraints on exploration, were related to Binet performance only at specific age levels. Analyses by sex indicated that relationships for females appeared earlier then male relationships and that stimulus variability was uniquely related to female development while a responsive physical environment was uniquely related to male development.

Four areas of functioning were focused on: curiosity and exploration, learning and mastery, autonomous behavior, and interpersonal contacts. Thirty exploratory and 30 cautious children were selected through teacher ratings and exploratory tasks and observed in their classrooms throughout a school year. Observational data were collected through detailed narrative records of 5- to 15-minute periods and with a precoded observation system in which behavior was coded in predetermined categories at short time intervals. Observers had no knowledge of which children had been labeled exploratory or cautious. Results indicated primary differences in social interaction with peers, spontaneous  expression of ideas and feelings and aspects of self-direction and autonomy in the classroom. However, exploratory and cautious groups were not systematically different in work persistence, management of classroom resources, the nature of contacts with teachers or the pattern of work relationships with peers. There was no simple confirmation of the hypothesis that exploratory children might be more generally effective in open classrooms than cautious children, though some patterns of behavior were different.

Established to aid low-income families in providing for adequate child care, the program is administered by the state Department of Community and Regional Affairs. The Department established standards of eligibility for day care benefits and contracts with local communities for direct program administration. Subsidy grants are available only to communities with licensed day care facilities, with the parent or guardian selecting the provider. Eligibility is determined on the basis of family income, number of children, and single-parent status. The document includes  brief descriptions of programs in 11 urban and rural communities, and consists mainly of appended tables which illustrate the scope and growth of the program, presenting details of operations in the individual communities.

        "description":"This paper summarizes a series of studies investigating the nature of children's attention to television. In a study of distraction, children's visual attention was found to be affected by distractions in the environment, by the nature of the program and by the viewer's own patterns of attending. A study of the general patterns of attention to television revealed that children have an inertial tendency such that they can become &quot;locked in&quot; to TV viewing. The longer a child had been visually attentive, the greater the probability s/he would continue that attention. This phenomenon was labeled &quot;attentional inertia.&quot; Another study investigated the conditional probability of looking back at the television as a function of time since the end of the last look. Again, results indicated  the operation of attentional inertia. This phenomenon was also present in a study done with college student subjects. The possibility of generalizing attentional inertia beyond television watching is discussed. (SB)",

Variables considered were cognitive development and academic achievement. Subjects consisted of 39 children, 2 1/2 to 6 1/2 years of age, reared communally from birth, and 39 home-reared children matched for age and sex. The Synanon community provided an example of child-rearing by multiple caregivers. Up to 20 different caregivers per year rear the children, who live in peer groups from birth to adulthood. Parents average approximately three hours a week with their own children. The home-reared group was comprised of children from upper-middle-class, two-parent families, with the mother as primary caregiver.  Cognitive development was assessed with the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. In addition, the 5- and 6-year-olds were given the Peabody Individual Achievement Test. Results indicate that multiple mothering, per se, is not detrimental to cognitive development. It was also shown that IQ can be influenced through environmental change, increasing to significantly above the average. Significant preliminary evidence showed steady increases in Synanon children's IQs from age 2 to 6, while home-reared children remained farily constant in IQ across age. The study also demonstrated that 4-year-olds can successfully be taught first grade materials. (Author/BF)",

Piagetian tests of classification and seriation and a variety of specially designed cyclic tasks were administered to 62 children, ranging in age from 4 to 10 years. Results show major progress in the representation of cyclic order and recurrence during the age period examined. The age patterns support the theoretical distinction between the cyclic features of order and recurrence. Children are able to produce a correct order of the elements of a cycle about two years earlier than they are able to distinguish permutations which preserve cyclic order from those which violate it. The ability to  produce a correct order is related to seriation performance, but not classification performance, when the variance attributable to age is partialled out. Continuity responses appear to be unrelated to performance on either of the Piagetian tasks tested when age is controlled. (Author/BF)",

Most studies on the emotional impact of ability grouping indicated that being placed in the low group carries a certain social stigma, although findings in one study suggested that students of low ability levels have higher feelings of self-worth in homogeneous settings. Studies concerned with self-image and social relationships found that children were aware of grouping, even in heterogeneous classes, and that peer acceptance was greater in heterogeneous classes. Studies of attitude and self-concept of children in homogeneous  grouping programs showed that these programs seemed to be most beneficial for children in the high status groups. In the study reported here 713 sixth grade students (356 homogeneously grouped, 357 heterogeneously grouped) from six elementary schools were administered a questionnaire devised to test the students' concepts of their interpersonal acceptance and academic success. Results indicated that homogeneously grouped children indicated more favorable adjustment to other children and schoolwork than heterogeneously grouped children, though there appeared to be as much, if not more, difference from class to class in each organizational plan than between the two large organizational plans. Some sex differences were found. Results were sufficiently varied to suggest that the entire  grouping question should be studied in depth. (SB)",

        "description":"This study explored the relationship between the mother-infant interaction and the concurrent perceptual-cognitive and intellectual status of the infant. One hundred and eight-nine 12-week-old infants were given a battery of perceptual-cognitive tasks, including the Mental Developmental Index (MDI) of the Bayley Scales, the Corman-Escalona Scales of Object Permanence, and an attention task measuring response decrement and recovery. Data from these tests failed to show any sex or social class differences. However, the MDI was affected by birth order with first borns showing superior performance. In general, these three measures of perceptual-cognitive ability were unrelated. Mother-infant interactional data were collected and analyzed on three levels; frequency distributions,  determination of simultaneous behaviors, and directed interactional behavior. The third level of anlaysis yielded more conclusive results concerning relationships between maternal behavior and infant performance. These findings suggest that specific contingencies between maternal and child behaviors are more informative than simple frequencies of behavioral occurrences, and that mother-infant interactional behavior is related to the young infant's cognitive status.

Forty normal mother-neonate pairs were studied, and the target behaviors were examined using an adaptation of the techniques developed by Brown and Bakeman (in which approximately 60 different mother behaviors and 40 different infant behaviors are coded). Two observers simultaneously coded the behaviors shown on videotapes of the mother-infant feedings. Aggregate scores of four specific maternal and infant behaviors accounted for more than 32% of the variance in total weight gain. These findings indicate that the availability of nutrients is not in itself a sufficient condition to meet the infant's nutritional needs.  Implicit in these findings are the possibilities that infants at risk of failure-to-thrive can be identified, and measures to prevent this syndrome can be introduced. (Author/SB)",

Topics covered in parenting group sessions include initial adjustment to the baby, infant development, baby care, and husband and wife relationship after the baby. Meetings often feature films or guest speakers. Extensive questionnaire data collected for 26 couples who have been in the Parenting Groups will be contrasted with data for a comparison group of 33 motivated  couples with similar backgrounds.

Forty teachers, 20 male and 20 female, were observed for 10 hours each during free play periods in preschool classes. Ten teachers of each sex were experienced (with at least 3 years' teaching experience and some formal training in early childhood education), and 10 were inexperienced (with less than 3 years' experience and no early childhood training). Analyses of observation data indicated that: (1) experienced teachers initiated more activities than inexperienced teachers, while inexperienced teachers joined children's play groups more  often; (2) experienced teachers of both sexes interacted more with both boys and girls when they were engaged in feminine preferred activities; and (3) inexperienced teachers of both sexes interacted more with boys engaging in masculine-preferred activities and girls engaging in feminine-preferred activities. Differences between male and female teachers were much smaller than differences between experienced and inexperienqed teachers. The fact that inexperienced teachers of both sexes were similar to male teachers described in other studies was interpreted as suggesting that some of the results previously attributed to sex of teachers were probably due to differences in amount of experience between male and female.

Evaluation data from all the programs are combined to provide an assessment of the overall effectiveness of parent training programs.

The low wages in underdeveloped countries are critical for the maintenance of their position as dominated, for these low wages allow the dominant industrial countries to receive goods at relatively low cost and also to reduce the internal mass market of the underdeveloped countries to a minimum. In a colonial period, education is used by the capitalist countries to produce elites in the dominated countries. Today universal education policies in the underdeveloped countries keep these countries in a state of underdevelopment, for the costs of education and the growing  unemployment rates of the educated in urban areas perpetuate a state of dependency. For the individual rural family, belief in advancement via education hinders the individual production and accumulation process and also creates a number of family liabilities in the form of children who cannot function within the existing rural society because they have never learned the required skills. By teaching things which have no obvious usefulness, institutionalized education plays a major role in creating the required mentality of a working class which can be and is controlled by the dominant classes in both the capitalistic and underdeveloped countries.

This study examined the effects of the program on 5, 6, and 7-year-old children living in isolated communities on the coast of Labrador. Since these children functioned cognitively 1-2 years below their chronological age when compared to urban middle-class children, focus was placed on whether the program could be a valuable learning device for children older than those for which it was designed and who were functioning below average for their ages. Over a three year period, children in  grades K-2 were administered the: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, and Criterion Reference Tests. The results showed that though there was an initial gain by those viewing the program, by the end of the second year all groups were functioning at an equal level. Suggestions are made for continued enrichment throughout elementary school rather than a short-term program. (NQ)",

        "author":["McKellar, Peter"],
        "description":"In producing programs and establishing policy criteria for the institutional church in rural Canada, planners must deal with community groups or types in order to maximize the transferability of programs and policies. This paper discusses a two-dimensional typology (social context and social position) based on the belief that there is a real interaction between the community, its institutions, and its environment. When the social context dimension is applied to rural Canada, five community types are identified; rural town or village, ex-rural town or village, rural neighbourhood, ex-rural neighbourhood, and resource development towns. The three &quot;social positions&quot; are: dominant, subordinate, and exclusive. Most people experience the church as part of their social context. They  attend, support, benefit from, and are enriched by the church in that context. But, the acceptance of a given program, its success across Canada, even within a type of rural community, such as in rural villages, also depends upon the community's social position. If a dominant village tries and approves a program, other villages in the area will accept it readily. Yet, if an exclusive community accepts a program early in its life other communities nearby will reject it at once as irrelevant to their situation. Therefore, it is crucial to describe and define the communities. (NQ)",

        "description":"The rural Appalachian community of a few decades ago functioned as a relatively autonomous social, economic, educational, and recreational unit. It was a producing and consuming unit that provided a setting for interaction patterns that led to the building of the family social structure, which, in certain respects, contained rigid and well-defined patterns of authority and division of labor. Factors that contributed to the nature of the family structure were the isolation and cohesiveness of the rural community, similarity in organization of the various families, and a value orientation which strongly supported family and community organization. In recent years, the rapid improvements in means of mass communication/transportation, the availability of employment opportunities in  urban centers, and improved education have affected the isolation of Appalachia and its relationship with the larger society. Interaction and communication with the larger society have contributed to the breakdown of family autonomy, wherein the rural referent has become a negative one. For some Appalachian families, however, a lack of means and cultural pluralism have produced a discord and deviance which manifests itself in extremes of non-conventionalism or traditionalism--behavior born of certain fears and the inability to compete in the mainstream, which, when reinforced by local interaction constitutes a culture of poverty.

Based on census and Office of Civil Rights data, the data are mainly for 1970, although information for other years both before and after 1970 is also included. Information pertains to: the response of higher education to Chicanos; Chicano representation in higher education; issues facing Chicanos in higher education (access, retention and attrition, faculty, administration, funding, instruction and curriculum, Chicano Studies, research, and survival); the eligible population; undergraduate and graduate enrollment; enrollment by fields of study; and brief case studies of select institutions. The data  indicates that Chicanos are under-represented at all levels of higher education. The proportional representation of Spanish-surnamed people declines the higher the level of education. Relatively higher percentages of Chicano enrollment are found in Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas which have the highest percentages of Chicanos in the general population. High percentages of Spanish-surnamed people are also found in the educational institutions of Florida and New York where the Cuban and Puerto Rican populations respectively are concentrated. These 7 states accounted for 83% and 80% of all Spanish-surnamed enrollment in higher education in 1970 and 1972 respectively. (NQ)",

        "description":"In order to test the hypothesis that the longevity of aged persons differs according to residence and by sex, race, and marital status, data from every third year between 1962 and 1974 in the Louisiana State Bureau of Vital Statistics were examined. Criteria for population inclusion were: people over 65 years of age; Louisiana residents at time of death; and death not due to external violence. Altogether, 14,420 deaths of persons over 65 were recorded in 1962; 15,528 in 1965; 16,207 in 1968; 16,018 in 1971; and 16,893 in 1974. Findings indicated: rural females were the most long lived; urban males had the shortest lifespan; urban blacks had the shortest lifespan in 1962 and 1965 and rural whites had the longest lifespan; urban blacks had the shortest lifespan in 1968, 1971, and  1974 and urban whites had the longest life expectancy; urban married persons in 1962, 1965, and 1968 had the shortest lifespan; rural once married had the longest life expectancy; rural married persons had the shortest lifespan in 1974 and rural once married had the longest lifespan; residence had a more pronounced effect on longevity in 1962, 1965, and 1968; in recent years (1971 and 1974), longevity had not been affected as greatly by residence.

Every third year in the 12 year period was arbitrarily selected as a sample year.

The Comparative Mortality Index (CMI), the General Index of Longevity (GIL), and the Level of Longevity of the Elderly (LLE) were constructed for analytical purposes. The findings were: the CMI indicated that for Louisiana aged as a group and for urban Louisiana aged, mortality  rates decreased during the period 1962-74; for the rural Louisiana aged the CMI showed a decreasing pattern from 1962 to 1971 with a slight increase between 1971-74; the GIL definitely showed that Louisianians were living longer and that rural Louisianians had a substantial longevity advantage between 1962-74 over urban Louisianians; the LLE showed an increase in longevity for Louisianians over 60 years old as a whole and especially for rural Louisianians, while urban Louisianians over 60 were surviving at a decreasing rate, according to their LLE.

Major barriers to the full provision of Indian child welfare services were identified as failure to: understand tribal cultures; recognize the special legal and cultural factors that arise in providing services to Indians; involve Indians in child welfare matters as foster and adoptive parents, as administrators and staff, or as advisory board members; foster programs operated by tribal governments. Major recommendations were: the  Federal government should support the operation of child welfare programs by tribal governments and Indian organizations (capacity building activities, tribal courts/codes, and direct or state-Federal-tribal funding); adoptive and foster care placements of Indian children should include increased involvement by tribal governments and Indian-run agencies and increased efforts to place children in Indian homes; child welfare services should respect and consider the cultural background of both the child and parent; more preventive and supportive services are needed; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs' boarding schools need to include more child welfare services.

The variables employed were: race (white and black), sex, place of residence (city, town, country, and farm), and academic performance. Respondents were asked to identify both career choice and rationale for career choice. Findings indicated: the only major source of career selectivity existed along sex lines; there was little support for the contention that education represents a more easily attainable point of entry into the  professions for black, rural, and less academically successful youth than the health situs; youth aspiring to education careers were more motivated by humanitarian considerations than those aspiring to the health professions; when sex was held constant, several distinctive attitudinal differences were observed between youth aspiring to careers in education and health. Since these data failed to consistently show any extensive selectivity of youth aspiring to professional careers, it was suggested that perhaps these considerations were not as meaningful at the level of aspiration as they might have been at the level of expectation.

Resulting data were tested for scalability, and two independent Guttman scales were constructed. The household head scale consisted of seven conditions and the homemaker scale of six conditions. A restudy of the same 21 counties was conducted in 1972 with the objective of determining changes which had occurred in counties classified as low-income in 1960 (no effort was made to contact the same households, but 190 of the same households were interviewed again). Three social and  economic factors describing household status attainment (occupation of household head, family income, and social participation) were considered in terms of differentiated aspiration levels. Findings indicated use of a hypothetical goal situation to measure the aspirations of adult females was valid; however, it was concluded that aspiration projected by the homemaker for her husband was a less appropriate procedure in the context of the 1970's than it was in the 1960's.

Factors were in the areas of the labor market behavior, income and earnings, poverty, welfare system and welfare reform, manpower development and training, economic development, and the community's social and political environments. Data were derived from: an extensive survey of households which obtained economic, social, demographic, and behavioral information; and a survey of county institutions which obtained specific information concerning business activities and the community's economic and social structure and organization. Surveys were conducted in Dodge County,  Georgia; Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana; Starr County, Texas; and Sunflower County, Mississippi. Major conclusions were: a substantial portion of the rural southern population was unable to obtain adequate income through work; rural workers were hampered in their income generating efforts by low educational levels, lack of training and of work experience, and health problems; employment discrimination by race and sex was pervasive and one cause of low incomes; and transfer programs had not eliminated poverty and welfare reform would have had significant beneficial impacts on many low income families and the overall economy of the rural South.

The hypotheses developed were: outdoor educational experiences provide a long lasting effect on those who have had the experience; past outdoor educational experiences provide for awareness of the environment and environmental problems; concepts for outdoor education are of value to outdoor educational programs; and parents who participated in outdoor educational experiences as students feel the experience was worthwhile and would support an outdoor education experience for their children. Data were obtained from: a letter sent to the teacher asking about the program,  and attitude questionnaires mailed to 22 participants of the 1963 class and 16 of the 1966 class. Ten of the 22 and 5 of the 16 questionnaires were returned. It was found that the residential outdoor education experience that these adults participated in as children had had a long lasting effect on them. They remembered their experiences, and the activities they participated in. They felt that this experience was good and worthwhile to them, and it would be so to their children. The opportunity to enjoy the outdoors as children may have led to their interest in outdoor activities as adults. (NQ)",

This paper presents baseline data on the socioeconomic plight of the Spanish speaking elderly. Data pertain to: population growth, nativity, family status, education, labor force participation, income, home ownership, mobility, crime victimization, and voting. Data indicate that: although the elderly Spanish origin population has numerically tripled in the last two decades, they represent approximately 3.5% of the total Spanish origin population; the Spanish origin elderly are largely younger elderly; half are of Mexican origin; three-quarters live in the central city of larger metropolitan areas; approximately 10% live with their  children; the majority live in husband-wife primary family households; females are more likely to live alone; the Spanish speaking elderly have the second highest illiteracy rate in the U.S. among racial/ethnic groups; they are less likely than other elderly to be retired; they have extremely high rates of home ownership and are more likely than not to own a home built before 1949; they report low rates of victimization and exhibit high rates of \"feeling safe\" in their neighborhoods; and they have the highest rates of inter-county mobility, especially among persons 85 years and over.

The implementation procedures of this program are described as involving: sensitivity to community specific constraints; central storage of the fluoride tablets in the school cafeteria with fluoride tray preparation performed by cafeteria personnel; student self-administration of tablets on a daily basis as they enter the cafeteria for lunch; daily program monitoring by teachers on cafeteria duty; parental involvement to encourage program participation (prior to the program, less than 9% or 176 of all elementary school  children were receiving a fluoride tablet at home, while after implementation, 90% or 1,846 students were receiving the tablet daily); an annual cost of $1,163 for distribution to 1,846 students during the academic year (trays for tablet distribution were constructed by the local high school's industrial arts department, making the per student cost amount to 63 cents per student for the tablets and about 5 cents per student for the trays).

Emphasizing the unique and valuable contributions of these diverse groups, multicultural education enabled the students to retain and develop their cultural identity while learning the values and lifestyles of mainstream America. During the year, multicultural themes were included in English, Spanish, French, sociology, history, New Mexico Studies, Native American Studies, environmental science, home economics, music, art, and religion classes. Unit outlines are given for: English (\"The Diary of Anne Frank\" and writings of Asian, Black, Mexican and Native American authors);  social studies (regional folklore and history and New Mexico's history and culture); home economics (Chinese, Italian, Jewish, North American, Spanish/Mexican American foods); Christian Education (religious dances from various cultures); and science (Chaco Canyon). The five major events celebrated during the year are outlined--Black Heritage Day, Lunar New Year, Christmas, a Pow-Wow, and a Mini-Course Week. Appendices include: a discussion of current emerging needs and issues; guidelines for evaluating textbooks; a listing of the nutrient content of some Southwestern foods; eight New Mexican folk tales; and a student essay on Father Antonio Jose Martinez.

The indicators employed were: income; job opportunities; agriculture and land use; transportation; public utilities; public schools; churches and religion; medical care and health services; welfare; county government; crime and law enforcement; physical environment; opportunities for special groups. Results indicated: knowledgables tended to be more favorable than the household sample in their assessments; both groups were highly favorable; the two groups gave equal assessments of  the current quality of schools and improvements in wages and job opportunities, agriculture and land use, opportunities for Negroes, and churches and religion; fewer than half of both groups saw improvement in county government, local politics, crime/law enforcement, the physical environment, agriculture and land use, and churches and religious life; aspects of life quality rated favorably by less than 50% of the residents and by more than 50% of the knowledgables were: quality of law enforcement and improvements in job opportunities, real income. recreational opportunities, and opportunities for old people.

Each paper was coded on a matrix by position (s) taken (1 of 10 options) and by factors included (structure, finance, quality of education, transition, legislation, and other circumstances), allowing for indications of positive/negative and specificity/intensity of statements. Major conclusions were: there is real and deep dissatisfaction with the delivery of educational services in the unorganized  borough, and it is universal; the Act establishing the Alaska State Operated School System (ASOSS) was conceived with inadequate planning, cursory input from constituents most likely to come under its influence, and lack of foresight as to its consequences; the authority for controlling education should be aligned with the development of local government units as envisioned by Alaska's Constitution; in order to eliminate constituents' fears re local control, an intense period of information dissemination, planning, and training must be provided; reorganization on the basis of local government will require flexibility and planning.

        "description":"Focusing on the processes involved in making formal bureaucracies responsive, the study examined: the structure of formal grievance and redress procedures within the criminal justice system in San Jose, California; and the informal strategies used by politically active members of the Chicano community to extend and strengthen these channels. The primary channel for complaints against individual police officers was a two-man Internal Affairs Investigative Unit within the police department. However, claiming that their work involved confidential personnel matters, the department refused to release any information on how many complaints were received or how they were resolved. Two years ago, in response to continuing pressure, the municipal government hired an ombudsman to serve as  an advocate/investigator for citizens with grievances against any city agency. However, his effectiveness was doubtful. Although there were several channels of informal support for grievances, the most these groups did was provide moral support and skills in filing a complaint through the Internal Affairs unit. The Chicano community had three possible strategies for maximizing their influence on the grievance and redress procedures: to strengthen the existing avenues for registering grievances and obtaining redress; to utilize legal strategies for making the agencies responsive to community needs through individual and class action lawsuits; and to use community political influence and pressure to redefine police policies. Of these, political strategies appeared the more promising.  (NQ)",

        "description":"Program evaluation can be used for both program improvement and program justification, and it can aid in program planning and policy making. In evaluation, we must be concerned with the components which not only make up the program but also the evaluation such as program objectives or goals, program personnel interaction, program processes, resources, intended audiences, evaluation objectives, types and levels of evaluation data, judgment-making processes, evaluator roles and responsibilities, etc. The process of evaluation has no single set of procedures, but the similarities among evaluation models can be identified as: program description; criteria formulation; evidence gathering; judgment making; and dissemination. Established and potential rural development evaluators must  be aware of the pitfalls inherent in the evaluation process; the following are some of the evaluator's concerns: irreproachable ethics; program evaluation responsibility vested in a single person; communication of all evaluation plans to the total program staff; data derived from many rather than one source; sensitivity to the necessity of diplomacy; areas of negotiation by program staff and evaluator; flexibility; spelling out program options rather than making actual decisions; commitment to evaluation; evaluation feedback to the proper personnel; and solicitation of feedback prior to implementation.

Of these, 8% were preschoolers, 58% were at the elementary level, 21% at the junior high level, and 13% at the senior high level. Slightly more than 3/4 were Mexican American, with an estimated 48% being Spanish dominant in the use of language. The elementary program included reading, language development, mathematics, spelling, cultural awareness, general tutoring, and career awareness. The secondary program included reading, spelling, general tutoring, counseling, career awareness, mathematics, and self-concept development. Focusing on the program's impact, this report provides an overall view of the whole program as it operates in  the State; presents eight area reports which provide detailed information of the regular school term on a school-by-school, component-by-component basis; and presents six area reports of the summer school programs. Data covered in the reports are: the area's migration patterns; number of districts, schools, pupils, and personnel; budget totals; and sites and grades served. All reports have appendices which display support service statistics. The Eastern Oregon State College Bilingual Teacher Training Component and the Migrant Education Service Center's activities are also discussed. (NQ)",

        "description":"Focusing on how &quot;North Town&quot; Anglos and Mexicanos have related to each other and have dealt with the proplems of economic inequality and racial discrimination, the study characterized the ethnic relations into three major historical periods: the &quot;Rancho&quot; Era (1900-30), the &quot;Colonia&quot; Era (1930-60), and the Contemporary Period (1960-75). During the &quot;Rancho&quot; era, ethnic relations took place under an extremely exploitative, paternalistic sharecropper system, supported by open racism, strict social segregation, and effective Anglo political machines. Within this environment, an extremely poor Mexicano laboring class created its own communities and sustained its cultural traditions. The &quot;Colonia&quot; era was marked by major transformations in the local labor system and &quot;Mexican Town&quot; as an  independent community. Mexicanos began developing their own economic and political leaders and organizations. They began challenging the earlier patterns of economic exploitation and social segregation. The Contemporary period was marked by heightened Mexicano-Anglo confrontations over the control of the city, school, and county governments. This period saw the rapid rise and decline of a Chicano third party, the &quot;Raza Unida&quot;, and the aggressive and conciliatory responses of local Anglos, who organized into the Better Government League. The present ethnic confrontation represents a process of &quot;historical retribution&quot; to some and a &quot;sickness&quot;, a &quot;cancer&quot; in the American way of life to others. To most, the conflict is a great source of pain and confusion; and &quot;North Towners&quot; are struggling  to recapture a more harmonious community life. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"Designed to be self-contained, the material in this workbook on social indicators can be used for teaching and research purposes by agency field workers and/or undergraduates from developing nations who do not have a social science background. Originally presented to 22 professional people from Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines as part of a 10-week workshop on research methods for rural development held at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii (November 1975), this material includes many illustrative tables (e.g., Proposed Indicators of Overall Philippine Well-Being; Criteria of Social Well-Being and Variables Used in Analysis of 48 United States; Preliminary Cross-Cultural Scale for Measuring Level of Living; Comparison of Level of Living Scores for Georgia, Puerto  Rico, and the Dominican Republic; Sample Household Food Consumption Schedule; Mauritius: Food Balance Sheet, 1960-64; etc.). Since data indicate food is virtually all that rural poor people in developing nations have and since most social indicator measures are more appropriate for urban dwellers in developed countries, especially the more affluent, it is suggested that food be made the core measure at the family, village, and national level. It is further suggested that food is inherently distributive (even the rich can only eat so much) and that as an indicator of human welfare, food avoids the problem of value judgments upon the relative quality of life provided by a given technological innovation.

To ascertain whether senior citizen centers are located in areas of client concentration, for example, this model superimposes the location of senior citizen centers on the actual distribution of persons aged 65 and over. Presenting an example of the overlay technique as applied to a national study of quality of life involving nine indexes, this paper includes graphic illustrations of the technique. A further example of this technique as applied to a rural development project in Clinton County, New York is presented to illustrate the way in which four major phases of investigation  (census and background data, crossroads survey, key informant survey, and general sample survey) can be compared via the overlay method. On the basis of the work presented in this paper, the following recommendations for assessing rural service needs are made: (1) assemble all pertinent census and secondary data; (2) map the data by geographic location; (3) conduct a windshield survey to identify actual locations of services; (4) interview key informants about where local residents go for services and what particular services are needed; (5) assemble all the data on overlay maps and present to local decision makers.

        "author":["Rivera, Felix G."],
        "description":"The paper introduces a 3-level paradigm for community assessment. First, Raza communities are conceptualized as belonging to three phases--culturally homogeneous, culturally in transition, and culturally heterogeneous. Each phase is determined by the proximity of the cities'\"barrios\" to the home country (Mexico, Puerto Rico, Central America) and by those pockets that have developed in some of the larger cities where Raza people can come in and be in a totally Latino environment. Further analysis develops Tonnes and Nisbet's concept of \"gemeinschaft\" (cultural homogeneity) and \"gesellschaft\" (acculturation), or the movement from an autonomous community to one that is dependent on outside services, and the implications this has for meaningful intervention. Second, a causal model  of community development that assumes a common disenfranchisement of the Raza is introduced. Using basic path analysis, a cause and effect relationship is conceptualized. This relationship may take either a functional or dysfunctional path based on the \"barrio's\" experiences with the dominant system and the efficacy of developing grass-roots leadership along those lines. Last, the three-cultural phases are combined with the functional developmental community stages, and the possible areas of leadership action are analyzed with a matrix. The paper addresses issues of cultural pluralism, concepts about communities, and such concepts as community \"sociotherapy\", anomie, political alienation, empowerment and Raza impact on social problems.

An effective lasting solution will depend not only on economic incentives but on the development of a health care delivery system that links providers to hospitals, decreases professional isolation, and utilizes physician extender personnel in isolated areas. Before building a health system, the community must consider four basic issues: (1) need--are there enough people to require the services of one or more physicians? (2) feasibility--is the community able to financially support health care personnel and facilities? (3) existing health care sources--where does the population currently obtain health care? and (4) linkages--are major health resources  accessible and available in the larger region for required backup services? The health system should address the population's needs for all three levels of care--primary, secondary, and tertiary. Emergency medical service should be an essential component at all levels. Consideration should also be given to linkages with medical schools and health departments, transportation, and community and financial support. Seven models of the rural primary care center depicting various levels of organizational arrangements are described. (NQ)",

The programs and curriculum emphasized attracting and retaining students. Of the 45 students enrolled during Fiscal Year 1973, 3 were &quot;dropouts&quot;. Emphasizing language skill development, the basic curriculum consisted of English (reading spelling, speaking), arithmetic, Miccosukee language and culture, social studies, and some music, art, and geography. Divided into primary and elementary levels, instruction emphasized individualized learning. Various enrichment activities were available to the children--weekly sewing classes for girls and shop classes for boys; daily physical education; design making, bead-craft, and basketry taught by mothers; cooking; weekly  movies; and monthly field trips. Focusing on the education program, the 3-day on-site evaluation determined how well program components met their objectives, and pointed out program component strengths and weaknesses. The evaluation indicated that the program was progressing steadily toward meeting its objectives. Appendices include: a copy of the school's contract, a Title I evaluation, outlines of teaching schedules, descriptions of the Adult Education programs along with enrollment data, examples of the school lunch menus, a &quot;draft&quot; of the school board manual, and a listing of the 1972-73 objectives for the primary grades.

Specifically, the relationships between educational quality and district wealth, teacher training, rural-urban characteristics of school districts, instruction costs per student, and student-teacher ratios were investigated. A statistical model with educational quality as the dependent variable was formulated and estimated by least squares. Major findings were: a significant positive relationship between educational quality and  amount of teacher training; differences in the educational quality of rural, urban, and remote school district (rural schools had higher levels of educational quality than either urban or remote school districts); positive relationship between educational quality and the amount of money expended per student on classroom instruction; a negative relationship between educational quality and high student-teacher ratios. It was concluded that ACT scores do not measure all aspects of educational quality. (JC)",

        "description":"In order to investigate the interaction of cost, quality, and efficiency in the provision of educational services in rural Nevada, synthetic cost functions were developed using a linear programming transportation model to identify optimal school district organization. Optimal school district organization was defined for specific levels of educational quality (breadth of curriculum), student-teacher ratios, cost of transportation, and maximum bussing distances for students in the region. Alternative district organizations were considered by varying these parameters and observing sensitivity of optimal solutions. It was found that by increasing the student-teacher ratio from 20:1 to 30:1, operating costs would be reduced by 17% and that transportation costs would have to increase  by over 200% before they became a critical factor in the definition of optimal district organization. Changing the assumed bussing mileage limits did have a significant effect on the location and size of schools in the region. Assuming that no student could be bussed more than 50 miles (one way) resulted in three schools in solution. Assuming a 75-100 mile limit resulted in only two schools in solution. The versatility of the linear programming transportation model was demonstrated in terms of its ability to provide cost comparisons for changes in program sizes, student-teacher ratios, permitted school locations patterns, bussing costs, and changes in permitted bussing distances by students.

The variables employed were: subjective housing satisfaction; outsider housing ratings; objective housing characteristics (convenience items, number of rooms, number of persons per room, and residence type); resident characteristics (age, income, education, sex, and race); other subjective evaluation (best possible vs worst possible situation and a series of 3 community satisfaction scales based upon responses to a 21-item questionnaire re  respondent's community). Some findings were: correlations between age and residence satisfaction, between income and education and outward appearance of residence, between race and satisfaction (non-whites were less satisfied with their housing), between housing appearance and race, and between satisfaction with housing and satisfaction with community services and social environment; low correlation between outsider housing scores and other subjective factors; no correlation between housing satisfaction and physical environment and between sex and housing satisfaction.

Methodological approaches used to directly evaluate these five components were student examinations, professional ratings of job performance, field observations, self-analysis and appraisal techniques, quantification and validation of job activities, follow-up studies, measurement of client benefit, and management studies and reports. In general, the Teacher Assistant Programs were the most highly successful. The Medi-Corps Program showed great improvement over the 1975 programs,  i.e., workload relevancy, importance of supervisorial services, and growing excellence of the preservice workshop courses. The Intern and Trainee programs needed professional, full-time supervision, separate sets of performance objectives, and a readjustment of workloads to better reflect the aspirations and abilities of the graduate students. This report also includes the followup study of ethnic background, migrancy, and careers of former students; student academic profile for active students; and a summary of the recommendations. (NQ)",

        "description":"The current status of research on the Hispanic Elderly indicates that very little has been written. Most of the published material is dated, unreliable, inconclusive, and scattered throughout the historical and social literature world. To date, research regarding the Hispanic Community is seriously defective both statistically and in its sociological interpretation. This research is usually directed in such a way as to reveal what the \"present status\" is rather than what the problems' root causes are. Since research on the Hispanic Elderly does not involve a homogeneous community, researchers are seldom prepared for the wide cultural and socioeconomic spectrum exhibited in the Hispanic Community. The utilization of Hispanic researchers would do much to alleviate the problems  posed by multi-ethnic composition, and the lack of comprehension on the part of the Hispanic Elderly. Therefore, efforts must be made to attract qualified Hispanic students into the field of Gerontological Research. Training programs should be initiated for non-Hispanic researchers to orientate them to pertinent ethnic considerations that will prepare them to produce meaningful research. Also the participation of the Hispanic Community in planning and implementation would greatly facilitate research efforts. Research must be coordinated on the national level to preclude duplication and promote cross-fertilization of innovative techniques and knowledge. (NQ)",

The model attempts to tie investigation of child value to existing scientific literature; make explicit the conceptually ideal measure of child economic value; provide for separation of child economic value into components; and indicate how various combinations of data can be used to construct a number of alternative measures of  child economic value. Viewing child economic value as the present discounted value of the stream of income and services each child provides his parents during their lifetime, this model concentrates on measuring/estimating the value of a child's productive activities in his parents' household and the value of his concurrent or subsequent cash in-kind contributions. Suggested measurement methods include 12 measures of child productivity used in conjunction with: parental expectations; actual past and present child contributions; and actual contributions from adult respondents to their parents.

Tables were constructed presenting the results of population estimates for 67 communities for which the Community Development Section compiles community profiles. A range of population was estimated  because the data used to indicate population growth was not defined in a consistant explicit manner for each community. Thus, the estimates could not help but contain population in areas immediately surrounding the community. It was felt, however, that a range of population was a more realistic expression of the state of the art of population estimation. (JC)",

Development (pilot and field-test) procedures are presented for three instruments. \"Our World of Today/Tomorrow\" uses a semantic differential to approximate children's orientation to the present and future world situation. \"The Environment and Pollution\" uses a Likert scale to approximate student's orientation  to general pollution and environmental problems. \"The Environmental Decisions Inventory\" uses a Likert response format to approximate children's orientation to alternative solutions to specific environmental problems. Estimates of validity, stability, and reliability, and factor analyses are presented. (Author/BT)",

Six subproblems were investigated. Eighteen right-handed children, ages six to eight years old, were given electroencephalograms while performing a battery of tasks: Piagetian conservation tasks, Piagetian temporal tasks, spatial tasks, and curriculum related tasks. It was concluded that tasks which had initial visio-spatial components during the stimulus period tended to elicit right hemispheric activity during that period. If that task had verbal or logical components during the subsequent response period, then left hemispheric activity tended to be elicited; high performers tended to show a greater proportion of right hemispheric  activity during the subsequent response period. Consistent patterns of hemispheric functioning were identified in children having the same sex and hand-eye dominance. (RH)",

Three parallel forms of a verbal problem-solving test, corresponding to the interest areas of outdoor, computational, and scientific, were constructed by the investigator. It was intended that only one feature of the problems on each of the three parallel forms was designed to be equivalent (e.g., reading level, verbal clues, mathematical operations involved, computational difficulty). The Kuder General Interest Survey was administered to 305 eighth-grade mathematics students in one school district. Next, students were randomly assigned, by sex, to each of three problem settings (outdoor,  computational, and scientific). The problem-solving test with content reflecting outdoor interest was administered to those students who had been randomly assigned to the outdoor problem-setting group. A similar procedure was followed for the students randomly assigned to the computational or scientific problem-setting groups. Results showed that it was not possible to predict the type (context) of problem on which a student will be most successful based on a knowledge of the student's interests alone, nor on knowledge of the student's interests and arithmetical reasoning ability.

The A-PAKS condensed the usual sixteen weeks of algebra into a six-week period. An experimental group of 25 technical mathematics students completed the A-PAKS. Each member of the &quot;traditional&quot; group was selected from the total population of students taking technical mathematics during the years 1970-1975, and was matched to a student in the experimental group based on percentile scores on the standardized Hundred-Problem Arithmetic Skills Test. At the end of the A-PAK treatment, a standardized algebra test  was administered to the experimental group and a student course-evaluation questionnaire was given. Results showed that the experimental group scored significantly higher (p &lt; .05) on the algebra test than the &quot;traditional&quot; group. Results of the questionnaire showed that students liked the A-PAK procedure. Appendices include the A-PAKS, along with copies of the tests and the questionnaire given to the students. (DT)",

Times for administration of chemical (mean time = 14 min.) and electronic (mean time = 4.4 min.) tasks were recorded. Statistical analyses of  the data revealed that both tasks were sex-free and equally effective in discriminating between concrete and formal operational subjects.

The attitude would then change to be in line with the behavior already recorded. To effect attitude change, the treatment in this study consisted of asking ninth grade life science students to prepare videotapes extolling positive virtues of (1) science as a school subject, and (2) the school lunch program. Initial determination of attitudes of 133 students towards the two areas was made by the administration of a Likert-type attitude measure. Twenty students from each of four  attitude categories (high science-high food, high science-low food, etc.) were randomly assigned to either the science or lunch treatment. After individual administration of the videotaping treatment, an attitude post-test was administered to all students. Analysis of results revealed a significant treatment effect for the science treatment on science attitude and a non-significant effect on the school lunch criterion. Although results are not completely compatible with the cognitive dissonance theory, future research in areas affecting attitude change in science education is suggested. (CS)",

In each treatment group, two algebraic and two geometric topics were covered. Learning data were gathered by posttest. The data were submitted to several analyses of variance in conjunction with pairs of other variables: mathematics aptitude, mathematics achievement, English aptitude, English achievement, sex, correct or incorrect verbalization, difficulty of  generalization. In addition, analyses of variance were performed on data generated by combining groups. In all these analyses, only two significant (p < .05) differences were observed: high English-aptitude subjects performed more poorly in treatment group 3 when the generalization was difficult, and low English-aptitude subjects performed better overall in treatment group 3 than in the other methods combined.

Three groups of 10 children (ranging in age from 4 years, 8 months to 6 years, 3 months) were tested, two in the spring and one in the fall. One of the groups of children tested in the spring was given several accurately placed landmarks prior to their model construction. Constructions were scored on the bases of Euclidean, projective, and topological accuracy. On all three measures, the accuracy of the boys was greater than that of the girls. Increased experience in the classroom significantly increased the children's Euclidean accuracy, but had relatively little effect on the projective  and topological accuracy of their presentations. The provision of landmarks enhanced the children's projective and topological accuracy but had no effect on Euclidean accuracy. These effects were found to be independent of chronological age.

One hundred eighty-three teachers and 64 principals responded. Results showed that the three most frequently cited teaching objectives for mathematics included understanding basic concepts, practicality, and the development of logical reasoning skills. Other objectives included proficiency in problem-solving, computational skills, and an enjoyment and interest in mathematics. Just over half of the teachers did not think the use of a calculator would help them realize their teaching objectives. Advantages and disadvantages of the calculator were  cited. Almost half of the teachers surveyed felt that the calculator could be introduced between grades 4 and 6, while 44% indicated a preference for after grade 6. More than half of the principals thought that students should display at least average proficiency before being able to use a calculator. The majority of principals agreed that the community should be informed if calculators are going to be used in the schools and 40 principals would anticipate a \"mixed\" community reaction. The results of this study suggested that teachers and principals are not unlike in their attitudes toward the use of calculators in the classroom and are consistent in identifying similar advantages and disadvantages of using calculators. A copy of both of the teachers' and the principals' questionnaires is  included in the appendices. (DT)",

One hundred forty-one university mathematics educators also took the MIT. Scores were compared using multivariate analysis of variance procedures. Results showed that the mathematics educators did not conceptualize issues in the same manner as school personnel.

The author selected courses which are innovative; provide significant assistance through organization, bibliography, or project suggestions to women developing their own courses in the area; extend rather than repeat material already available in the first three volumes; and indicate the geographic and institutional diversity of women's studies. Course descriptions on Third World women in non-Western societies are included. Following a brief introduction, the book outlines courses in female studies in the following areas: interdisciplinary courses; humanities and arts; classics; history; literature; philosophy; speech; theology; anthropology;  economics; law; political science; psychology; sociology; child development; education; journalism; and social work. Course descriptions include a brief statement of rationale and major goals and lesson plans stressing course concepts, topics, and assignments. The book concludes with additional lists and short descriptions of women's studies programs. (Author/RM)",

The reports include data from actual use of K-12 materials in teacher training and classroom situations. Three major data bases were searched in the spring of 1976 to identify existing evaluation studies: the ERIC collection, Dissertation Abstracts International, and the curriculum materials background collection of the Social Science Education Consortium's Resource and Demonstration Center. The document, arranged alphabetically according to the title of the materials, provides basic information including the author, developer, editor; the publisher and address; the publication data; the grade level; and the subject area of the materials. Following  this descriptive information the evaluation studies on the materials are listed alphabetically by author. Basic bibliographic information is given for each evaluation study followed by an annotation. Each annotation contains a statement of the purpose of the study, including the variables that were examined; a description of the size and nature of the sample used in the study; and an indication as to whether the study was summative or formative. No evaluation studies were found for about one-third of the materials. These studies are identified with a statement \"No evaluation reports available\" to save the user who might be interested in such studies the effort of a fruitless search. (Author/JR)",

Various student readings needed to implement the lessons are included. The introductory lesson, \"Teaching World History in Cultural Perspective,\" presents the cultural universals. In Chapter 2 students examine the Pinatubo Negritos, the Netsilik Eskimos, and the King Bushmen as examples  of the herding and gathering societies. The third lesson looks at the Bantu-speaking Africans as an example of agri-pastoral people. Chapter 4 focuses on the agricultural societies, presenting material on the ancient middle-American Mayan culture. Students examine the Chinese agricultural society in Chapter 5. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the rise of industrialism in Europe and in Japan. The eighth lesson examines the post-industrial United States. In Chapter 9 students look at the development of totalitarianism with post-industrial Nazi Germany. The tips paper concludes with a bibliography of pertinent curriculum materials in ERIC.

The subjects included 148 students enrolled in an introductory college level child development course. One group of 74 students was randomly assigned to a self-paced section and another group of 74 students was assigned to an instructor-paced group. The general procedure was to divide course materials into 15 units of approximately equal size. At the completion of each unit's assignment, students were required to pass a 10-item, short answer essay quiz and an oral examination. Ninety percent mastery was required. The course syllabi for the two groups were identical except for the section describing grading procedures. In the  self-paced group, students were permitted to complete the course at their own rate within the semester. The final grade was based solely on the number of units mastered. Findings indicated that even though the self-paced group procrastinated while the instructor-paced group worked at an even rate throughout the semester, both groups scored similarly on pre-, post-, and follow-up tests and were equally satisfied with the course. No differences were found in the number of units completed, final grade distribution, or course withdrawal rates. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"The paper investigates the relationships among indoctrination, education, believing, and action in order to inform students and teachers of methods of openly and collectively guarding against indoctrination in the American school system. Four conditions for distinguishing indoctrination from education are: (1) intent of the teacher; (2) truth or falsity of content; (3) method of teaching; and (4) context of teaching, i.e., the existence of reward or punishment in the situation. A conceptual and political strategy illustrates a way of distinguishing between indoctrination and moral education. The first rule admonishes the teacher to do whatever is possible on an individual basis, for example, eliminating the condition of reward or punishment. The second rule suggests action up to  the limit of incurring institutional repression, followed by rule three which recommends sharing matters one can't handle oneself with those existentially concerned, including students. Rule four states that both student and instructor views comply with a truth value which can be established as true because all its component parts are true. In conclusion, when the rules of procedure are followed, education instead of indoctrination will occur because students and teachers establish conditions that promote rationality (mutuality) in an effort to discover what they want to believe and how they want to act in accordance with those beliefs.

The purpose of the meeting was to promote exchange of ideas and experiences among higher education experts from Latin America and the United States. A major portion of the Mexico conference was devoted to an assessment of Latin American area studies programs from the perspective of educators from the United States and eight Latin American nations. Presented as an essay interpreting the principal issues in the position papers, the document discusses three major topics. The first section compares Latin American studies in American universities with similar courses in Latin American institutions. It concludes that recent improvement in centers in Latin  America has decreased U.S. domination of the field and encouraged dialogue on common intellectual concerns. Section II focuses on dwindling financial support for U.S. Latin American studies centers which, when combined with relatively low-level funding of research and training in Latin American institutions, may sap the vitality of the professional field. In section III, the role challenge facing U.S. Latin American scholars is discussed and suggestions are made for re-evaluating objectives and establishing cooperative projects between U.S. scholars and their Latin American counterparts. A directory of conference participants and observers is included in the document. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Two booklets provide an overview of the history and folklore of Cape Verde, a group of islands lying 370 miles off the west coast of Africa. One booklet describes the history of the islands which were probably settled initially by Africans from the west coast of Africa. By the 15th century the islands were colonized by Portuguese and other Europeans. The language, Crioulo, is a mixture of Portuguese vocabulary and African grammar. Geographical position was the main reason for settlement of Cape Verde: located near the African coast, with good winds and currents, the islands were an ideal stopping place for ships sailing between North America and Africa and Europe and South America. Salt and hand-woven cloth were exported from the islands, and in the 15th and 16th centuries slave  trade provided another basis for commercial activity. Cape Verdeans came to America in the 17th century as slaves, and in later years others immigrated to New England to work in cranberry bogs. Cape Verde became independent of Portuguese rule in 1975. One of its most serious problems is recurring drought and famine. The booklet of folk tales contains five stories with the same characters: a foolish man, a clever boy, and an equally clever wolf. The folk tales seem appropriate for intermediate or junior high reading level. (AV)",

Helpful to teachers in presenting complex ideas from the social sciences in a direct and simple manner, the model consists of four major steps. Step I discusses the selection of major ideas and ways of placing them into a discipline framework. Curriculum content selection begins with outcome specification and is followed by the selection of content to achieve that outcome. Step II is an expository presentation of ideas in narrative form to clarify understanding of material. Benefits of this type of presentation are elaboration of the material to be developed, without the need for simplification; opportunity to check coherence and unity of  conceptualization; and fuller explanation of the material to the teacher. Step III focuses on the selection of major ideas most critical for children's learning and recommends a review panel to facilitate judgment. Step IV explains how to rewrite curriculum material in a simpler format. Useful pointers for writing smoothly are given on the topics of deletion, syntax, vocabulary simplification, economy of expression, statements of generality and specificity, and content validation.

The bulk of the report presents the thesis in four sections. Section I proposes a typology of organized social research units (OSRUs) in the 11 universities studied. Dimensions used to classify the OSRUs are location, type of program, program orientation, and organizational unit. The second section summarizes the thesis: that OSRUs represent the embodiment of research function in the quality university, a reduction in time devoted by social science faculty to teaching, and an increase in the research effort of academic social scientists. The third section summarizes constraints inherent in the university context which face any  effort to develop OSRUs, such as administrative policies, organization of OSRUs, choice of director, and recruitment of staff. The final section summarizes requirements for the creation and operation of successful OSRUs.

        "description":"The review documents civil rights developments during 1976, concentrating on positive developments such as school desegregation, increased political participation by minorities and women, and on negative developments such as economic recession and inadequate civil rights enforcement. Section I provides information on the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in Washington v. Davis and several other related cases in which the court restated that the plaintiff in civil rights cases must prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory intent. Section II describes the gap in occupational and income status between white males, minorities, and women which was aggravated by the 1974-5 recession and continued into 1976. In section III, desegregation of educational facilities and the enactment  of bilingual, bicultural programs are discussed, followed by a report of increased political participation by minorities and women in section IV and a review of housing conditions and problems in section V. Section VI reviews a number of other civil rights issues, including abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, harassment of legal aliens, abuse of Native Americans, and discrimination within the military. The conclusion is that the Federal Government must counteract the erosion of previous commitments to basic rights by reestablishing America's moral commitment to civil rights through specific equal opportunity programs.

Positive and negative aspects of the cognitive-decision, developmental, prosocial, and values approaches are discussed and ways of relating the four approaches to each other are suggested. The first approach, cognitive-decision, is distinctive for its examination of the concept of practical reason. It includes claims about morality and offers a specific moral/civil theory based upon liberty, dignity, equality, and fairness. It maintains that the objective of moral/citizenship education is to instruct students in the nature of making moral and civic decisions. The second approach, developmental, favors a moral theory which maintains that there exists a set of sequential and irreversible moral  stages through which human beings go and that students must be guided to higher stages until they reach rational autonomy. The third approach, the prosocial, stresses research on specific kinds of altruistic behavior and alteration of student behavior in a prosocial direction. The fourth approach, values, focuses upon helping students become aware of and act upon their values, although there is significant disagreement among proponents of this approach whether or not any set of values might be good or bad in a moral sense.

Intended as an explanation to sociology teachers and researchers of how students' learning experiences are shaped by their orientations to computer environments, departmental organization, and university organization, the paper is presented in three sections. Section I discusses the relationship between using the computer for educational purposes and sociological theory. Simulation examples and observations on educational environments are given. Section II presents reasons why computer usage is a particularly suitable topic for educational research. Reasons include the compatability of  computer technology with both teaching and research and evidence that students improve decision-making skills when trained in computer simulations. There are also indications that participation in computer simulations contributes to development of basic sociological knowledge which, in turn, facilitates learning of sociological theory. Section III discusses computer usage by the reformist element in sociology within the framework of statements by sociologist Wilbert Moore. Tables, a questionnaire of student attitudes toward research methodology, and references dealing with sociology education, simulations, student evaluations, and computerized education are included.

Focusing on the difficulties experienced by Slavs in melting into accepted American patterns, the paper records the rise in Slavic ethnic consciousness. Topics discussed are Slavic language, geographic concentration of Slavs in Eastern Europe, cultural identity, physical characteristics, and religious differences. The section on early immigration discusses the reasons which attracted Slavs to America from earliest colonial days. These reasons include religious convictions, military obligations, adventure, and political idealism. Case studies of individual Slavic immigrants are presented. The greatest wave of Slavic immigration occurring from  1880-1920 is described, followed by discussion of the constant but less intense immigration after 1920. Reasons for later immigration include the Bolshevik Revolution, displacement due to political events in Europe, and religious persecution. The major contributions of Slavs to American science, music, industry, politics, and education are noted. (Author/DB)",

The importance of background knowledge and abilities that students bring to games is discussed in section III, followed by identification of the problems and positive aspects of role playing in sections IV and V. Problem areas include lack of role involvement, boredom, and the similarity of all simulation games. Positive aspects  include the changed role of the teacher, the socialization process that occurs during the game, and the ability of games to teach complex problems in the classroom. Section IV discusses computerized games, the contribution of computers to gaming, and the increased sense of efficacy experienced by students using computerized games.

        "description":"The scientific community needs to reappraise its actions and become concerned with the real world problems that threaten existence in society. These include world poverty, starvation, and declining quality of life. Geographers need to develop greater concern resulting in evaluating their research, curricula, educational goals and course content in light of the problems of human survival. Three tasks to be undertaken in equipping students for such problem solving are identified. First, geographers must learn more about research in other social and physical sciences in order to work towards solving societal problems in an efficient, interdisciplinary manner. Second, geographers must develop curricula which emphasize training for present and future problem solving. Third,  geographers should reorient geography courses to focus on the complexity of contemporary problems. An introductory, college-level, human geography course outline is presented in five parts: (1) focuses on mankind at the turning point in his struggle for existence and explores the urgency of finding solutions before it is too late; (2) discusses geographic perspective, reasoning, tools for analysis, and relevance; (3) identifies and discusses local, national, and international spatial systems; (4) describes the processes which underlie human survival and spatial systems; and (5) summarizes the geographer's contribution to future survival.

        "description":"A method for incorporating an examination of sex roles and position of women into an undergraduate course on geography of Africa is discussed. It is a regional geography course with a cultural emphasis. Five percent of the total instruction is devoted to the examination of women. This is justified because geographical concepts such as spatial interaction, environmental perception, and static distributions involve women's issues. Moreover, the role of women differs from one society to another, and the origins and distributions of role concepts are geographical. A brief section explains how house types and settlement morphology reveal cultural aspects about the position of women. The majority of the document compares status and roles of women in African, Arab, and American  societies. Preschool sex roles of the three groups are similar, but learning of roles becomes more formalized when schooling begins. By puberty, great contrasts are found. Americans hold the sexual double standard; Arabs enforce female seclusion in order to prevent premarital sex and thereby ensure receipt of a woman's \"bride price;\" African tribes are less anxious about human sexuality and only few insist on virginity of unmarried women. Marriage patterns of polygyny or monogamy and effects of nuclear or extended families are also discussed. A short bibliography contains 17 references on women in Africa and the Arab world. (AV)",

        "description":"The status of citizenship education in American public elementary and secondary schools is discussed and suggestions are made for curriculum development. Although administrators rank citizenship education as a high priority, research shows it is given minimal attention in elementary grades and inadequate coverage in high school. Students must be prepared for reflective and effective political participation in society. One way of achieving citizenship participation, individual development, and an informed citizenry is to make citizenship content relevant to current issues in student life. Teachers and society in general are accused of overprotecting students from controversial issues, thereby inhibiting their self-actualization. In our highly mobile, spatially divided society,  self-actualized students who are given an adequate orientation about citizens' rights and responsibilities could discharge their civic duties in a responsible manner. Results of three studies are summarized to point out the low awareness level of teenagers and young adults about government structure and individual rights. Suggestions for curriculum development stress an action-centered approach in programs which use learning environments outside the classroom, provide students with experiences in dealing with conflict, and have affective as well as cognitive objectives.

Writing, observing, describing, and identifying sociological patterns within cultures are among the skills. Suggested  activities include simulated archaeological excavations, comparison of the tools of arctic and rain forest cultures, and learning songs or crafts of a nonwestern culture.

By using the programmed learning material the students become acquainted with the evolution of money through questioning techniques. Students explore the concepts of barter, token money, coins, paper money, and checks. The paper contains a program description, student instructions for answering the questions and checking for correct responses, the Money-Go-Round Self Teaching Program, a test, and an answer key. The study of money is logically and progressively sequenced and is completely self-contained. Learning is broken down into small, graduated steps that facilitate successful responses, and reinforcement is provided throughout by frames that review previously  taught concepts. Supplemental relevant information, such as the life span of a piece of paper money and the weight problems engendered by large numbers of coins, is often included in the answers to frames.

It is designed as a planning and implementation guide for social studies in Wisconsin. First, ways are suggested in which educators can define the purpose of their social studies programs and decide how to balance skills and subject matter components. A matrix is provided on which skills and grade level presentation can be outlined. Then a historical section traces social studies curriculum development from the 17th century through &quot;the new social studies&quot; to current concerns such as relevance to student needs. Next the nature of an ideal social studies program is discussed. The program is classified into three knowledge perspectives: disciplines, processes, and  values; comparative; and topical. The comparative perspective considers the knowledge of time, space, and culture. The topical perspective considers knowledge of self-awareness and social awareness. Five models for scope and sequence format for elementary and secondary levels are presented. These involve expansion of students' knowledge from family and local levels to national and global awareness. Specific recommendations for Wisconsin social studies are listed in terms of curriculum and instructional development, instructional organization and resources, and evaluation. Final sections explain how to implement and evaluate new programs at the local level. Appendices contain Wisconsin's general educational goals and its elementary sequence model. (AV)",

Investigated is the thesis that psychological traits are useful concepts for political scientists as predictors of consistency in behavior. Contending that previous trait theory research has been generally unimpressive, the author hypothesizes that traits may be specific to individuals as well as situations. This reform of trait theory is applied to six politically relevant traits: tendermindedness, radicalism-conservatism, F-scale, social desirability, locus of control, and machiavellianism. The criterion variables include 18 measures of electoral and non-electoral participation, ideology and partisanship, including: votes in campus, local, state and national elections,  anti-war activity, party identification, political discussions, and attempts to persuade others. Findings indicate that segregating the sample into trait-relevant and trait non-relevant groups is meaningful since predictive power is distinctly enhanced in the trait-relevant groups. In addition, the analysis shows that the 18 criterion items cluster according to trait-predictability in highly interpretable ways. References relating to personality types, psychological studies, and political participation are included. (Author/DB)",

By making geological relief maps, independently researching individual countries, or analyzing folk tales, students develop map and research skills while learning about the forces that have shaped the continent's history. Student reading material and teachers' lectures  cover topics such as apartheid and tribalism. The unit on Russia emphasizes its cultures, geography, historical development, and role in the 20th century. Teachers are encouraged to select from 70 learning activities including field trips, role-playing historical characters, and comparing pollution problems of Lake Baikal and Lake Erie.

Activities include crossword and acrostic puzzles with names of famous explorers, map study of significant world regions, and short-answer tests on reading  content. In \"Discrimination,\" students are assigned particular identities on the basis of traits such as sex, appearance, nationality, and income. Each day, points are taken from or given to students exhibiting certain traits. In order to earn back their lost points, students must complete assignments which require reading articles on various types of discrimination.

        "description":"Components of national undergraduate geography major curricula are reviewed, followed by discussion of a behavioral approach to curriculum theory and a case study which incorporates behavioral objectives in curriculum development. Surveys in 1968 and 1974 revealed that most undergraduate major geography programs are loosely structured and contain typical courses in introductory physical geography, introductory human geography, a regional course, a techniques course, and a senior seminar. Arguments are presented for and against using specific behavioral objectives to develop student-oriented programs. Proponents argue that learning can be more effectively promoted and individualized if objectives are precisely stated. Critics worry that specification may lead to a focus on trivia  and that affective aims are likely to be neglected. A four-stage developmental process is being implemented by the author at the University of Illinois. This involves identification of fundamental concepts and skills comprising the core curriculum, assessment of performance of geography majors in the fundamental areas, assessment of majors' perceptions of their abilities and desired levels of attainment, and development of an inventory of learning experiences provided in various courses. Two appendices list fundamental concepts and show how they are incorporated into specific courses. (Author/AV)",

The essay is presented in two parts. Part I proposes that American national educational policy has favored spiritual neutrality to a degree which has hindered Americans in their search for meaning in life. Recommended to solve this dilemma is transformation of state and federally controlled and supported public schools into self-governing, independent institutions which offer a choice between spiritually grounded and anti-spiritual forms of education. Section II presents consideration of some problems which might arise if  Americans were given freedom of choice in matters of education. Problems include: use of independent schools by teachers for bigoted, elitist, or otherwise separatist purposes; segregation of students; power centralization in the hands of teachers; variable standards; and financial problems. Ways of solving all these problems under a system of independent schools are described. (Author/DB)",

The school/community programs focus primarily on the local level and do not include federal and state mandated programs involving business and industry. Descriptions of the programs are categorized into nine major areas: American heritage, law and  local government, value clarification and decision making, school/community service, preservation of the environment, relating school and community, enriching school programs, advising/planning/evaluating, and serving an area. Sample activities include writing and performing a play about the local community, recording history on slide tapes, and developing parent advisory councils. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that conflict, change, and deviance in school board behavior can be effectively studied and examined within generalized models of culture. In the first section, problems in studying educational cultures are identified and the biased views of educational anthropologists are discussed. Section II presents information on role and myth in the politics of education and discusses differences in interpretation of an institution which arise with different observers. Section III focuses on relationships between culture, conflict, and school boards. Three basic premises underlie successful use of a general conflict model to explain school boards and their operation: (1) that there exists a worldwide culture of education; (2) that the United  States has a national culture of education; and (3) that the school board can be considered a unique culture. Categories for understanding culture and conflict within an educational institution are identified in section IV, including individual motives of school board members, changing expectations of society, and balance between the processes of cultural stability and change. Section V presents a brief summary of the paper. References are included in the document. (Author/DB)",

Three major reasons for interdisciplinary activitiy are (1) educational psychologists have research skills and psychological knowledge to offer colleagues in other fields, (2) they can gain new insights from professionals in other fields, and (3) they can provide services and expertise to colleges of education which are being asked to justify their reasons for existence in the face of an overabundance of teachers. The author describes three situations in which she has become involved personally in interdisciplinary activities. She has helped college  mathematics professors to identify and correct negative attitudes and low competence in basic math exhibited by elementary education majors; she is working with an English professor and a developmental reading specialist to evaluate the K-12 language arts program in a local school district; and she has studied immigrant history in terms of public schools' effects on immigrant children's self concept. Additional interdisciplinary ventures are suggested in the areas of biology, medicine, law, economics, and remedial or developmental programs. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"The report describes two experiments involving the ability of preservice social studies teachers to stage score moral thought statements. Stage scoring is defined as keeping a record of statements in accordance with the stages of moral development originated by psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg. The two experiments involved the use of three stage scoring rater guides. They were designed to help teachers overcome content influence in order to stage score correctly on the basis of the structure of moral thought. The procedure for the first experiment was to randomly assign 32 preservice social studies teachers enrolled in a required methods course to two treatment groups. One group was given Kohlberg's sentence rater guide and the other was given his global rater guide. In the second  experiment, 40 preservice teachers in the same course the following semester were assigned to similar treatment groups, one of which used an additional, updated, global rater manual. For both experiments, the preservice teachers were given information on Kohlberg's moral education program and instruction on how to use the rating guides. Findings indicate that none of the stage scoring rater guides aided teachers to overcome content influence and that, therefore, teachers should refrain from stage scoring until further research indicates which factors cause successful use of the stage scoring system. References related to teacher training, moral development, and assessing the moral reasoning of students are included. (Author/DB)",

In \"Manpower and Human Resource Needs,\" Willard Wirtz identifies unemployment, changing role of women in the work force, and need for continuing education as problems to be solved. \"Dangerously Provincial\" by Frederick Champion Ward stresses the need for international perspectives on energy use, food production, resource development, and population control. Allan  K. Campbell reviews the history, current trends, and future needs of educational finance in \"The Politics and Economics of the Future Financing of Public Education.\"\"The Shape of Democracy--The Citizen Role\" by Forbes Bottomly stresses that human values and political choices influence the future, not continued application of technology. In \"The Public and Private Life of the Individual,\" Harold G. Shane sees population expansion, technology, coming food crises, and group values as influencing personal security. \"Energy in Nature and Society\" by Charles Ryan explains how traditional curriculum has fostered values that now conflict with our finite energy and resources.

The first section discusses changes in course content from the late 19th century, when psychology was part of the elementary teacher education program, to the present, when psychology is most often offered as a personal adjustment course. Section two focuses on textbooks which have been used to teach psychology related subjects since 1831. Recent surveys indicate that teachers favor basic textbooks, but that various materials are also used in some courses in lieu of a textbook. The third section indicates that psychology teachers receive more university training and participate more in psychology workshops and summer institutes than previously. Also, they generally teach social science  courses in addition to psychology. The ever increasing number of students enrolled in high school psychology courses is discussed in section four, followed by a brief summary which reports that the teaching of psychology on the high school level is becoming more common, teacher preparation is improving, student enrollment is increasing, a variety of teaching material is becoming available, and psychologists are becoming interested in this area of instruction.

The first section discusses the philosophy of social reconstruction maintaining that teachers and students should be in the forefront of social change. Rugg's major contribution to social reconstruction was a serious and sustained attempt to design a total curriculum. Section II presents Rugg's rationale for his approach, derived from the educational, social, political, economic, and aesthetic experiences he had at Teachers College, Columbia. Two of Rugg's textbooks are analyzed in section III. &quot;Changing Civilizations in the Modern World&quot; employs narrative style and extended quotations to stress communality and interdependence among industrialized  nations. &quot;The Conquest of America; A History of American Civilization: Economic and Social&quot; stresses geographical factors in history and the class base of American society. Rugg's advocacy of a planned, cooperative economy and society, as exemplified in the two texts, caused his work to be labeled un-American. Section IV presents a history of the controversy over the use of Rugg's textbooks in the public schools. References are included in the document. (Author/DB)",

Over 3,300 responses were examined to determine the perceived geographic range of given countries, the regional degree of accuracy among students, and the overall significance of response errors. As a group the students were able to locate less than half of the countries. Data for 35 countries are presented in this paper. Most accurately identified were the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, U.S.S.R., and Australia. Countries about which students know the least are Ceylon, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Burma, Nepal, Iran, Nigeria, and Zaire. Over half of the 35 countries were misplaced in 50 or more other nations. Latin American  countries were generally misplaced in other LaLin American countries. A similar pattern was exhibited for Asian countries. The regional adjacency pattern for Middle Eastern and North African nations was more complex, with Egypt being placed in other Middle Eastern countries and Turkey sometimes being placed in Europe. African countries, when located, were mainly placed in Africa, although there was a 12% tendency to place Ethiopia in the Middle East. Conclusions are that students can associate given countries with proper regions even if they do not know exact location, and that there is an adjacency pattern for several European countries including France, Spain, West Germany, and Poland.

Using films, classmates, visitors, and museum artifact analysis, the third article presents ideas on four  simulations which can increase undergraduate involvement in anthropology courses. The fourth article examines curriculum models for teaching anthropology. The Fifth article describes an elective physical anthropology course for the eighth grade. The sixth article shows how an anthropology learning center is used for grades three through six. The seventh article presents techniques to aid anthropologists who are asked to speak to elementary school classes. The eighth article discusses pre-collegiate anthropology materials.

        "description":"Similarities and differences between alternative and traditional school programs are assessed through a survey of 11th grade social studies teachers in Long Island, New York. The sample consisted of 11 alternative schools and 24 traditional public high schools containing a representative sampling of upper, middle, and lower-class students. A survey instrument consisting of open-ended and closed questions was sent to all teachers. The questions focused on who determines what curriculum topics will be covered and what classroom materials will be used; coverage of curriculum topics; emphasis placed on particular topics; and usage of curriculum materials. Teachers were asked to rank how much they agreed with the facts and views presented in these materials. To determine political and  social attitudes, teachers read passages and rated themselves as to how much they felt that they agreed with the passage. Teachers' responses to all survey questions are tabulated in this document. In addition, the results are discussed. Among the findings are that in alternative schools teachers and students have control of classroom curricula and a large portion of class time is devoted to topics that are different from the standard 11th grade social studies program. Thirty-two percent of the traditional teachers determine the curricula and 68% of the topics taught are those mandated by the state of New York. (Author/RM)",

        "description":"This unit is designed to help secondary social studies students learn about national political party conventions. It is arranged into 15 class sessions and contains two case studies. Each class session explores a political subject related to national conventions, such as the American party system, the primary process, elections, selection of delegates, compromises, candidate selection, delegate responsibility, and coalitions. Topics of the class sessions are identification of leadership potential, presidential ambition, the decision to become a candidate, political plotting, primaries, delegate and candidate characteristics, purposes and events of a national party convention, the decision-making process, convention activities, and colorful past conventions. The 15th class session  directs the students to consolidate information from preceding sessions and write a 200 word statement discussing the pros or cons of the convention system. Each class session presents background information and suggests student activities such as art work, class discussions, oral reports, research reports, question answering, and readings. The case studies of the 1976 Democratic and Republican conventions emphasize the historical importance of each gathering and highlight unconventional aspects and personal maneuvering. A listing of presidential candidates from 1856-1968 and a glossary of terms are included in the document. (Author/DB)",

        "description":"Since history textbooks omit and/or emphasize certain data, students are left with a false sense of history. Although the \"hard data\" presented in history texts is generally regarded as reliable, the selection and organization of that data is inherently manipulative because other data has been excluded. Because authors do not begin with a description of the frame of reference which underlies their work, most historical writings have a hidden subjectivity. Three discovery exercises are presented to help secondary or undergraduate students overcome manipulation by texts and promote independent thought. In the first exercise, students identify data about the period 1972-76 which historians might include in one chapter of a text in the year 2050. Once a list of social, economic, and  political data has been compiled, students decide which to emphasize and which to eliminate. Lack of concensus will demonstrate how objectivity becomes impossible. Classes can analyze their own texts from this perspective. Exercise two emphasizes how different forms of textbook organization lead the reader towards certain understandings and deemphasize others. In the third exercise, students try to select objective, analytical questions about given periods of history. An assignment to write ten objective sentences and ten analytical statements can point out that the distinction between \"objective\" and \"analytical\" is often not clear. (AV)",

        "description":"Ways in which pluralistic communities can exist in peace and harmony through consent rather than force are discussed. Historical and sociological determinants, which should be considered when coexistence is sought, are politics, color, religion, nationalism, national aspirations, language, employment, and educational systems. Problems which arise in connection with these determinants are analyzed. For example, freedom of religion is universally desired but has often lead to dogmatism and war, as it did in Ireland, Lebanon, India, and Crete. Although language serves as the most intimate articulation of the individual and his group, it can also serve as a barrier to those who do not speak or understand the official language. Skin color has influenced governments to adopt policies  of apartheid or integration, but each policy has encountered problems. Case studies of Rhodesia and South Africa are presented. The problems of dealing with the determinants in a way that fosters human rights, educational excellence, intergroup cooperation, and responsible government are discussed. Honesty, consideration of differences, and meaningful association of diverse groups within a culture are necessary in a culturally pluralistic society and can be achieved when political autonomy, moral authority, and religious faith supercede selfish dictatorship.

Section I describes the regional advantages which have made Kilimanjaro the most educated area of the country. Section II discusses the church role in education prior to and following independence in 1961. The relationship between geographic and ethnic differentiation within Kilimanjaro is described generally in section III, followed by a more detailed description of ethnic and class groups in sections IV and V. Links between the ruling class and state institutions, which have produced a bureaucratic bourgeoisie, are discussed in section VI. Section VII analyzes Kilimanjaro's economic dependence upon coffee production  and concludes that social mobility and the relative economic development of the area obscure class differences and minimize social and educational demands of the lower classes. Section VIII identifies class formation, ruling class perpetuation, and underdevelopment as mechanisms through which differential access to education has been manipulated in Tanzania and concludes that educational policies adopted by Tanzania and other African nations will determine which segments of society will govern by determining who will attend school.

The first section provides background information on Sweden's social democratic system which exhibits a strong tendency towards pragmatism, practicality, rationality, efficiency, competence, and educational planning. Section two focuses on changes in 1950 in the primary education system from the traditional two-tiered system to a nine-year comprehensive egalitarian system. Section III describes attempts of the secondary education system to play a modernizing role in society while initiating a smooth process of maximum student adaptation to an inherently unequal social system. Various realms and problems of post-secondary education, including educational  structure, governmental role, industrial influence, American influence, decentralization, and faculty power are examined in sections IV and V. Curriculum and students are discussed in section VI, followed by a discussion of continuing education in section VII. In conclusion, Sweden's educational system is making strides towards increasing social justice and personal fulfillment through provision of appropriate educational opportunities for all students.

The first section reviews various conceptual approaches and provides frameworks for the study of inquiry teaching. The second section presents two case studies which illustrate inquiry teaching approaches to a geographic study of world population distribution. The two cases represent widely divergent classroom styles, with one teacher taking a highly cognitive stance with his students and another teacher indicating more concern with development of student interests in geography. Presented for each of the class types are six beginning inquiry activities, eight inquiry process techniques, and three inquiry debriefing techniques. Sample techniques include focus setting,  clarifying, suggesting and designing an operation, identifying inquiry processes, probing for intent or function, and probing for student's theory. The third section identifies some limitations of inquiry teaching such as lack of suitable evaluation instruments, insufficient teacher preparation in effective uses of inquiry training, limited curriculum materials, and poor dissemination of existing materials.

As a sample of state summary reports, a profile of Maryland census data is provided.

In the introduction, the developers comment that the objectives are to be considered as minimal, and that most students will move beyond them. The objectives stress social studies skills and concepts; they are relatively content free. This allows schools to have varied curriculum according to local needs and preferences. In the booklet the objectives are presented in three groups: early elementary (grades one to three), later elementary (grades four to six), and secondary (grades seven to nine). They are terminal objectives, which means that students should have acquired the skills by the end of each level. On each page objectives are listed in one column with  accompanying comments and sample test items in an adjacent column. The test items are included for clarification only. They are not necessarily valid and reliable evaluation items. Both levels of elementary objectives fall into 18 broad categories, including concept formulation; participation in group discussion and activities; problem solving; comparative cultures; and environmental awareness. The 49 secondary objectives are categorized by skills: social-affective, thinking, social science, occupational, and those relating to specific social science concepts. (AV)",

Surveys of recent literature on teaching reading skills and results of the author's interviews with 91 selected social studies teachers indicate that secondary school social studies teachers have definite responsibilities toward teaching reading. A summary of the teachers' suggestions for effective methods of teaching social studies reading skills is presented. These stress the teacher's role in helping students grasp main ideas and relevant details, master special social studies vocabulary and concepts, use textbooks and references effectively, set purposes for reading, and learn to read  critically. Teachers also should provide materials appropriate for the course and for the students' reading level. Because this study was conducted with selected teachers in a limited geographic area, the author recommends that further study be done by other researchers on the same topic with other teachers and in different geographic areas.

More than 15 yearbooks and methods texts published in the 1960s and 1970s are described. \"Skill Development in Social Studies,\" published in 1963 by the National Council for the Social Studies, is reported to be useful. Most methods texts have at least one chapter dealing with skill development. Many stress problem solving and analysis of controversial matters. In an effort to identify existing skill development programs, the author surveyed members of the Social Studies Supervisors Association. Analysis of 61 responses is presented. Medium-size school districts seem to be most active in  developing skills programs. Data gathering and thinking skills are reported most frequently, and social action skills are reported least frequently. Effective teaching procedures include learning centers, contracts, simulations, and discussion of public and private issues. Ten districts are identified as moving ahead in skill development. The author recommends that schools identify important skills, analyze existing curriculum in terms of those skills, and offer repetitive experiences to reinforce skill development. He also sees a need for a guide to social studies skills which will be useful after students graduate. (AV)",

Results indicate that many are interested in international/global education, but few presently use an international curriculum in any specific subject. In a section directed toward students interested in study abroad, there are eight questions to consider and a list of 25 international programs. The descriptions include grade level, length of program, type of schedule, and participating countries. A section  for teachers discusses the philosophy and methodology of global studies. Model frameworks for developing curriculum units are presented. Frameworks are provided for five topics on the historical dimension of global studies, planetary environment, futuristics, conflict resolution, and global population and resources.

        "description":"The document presents the full texts of conference papers that examine questions and tentative answers about learning. The 12 formal papers center around three questions: (1) what has recent research, experimentation, and experience taught us about learning? (2) what barriers to the use of this knowledge exist in our society, our educational system, and organizations? and (3) given that application of new knowledge and ideas are often thwarted by real and perceived constraints, what can state school officers do? The papers were delivered by educational consultants, thinkers, researchers, and practitioners. Speakers addressed the topics of theories and processes of learning, learning continuity over a long time interval, learning environments, the relationship between work  experience and learning, skills that should be learned for the future, educational quality, declining scores, humanistic learning, and programs for culturally different and special education. Programs for linguistically and culturally different students and problems of handicapped and disturbed students are described. The final report summarizes the conference as concentrating on 12 interconnecting rings of learning which can be expressed on six levels: settling what we know about learning, setting goals and desirable conditions, encouraging learning for youth, improving learning through humanism and school personnel, recognizing special student needs, and realizing the limitations of our present knowledge about learning.

        "description":"This study investigated (1) whether girls express greater or lesser interest in certain social studies methodology and content than do boys, and (2) whether, in these areas, differences exist between junior and senior high school students. Conducted in Georgia in 1976, the study involved 391 students representing rural and suburban areas. On an 18-item rating scale, the students indicated their level of agreement with statements explaining why a person might enjoy social studies classes. Ten statements dealt with methodology and eight dealt with curriculum content. These included use of films or oral reports and emphasis on current events or money management. Two tables of data document the results. Girls on both levels expressed interest in the culturally-oriented areas of  sociology and cultural geography. This may indicate that the culturally-oriented areas of social studies have less male bias than those dealing with military and political history or physical geography. Boys, especially on the junior high level, expressed greater liking for military and political history than did girls, although the difference diminishes as students mature. In general, junior high students seemed more favorable than senior high students toward social studies. This may be caused by the maturation process, the nature of the school's program, or a combination of reasons. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"This handbook for educators and parents discusses the need to include philosophy in the elementary classroom. The authors point out that as a question-raising discipline, philosophy is appropriate to guide children's natural inquisitiveness through the educational process. It encourages intellectual resourcefulness and flexibility which can enable children and teachers alike to cope with the disconnectedness and fragmentization of existing curricula. It can help develop sound reasoning and ethics. The first six chapters discuss reasons for including philosophy in the curriculum, aims and objectives of the philosophy for children program, and methods of teaching and guiding philosophical discussions. The point is made that children frequently are not satisfied with simplified  answers to their questions, and that their minds should be trained at an early, receptive age to consider metaphysical, moral, and logical issues. Chapter seven presents an argument for the use of formal and nonformal logic in teaching children to think constructively and learning to make inferences and deductions on their own. In chapter eight, the authors explore the following question: can moral education be divorced from philosophical education? The interrelationship of logic and morality indicates that the answer is no. See SO 009 951 for a philosophical reader for junior high students. (Author/AV)",

        "description":"A philosophy reader for seventh and eighth graders, \"Lisa\" presents a story about daily experiences of a group of schoolchildren. The story is a sequel to ED 103 298. \"Lisa\" focuses on ethical and social issues such as lying and truth-telling, fairness, naturalness, and what are rules and standards. Other issues such as job and sex discrimination, punishment, the nature of death, and the rights of children are also explored. Constructed as a series of dialogues between children, the story has a child-centered perspective which provides readers with a means for attending to their own thoughts and to ways that their thoughts can function in their lives. This is approached through a discovery of rule-governed thinking and by illustrations of a variety of non-formal types of thought.  Search techniques are provided to allow readers to identify rules of their own. In the story and in the classroom, it is the children and the students who discover and test the structural rules of formal logic. \"Lisa\" is not only about reasoning and morality; it is also concerned with the interrelationship of logic and morality. For example, Lisa ponders inconsistencies in her own behavior of loving animals and yet liking to eat roast beef. The philosophy program helps students establish good reasons in justifying their beliefs and in justifying certain departures from normal patterns of conduct. (Author/AV)",

The objective was to develop constructive recommendations in areas where the programs need strengthening. All elementary and secondary school districts were surveyed. Forty percent of the elementary schools offered students units of economics. Only 41 percent of the schools provided some inservice training in economics for elementary teachers. Forty-seven percent of the elementary teachers had no college training in economics, and 56% had less than three semester units of college economics. Less than one-third of the high schools reported they offered a grade 12 economics course. Over 91% of the high school  seniors in the state do not take a senior level economics course. Separate economics courses below grade 12 level were offered by only 16 percent of the schools. High school economics teachers have had little or no training in economics. Conclusions indicated that California schools need to expand economics courses and offer many institutes in economics for teachers. An outline of the kind of teacher training recommended is provided.

Questionnaires were mailed to the principals of all the junior and senior high schools in California. Approximately 1300 questionnaires were mailed and 480 returned. Since a similar study was conducted in 1966, some comparative data are available. About 38% of the schools indicated that they offered a separate one-semester course in economics for grade 12. This is a small improvement over the 31% in the 1966 survey. Consumer economics has increased in relative importance as 139 schools reported courses in this area, 68 in general economics, and 48 equally divided between consumer and general economics in the  current survey. Thirty-eight secondary schools offer a one-quarter semester course in economics and enroll 42,333 students. In 1966, 32 schools reported offering this course but enrolled 32,567 students. The economics training of personnel teaching separate economics courses has shown some improvement since 1966, although 134 teachers of such courses have no college economics and an additional 85 have less than three units of credit. The separate economics classes in 1974 and 1966 were taught predominantly by social science teachers. (Author/RM)",

Teaching strategies include discussion based on starter activities, simulation, role playing, and use of community resources. Each activity specifies objectives, teaching time, materials, procedures, evaluation, and further suggestions. Most of the materials are handouts, which are appended. For example, an activity stressing  awareness, values, and critical thinking makes use of a personal food survey to help students determine personal and community eating patterns. Another activity emphasizes values, nutrition, and food distribution through student documentation of food waste within their homes. Global issues of poverty, malnutrition, and disease are also studied.

The major focus is on the individual measures of quality control which can be exercised at eight critical points in the preparation and practice of a teacher: (1) college admission; (2) admission to teacher education programs; (3) student teaching and other professional field experiences; (4) completion of preservice preparation and institutional recommendation of candidates for initial certification; (5) state agency certification; (6) employment; (7) retention and tenure decisions--the role of inservice education; (8) continuing professional development--the recognition of the teacher-scholar. The major section of this paper is organized around these quality control points,  and, within each of the eight subsections, seven basic questions are utilized to clarify the issues relating to each point: (1) What are the competencies, qualities, and characteristics associated with effective teacher performance expected as exit criteria from this point? (2) Which of these competencies, qualities, or characteristics can be developed or enhanced by the institution or agency primarily responsible for the quality control point with the time and resources available? (3) What are the entry requirements at this quality control point? (4) How can generic competencies associated with quality teacher performance be ensured while at the same time avoiding a narrow view of teaching? (5) What are the principal influences on the quality controls exercised? (6) With whom does  primary responsibility for evaluation lie? and (7) What processes, mechanisms, and instruments are properly involved? A bibliography is appended. (MM)",

Seventy-two preservice teachers were selected from six universities participating in a consortium teacher center program. Each student teacher was randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group. The experimental group was provided with training implemented through the teacher center aimed at developing teaching skills that contribute to the creation of a positive learning environment. The control group received no such training and proceeded instead through the teacher preparation curricula provided by their respective organization. A Competency Indicator Scale  was used to observe teaching behaviors directed at developing affective outcomes in learners. Based on the data collected, the teacher center consortium did not seem to offer any special advantages to helping preservice teachers acquire and demonstrate specialized teaching skills. The cooperative teacher center effort, however, did seem to have positive effects on the program participants. (A discussion of the Dallas Teacher Education Center is included). (MM)",

In the first paper, a rationale for the present state of the art is given and also a projection for the future. Differing, but equally effective, approaches to the inservice education of teachers are analyzed. Factors that determine program purposes and characteristics are discussed. Scenarios of three illustrative inservice education programs are presented in detail. In the second paper, a number of basic conditions that need to be considered in planning for more viable inservice alternatives are considered, and suggestions on how some of these issues may be resolved are offered. The point is made that the \"whys\" and\"hows\" of inservice education will be understood more clearly if they are examined in relationship to foreseeable changes in the total approach to teacher education, and school conditions in general.

The resulting data sets were factor analyzed to a principal axis, varimax rotated solution with resultant factors somewhat consistent across forms and highly consistent across clarity levels for each form. The data suggests that teacher clarity consists of a general dimension involving explaining concepts in an understandable manner, at an appropriate pace, involving use of examples and illustrations in presenting material.  Practical implications appear in several areas: (1) junior high school teachers who wish to be judged as clear teachers should use clarifying techniques in their teaching methods; (2) teacher educators who wish to train clear teachers should stress the practice and frequent use of understandable presentations, appropriate pace, and use of examples; (3) researchers might well find similar success in identifying and defining other high inference constructs (e.g., teacher variability, enthusiasm, task-oriented behavior, etc.) by using similar methods.

Previous studies had shown a decline in these types of pupil attitudes during an academic year. Control classrooms in the study exhibited this decline. Six classrooms in grades 3, 6, and 8 were experimental sites. The six control classrooms of the same grades were selected in a poor, white Appalachian school district. Results indicated that socioeconomic level did not relate to student attitudes and that the verbal behavior of the teacher is one factor that affects student attitudes. The conclusion of the study is that  achieving a positive attitude toward school on the part of students is a complex problem calling for more careful study of teacher behaviors and attitudes. (JD)",

        "description":"This document presents the negative effect on many adolescents of the typical secondary school program and outlines a proposed curriculum for education majors. The problem dealt with is the departmentalized structure of high schools, which results in fragmenting the student's life at school into a series of subject-matter-centered meetings. The curriculum is devised to prepare teachers for interdisciplinary teaching, thus enabling them to spend more time with one unified group of students. Broad training and certification would make teachers qualified to teach in one major area, plus one or more minor areas. The graduates from this teacher education curriculum would be expected to work in high school programs where greater attention would be paid to interdisciplinary coordination  and to stimulating cooperative activities among students and teachers. Presumably, such cooperative activities would serve to diminish student isolation and assist in realigning subject area responsibilities among high school faculty. The ultimate goal of the program is to improve the school experience of the high school students by improving the quality of contact with teachers and other students. The curriculum is outlined, using the subjects of art design, history, physical education, english, and education courses as examples of how different disciplines may be coordinated. Proposed high school programs for the student teacher are described. (JD)",

Three problem areas in particular are discussed: (1) the dilemma of teaching style, involving questions of teacher vs. student motivated learning; (2) the dilemma of recommendations to individual teachers, stressing the need for constructive evaluation, conditional upon the instructor's views of what is appropriate, practical, and desirable to him in respect to his  instructional goals, and (3) the dilemma of designing valid evaluation instruments, instruments that take into account factors such as teaching modes, teacher expectations, learner performance, student workload both in and outside the class, and instrument internal consistency. Discussion of five factor analysis clusters determined by Hildebrand as characteristic of best/worst teachers illustrates further difficulties in evaluation procedures; the author offers remedial suggestions.

The results of this study indicate that even though futurists are varied in their ideas and approaches, there is general agreement among those surveyed on the following: (1) there is a noticeable stance among educators of past and present orientation; (2) changes are forcing more educators to look to the future; (3) the educational system lags behind other institutions in responding to change; (4) the study of the future should be the concern of all learners; and (5) there is a need for recognizing the importance of fusing a futuristic orientation to all aspects of the curriculum -- elementary, secondary, and collegiate. Besides the proliferation  of books, articles, and media devoted to futurism, there is evidence that college courses have grown with extreme rapidity in emphasizing futurism. There is evidence that futurism has value for preservice and inservice preparation. (Author)",

        "description":"The authors present a brief description of an experiential, sequenced graduate program in reading instruction which answers traditional criticisms of field-based graduate study. Such criticisms include the belief that graduate teacher education is not in the domain of field-based instruction, that adequate supervision is difficult to provide, that goals are vague and poorly defined, and that activity sequences are poorly planned. The Ohio University Teacher Corps Project in Reading, constructed to avoid these shortcomings, consists of six experiential phases, which may be viewed as comparable to the quarters of a school year, or as sequential components not bound by time constraints but by the student's competencies. Phase One consists of observation, tutoring, and team teaching,  designed to acquaint the graduate student with the experiences and processes necessary for effective instruction. In Phases Two and Three, the student functions as an instructional team member, first at the elementary level and then at the secondary level. As the student proceeds through these phases, he becomes less of an observer and more of a contributing member of the team. Phases Four and Five are devoted to developing diagnostic-prescriptive skills, again as a team member in elementary and secondary level situations. Phase Six provides the student with the opportunity to demonstrate the integration of all his previous skill attainment by assuming the role of instructional leader in reading. The variety of experiences provided in this program give the student the necessary expertise  in reading necessary to effectively deal with students at all grade and achievement levels. (MB)",

The positions of the children in the social hierarchy were determined by three measurements: (1) the &quot;mean&quot; indicating the individual child's position in the existing hierarchy; (2) &quot;developmental trends&quot;  determining stability in the individual's status development; and (3) &quot;variation&quot; indicating the degree of uniformity and variation in the individual pupil's development trend.

The model assumes conceptions of preferred global futures as a necessary first element in avoiding vacuous and overly general educational purposes.

An educational training program consists of sets of planned experiences offered in a prescribed sequence and manner but involves other factors as well, since a training program is an environment going beyond the explicit content communicated to include overt and attitude change. The author examines implicit factors involved in creating a \"powerful environment,\" including change as a stated objective, provisions for both professional and personal development, the valuation of such changes and their congruence. Design issues examined include problems of integrating the horizontal and vertical organizational components as separate entities and as parts of a  structural whole; instructional settings and locales; and strategies for developing an integrated structure. Process issues are the other major components of developing the energy and potency needed to make a program a \"powerful environment.\" The author examines recruitment, selection and admission processes, advisory and staffing processes, training processes (grouping, teaming, and contracting), and supervision modes in an effort to explicate means of intensifying these processes in order to increase the potency of the training program. Implicit processes (choosing of deductive or inductive inquiry methods, activity selection, sequencing and pacing) are the last factors examined by the author. In summary, a program becomes a program when structural and process dimensions are so designed  and managed as to provide a \"total learning experience\" for the trainee. (MB)",

Twenty-three juniors and seniors were involved in the program, which took the form of an unstructured block of courses in mathematics, science, and social studies. Three instructors were in charge of the block and taught both individually and in teams. Eleven goals were outlined for the course, the first two of which had to be student-initiated. The balance were devoted to viewing math, science, and social studies as human endeavors for which appropriate psychological, philosophical, and practical bases had to be developed. The result hoped for was that each student (and the three teachers) would  develop skills that would make the curriculum and/or classroom evolve in a synergetic rather than competitive fashion. Personal freedom was retained to the maximum level to allow students to pursue the stated goals of the course and also to develop their own journals to reflect their readings in the field, personal reactions to the course, evaluations of self, teachers, and program, and miscellany at the students' discretion. Both student and professorial reaction to the program was highly positive, with an emerging concensus that students and teachers were more capable of honest, open relationships and the pursuit of educational goals in a setting of interpersonal cooperation and personal freedom.

The population for this study consisted of two pools of teacher competencies: The present-day &quot;Florida Teacher Competency List&quot; and the Commonwealth Study. Samples of fifty items were drawn from the two lists and matched for content. The sets were judged to determine equivalency of items. Sets of fifty items alternating between Florida and Commonwealth were given to forty volunteer teachers to be sorted into groups that they  saw as describing the same aspects of teaching. Data from the sortings were interpreted and ten categories determined from the Commonwealth material and eleven from the Florida list. The categories seemed to follow quite clearly from the content of the statements defining the categories. Results of the analyses and the categorization of items from two different populations seem to indicate that a high degree of relationship exists between these two sets of items. The second question is not as well supported because only four of the latent categories matched similar logical categories. The results tend to support a connection between past theory and practice in teacher education and the present movement in competency based teacher education. While the results do not support the established  logical categories of competencies, the methodology employed seems to be a suitable tool for investigating the structure of these sets of competencies.

The rationale was that teachers should determine the content and design of inservice education at the school building level on the basis of the kind of staff they want and need to become, that goals for the development of the staff should be determined by the kind of staff needed to conduct the school program, and that the school programs should be decided by the needs and interests of students and parents. The project as initiated in three schools--an elementary school, a junior high school, and a senior high school--is described and analyzed. Some results indicate: (1) Teachers focused more on students;  (2) Teacher-administrator working relationships were challenged; (3) New roles for professional associations were explored; (4) New ways of studying children and new avenues of communication between students and teachers were created; (5) The importance of the site for the project was determined; (6) Some latent and subliminal hostility, conflict, and jealousy among professional personnel was uncovered; (7) Allotment of time given to duties other than teaching became a serious consideration; (8) New methods of changing school policy were discovered; (9) An overview of the project itself revealed the need for some changes in approach and implementation.

        "description":"This paper describes a model of a collaborative inservice education program based on the work of a Teacher Corps Project sponsored jointly by the School of Education at Stanford University and a neighboring junior high school in the San Jose Unified School District. In this model, the power to determine the content of the inservice program resides with the teachers and, because literature reviews have shown that teachers themselves are better inservice educators than administrators and professors, the teachers are also the inservice educators. A case study is used to describe the model and provides a picture of how collaboration between universities and schools can and did take place. Implementation of the model involves: (1) briefing the relevant community on the inservice  topic, outlining its dimensions, and correcting any misconceptions; (2) identification of needs by teachers, administrators, parents, students, and inservice educators; (3) summarizing and cataloguing pertinent literature; (4) obtaining additional information from practitioners in the field; (5) selecting and developing appropriate policies; (6) adopting policies; (7) evaluating policies; (8) disseminating information and writing articles for publication.

        "description":"This study aimed at assessing the relationships between the structures of the teaching occupation and teacher training institutions and the personality characteristics of teachers in Israel. The hypothesis considered was that recruitment by self-selection would promote an image of conservatism by bringing into teaching people with matched personality traits. Testing was done with samples of student teachers compared with a normative general group, rather than with inservice teachers, since the hypothesis is based on occupational image and the self-selection process. The student teacher samples (n=1882) were compared with a general population on the 16PF. Profile and discriminant analyses revealed that student teachers share common traits, such as submissiveness, conformism,  adaptability, sensitiveness, and conservatism, and differ in these traits from the normative group. These results seem to suggest a type of natural selection following some occupational image rather than of any preconceived or predicted kind. It seems reasonable to conclude that the absence of a programmatic recruitment system with preconceived selection procedures does not assure the selection of a diverse group of people. Rather the lack of selection procedures (or selection based on a single attribute such as intelligence or scholastic ability) creates a process of self-selection based on one's (or society's) image of the chosen occupation.

A brief summary of previous research and writing of educators is presented, followed by a listing of characteristics exhibited by teachers who are superior in encouraging motivation and learning in all types of students. Using this set of positive values as a standard, 84 secondary school teachers who had taught at least four years and been recommended by either their principal, superintendent, or a supervisor were interviewed. Teachers were asked to state the most promising approaches or methods they would employ in motivating their students. The survey of literature on motivating students and the results of interviews and  responses to the questionnaire used in this study indicate that: (1) Literature on the topic definitely indicates the secondary school teacher has responsibilities in the area of student motivation; (2) The secondary school teachers who participated in this study all indicated that the motivation of students should be an area of concern for teachers. In conclusion, capable and experienced teachers have many similar traits, characteristics, and approaches to motivating their pupils. (JD)",

        "description":"This paper contains the major comparative findings of an investigation undertaken to survey and precisely describe a number of classroom behaviors occurring within the Kindgom of Nepal and to determine how those behaviors differed from comparable U.S. classroom behaviors. Comparisons were made using the Beeby taxonomy of educational stages and Flanders interaction analysis categories. Some of the findings indicated that: (1) Nepalese students did not express their own ideas and opinions very frequently, and teachers made little use of student ideas. Nepalese teaching observed conformed to what many educators would consider to be traditional, teacher-dominated classes, interspersed with periods of recitation. (2) Nepalese teachers were found to focus more directly upon the  presentation of content matter than did U.S. teachers. (3) U.S. teachers tended to ask longer questions, spent greater percentages of time giving directions, and generally exhibited more extended &quot;indirect&quot; as well as &quot;direct&quot; teacher influence than did corresponding Nepalese teachers. (4) The extent of &quot;drill&quot; was found to be similar in most comparable Nepalese and U.S. classes, as was the percentage of time students talked in response to teacher and the ratio of student and teacher talk. The study did not determine whether similarities and differences are unique to Nepal and the U.S. or whether they are more generally descriptive of behavioral similarities and differences between industrialized and &quot;underdeveloped&quot; countries, between western and Asian cultures, or between other  permutations of social systems around the world.

        "description":"This document examines the factors that hinder effective change in curriculum development and inservice education at the school district and building level and suggests strategies for promoting a climate conducive to such change. The school district/building is described as a political environment, influenced by relationships between teachers, administrators, students, parents, and other special interest groups. These influences are arranged into four clusters (internal--formal and informal, external--formal and informal), and examples of each are given and briefly discussed. Prospects for educational change are viewed as possible if those involved realize the political nature of the institutions in which they function and make a continuous effort to deal openly and trustingly  with others. Specific examples of approaches which have worked in promoting change are cited, grouped into the four clusters previously described. The paper closes with a statement of need for both preservice and inservice educators to become familiar with the school as a political institution in order to produce effective change. (MB)",
