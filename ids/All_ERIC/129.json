Karnes and R. Zehrbach consider decisions regarding identification and assessment of replicable products (such as curricula and audiovisual presentations). Discussed by D. Stedman are the kinds of target audiences and methods for approaching an audience regarding replication. R. Havelock covers aspects of service delivery. General factors affecting the success of replication efforts are described by D. Weikart. E. House reviews the evaluation process for replicable products. Financial considerations are discussed by J. Moss. L. Gunn examines staff organization and training, and M. Wood describes the replication  experience of the Rutland, Georgia Center ( a community-based program for children with severe emotional problems). (CL)",

Research is reported to support other aspects of his hypothesis such as the lack of visual problems in the spatially competent learning disabled (SCLD) group, the frequent occurrence of a general maturational lag in SCLD males, and the common presence of hyperactivity is also due to an inherited maturational lag. Research is reviewed in the areas of birth order, sex of siblings, neurological impairment, pregnancy and perinatal factors, hyperactivity and brain damage, the nature of hyperactivity, the management of  hyperactivity, the inheritance of specific abilities and disabilities, specific abilities underlying reading and other language processes, the good spatial ability but poor auditory-vocal memory skills in SCLD children, the incidence of SCLD children, and the effectiveness of remediation programs.

The literature review of the entire study focused on the critical variables (teachers' roles, individual differences, and individualized instruction) involved in using the open classroom for special education. In the experiment reported, Ss behavior over 5 hours was classified as either academic vs. nonacademic; amount of time spent with teachers, peers, or alone; and positive vs. negative interactions. It was found that Ss spent more time in nonacademic activities than academic, alone and with peers than with teachers, and in positive interactions.  Preliminary findings of the entire study suggested that, in comparison to instruction in traditional classrooms, considerably more peer helping takes place in the open classroom; younger or poor achieving children are learning incidentally considerable material in the open classroom that is presented to older children; younger children in the open classroom engage in activities usually associated with older children; and teachers seem to perceive less deviant behavior and less under-achievement in the open classroom, leading to fewer referrals for psychological examinations, testing, and special class placement.

Noted are trends such as increasing numbers of exceptional children in regular classrooms, and fewer children institutionalized or exempt from public educational programs. Listed are common complaints of educators regarding most IT programs such as that programs are uninteresting. Offered for IT implementation are three guidelines: design the program to fit the need, insure cooperation between teacher training institutions and the public schools, and develop a National Inservice Teacher Education Program. Described as a model of a cooperative program is Project  CHILD (Cross-discipline Help for Individual Learning and Development), which provides inservice training to regular teachers with learning disabled children in their classrooms.

During oral reading lessons, errors were recorded under conditions in which the teacher was either instructed to make her normal responses to oral reading errors (control group) or use the five-step attentional cueing technique (experimental group). In comparison to controls using single- or multiple-cue responses to pupil errors, findings showed a significant error difference in favor of the experimental condition. Evidence suggested that mildly retarded children learn more new words from teacher responses to oral reading errors which provide a highly consistent,  structured, attentional form of feedback than from teacher responses incorporating the normal variety of cueing behaviors. Study limitations included deviations from normal teaching patterns and the relatively small sample.

        "description":"A study was conducted to compare teaching and control patterns used by mothers of 4- to 6-year-old trainable mentally retarded (TMR) children to patterns used by mothers of nonretarded children, and to evaluate an analysis strategy identifying sequential behavior chains from observational data. Literature was explored on three topics: cognitive characteristics of TMR children, maternal attitudes toward handicapped children, and techniques for studying parent-child interaction. Ss were split into six groups consisting of the mother with the target child (either nonretarded, TMR, or older TMR) and a sibling of the target child; and each S group was given four experimental tasks (such as block stacking and sorting). Recorded were the proportion of time spent at each task and the  number of transitions between each of six interaction patterns (such as elaborated explanation and residual patterns). Results did not support the major hypothesis that mothers teaching moderately retarded children would use more restricted patterns than mothers teaching nonretarded children (either of equal chronological age or of level of social competence). The negative finding may have been due to insufficient differentiation between elaborated and restricted interaction patterns. Analysis procedures demonstrated the value of the computer-based system for coding and processing data. (Tables, illustrations, pictures, and appendixes are provided.) (SB)",

The Individual Cognitive Demand Schedule and the Indiana Behavior Management Scale were used to record process variables during each 30-minute instructional period, and pupils were administered achievement tests covering the lesson's content area. Results of the study indicated that: the method developed was feasible; some generalizability of teaching ability existed across the content areas; there were differences between the beginning and student teacher groups in teaching  methods and pupil achievement; almost no stable relationships between trainee characteristics and teaching ability were found; and although few consistent relationships between pupil learning and process variables were found, the group that obtained higher pupil achievement scores (beginning trainees) tended to use more informational and negative feedback and less positive feedback than did the group that obtained lower scores (student teacher trainees).

        "description":"There is a lack of adequate measurement techniques for testing language proficiency. Researchers compose specific tests for a certain task, but these have only limited general applicability. Often multiple-choice, true-false or fill-in-the-blank tests are used, but these rely heavily on written language and are inadequate for those with poor written but good verbal skills. Such tests tend to compartmentalize learning into components and neglect the overall view, and they generally reflect academic language rather than current vernacular. Norm-referenced, criterion-referenced and non-formal tests involving listing of words following a language cue may be affected by the individual's attitude toward being tested. Indirect tests may solve some of these problems by examining language  produced in a non-test situation. Factors studied are sentence length, structural complexity, lexical choice and type-token ration. Occurrences of linguistic mazes and culs-de-sac may also be observed. Second-stage indirect measures such as body language may also be useful. It is possible, however, that proficiency may be a mark of social rather than linguistic status. (CHK)",

Recent work on the acquisition of syntax and semantics shows an ordered acquisition for linguistic items; this pilot study was to test whether the ability to discriminate between consonants proceeds in a similar order and discrimination of any particular pair implies the ability to discriminate all others in order before it. Objects were given nonsense names differing only in initial consonants, and when the experimenter called one name, the children were requested to perform an action with the proper object to prove they could discriminate the consonants. Selection of subjects, experiment materials, scoring and testing  procedures are detailed. Results show that Shvachkin's method is valid with American children, and an ordered sequence similar to the Russian order of classes of oppositions emerged. The acquisition orders are charted. Findings appear to justify a full replication study for English. (CHK)",

        "description":"A longitudinal study investigated early syntactic forms in child language; this paper reports on findings dealing with differences in approach to syntactic acquisition. Seven children aged 16-20 months were the subjects, and audio or video tapes were made once every three weeks beginning prior to the development of syntax. Data collection continued until 20 percent of the utterances specified a combination of subject + verb + complement. Analysis showed that the greatest difference among children was the length of time required to develop from the single word utterance to the subject + verb + complement structure--varying from 2 1/2 to 9 months. This reinforces the notion that speed of language acquisition varies considerably among children. It is noted that girls' syntactic  development was considerably more rapid than boys'. Differences in syntactic acquisition based on speed and gender may be related to style differences in language development. Style differences between slow and rapid developers are examined in terms of presyntactic utterances, simplicity and complexity of utterance, indeterminate constructions not meeting English word order constraints, and subject and predicate specification. All factors showed a definite pattern relating to speed of syntactic acquisition. (CHK)",

The investigation technique described is that of elicited imitation, whereby the child is simply asked to repeat sentences containing grammatical features observed to show variation. Previous use of this technique and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The test itself appears in two forms, each one containing 15 sentences taken from recordings of natural speech. It is administered individually to  children whose mean age is 5.5 years, by an adult tester, and recorded. Native speakers of English should perform better on the test, and the scores should improve with age, that is, further exposure to Standard English. The results confirm these predictions, thus demonstrating the validity of the test. Specific results are given for tests given to Mexican-American and Pima children, and to Hawaiian-Creole speaking children, the results from the latter being the most detailed. (CLK)",

Over 600 Indian words were extracted from contemporary Guatemalan literature and Lisandro Sandoval's &quot;Semantica guatemalense.&quot; Interviews were arranged with middle and upper class speakers of Guatemalan Spanish in Guatemala City and Xelaju, the second largest city. The subjects were divided into four age groups: (1) 14-21, (2) 22-35, (3) 36-50, and (4) 51 and over. Several usage patterns emerged. Approximately 225 words were not recognized by any group. These words are semantically divided into terms for trees, plants, animals, rare insects, fish, Indian clothing, expressions for sick children, kinship,  agriculture procedures, chiefs or bosses, the devil, and extinct professions. The oldest group recognized the most Indian words, and each progressively younger group was acquainted with fewer. Vocabulary used by all groups was divided into three groups: (1) Fruits and vegetables: achiote, aguacatal, caimito, camote, piloy, and pozol, (2) Animals: cutete, coyote, pijije, and tacuacin, and (3) Utensils and clothing: caite, comal, guacal and paxte.

        "description":"A study was undertaken to determine whether children in early periods of language development use stress with any regular patterns, and if so, on what the patterns are based. The subjects were five children aged 21-29 months, MLU between 1.3 and 2.4. Tape recordings were made during play sessions with each child. Two-word utterances that could be clearly interpreted were extracted and grouped and their stress was determined. Analysis indicates that children have strong stress patterns and that semantic relations are more important to the child's stress than syntax. In use of locative phrases with verb-locative, the locative was stressed in every case. In modifier-noun use, the modifier was almost always stressed, in contrast to transformation generative theory. Other stress  priorities are noted and arranged in a scale. It is proposed that children distinguish whether information in utterances is new or contrastive and apply stress accordingly, following a semantic hierarchy. The evidence showing that children early produce regular and significant patterns of stress is important for the syntax vs. semantics controversy in adult stress assignment. (CHK)",

        "description":"In the past, social lectologists have not considered their work as contrastive linguistics. One reason is that sociolects of a language differ quantitatively; differences lie in the frequency patterns with which certain forms occur in each lect. Contrastive linguistics deals with standard or idealized languages, while sociolects are often nonstandard or socially stigmatized. Contrastive social lectology began in the 1960s to study vernacular Black English to aid in teaching standard English to minorities. Quantitative measurement of variable linguistic forms aids in examination of speech differences as related to extralinguistic factors. It is necessary to identify social and linguistic environments affecting use of variants. This article charts the occurrence of several variants  by social class; analysis reveals the operation of rules governing variable appearance. Optimal use of variables is controlled by a hierarchy of constraints, but a correct theory as to how this system works has not yet been formulated. This notion of structured variability provides a model for variation in interlanguage contrastive studies. In any contrastive study it is important to examine the actual lects contacted rather than idealized norms, as illustrated in a recent study of Puerto Rican English in East Harlem. (CHK)",

It is hypothesized that the brain in youth is extremely plastic, but hardens with adolescence and adulthood and becomes less receptive. Children learn in an active way, during play, and the language is reinforced by pleasure and by corresponding activities. Adults usually learn passively in a classroom involving only audiovisual methods and memory. Accordingly, the following characteristics of effective language learning programs are suggesged. For children: Native-speaking teachers, several hours of instruction or exposure daily, linguistically unstructured activities, no corrections until the child is fluent, cultural lessons may or may not be  used, supportive home-school environment. For adults: A well-trained, dynamic and patient teacher, students with expressed goals, daily or frequent classes that are both small and homogeneous, linguistically and methodologically sound textbooks, acting out situations in the language, varied modalities of presentation, minimum of correction, outside practice, availability of tutors, individualized instruction, explication of purposes and goals of a learning activity.

The formation of a corpus is justified in terms of saving effort and in providing a compilation of data that will serve as a research tool in comparative studies. Important questions in the process concern the body of language from which the sample will be drawn, the size of the sample, and its structure. These, in turn, are dependent on the purpose for which the corpus is assembled: graphic analysis will require a different corpus than will phonological or  grammatical analysis, for example, the latter presenting the most problems. Practical constraints on the size of the corpus, including time, energy and money are mentioned. The organization of the corpus is discussed, underlining such factors as the size of the base units, mode of selection and collection, assembly of the corpus and computerization. The question of how much additional explanatory material should accompany the corpus is raised, with particular reference to lexical and semantic analyses. (CLK)",

The paper shows that: (1) the manner in which some workers discriminate between categories reveals their position in the production flow, (2) terms are lost if ideas relating to them are lost to the group, and some undergo a psychological regrouping if there is competition between homophonous forms in overlapping work environments, (3) operational links determine the extent to which workers share conceptual categories and  linguistic terms referring to those categories, and (4) workers who are closely associated with particular operations are capable of making precise distinctions between conceptual units. The discussion shows that studying language in a work setting contributes to a better understanding of the relationship between social forces, cognitive processes and communicative behavior.

After a rapid review of the main dimensions of linguistic variation within a given society, with particular attention to sociolectal and register variation, 'codes' are examined and compared with registers and sociolects. There follows a more detailed investigation of the nature and implications of codes in the Bernsteinian sense, relating to the social and, more precisely the educational context. The conclusions are that 'code' and 'lect' correspond to radically different types of variation, and that code-variation is by no means as socially exclusive or inherently so politically charged as many writers claim. Two points should be  borne in mind while reading this paper; it represents work in progress towards a fuller treatment of the subject, and the final presentation of &quot;restricted code&quot; is exaggerated deliberately to provide a counter-argument to polemic current in Europe in 1974.

This variation is used on reservations or in urban Indian enclaves when the &quot;Indianness&quot; of the discussion or participants needs formal linguistic marking. One research goal is to demonstrate that tribal varieties of Indian English actually exist. Analysis shows that Indian English grammatical and phonological structures are often replications of the Indian language detail. American Indian English may have had a fairly recent origin in federal boarding schools where only English could be spoken in classrooms and dormitories by the Indian students of various tribes. A second area for research is the idea that current American Indian English dialects vary predictably according to the native  language rules. Dialects of American Indian English contain grammatical features common to other nonstandard dialects, such as Black English. Testing is underway to determine whether the dialect factors arise from similar motivations. Another research project is a study of the Indian English patterns within a given community to yield information about both grammatical structures in the Indian language and first-language interference in learning standard English. A final research area is the need for educational techniques and policy to develop diglossic fluency in both standard and American Indian English. (CHK)",

Vernacular is spoken by individuals with little education. Sociolinguistics as a field embraces ethnography of communication, social coding, societal analysis, social-psychological analysis and anthropoloty, all of which avenues of research are pursued by noted linguistic theorists. These strands may be unified into a &quot;pandialectical model of sociolinguistic research.&quot; Early work in the field isolated vernaculars, identified patterns of language choices, and constructed rules governing variability. Variation within a language or between languages can be understood as a continuum within which a speaker moves and chooses. Notions of language  restrictiveness and elaborateness were seen to be independent of intellectual capacity. Research into southwest English must consider Mexican-American English, Spanish, and bilingualism. Research should study sociolinguistic perspectives investigated elsewhere and identify pandialectical elements that may be applied to the southwest to construct a pandialectical model to trigger research. Issues to be examined include: (1) identification of vernaculars, (2) the nature of stylistic shifting, (3) description of speech communities, (4) description of variability features through variable rules, and (5) the presence of cross-cultural biases.

Contrastive analysis between standard English and the native language is used and the ethnic dialect of English is described and compared with standard English. Variation study of the Mexican-American dialect is important to identify grammatical errors that can be corrected. Constrastive analysis explains and predicts first-language interference from maximal to minimal as the second language is learned. Error analysis compiles deviations caused by language interference, dialect differences, lack of knowledge of grammar, etc., and provides a teaching tool. Language  acquisition and probably second language learning follows set stages and the types of errors appropriate to each stage are in a well-defined series. The notion of irreversible solidarity states that when E3, E2, and E1 are grammar rules of descending difficulty, if E3 is learned and used correctly by an individual, then E2 and E1 will be also. The rules are learned in order from simple to complex. Knowledge and understanding of language acquisition and error patterns are powerful diagnostic tools for the teacher of English. (CHK)",

The point is to show the effect of the use of the vernacular in the learning of subjects in the curriculum. A socioeconomic investigation which preceded the project selected 150 6-year-old children from rural backgrounds, from three communities: Flon, Darbonne, and Dessources. Factors such as the degree of literacy and education of the parents, their professional status or lack thereof, and the amount of land that they worked were taken into account. The experimental  group used Creole as a medium of instruction, while French was taught as a foreign language. Control Group 1 used exclusively French and the methods of the Mission Pedagogique Francaise, while Control Group 2 used those of the Department of Rural Education and was independent of CHISS. Testing of intelligence, oral language, achievement, and attitudes was conducted at given intervals. The tabulated results show bilingual education to be preferable to traditional methods. (CLK)",

The majority of the studies have been done by Belgians, and have to do with regional varieties of French spoken in Belgium. Some, however, examine African or American varieties. Chapter 1 deals with the normative or prescriptive studies. These include investigations of lexical and semantic items and have chiefly concentrated on measuring the difference between &quot;Belgian&quot; usage and &quot;correct&quot; French as judged primarily by the literary language. Chapters 2 and 3 discuss the descriptive studies which deal with lexical and semantic problems, or with grammatical and phonetic problems. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the studies that are  indirectly related to Belgian varieties of French, including historical investigations and relevant literary studies. Chapter 5 refers to studies that are of a more sociological nature. In each chapter, brief discussions of the material accompany the listing of the works. The author's name and the date of publication are included. An extensive bibliography concludes the report. (CLK)",

        "description":"Motivating students to study foreign languages is a unique problem within American culture. Experience suggests that Americans are psychologically inhibited from identifying with other people because of sensitiveness to their immigrant past. Some foreign language educators have concluded that, because of this past, teaching of foreign languages will always be difficult, if not impossible, in most American schools. Others feel that this factor merely makes foreign language instruction more difficult, but not impossible. According to the latter view, the key to motivating American students lies in getting them intrinsically motivated. The problem is that foreign language acquisition requires the learning of a great deal of material which, in itself, is not intrinsically motivating.  As a result, many teachers attempt to force-feed the material into students. This tends to drive them out of foreign language study and to reduce enrollment levels to the point where the program is financially questionnable. Thus, the key to success in the American foreign language classroom lies in making the necessary drill material palatable without having the classroom deteriorate into \"fun and games.\" The article discusses the above-mentioned problem and suggests techniques for motivating students in the context of American education.

        "description":"This study evaluates the effectiveness of a mnemonic procedure, called the keyword method, for teaching a large Russian language vocabulary to college students. The method divides the study of a vocabulary item into two stages. The first stage requires the student to associate the spoken Russian word to an English word (the keyword) that sounds like some part of the foreign word; the second stage requires the student to form a mental image of the keyword &quot;interacting&quot; with the English translation. Thus, the keyword method can be described as a chain of two links connecting a foreign word to its English translation through the mediation of a keyword: the foreign word is linked to a keyword by a similarity in sound (acoustic link), and the keyword is linked to the English  translation by a mental image (imagery link). A computer controlled curriculum using the keyword method served as a supplement to the second-year Russian language course at Stanford University. Students studied a large basic vocabulary over an 8- to 10-week period. Data obtained during the study and student reports indicate that the keyword method was highly effective. (Author)",

        "description":"This thesis presents the results of a field study of code-switching in K-3 level classrooms of an experimental Spanish-English bilingual education project in Los Angeles. The goal of the project, based on a pluralistic model of bilingual education, was the maintenance of Spanish by means of continued language-development in both the students' native and second languages. The thesis shows that the means of implementation contradict the project's goals. Data was collected on code-switching in 12 different setting-participant combinations during language-development lessons. A quantitative measure related code-switching by teachers and students to specific setting-participant combinations. An analysis of the functions of teacher code-switching indicates that it is a communicative  strategy. The study concludes that: (1) English is more intrusive in the classroom than Spanish; (2) the contrast in the amount of code-switching by teachers may be based on their expectations of students to communicate in the target language; and (3) the contrast between the patterns of teacher code-switching during the language lessons may be signaling to students that English functions more efficiently than Spanish for &quot;important&quot; messages in the classroom. Demotion of Spanish may be an attitude-motivation factor in both the maintenance of Spanish for native speakers and the acquisition of Spanish for native speakers of English. (Author/CLK)",

Through what kinds of policies would they be most likely to encourage enrollment in their institutions? This study was designed to answer these questions, which have become relevant because of the near certainty that the majority of institutions will have a plethora of space and a shortage of applicants by 1985. To reflect the competitive strengths of different schools in both the private and public sector during the next ten years, postsecondary institutions were classified by selectivity and geographical recruitment areas. Various strategies for increasing enrollments are discussed and evaluated. The study concludes that the size of the private sector depends upon policies in the public sector. It  is quite possible, with generous state funding, that public schools will maintain past levels of enrollment and impact enrollments in the private sector quite drastically. Private institutions will have no choice but to lower admission requirements to attract students who can afford to pay the high tuition fees they charge. The lesser private schools (except those catering to commuters, which presumably have the monopoly of location) will lose a considerable portion of their enrollment and may be forced to close.

Responses were received from 409 of the 620 randomly selected citizens of Minnesota who were contacted. Key findings include: Most respondents tended to endorse a broad, multifaceted mission for the university. Within that broad mission, the most support was given to graduate and undergraduate programs oriented toward career preparation. Least support was offered for the provision of social events for students and athletic events for the public. Although large numbers of respondents felt inadequately informed to make judgments about the university, majorities of those who did  answer reported being satisfied with the university system as a whole and with university students and faculty.

Key findings include: For no fee did a majority of students endorse an immediate reduction or elimination, but for only four fees (health service inpatient and outpatient care, Student Ombudsman Service, and Regents' Aid Fund) did a majority advocate an increase to maintain present programs in the face of inflation. Over 75 percent of the respondents were against having a regular telecommunications fee, although over 40 percent felt that they might be interested in using student telecommunications services in some fashion.  Respondents were nearly evenly divided over a proposal to replace the health service inpatient fee with a health insurance requirement. (Author)",

The programs included those initiated by the 1971 appropriations bill (ESHB 151). A proviso was attached stating that 1/2 of 1 percent of the funds provided under the instructional budget for higher education institutions should be expended to develop new and innovative programs.  With one exception, no general fund appropriations were specifically earmarked for new and innovative programs durring the 1973-75 biennium. Focus in this report is on stimulating interest in the cooperative development of these and similar programs, and toward recognizing the time, effort and financial resources expended by each of the institutions of higher education to develop, review, implement, and support innovative programs.

This new college was to be known as the &quot;experimental&quot; college of S.U.N.Y. The goals expressed by this new college are exciting, inspiring, and due to the system which promulgated them, inherently unrealizable. Due to the needs of the &quot;parent&quot; systems, the &quot;child&quot; could not survive in any form very different from any other state college. The first academic year ended in a sit-in during which most of the students, faculty, and administration found themselves involved in a bitter fight around every issue but the central one--the built-in contradictions inherent in a state supported &quot;experimental&quot; college. The steadily escalating tension arose as a  result of the conflict between Old Westbury's college heredity and Old Westbury's college environment (which was both &quot;inherited&quot; and created), plus the environment that is out of its control entirely, the American political scene.

        "description":"A mathematical model of the Ph.D. scientist labor market demonstrates that subsidies of graduate training can be more cost effective than higher wages if the supply of doctorates is substantially more responsive to $1000 of early subsidy than to higher future wages with a present discounted value of $1000. Whether this is true is an unsettled empirical matter. There are three reasons for targeting subsidies at Ph.D. scientists: (1) As a condition of taking a job they demand freedom to do basic research and publish their results. (2) Because of their special knowledge and loyalty to professional values, hiring scientists and engineers contains an extra risk that trade secrets will be stolen or that one of them will be a \"whistle blower.\" (3) From the firm's point of view these  factors reduce the scientist's productivity. They do not from society's point of view, so an externality is created by the employment of scientists. (Author/LBH)",

All of the arbitration awards generated by the four-year colleges of the State University of New York as well as the awards of the Pennsylvania state colleges were reviewed. Twelve two-year SUNY colleges also responded to a letter requesting arbitration decisions, and additional cases were found in back issues of &quot;Arbitration in the Schools.&quot; Less than half of the awards surveyed involved academic judgment issues. The majority concerned traditional contract interpretation questions such as the length of contract-mandated paid vacations, eligibility for pension benefits, and  the necessity of paying for overtime work. Cases where academic consequences grew out of basically non-academic grievances are reported briefly. It is shown that the very presence of arbitration has had direct impact on academic decisions, some of which has been beneficial. Tenure and promotion decisions have been affected by the introduction of due process elements into academic personnel decisions. If the traditional system of faculty participation in decision making is to be maintained, steps must be taken to establish appropriate boundaries between academic officials' and arbitrators' authority.

This study combines data for 1973 from reports covering state agency expenditures for research and development and a series covering all institutions of higher education expenditures. This joint consideration of state agency and state university R and D efforts can be useful in assessing the factors that contribute to economic and social change within the States. These combined expenditures, representing funds that were disbursed by the budget offices of state agencies and universities, amounted to $1,990 million in 1973. The report compares and contrasts the R and D emphases of the state universities and agencies noting the sources of the funds as well as the  areas of distribution: life sciences, engineering, social sciences, physical sciences, and others. The ranking of states by expenditures shows a strong correlation between the leadership of states in public R and D expenditures and their relative rankings in state population, total personal income, and total state government general expenditures. Finally, the report shows the growing recognition in both government and university circles that university expertise could be further extended into the public sphere with benefit to both groups.

There is an effort to clarify procedures in areas such as insurance, social security, payroll, and contracts, which have created a reluctance on the part of many administrators to develop or expand their off-campus program. The intent is to provide a broad sampling of methods and forms for development and improvement of programs. The models or alternatives discussed are broad and general so as to be adaptable to the variety of  situations and environments found in postsecondary programs. The guide contains materials on ways to find jobs, student placement procedures, program-administration tips, issues and policy, academic credit, evaluation.

        "description":"The legislative history of the formula-grant program is surveyed. Testimony at congressional hearings is examined to ascertain the positions of government and health professions organizations regarding the purposes and use of formula grants over time. It is shown how changes in the successive laws reflect changing goals of the program. The actual uses of the funds and the relationship between purposes and accomplishments are studied with focus on dental schools only. Two trends are noted: (1) Schools and professional organizations have regarded the funds as subsidies to existing programs rather than as incentives to increase enrollment, and (2) in each renewal of the legislation, Congress has attempted to create stronger incentives to increasing enrollments and graduates and to  make more explicit its intentions that the number of health professionals increase. It is also noted that the first-year enrollment increases in medical and dental schools between 1965-1971 were approximately equal to the number of federally-funded new school spaces built in that period, indicating minimal enrollment increases coming from the formula-grant program alone. This is concluded to raise the question: Can per-student grants to schools be effective to increase enrollments without also giving the schools substantial construction assistance? (LBH)",

        "description":"Legislation regarding federal assistance to health professionals is reviewed with tables included on specific expenditures and enrollments. The 1963 Health Professions Educational Assistance Act provided financial assistance for schools in two areas: subsidies for construction of new capacity and loans to students. Amendments to the act in 1965 continued those two programs and added three new ones for financial assistance. They added basic improvement grant, special improvement grant, and scholarship programs, as well as new appropriations for student loans. The Health Manpower Act of 1968 continued with modifications the earlier legislation and also covered nurse training, allied health professions and public health training, and health research facilities. Details are given on  Title I, Health Professions Training. The Comprehensive Health Manpower Training Act of 1971 made extensive additions and modifications to the H.P.E.A. program, with programs more explicitly defined, requirements for receiving federal funds raised, and incentives for increasing enrollments and graduates increased. The most extensive changes came in the area of institutional support to schools. (LBH)",

        "description":"The large inflow of Foreign Medical Graduates (FMGs) into the U.S. is cited and four issues discussed. They are: (1) the belief that the FMG is less qualified than the U.S. medical graduate and thus contributes to the decline in quality of medical care; (2) the loss of scarce manpower from less developed countries that have greater needs than the U.S. for medical care and for physicians; (3) the lessening of opportunity for large numbers of U.S. citizens to become physicians; and (4) if trends continue, then together with the recently increased capacity of U.S. medical schools, there will be an oversupply of physicians in the U.S. which could lead to adverse competitive behavior, unnecessary care, and higher costs. Each of these concerns is examined together with several  alternatives for alleviating each concern and the probable consequences of each alternative. It is concluded that the differential effects of a reduction in FMGs alone does not appear to be the solution to any of the issues, nor is it realistic. The differential effects of a reduction in FMGs on the population they serve may more than outweigh any benefits from such arbitrary reductions. (LBH)",

        "description":"The unusually high rate of inflation has produced a clear demand for more vigorous government action to lower the rate of price increase, including increases for health professional schools. The concern coincides with Congressional debate surrounding the renewal of the entire structure of federal support for the education of physicians, dentists, optometrists, and others. Two issues are addressed: (1) what has been the impact of inflation on the costs of health professional education, and (2) how will schools meet the growing burden? A brief overview is presented of both the structure of school costs and estimates of how they have been changing. Attention is paid not only to what has been happening but also to what is likely to occur. These estimates are balanced by a discussion  of what has been and is likely to be the school response to cost pressures. Methods of cutting costs as well as increasing revenues are examined. The discussion offers a background for analyzing the impact on school financing of anti-inflationary policies; i.e., a tight monetary policy and expenditure reducing fiscal policy which includes cuts in federal support. Emphasis throughout the paper is on medical and dental schools. (LBH)",

The report provides background on the need for the program that has been responding to the need of students from low and moderate income families, but has been serving proportionately and absolutely fewer low-income families in recent years. The overall conclusion of the review is that the OIG program continues to merit the highest public priority but requires modification if it is effectively to provide access to higher education for students from low and moderate income families and choice among Ohio's higher education institutions. The overall priority for modifying the OIG program would be to provide increased aid to reduce financial  barriers for existing eligible students before extending eligibility to new groups of students. To further improve the administration of the program, the recommendations are made in four major areas: communications, processing, flexibility, and equity. The projected costs for implementing the recommendations are detailed. (Author/JMF)",

        "description":"By using environmental data, possibly as predictors in their own right, but most probably as moderator variables, it was intended to evaluate available and currently used predictors of leadership potential and academic success. The Environment and Interest Inventory was administered to nearly every candidate for admission to the academy. Over 2,000 completed inventories were accumulated, from which 791 of those who actually entered in July 1964 were obtained. The results of the inventory were to be used for the identification of those environment and interest characteristics which were significantly related to any of three criteria: academic standing, aptitude for the service standing, and resignation versus active status. It is found that the typical entrant to the Class of 1968  comes from a family of comfortable means, not wealthy but economically secure. With respect to specific, available artifacts, such as books, cars, etc., there seems to be a high correlation between the availability of such items and the frequency with which they are used. The relationship between availability and utilization is less obvious regarding general facilities and opportunities, such as libraries or community teams. Questions are unresolved regarding &quot;from whom one seeks help with various kinds of problems,&quot; since a majority responded &quot;does not apply.&quot; (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"A survey of 12 medical and other health sciences schools which have implemented a standard three-year curriculum in the past few years revealed that only one of these schools is planning to revert to a standard four-year program. Some are introducing more attractive four-year curriculum options. The schools' self-ratings of the success of the three-year curriculum were generally favorable. Three- and four-year students were found to be comparable in cognitive knowledge and clinical skills, although comparison of three- and four-year students at one school showed that the four-year class rated itself far superior to the three-year class in knowledge. Faculties appeared to be somewhat dissatisfied with the three-year curriculum, but students enrolled in this program appeared  generally favorable toward it. Overwork and overcrowding were cited as problems. Implementation of the three-year program provided the impetus for intensive preliminary review and reorganization of the educational program, a beneficial side effect. Because of apparent discrepancy between the schools' reported success with the three-year program and extreme caution in discussing it, as well as between reported success and general faculty dissatisfaction, clearer delineation of the impact of a three-year program is advocated.

        "description":"On the basis of information available to them in April 1973, representatives for the Higher Education Panel at 209 institutions gave estimates of the number of doctorates that would be awarded within each field of study during the academic years of July 1972-June 1973 and July 1974-June 1975. The figures reported afford a picture of the possible impact of the collective expectations. In general, doctorate production is expected to increase moderately, and most fields of study will have a share in this increased output. Only in physical sciences did representatives expect to see a somewhat lowered rate of doctoral output by 1975. If their estimates prove reliable, the relative proportion of doctorates contributed by each field of study will remain fairly stable. Only minor shifts  will occur in the relative proportion of degrees granted in a given field of study by public and private institutions or by top 20, developing, or other institutions.

To assist in the dissemination process, the Education Commission of the States (ECS) conducted a series of regional conferences, concluding with a national conference, on the general theme of postsecondary financing. This report summarizes and highlights that conference series. Participants discussed modes of financing which would expand resources for delivering education, ways of providing education within existing budgets, possibly even shrinking budgets. The discussions focused, in part, on accountability, greater efficiency and productivity standards, and the relative fiscal health of  the levels of government.

Results of the interviews and the examination of the documents were analyzed through the  use of the Baldridge Model.

Situational barriers, or social constraints, are seen as those effects of class, ethnic or racial group membership, family attitudes, domestic responsibilities, place  of residence, and community attitudes. Psychological factors include the current status of theories regarding the psychology of women, sex differences in intellectual functioning, attitudes of women toward themselves and in relation to others, motivation for achievement, and psychological correlates of socialization practices.

The sample of applicants studied included 697 candidates to the Class of 1972, 542 of whom were admitted. The 10 traits were combined into four for each of the five raters by factor analysis. Integer weights for raters were developed for each trait and then for the combined traits to best predict Fourth Class Aptitude for the Service and Fourth Class Grade Point Average. It  was found that combinations of the ratings had significant validity for predicting both Fourth Class ASR and GPA. This was especially true with ASR for the group of cadets having ratings from at least a mathematics teacher, an English teacher, and a physical education teacher or coach. (Author/LBH)",

        "description":"The responses of USMA graduates from the Class of 1950 are compared with those of graduates from civilian colleges on a number of topics of current interest. Most of the topics dealt with many of the goals of education which are obtainable and observable only in adult life. The questionnaire that was used consisted of seven major sections: background information, activities, changing society, viewpoints, educational benefits, memory of college experiences, and personal traits. The respondents to the mailed questionnaire were divided into five groups: USMA graduates still on active duty; USMA graduates not on active duty; the total number of USMA graduates responding; graduates from eight civilian engineering and science schools; and graduates from 74 civilian colleges and  universities. In general, it appears that the USMA graduate compares favorably, if not more favorably, with graduates from civilian colleges and universities on most of the topics analyzed. It is noted that the typical USMA graduate feels that he has benefited more by going to college than does the graduate from a civilian institution of higher education. It is cautioned that any interpretations of these results must be made in conjunction with the goals, philosophies, values, and beliefs of USMA and the other colleges, since they may vary from institution to institution.

Of the 291 university campuses surveyed, 51 or 17.5 percent indicated that they were conducting student affairs research on a programmatic basis. Forty-six others had such research but without research  project coordination by a specially delegated individual. The regional distributions of the programs were almost identical to those of the total population of institutions that were surveyed. The distributions by size and type of control of parent institutions were almost identical to the size and control type distributions of the 151 institutions that responded. More than 50 percent of the programs were located at institutions with total student enrollments of 15,000 or more and the majority of programs were at public institutions. Most programs had been in existence for more than one year and almost 50 percent for more than five. (LBH)",

Its origins, administration, financing, facilities, students, and staff are described. The learning system employed is designed for teaching at a distance with course materials prepared by course teams and mailed to students. Television and radio broadcasts supplement the material. The university is viewed as a  self-improving system available to all students without qualification. Its materials can be used by other institutions who can benefit from the course materials themselves along with systems for producing course materials, and systems which combine to deliver the courses.

But careful examination of our many faceted questions suggests that more information may not be the only answer. The National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) has found other aspects to the postsecondary information problem. First, a huge communication gap often looms between those asking the fundamental questions and those in the best position to answer them. Second, information resources do exist, collected either by individual researchers for purposes of investigating a relatively narrow specific aspect of postsecondary education or for purposes not directly related to postsecondary education. The NCHEMS  believes these data can be used in postsecondary education decision-making much more extensively than they have been used in the past. In pursuit of this hypothesis, NCHEMS called together people with unique knowledge of information needs and information availability at all levels: federal, state, and institutional both inside and outside the postsecondary education community. This document presents seven major papers delivered by these people at a seminar, and includes responses to each paper. (Author)",

To this end, the University of San Francisco developed a two-page questionnaire focusing on the needs of a religiously affiliated university with concerns for the quality of life on campus. The questionnaire centered on the following topics: (1) finances; (2) personal earnings; (3) religious views; (4) personal values; and (5) personal concerns about college life. The demographic characteristics of school/college enrollment, current religious preference, sex, legal status, federal government, ethnic categories, residence, and parental income were included. Of all questions on the survey document, only the parental income question was generally not  answered. Hence, no significant data in this area was collected. In its present form this study presents one thing only. It provides a description of the fall 1974 freshman at the University of San Francisco in term of certain demographic characteristics, attitudes, values, and concerns. There are no theoretical or generalized notions to tie these various elements together. In particular, the ethnic groups' data are not organized according to any theory of human relations. (Author)",

In statewide university systems accountability is a formidable task. A major difficulty comes from the diversity of goals and disagreement or confusion over measuring the achievement of those goals. Two major aspects of the problem are contradictory perceptions of &quot;who is accountable for what&quot; and actual operation of a system of accountability. There has been a failure in measuring performance and to distinguish and relate input variables, process variables, and output variables. Many previous evaluations by accrediting agencies and external reviewers have tended to focus of the input variables of  quality and reputation of faculty, quality of students, and adequacy of resources. This orientation overlooks the impact of a program upon the ultimate success of its students and, of equal importance, it tends to neglect the manner in which teachers and learners interact for some purpose. By delineating and clarifying the evaluation process through the use of a specific checklist confusion can by minimized and areas of agreement can be enlarged. (Author/KE)",

Some thoughts on the likely evolution of British higher education to the 1980's and beyond are apparent after looking to: the Robbins Report of 1963, which proposed massive expansion of student numbers and &quot;that courses of higher education be available for all those who are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and who wish to do so;&quot; to the system as it is now; and finally to issues in North America and Europe. Since there is no agreement about the Good Society, and thus about aims and content, the mandate for the pragmatist is to create a variety of higher education institutions  that can fulfill a variety of functions. The direction in which higher education should move is toward greater diversity and greater fairness between the sectors as well as more social justice. What we shall be talking about in 1985 is a system of post-school education in which systems of higher education throughout the world are already moving, and British higher education is set in the same direction.

The survey instrument, 56 competency statements, was divided into three sections: (1) nutrition competencies basic to nursing practice in institutions and in the community; (2) items specific to institutional nursing; and (3) items specific to community health nursing. Analysis of the data showed the predominance of respondents favor inclusion of the majority of essential nutrition competencies in both levels of nursing education over inclusion in either the baccalaureate or  associate degree program. When respondents indicated a preference for a single program, the baccalaureate program was more strongly preferred for all but four competencies. These four, specific to institutional nutrition, were more strongly preferred for associate degree programs. Correlations between information on the Data Sheet for Respondents and responses on the survey instrument indicated that neither the level of program with which faculty were associated nor respondents' level of academic preparation significantly influenced their responses.

A full-scale assessment with outside consultants was not necessary in the case of a provisional embargo. Instead, the method used to remove the embargo was self-study by the discipline group leading to a report to the Advisory Committee on Academic Planning (ACAP), which, in turn, makes recommendations to the Council of Ontario Universities (COU). The report is one of a series of disciplinary studies whose emphasis is on forward planning, and it is hoped that the implementation of COU's recommendation will help to ensure the more ordered growth and development of graduate studies in Ontario's universities.

The tables present data for students enrolled in October 1973 based on family income, expected educational expenses, sources on income, type of school attended, full-time/part-time attendance status, marital status, and financial dependence on parents. Some major findings are: (1) The median expected educational expenses for full-time college students varied from about $620 for those in public junior colleges to $2,640 for students in private universities, and to about $890 for full-time students in vocational schools. (2) Student's  yearly earning and aid from parents were the most common sources of income for undergraduates. Forty-four percent of postsecondary students (excluding graduate students) worked while attending school to pay for the costs of their education. Forty-two percent of students were aided by their parents, 8 percent of students received state scholarships or grants, and about 7 percent received local scholarships. (3) Blacks made up about 8 percent of the total postsecondary school enrollment in October 1973. While a slightly lower proportion of blacks than whites was attending 4-year colleges and universities, the proportion of blacks attending 2-year and vocational schools was somewhat higher than that for white students. The appendix reproduces the survey form used to collect data.  (Author/KE)",

        "description":"There is a crucial need in the field of higher education for a methodology of self-study and self-evaluation of the effective and efficient management of postsecondary institutions that deals with facts as well as perceptions as they relate to institutional management. The Management Systems Inventory (MSI) addresses itself to this need. MSI is a management tool designed to permit an institution to evaluate itself through objective and subjective observations made on the basis of both facts and perception of those facts by various internal and external organizational units and constituencies. MSI bridges the gap between being an audit and a strategy prompting the type of introspection that identifies the various perceptions that act as a catalytic agent for management behavior.  It establishes five areas of concentration: institutional mission, goals, and direction; applicability of organizational structure to mission; organizational responsibility; the extent to which feedback and evaluation mechanisms assure that responsibilities are carried out and that desired results are achieved; and appropriateness of fiscal operations for sustaining institutional continuity and direction.

The social and demographic characteristics of the part-time student population, including educational background, employment characteristics, residence, travel, parental background, financial support, and marital and family status, indicates a relationship between these variables, academic aspiration, and achievement. Adult students are higher achievers than representative college-age groups. The sample consisted of all new students who registered in the Mature Students Qualifying Program with a 67.6 percent rate of response to a questionnaire. Three dependent variables-credits were used as criteria of educational outcomes  for part-time university students. Desire to learn and become educated emerged as the prime reason for taking university courses among over 70 percent of the students tested, while job-related reasons were given first priority by about 20 percent. Family pressures and social reasons received the lowest priority by an overwhelming proportion of respondents. (Author/KE)",

Focusing on the dropout, a phenomenon of major concern in part-time university education, survey was made of all new students registered in the Mature Students Qualifying Program at Sir George Williams University. The survey covers demographic variables, educational background, employment characteristics, residence, travel, parental background, financial support, and marital and family status. The dropout is a multidimensional phenomenon. No single factor could explain dropout from higher education. The need for further multidimensional analysis is apparent. The dynamics of dropout behavior might well  turn out to be different among full- and part-time student populations. Results obtained here would tend to suggest that they are. (Author/KE)",

At the present time there is an increasing awareness of the opportunity for expanding the interinstitutional utilization of faculty between the historically black campuses and the historically white campuses that are located in proximity to each other. In the process of state planning to eliminate dualism in public higher education, the geographic proximity is often regarded as constituting a difficult problem calling for the review of institutional roles and responsibilities. On the other hand, their proximity offers an opportunity for providing, through cooperation and joint planning, a combined resource for serving the total community in its increasing efforts to serve all ethnic groups without  discrimination. This report is a compilation of discussions with administrators and faculty from locations where steps to initiate joint planning have been taken. The materials from these discussions are presented under four headings: the potential benefits which may result from interinstitutional utilization of faculty resources; barriers to achieving cooperative programs; types of arrangements that may be developed between institutions; and suggestions for planning procedures.

Important findings included: (1) significant declines in importance between 1966 and 1973 were  recorded for research and publication; (2) campus committee work and student advising increased sharply as \"major factors\" in faculty evaluations; (3) in evaluating teaching performance, the deans' reliance on \"systematic student ratings\" increased significantly; and (4) whereas the importance of chairman's and dean's evaluations retained a prominent position in teaching evaluation, committee evaluation increased in prominence.

A review of the existing literature from the pre-Soviet period to the present indicates that although there has been a decline in the number of higher  correspondence students since 1965, this form of instruction still plays a significant role in supplying the Soviet economy with a great number of specialists.

Emphasis is on building a close democracy with decentralized planning and coupled relations between all parts of the university and society. The process of designing alternative structures for the University of Copenhagen is clarified, as are the possible uses and problems to be considered with professional management in a university setting. Comparison with the University of California is made. Differences in the structure of the  organizations and in particular the process of decision making in the budget planning are shown to result in differences in the research activity around the management and administration of the two institutions.

The data and findings are of a tentative nature since the survey on which the analysis was based suffered from the lack of standard definitions of concepts as well as the paucity of available information at the institutional level. Data were obtained for 32 different departments grouped into six major subject fields, pure sciences, technology, medical sciences, humanities, law, and social sciences. The ratio between student enrollment and academic staff is discussed as an indicator of the need for academic staff. The importance of  non-academic staff is also emphasized, and ratios between students and administrative staff indicate distinct differences between pure sciences, technology and medical sciences, as compared with the other fields. Technology provides the highest number of teaching hours per week. Data show that these three fields also spend more of the total annual recurrent expenditure on non-remunerative items. A tabulation is given of average recurrent expenditure per student enrolled by department for England, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The data show substantial cost differences between fields within the same country. (LBH)",

Comprehensive long and medium term planning is proposed with the special feature of decentralized decision making. The issue of information requirements for managerial decision making must be considered in view of socio-political conflicts within and outside the university. Possibilities of substantially decreasing unit costs in British universities are explored. Justification for a research collaboration among universities and its continuance into the future on a wider scale is apparent when the wider experience is considered. Latent problems of management can be discussed explicitly within and among  university communities in the sense of a continuing dialogue on issues and problems. The demonstration and diffusion of promising techniques can be carried out efficiently if a clearinghouse facility is made available to which a large number of universities have access. (LBH)",

        "description":"Most efforts to achieve more effective administrative computing in higher education have focused on technical questions or on isolated applications required by middle management. Much less attention has been paid to the question of the proper role of administrative computing in the accomplishment of overall institutional objectives. The enormous variety of environments, missions, and goals found among institutions in postsecondary education precludes easy, all-inclusive answers. But answers must be found if institutions are to make major improvements in their information systems and administrative computing functions. Improvements will occur only if top-level management takes an active role in finding those answers. After defining the alternative roles that administrative  computing can play in an institution, and after the various stages by which administrative computing is developed, an institution should be able to assess where its administrative computing effort stands. The next step is the involvement of top-level management by identifying the roles and responsibilities of users, the administrative computing organization, and external agencies. (Author/KE)",

Usable data was returned by 73 percent of the institutions surveyed offering biomedical research and development activity. The data supplied was analysed in relation to selected institutional characteristics: (1) control of institution (public/private), (2) relative size of biomedical research  enterprise (Top 20/Bottom 20), and (3) whether respondent institutions possessed a medical school or not. Respondents also rated their institutions' effectiveness in finding new nonfederal funds for biomedical research and their projected nonfederal funds for the next five years. Finally, the respondents commented on anticipated changes in nonfederal funding, including the nature, magnitude, and implications of these changes. (Author/JMF)",

        "description":"The end of faculty growth in higher education has led to near panic predictions of aging, highly tenured, more costly, steady-state faculties as the &quot;growth bulge&quot; hired in the 1960's age. This study discusses two models for simulating the behavior over time of indices of faculty health such as average age and salary, annual new hires, and percent tenured. These models are then applied to a specific faculty to demonstrate their usefulness and to provide recommendations. Each school should explore the future implications of its current faculty distribution by age and tenure status and of current hiring and attrition behavior before accepting predictions based on national data. Schools should not overlook &quot;natural&quot; attrition which accounts for much of the difference between annual  new hires and retirements. A time perspective is important, and the behavior of indices of faculty health is cyclical. The young, regularly rejuvenated faculty of the 1960's was somewhat artificial since it was based on permanent growth, and the current deterioration of faculty health indices is in part a return to pregrowth normalcy and will be eventually reversed. The study concludes with a discussion of options for avoiding the aging, more costly faculty approach to steady-state and experiment with the impact of variations in tenure standards on faculty health indices.

It is then necessary to estimate the cost of undergraduate medical education within the perspective of the total education and training of the physician and the other programs and activities of the complex modern medical school. To accomplish this goal, the institutional setting in which this education takes place and the elements and objectives of the undergraduate medical education program are described. The elements and objectives of undergraduate medical education also are defined. Quantitative cost measurements are then presented and the committee's views on the issues surrounding cost  measurement are discussed.

What are the components of contract learning, how do students carry it out, and how do they evaluate it? What are the educational outcomes from contract learning and how satisfied are students with this approach to learning? Answers to these questions imply: contract learning seems a particularly well-suited format for the older, working, married adult who may have attended several colleges some years ago. Students differ at entry and  throughout the degree program in their ability to handle independent study. The role of mentor becomes crucial if the college is to foster self-learning. An experienced, resourceful, and mature group of faculty committed to the ideal of independent learning is needed to effectively work with students having different styles of learning. The contracting process itself has substantial educational benefits apart from the subject matter the contract addresses. (Author/KE)",

Several useful strategies are: (1) launch a committee to study local goals and needs; (2) connect the group and concerned outsiders to evidence about local conditions and to external knowledge resources; (3) seek and sustain support at the top of the institution but broadly involve faculty; (4) persuade persons whose support is needed by personal interaction; (5) develop advisory groups; (6) seek external funding to get things started, but switch to stable internal support as quickly as possible; (7) recruit leaders and faculty who understand the  program; (8) carefully evaluate contract learning experiences, outcomes and related costs; (9) provide orientation and professional development opportunities for those who must assume the new roles; (10) provide reasonable workload and suitable rewards for mentoring functions; (11) set up mechanisms to disseminate innovation; (12) establish renewal units such as planning committees, research officers, faculty development centers, policy analysis and planning officers.

        "description":"Empire State College educational evaluation is oriented to the individual student and in the learning experiences mediated by the institutional arrangements it is essential that cost information be on an individual student basis. Therefore the basic unit of analysis chosen is the individual student contract. The costing model developed assigns to each student contract its share of all costs -- both direct and indirect. Most elements of cost are gathered in cost centers by the commonly accepted definitions. A hypothesis that &quot;high-impact&quot; students would be more costly because they made greater use of tutors and engaged in a longer contract experience was correct. However, the high-impact students at one location, while taking work that lasted almost one month longer than those at  another location, used substantially less tutor services than did those at the other location. An analysis of high-impact students' contracts and their relation to actual facility and cost was made. As is found with everything that develops from this cost/effectiveness system, however, more questions are raised than answered. (Author/KE)",

If you go beyond this type of student and faculty member, you run head-on into serious administrative and planning problems. In short, students are unsure and often confused about their role in individualized education. It seems that (1) students need thorough introductions to individualized programs -- what it's like to be a student in such a program, and maybe opportunities to practice before the program actually begins; (2) faculty need more varied and creative ways, beyond sink-or-swim, to learn their roles, responsibilities, and opportunities; and (3) individualized education programs need clarification as to content, structure, and process. Fundamentally, these findings suggest that if  institutions want to work with a wide range of student types and backgrounds, it may require substantial investment of time and energy in faculty development and student preparation.

Included in those amendments, under Title XII, General Provisions, was Section 1202 pertaining to the establishment of state postsecondary education commissions, signifying an expanded awareness of the new multifacted environment of postsecondary education. Four constituencies interested in statewide coordination of higher education and 1202 commissions were brought together in the conference. The constituencies were the executive directors (or their representatives) of state 1202 commissions, officials of the U.S. Office of Education representing the executive or administrative interests in the federal  government, and scholars from the higher education community who have been engaged in research on 1202 commissions. Formal papers and informal discussions from that meeting are presented. The papers discuss (1) information related to how states have proceeded in establishing the state postsecondary education commissions required by 1202 in the Education Amendments of 1972, including information about membership by states and provisions for coordination of postsecondary planning with vocational education and manpower planning; (2) problems facing 1202 commissions; and (3) whether or not the 1202 commissions should be dissolved, and, if not, how they can be improved.

The use of contracts for services from private higher education institutions in the various states is reviewed as a more feasible procedure than the continuous expansion of public higher education facilities. A correlation is shown between mounting tuition and fees in the private sector and its declining proportion of the total college enrollment. A system for eliminating tuition subsidies and the effects of below cost tuition is examined. The study suggests that an alternative to per  student aid is the New York system of aid on the basis of earned degrees produced by the institution. Assisting colleges in forming consortia not only by state leadership but by providing full-time coordinators to promote maximum utilization of resources within each consortium is suggested by the study as another alternative in financing higher education.

The current situation is classified into four major headings: student confusion; serious managerial problems; lack of conceptual clarity; and special problems in need analysis. The implications of the findings are concluded to be serious. The multiple programs, apparent inconsistencies, and managerial problems create a poor delivery system for student financial aid, which will continue to increase the amount of confusion and uncertainty among the applicants, recipients, and the personnel who advise them. Funds are likely to be used inefficiently. The poor delivery system could cause inefficient management to the extent that  Congressional and state legislative enthusiasm for student financial aid programs could be depressed. Developments and changes in the State Scholarship Program, the College Opportunity Grant Program, the State Guaranteed Loan Program, the Supervised Clinical Training Program, the Medical Student Contract Program, the Law Enforcement Personnel Dependents Scholarship Program, and the Research Program are reviewed with statistical data included.

Topics covered deal with the liberal arts, professional training, institutional reform and the community, new goals of education, the transition from school to work, career exploration and issues of employment, work and service. Taken as a whole, the literature of experiential education is concluded to call for a new interpretation of the relationships of the individual to those institutions that affect him, including education, the workplace, and citizenship. It is suggested that to create an environment hospitable to true life-long  learning, the relationships between learning and working and serving must be redrawn in such a way that the individual can gain more from all three activities and see that the three activities are not necessarily unrelated. The need is also cited to rethink the methods of teaching general or liberal arts education and to relate this type of learning to the acquisition of specific competencies or skills. (LBH)",

The study reveals a current (1975) shortage for all types of engineers as well as a considerable long-term shortage to 1983 because of the probable response to the energy crisis. The greatest need, numerically, will be for electric-electronics engineers, mechanical engineers, industrial engineers, and chemical engineers. There will also be a marked increase in demand for highly specialized types, such as energy production, biomedical, health systems, and aquaculture. The long-term decline in the number of college-age youth projected here indicates a severe and deepening shortage of trained engineers unless  currently undertapped populations, such as women and minorities, are recruited. Some consideration is also given to the problem of obsolescence and the possible role that industry and the schools of engineering may play in reducing it. Recommendations are made for (1) encouraging more students to major in engineering, (2) placing more emphasis on in-service and continuing education to avoid obsolescence and upgrade personnel quality, and (3) not building more classrooms but making more funds available to upgrade teaching and lab equipment.

A six-stage decision making flow chart is provided; the six stages then explained and elaborated. The six stages are: define all realistic options; eliminate certain options because of lack of interest; define financial pass-fail criteria; determine financial feasibility of all remaining options; test sensitivity of results to basic assumptions. A financial flow chart is also included. It is suggested that similar flow charts be constructed for other decision making areas related to cable television, such as who shall operate the system.

Disadvantages are that it is transitory, inflexible, often presents an alien perspective, is structured linearly, is expensive and is limited by its logistics. It is concluded that film is best for general information, motivation, orientation, and some kinds of teaching, and less satisfactory for messages that require detailed, long-term retention of specific facts or procedures.

        "description":"An experiment was conducted to study how children, aged 10-15 years, learn concepts relevant to computer programing and how they learn modern programing languages. The implicit educational goal was to teach thinking strategies through the medium of programing concepts and their applications. The computer languages Simper and Logo were chosen because they are computationally general, relatively easy to learn, interactive with powerful editing features, and are highly dissimilar. The experiment included significant tutoring, curriculum design, and various special output devices such as graphic displays, robots, electric trains, and sound synthesizers. The report is divided into six major sections: (1) introduction: background and motivation; (2) programing facilities; (3) student  selection, grouping and tutoring; (4) curricula; (5) data acquisition and analysis; and (6) results. Among the results were suggested modifications to both the Simper and Logo languages and to the curriculum designed to teach them. (KKC)",

Topics are the young people's pattern of exposure to television, the nature of their viewing experience, the way they respond to television, and the direct effects on their values, attitudes and behavior. Research on the influence of television violence on aggressive and anti-social behavior is discussed at length; it is concluded that violent television entertainment increases the probability of subsequent aggressive behavior on the part of children and youth. The question of what, if any, action should be based on these findings is also discussed. (SK)",

The long range goal of the project is to make available meaningful information for the evaluation and improvement of local public libraries. Two immediate objectives are to test the Public Library Association (PLA) performance measures manual in a representative sample of Illinois public libraries of various sizes and to teach a sample of library personnel the data collection techniques necessary for applying the PLA performance measures. Since operating expenditures proved to be the significant variable related to library size, public libraries were stratified by operating budget for the four areas of the  state, and a random sample drawn. The LRC staff held six workshops to teach the PLA procedures to staff from the library systems and from the selected public libraries. Trainees were then asked to conduct a three-day performance measures study in their own library, tabulate their data, and send the results to the LRC, along with comments on the manual. When all of the data is received, the LRC will create individual library profiles and establish performance levels for libraries of each budget level. (Author/SL)",

DOG, a decision mathematics game for the purpose of providing an environment for application of mathematical concepts, consists of assignments mostly utilizing matrix algebra but also some calculus, linear programing or free form modeling. It is a simulated environment originally written in BASIC, and now also available in FORTRAN IV. The problems involved in implementing DOG into the undergraduate curricula of the Georgia State University School of Business are discussed. It is concluded that it is possible to successfully introduce computer applications into large multi-section undergraduate courses, but not painlessly. If  only the physical and technical aspects of the problem receive serious attention, then the likely outcome is disaster. Only careful coordination, much support, some sugar coating of the pill, and occasional genteel bullying will assure success. (Author/KKC)",

Clusters of related keyphrases, statement phrases, and distractors form minipools from which the computer generates items for a domain-referenced unit of instruction. Test items can take the form of multiple-choice, true-false, matching, and fill-in questions. A random number generator produces data for test items requiring numerical solutions, and the correct answer is computed from a coded formula so computational subroutines are not required for each test item. This component of computer managed  instruction allows the instructor to key related items in the data minipool to learning resources and to code the resources themselves for inclusion in the data bank. Use of this system for elementary, secondary, or undergraduate courses can facilitate instructional management and result in positive effects on student morale. (CH)",

As part of the study, DIALOG, Lockheed's online reference retrieval system, has been made available to the public through four public libraries in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties in California. The project was inaugurated in August, 1974. For the first year, both terminals and staff training were provided free to participating Libraries. Results of an evaluation of the first year of the project indicate that DIALIB users were for the most part highly educated and asked technical questions relating to their work or study. While the service is fairly expensive, it is reaching a  segment of the population that does not normally use public library reference services. The public has shown a great deal of enthusiasm for DIALIB service. In the second year of the project, users will be billed; the effects of this factor on the use of the system will be studied. The Metro-Teachers College project--a similar effort in New York City is also being studied. (Author/SL)",

The obvious reason for this is the deteriorating financial situation facing libraries of all types. It has become critically important for the future of libraries that librarians become knowledgeable in the contest for the diminishing tax dollar. Although most libraries have seldom been able to claim affluence, their financial situation over the past 10 or 15 years could be characterized as relatively stable and, in some sense, on the ascendance. The situation has now changed. Even library systems like that of Contra Costa County, California, which enjoy community and local government support, are now faced with potential budget reductions. Like  other public agencies, the library must now concretely demonstrate the value of its public services. First, attention must be given to maintaining good relations with the community and with local government officials, while providing the best possible library service. It is also necessary to develop specific performance measures--hard data which will help to prove that the library deserves the tax dollars it receives. (Author/SL)",

The California State University and Colleges (CSUC) consists of 19 very distinct campuses. The problems and solutions of one type of CSUC library are not likely to be those of all CSUC libraries. For example a 1974 survey of microform equipment on all the campuses showed widely different experiences with the same brand of equipment. If one looks at the interval from the time a standard is first suggested until it is approved, one finds that it usually goes through several revisions. For example, in 1969, representatives of the recording industry suggested that there be a uniform coding system for all products  of the music industry; but today, in 1975, the standards have still not been totally accepted. The process of developing standards is necessarily one of compromise; so perhaps the most tangible way librarians can influence the evolution of standards is simply to meet to decide what their needs are, examine what solutions are available, and get whatever consensus is possible.

Six years after its incorporation, OCLC is now mainly in the business of operating a shared cataloging system and producing catalog cards designed to meet the needs of each of its member libraries. OCLC also maintains a union catalog of its member libraries as a byproduct of this service. Its data base grows at the rate of about 1,000 records per day, both Library of Congress (LC) MARC records and the original cataloging done by member libraries. Catalogers in OCLC's member libraries, using their computer display terminals, can call up records in catalog card format by imputing LC number, author, or title. Records can be modified online to meet local  needs. This report further describes OCLC in terms of the basic cataloging process, the system's advantages and disadvantages, and the costs to and responsibilities of participating libraries. Appendixes outline planned OCLC subsystems and LC's MARC and RECON projects. Sample OCLC printouts are included. (Author/SL)",

Functional activities were initially categorized as preliminary studies, reviews, and analyses to determine (1) which library planning efforts were relevant to those of EODD in providing for a range of social services; (2) the data needs and deficiencies of the district library with the object of sharing common socioeconomic  data useful in planning; and (3) economical and effective ways in which EODD can assist the district library in extending services to unserved areas. The initial working period showed that cooperation was successful. Further coordination was strongly recommended, especially with regard to disadvantaged groups, elderly, youth, and poor.

        "description":"Project FREDD was initiated in 1974 as a cooperative effort by library and mental retardation agencies in the Waterbury, Connecticut area. The project utilized a bookmobile to route a special collection of books, media, and games to the mentally handicapped and information on mental retardation to their parents and teachers and to the community. Bookmobile stops were scheduled at special schools, sheltered workshops, and programs sponsored by area associations for the retarded in many local towns. Patrons were allowed to return borrowed materials to their local library. Publicity was provided by letters to the community, by media and magazine coverage, and by the mobility of the project van itself. From the experiences gained during the project period, several recommendations  were made for the continuation of this program or one of similar intent, including types of material which proved to be most popular, the use of the Connecticar system for returning borrowed materials, the scheduling of stops, and the type and size of bookmobile to use. It was concluded that Project FREDD had positive effects in this specialized area of library service. (Author/SL)",

Peircean logical analysis shows that IS may be classified in three parts: pure science, applied science, and technology. The deficiency in the present state of the art is in the pure science, or theoretical portion, of IS which must be developed in order to fully and properly apply the existing technology. The specific nature of the science underlying information technology is semiotics, the science of signs and sign processes, their structure, and their applications to the communication process and information transfer. Long-range research goals should therefore be formed in order to (1) develop a theory of the structure of all categories of signs,  sign systems, and sign processes; (2) investigate the measurable properties of all sign components; (3) explore the basic regularities existing between the measurable properties; (4) develop theories which explain these regularities; (5) investigate the relationship between various information processes and semiotic processes; and (6) develop lab instrumentation with which to carry out the critical experiments in the above areas.

If public libraries could act as the liaison in this transition, perhaps more people would be prepared to lead productive lives after age 65. Public libraries set aside sections for children and young adults but fail to do the same for the elderly. This age group has very little to occupy their time or mind after retirement, and many regress to the point of turning their energy inward, which can result in psychosomatic disorders, death wishes, or depression. This energy could be channeled into continued education, pursuit of a new interest, or interchange of knowledge. The public library could and would be the most logical coordinator of such a program. A bibliography is inserted  at the end of each chapter with a glossary and list of available literature appended. (DS)",

Development of such a pattern depends to a large extent upon a body of fundamental information about the field itself. This foundation is simply not available at present. A broad effort is needed to collect available data, together with development of standardized collection methodologies which can meet critical scrutiny as well as provide the necessary additional comparative and additive information. Increased research and policy study  of the roles and processes of information diffusion into the private sector is also needed. (Author)",

Two components of the environment were studied: (1) training of the adult care-givers to implement materials and, (2) concepts related to the programs and arrangements of the physical environment to increase the likelihood that the child will use material from the program in his everyday behavior. The television program called Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was dubbed to 16mm film; the subjects were children enrolled in the Head Start program. Twenty films were shown in each classroom during the eight-week experimental period.  Play materials relevant to prosocial television were designed to provide cues; books, games, and records devoid of prosocial context were chosen as irrelevant material. Prosocial television produced few behavioral differences from the neutral treatment, but the effects of prosocial television accompanied by relevant play materials varied with classroom structure. The study indicates the usefulness of prosocial television and related curriculum materials in day care and educational programs for young children of the economically disadvantaged. Fifteen statistical tables detail the material used and measurement figures. Suggested neutral materials, film content, and observation of behavior are appended. (Author/DS)",

Average enrollment in California community colleges was 8,772 (median=7,193); the average number of degrees awarded was 687 (median=591). The number of students enrolled per graduate averaged 12.77 (median=12.17), while an average of 78.32 degrees were awarded for every 1,000 students enrolled. Overall, the degrees awarded equalled 7.8 percent of college enrollment; 57.6 percent of the degrees were awarded to males (4.5 percent of college enrollment), and 42.7 percent of the degrees were awarded to females (3.3 percent of college enrollment). Community colleges in California have a variety of emphases and objectives. Some colleges primarily prepare students for transfer  to a four-year college or university, while others dedicate themselves to the vocational needs of students. These data must be interpreted with a recognition of the community college's obligation to fulfill the needs of the adults in the community. Five tables are appended. (Author/NHM)",

In order to identify student attitudes toward a televised child psychology course and assess the quality and rigorousness of the course, a questionnaire was developed and administered to students who watched the course at home on cable television and to those who individually viewed the course at their own pace in the college Learning Resource Center. Students seemed to favor the flexibility of the televised programs in the library to the structured viewing approach over cable television. Over half of those who responded indicated that the amount of work required was about the same as that of other courses, but the degree of pressure was perceived as about the  same or less. Almost 75 percent of those using only the library indicated that they learned the same of less than in other courses, while 65 percent of cable users indicated that they learned the same or more; this is perhaps due to a difference between the perception of the full-time student. Failure to complete the course seemed less attributable to course difficulty than to other, outside pressures on the student. Recommendations are made, and the questionnaire is appended, along with 16 tables of the findings. (NHM)",

        "description":"The nature of the economy in Connecticut--its changing occupational structure and trends of population growth--and the changing pattern of higher education enrollments, particularly increasing enrollments in technical colleges and in relatively new regional community colleges, indicate the need for increased post-high school educational opportunities. Based on an analysis of employment and enrollment trends and community college objectives, this report presents guidelines for the future development of the regional community college system. Six models for providing college facilities and criteria for establishing new community colleges are detailed. Recommendations for new, expanded, or merged facilities are based on application of the criteria to each community college district.  On the basis of first-hand acquaintance of the study team with topography, existing and planned road systems, and other accessibility factors, two areas of location for permanent community college facilities are recommended, and two proposed sites for which legislation has already been enacted are discouraged. An amalgamation of technical colleges with regional community colleges is recommended. Statistical studies of the present community college network, three alternative enrollment projection estimates, and maps are included. (Author/NHM)",

In 17 tables, the authors note the composition of the group by sex, age, and ethnic group; expressed occupational goals; preferred methods for entering an occupation; persons influential in determining career choice; training methods and institutions respondents wished to avoid and reasons for avoidance. The authors attribute negative attitudes toward occupational education to the unrealistic job expectations of minority high school and community college students and blame these aspirations on ineffective  career guidance in the high schools. Students need a minimal understanding of the requirements for educational programs and careers, and of the severity of the competition for the available positions. The authors recommended a once-a-week multi-hour session and year-long credit course for high school seniors to be given at the college. Considering the low influence of teachers and counselors, the course could be given by carefully chosen professional, business, government, and labor leaders; better community and industry relations along with future job placements might be valuable fringe benefits.

Information was gathered on the role the CAC plays in policy-making at Pasadena City College (California). Respondents generally felt that CAC is an important and positive contributor to the college's policy-making process, although improvements, especially in the areas of committee authority, speed, and visibility, need to be implemented. Another questionnaire was developed and administered to 400 Chicano students, faculty, administrators, members of the Chicano recruitment staff, and present and past members of the CAC, in order to measure the  effectiveness and direction of the Chicano Recruitment Project. While viewing present recruiting efforts as effective and positive, respondents felt that a more intensive effort is needed, with increased funding and staff, and more varied recruiting methods. The author provides a model for a Chicano recruitment project, including steps needed to develop a more effective program. In addition, suggestions for the development of more effective CAC operating procedures are presented. A bibliography is included, and the questionnaire results are appended. (NHM)",

        "description":"The community college has become the institution of higher education which implements the American \"open class\" ideology, providing an opportunity for students to learn and advance themselves socially and occupationally. Evaluative research concerning compensatory education programs in the community college indicates that such programs have not been highly successful in welcoming and encouraging those who have a history of failure in traditional schools. Most such programs have dealt solely with erasing cognitive deficiencies, but an effective program must address the affective domain as well. By emphasizing the development of small, cohesive learning groups which have norms of communication and support, and which are open to the distribution of authority and the shared  responsibility for learning, the interactionist approach addresses both cognitive and affective domains. A general theoretical rationale is presented for establishing an interactionist compensatory educational program, by reviewing current programs, and examining the relationship between various affective components and academic performance. Then, a model program is presented, including a step-by-step group development and skill-building design tested and refined in community colleges. A bibliography is appended. (NHM)",

Since two-year colleges are unique institutions with philosophy and goals to justify their separate existence, a more coherent educational approach is needed, identified as &quot;liberal education.&quot; Liberal education seeks not only mastery of bodies of information, but coherence among them, enhancing personal development. The curriculum of a discipline-based social science department was studied by developing a&quot;program-priority-value-matrix.&quot; Three factors were used: (1) program priority; (2) student demand priority; (3) cost per credit hour. The hypothesis that decision-making curriculum managers perpetuate the dichotomy between discipline-based and vocational/technical education was sustained; social science courses had little or no demand/priority in vocational programs.

Although the bibliography focuses on the role of the community college chairperson, a number of documents include references to selection and appointment procedures, the role of the chairperson in the secondary school or four-year college, and items developing out of, and indigeneous to, the two-year college. The major variables in the role of the chairperson are seen to be the chairperson himself, the scope of his  responsibilities, the extent of his authority, his effectiveness, and the perceptions he, his faculty, and his supervisors have of his position. Major problems facing the chairperson are the ambiguity of his role, lack of training and orientation among those who hold the position, confusion about the nature of the position, often created by the advent of collective bargaining, and lack of general support from upper echelon administrators. Present research suggests that the position and nature of the chairperson's role will not change significantly over the next five years. (NHM)",

Numbers of graduates are tallied according to sex, day or evening status, January or June completion, and major. The total number of associate degrees (AA) awarded rose steadily through the first decade of the period, but has declined in the last three years. Likewise, the percent of the total college enrollment receiving the associate degree rose from 5.2 percent in 1962 to a high of 9.4 percent in 1972, but dipped to 6.8 percent in 1975. The number of women receiving degrees overtook the number of men graduates in 1972, and has increased since that time. The percent of June degree recipients has  hovered around the 60 percent mark throughout the period. The percent of evening student graduates rose to a high of 32.7 percent in 1974, but dropped markedly in 1975. About 40 percent of the 1975 graduates completed a two-year occupational major, a figure slightly below the 1974 percentage. In comparison with other California community colleges in 1974, LACC ranked fourth (of 96) in number of AA degrees awarded, and twenty-ninth in ratio of number of degrees to enrollment. (NHM)",

        "description":"Because of its lower cost, cultural integration into the community, non-selective admission requirements, and vocational/technical programs, the two-year college has been seen as a way of enrolling students historically underrepresented in higher education. In comparison to his four-year college counterpart, the two-year college student is from a lower-income family, has parents with less schooling, and ranks lower on scales of academic aptitude. One function of two-year colleges is the rechanneling of student aspirations in line with student abilities and labor market demands. This is accomplished through a persuasive guidance approach which reorients students, most often resulting in the redefinition (cooling-out) of transfer students as terminal, vocational education students.  Even if education as a certifying agent were abandoned in favor of skill training in business and industry, the author contends that the same inequalities which currently prevent equal access to colleges would prevent equality of access to training programs in the private sector. Thus, despite the unsavory implications of &quot;people processing,&quot; the idea of a better fit between educational and occupational spheres is attractive and desirable. (NHM)",

        "description":"Former occupational-technical students were questioned as to their attitudes toward their community college programs. The large majority of respondents rated their overall experience very high, and said they would recommend their college to someone seeking the same program. Social activities, however, were rated quite low. Women and graduates were much more positive about their community college experience than were their male or nongraduate counterparts. Diploma graduates expressed far more positive attitudes than AAS degree or certificate graduates. Of curricular groups, public service students were the most positive, followed closely by health students. Minorities were somewhat more positive than whites. Students rated the quality and value of their preparation in seven  different areas: technical knowledge and understanding, job or learning skills, getting along with people, self-understanding, knowledge about career opportunities, communication skills, and general education. General education received the highest rating, both for quality and current value. Yet, when asked to give their opinion on the balance of general education and technical courses, more than half of the respondents wanted to increase the proportion of technical courses.

Keynote addresses include: (1) a survey of the literature which reflects the present state of the art and points out areas in need of research; (2) critical questions and issues faced by any college attempting to design a staff development program; (3) description of successful staff development programs in large, medium, and small institutions; Discussions of (4) evaluation methods, and (5) the use of consultants; (6) recommendations. One major aspect of the conference was a simulation exercise on staff development designed to provide an experience which would enable the participants to synthesize all they had been hearing from  keynote speakers. Participants were divided into groups, and group reports were prepared and presented. Criteria used in judging programs were based on the assumption that staff development programs should be: developmental, democratic, inclusive, supportive, self-evaluative, self-prescriptive, and wide spectrum. Appended are an annotated bibliography, sample community college staff development programs, a conference registration list, and results of an evaluation questionnaire which was administered to participants.

        "description":"A teacher must confront the issue of whether or not he should disclose his beliefs, and if so, to what extent. Disclosure can easily become advocacy. A review of the literature reveals that self-disclosure quickens learning, but the literature is divided on whether a religion teacher in tax-supported schools should advocate personal teacher self-disclosure and advocacy on their learning, a questionnaire was developed and administered to four Interpersonal Communication classes and one English class. The survey of 87 Fresno City College (California) students showed overwhelmingly that they saw their most effective teachers as being self-disclosing; that they preferred teachers to self-disclosure and, to a lesser extent, advocate a position. An analysis of the responses by age  groups revealed that while both students under 25 and students 25 and over favored teacher self-disclosure and advocacy, the older group did so more strongly. The evidence of this study supports teacher self-disclosure in the classroom, even in religious studies, for both philosophical and educational reasons.

        "description":"Exclusive reliance on objective testing focuses students' attention too narrowly on memorization and rote answers to complex problems. Grades become supreme ends; learning, merely a by-product. Since students learn best when asked to verbalize, analyze, and synthesize their ideas, a grading system was implemented in a social science course at Miami-Dade Community College (Florida) which would encourage analysis and learning from different sources. Students could earn up to five points a week on objective tests, and up to four points a week on written reports. In addition to textbook assignments, students received lists of audio tapes, movies, television documentaries, and articles which could be reviewed. Grading of review was based on the extent the student wrote in his own  words, the care he took in writing, and the way he related material to academic ideas and personal experience. Results of a questionnaire found student attitudes positive toward the course, the grading system, and especially toward the variety of ways points could be earned. Although care must be taken to insure the quality of the outside sources and the reports themselves, the new system adds flexibility to course curriculum, encourages optimism toward success in the course, and focuses attention on understanding rather than memorization of ideas. Extensive tables of data are appended. (Author/NHM)",

A review of the literature indicates that no institution or program has achieved the ideal of participatory resource allocation. A process by which internal participation in resource allocation can be fostered is described for a modified bureaucratic organizational structure, augmented by an extensive joint committee system.

The benefits can be classified into the tangible dollar expenditures of people associated with the college and the intangible benefits of human resources development. Costs often include alteration of neighborhoods and added municipal services. The Institute of Higher Education Research and Services at the University of Alabama recently completed two economic impact studies of two very different colleges in Alabama. One study, completed in May 1974, reported the impact of a private, predominately black, four-year accredited liberal arts college on the economy of an urban area. The other study, completed in August 1974, reported the economic impact of a  public, predominately white, two-year accredited junior college on a rural area (see ED 099 069). This report summarizes and points out some unique aspects of the two studies. In addition, reasons for conducting an economic impact survey, and the procedure for undertaking such a task are briefly discussed. Summary background data about the two institutions are discussed. Data collected for the studies are summarized in 11 areas of impact and are presented in chart form. (Author/NHM)",

Information was derived by an extensive search of the literature. Materials were identified by scanning 34 sets of bibliographic indexes for publications of the past 10 years, along with the catalogues of the UCLA University Library, and by asking association and institutional heads for unreported studies. The preparation sequence leading to a specialized competence is frequently seen as inappropriate for the tasks of teaching in an open-door institution. Holders of doctorate degrees have difficulty in obtaining positions because they are priced  too high. Part-time faculty paid at a relatively low hourly rate are being employed in increasing numbers. But opportunities are opening for constructive inservice training. The major foundations and federal funding agencies are becoming increasingly aware of faculty in these institutions. And, most important, a professional consciousness is developing within the faculty as they form their own subgroups within the major disciplinary organizations and seek to take control of the conditions of their work.

Other results indicated: 52.2 percent of the respondents were against administrators, other than the president, being empowered to bargain independently; 64.3 percent were in favor of negotiations at the local rather than the state level; 75.3 percent were against the  idea of limiting collective bargaining to the traditional economic issues of wages and hours; 54.3 percent favored both collective bargaining and internal governance. Responses were evenly divided on the advisability of a statewide salary schedule for community college faculty.

The project staff, the steering committee, and principal consultants began with the assumption that evaluation can be a valuable and continuous part of program effort, providing critical feedback that will identify and support essential program modifications. Reality-based evaluation (RBE) is described as a three-phase process: (1) clarifying a program's real intent; (2) collecting information on what that program actually does; and (3) interpreting how well it was done and recommending what should be done. Phase I, &quot;Clarification,&quot; results in a management outline, subject to change and based upon the realities of the  program as they are seen. Phase II, &quot;Data Collection,&quot; results in a working plan which implements Phase I objectives. Phase III, &quot;Interpretation,&quot; results in the compilation of evaluation conclusions. Forms paralleling the RBE process phases are provided to facilitate consistent recording of data as it is derived at each procedural step.

A five percent sample of persons in the service area of Central Florida Community College was drawn from the telephone directory; 120 listings were chosen from each of five residential areas: high-income white, middle-income white, low-income white, middle-income black, and low-income black. A telephone survey was then conducted to determine two factors: (1) the number of persons in income/racial groups at each information level, in regard to  vocational education programs; (2) patterns of media use within the income/racial groups. These media use patterns were used to design and implement an information dissemination campaign. A follow-up telephone survey showed a significant positive change in numbers of persons at the various information levels for low-income white and black groups. The sum of the percentage of increase for each information level was 23.6. Thus, 12,500 low-income whites and blacks had increased levels of information.

Transportation emerged as the greatest need. Because information clearinghouses would maximize coordination of services, their development was also given high priority. Other priorities established were  provision of informal learning experiences relevant to daily living for older adults, including pre-retirement planning, leisure time activities, and the involvement of older adults in volunteer roles. The need for in-service training of persons serving older adults in these areas was also recognized.

One such effort involved the development and distribution of two comprehensive curriculum guides for governmental management and instructional associate programs by the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office. In order to communicate this curriculum information to community colleges, delineate the scope of the public service occupations designation, and encourage the implementation of such programs, seven workshops were held in northern and southern California in 1974 and 1975. This document describes workshop outcomes by theme: (1) Instructional Aide/Associate Workshops; (2) Governmental Management Workshops; (3) Public  Service Occupations Workshops. Each of the workshops followed a similar procedure: first, programmatic need was established; then, after identifying necessary program content, guidelines were given for program implementation. Analysis of evaluation questionnaires administered to participants reveals that although the workshops were successful in defining the scope of and need for public service occupations programs, workshops did not result in the conception of a need for the evolution of a distinct department or section to house all public service occupations courses or curricula.

Of 321 subjects, 219 responded (68 percent). Twenty-two counseling functions were rated in terms of the extent to which they were actually being performed, should ideally be performed, or were useful. Data are recorded in tabular form. As evidenced by a strong increase in the response tendency between the real and ideal categories, a need for improvement was perceived for every function except providing marriage counseling, which all groups perceived as unnecessary. Where significant  differences occurred between group responses, administrators and counselors collectively tended to disagree with the other groups. Although faculty and students saw the usefulness of all counseling functions except marriage counseling, counselors did not consider registration assistance, student screening, and providing information on students to the college useful. A review of the literature is included, and a bibliography is appended. (NHM)",

Twenty faculty members, five low-income and minority students, and five representatives of local low-income and minority communities participated in the 18 sessions (two per month) of this institute. The first half of each session was devoted to a presentation by a guest lecturer; the second half involved participants in discussions of how the content of the presentation could be applied to DJC. This report of the  institute is intended to assist other community and junior colleges in planning and carrying out similar institutes. It details the participant selection an institute planning processes and the physical setting, as well as the outline for each session.

        "description":"The \"open-door\" policy of community colleges has resulted in the three interrelated problems of student recruitment, student retention, and student placement. In order to identify and analyze factors which cause the separation of \"new\" students from the community college, a one-day seminar was conducted at Southern University in May of 1973. Keynote addresses dealt with the impact of faculty on student retention and the importance of curriculum. A summary is made of positive and negative impacts of compensatory instruction in 18 community colleges with such programs. The meeting of \"new\" students' non-academic needs greatly determines their academic performance. Retention will not be achieved within the rigidities of the traditional academic system, but change need not mean a  lowering of standards. Rather, what is needed is a change in attitudes toward persons who, regardless of backgrounds, wish to find their places in a contemporary society which is polycultural and heterogeneous rather than class-oriented and somewhat homogeneous. Colleges must keep curriculum requirements flexible and responsive to the needs of those concerned. Not only should revisions be continual, but everyone concerned, including students, should be involved. Appended are the observations of discussion groups and a list of participants. (NHM)",

Conference participants were drawn from each of three sectors: community colleges, graduate schools of arts and sciences, and university schools of education. The conference was organized around 11 commissioned papers which make up the bulk of this volume. Participants addressed the issues raised in these papers during conference sessions, which grouped the papers according to: (1) current trends within community colleges that have created the concern for staff development; (2) responses to staff development needs, including responses in \"non-traditional\" settings; and (3)  perspectives of graduate faculty, deans, and schools of education. Although conference participants agreed that improved university programs for community college staff development are needed, the practical questions of how to develop, administer, and finance such programs were left open. It is clear, however, that problems of staff development will require cooperative approaches involving both the university and the community college. The necessary resources for successful programs are present in the two institutions, not in either one alone. (NHM)",

This section serves as an overview of the community college movement and as a summary of the changing profile of college students and the various factors which may lead to shifts in enrollment distribution. Section two examines the distribution of enrollment in New York City Community Colleges, the curriculum preferences of students, the geographic origin of students, the grade  distribution of students, and credit hour attrition within the academic semester. The final section projects the Colleges into the immediate years ahead. The findings in this report support the general recommendation that expanded institutional efforts be directed to the development of non-traditional educational programs in all units of the Colleges and to the recruitment of non-traditional students. Major problems associated with institutional growth are discussed, and recommendations are drawn pertaining to college organization and financial support. (Author/NHM)",

(3) Determination of the market demand for graduates in a specific field. This phase involves sampling the population of  employers and organizations in the district and then conducting follow-up studies. (4) Validation of market analysis surveys.

This report focuses on the preliminary phase of the program, the recruitment process. Through structured, open-ended interviews, information was gathered from three groups of program participants: the planning staff, junior high school guidance counselors, and students. Interview data were supplemented by systematic observation of the recruiting and planning processes. It was found that most guidance counselors received their  information about the program from a personal representative of the program, usually the director or a staff member. Students learned about the program primarily from their guidance counselors. Counselors and planners alike viewed the program as a means to \"redeem\" marginal students, and motivate them to remain in formal education. Initial perceptions of the benefits of the program included: (1) better articulation between high school and college; (2) an atmosphere conducive to learning; (3) small classes/remediation; (4) positive peer influences; (5) vocational education.

During the 1974-75 academic year, two participant observers made over 400 observations of the Middle College's activities, focusing on: (1) instructional methods, materials, and content; (2) incentives and rewards; (3) failure management; (4) counseling patterns; (5) discipline in the classroom; and (6) LaGuardia-Middle College interface. Findings of the study revealed that students expected primarily academic advantages from the program. After a half year in the program, however, social advantages were seen as most important. Faculty expectations of professional growth were fulfilled due to greater  academic freedom and the opportunity for personalized relationships. Although the majority of those questioned agreed on the general success of the program, it was felt that the small size of the program, rather than the college setting, was responsible for increased learning. The emphasis and effectiveness of basic skill instruction, as implemented, appeared to rank behind the size, setting, and counseling remedial components. There was some feeling that students were abusing the school's lenient attendance policy; however, any proposed policy change was rejected as potentially damaging to the atmosphere of the school.

An examination of the needs of the adult learner indicates that as the years past age 18 increase, the appropriateness of the classic college classroom model decreases, and educational technology becomes increasingly relevent. This report summarizes 22 major recommendations which have arisen from a one year exploration of the issues involved in the development of a metropolitan learning resources service for the Chicago region, along with a parallel improvement of media services for the multi-campus City Colleges of Chicago. It is urged that a council of professional educational technologists from the Chicago metropolitan region be assembled which would analyze  the needs of adult learners expressed in recent surveys in Illinois and elsewhere, and develop strategies for meeting individualized instruction needs on and off-campus from the standpoint of educational technology. In order to initiate a prototype of a metropolitan learning resources service, it is recommended that one or more existing institutions offer their services to others with the understanding that the nucleus service group would be compensated directly or in kind for services rendered, and that a users advisory board would be formed.

Cooperation between community schools and community colleges in community education efforts should result in less duplication of effort, expanded use of facilities, better use of tax dollars, improved instruction, expanded programs, and better services. The community college's role in this cooperative effort is: (1) to support and encourage the community school; (2) to work closely with the coordinators in the various communities and offer assistance to them; (3) to offer college classes in the local school districts where there are no community schools; (4) to help coordinate a needs  assessment in a community where there is no community school program; (5) to set up a curriculum for training community school coordinators or directors; and (6) to offer counseling facilities to high schools and the community at large. During the 1974-75 academic year, Clackamas Community College (Oregon) found such a cooperative program economically and educationally sound.

The Metropolitan Achievement Test in Reading was used for pre- and posttest comparisons of achievement, and a questionnaire on student attitudes was administered at the end of the school year. Radical differences in the kinds of children assigned to either modified open or traditional classrooms presented serious problems in data analysis. Children had been previously selected for inclusion in a particular classroom setting on the basis of scholarship and ability to adjust (slow learners and non-English speaking children were assigned to traditional  classrooms). Therefore, a wide discrepancy was found in pretest reading ability. Also, the total number of children in the modified open classrooms greatly exceeded that of the traditional classrooms. Statistical modifications (described in detail) were made in an effort to cope with these population problems. Results indicated: (1) there were no significant differences in expected reading achievement gains for any group, and (2) there were no significant differences in pupil attitudes.

Each of 12 chapters is concerned with successive months in a child's first year and is divided into three sections. Specific stimulating activities (i.e., handing toys to the infant's alternate hands) which parents can do with their infants are suggested and illustrated with photographs. Detailed instructions and diagrams are included for the construction of toys made from household materials. A brief discussion of an infant's expected developmental progress in each month is found in each chapter. A sample form for recording an infant's initial motor, sensory, social, and language achievements is provided. Throughout the  booklet, parents of infants are encouraged to promote confidence and exploration by providing successful and pleasant experiences. (BRT)",

        "description":"This study attempted to determine whether the mental test performance of 77 children tested at 6, 12, and 36 months of age could be predicted from scores on an Inventory of Home Stimulation used to assess the children's home environment during their infancy. The Inventory of Home Stimulation had six subscales: (1) emotional and verbal responsivity of the mother, (2) avoidance of restriction and punishment, (3) organization of the physical and temporal environment, (4) provision of appropriate play materials, (5) maternal involvement with the child, and (6) opportunities for variety in daily stimulation. This inventory was used to assess home environments when children were 6, 12 and 24 months of age. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development were used to measure mental performance  when children were 6 and 12 months old; the Stanford-Binet scale was used when they were 36 months old. Correlations of the home inventory scores with Stanford-Binet scores were generally higher than those reported in an earlier study by McCall et al, which related infant tests and parental educational level to childhood IQ. It was concluded that the Inventory has the potential for use in the differential diagnosis of strengths and weaknesses in an infant's environment. (Author)",

The children were enrolled in a program designed to develop their readiness skills. Family income, limited educational opportunities of adult members of the family, and dependency on public assistance were determinants of qualification for the program. The Pupil Evaluation Measure (PEM) was based on program objectives expressed in Piagetian terms. Each of nine tasks was designed to measure progress towards a more abstract level of cognitive development. Teacher assistants administered PEM to each child 5 times during the school year. Comparisons between October and June test results showed an increase in the proportion of  students performing above the semiconcrete/semiabstract level on all nine PEM tasks. Appendices include graphs of PEM scores from the entire year, average pre- and post-test scores on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Tests given the children, and procedures for administering and scoring the PEM.

It is suggested that greater knowledge in these areas would allow policy makers to better consider the consequences of laws concerning adoption, disposition of minors in divorce cases, child abuse or neglect, foster care, and parental rights. It is argued that too often judges and agency workers are forced to make decisions affecting the lives of children on the basis of intuition alone. Developmental psychologists are called upon to aid in making the juvenile justice system more sophisticated and more likely to  serve the best interests of children. It is suggested that many courts and child welfare agencies would be willing to work with behavioral scientists in carrying out the needed research. (BRT)",

        "description":"Sex differences in children's reactions to failure feedback in school situations were investigated by assessing the ways in which teachers use negative evaluation in the classroom. Three aspects of teachers' evaluative feedback were studied: (1) ratio of negative to positive feedback; (2) contingency vs. noncontingency of feedback; and (3) (the major aspect) the particular aspects of performance upon which negative evaluation was contingent. In 5 fourth and fifth grade classrooms, every contingent evaluative statement made by the teacher was classified according to the class of behaviors upon which it was contingent (conduct, intellectual quality of academic performance, or intellectually irrelevant aspects of academic performance). Feedback was also classified according to the  reason for failure (lack of motivation, lack of ability, or other external factors). Boys and girls received virtually the same proportions of positive and negative evaluation for the intellectual quality of their work. However, there were striking sex differences in the contexts in which negative evaluations were given. Implications of these results were discussed in terms of teachers' evaluations of their students, differences in teachers' attitudes towards boys and girls, and sex differences in children's own achievement expectations and ability assessments. Some suggestions for consistent uses of negative evaluation in the classroom are included. (Author/ED)",

Subjects were 102 children, 3-5 years of age, enrolled in preschools or day care centers. Children were asked to select their favorite toy from a set of six photographs. They were then shown one of four photographs of another, same-sex child (boy or girl in regular chair or boy or girl in wheelchair). Children were told that toy preferences of the pictured child were either similar of disimilar to their own, or they were told nothing concerning toy preferences. While viewing the photographs, subjects were  asked questions designed to determine their (1) affinity for the photographed child; (2) assessment of the child's ability; and (3) perception of the attitudes of their parents, teachers, or friends towards the subject's playing with the photographed child. Subjects shown disabled children were also questioned to determine their comprehension of disability. Results indicated that a shift from lack of understanding of disability to understanding occurs between 3 and 4 years of age; but that understanding of a disability does not produce the negative attitudes towards the disabled that are found in older children.

One question considered was whether early child stimulation could have continuing effects as children reached school age. Subjects were healthy babies from indigent families whose mothers agreed to be visited once a week and to work with the parent educator. She also had to allow her child to go to the home learning center twice a week. The first two years of experimental treatment consisted of weekly home visits, some educational and some just &quot;friendly.&quot; In the third  year, intervention consisted of weekly home visits and experience in a group setting twice a week. Results of intensive testing of the subjects at age six showed that the intervention had long-term positive effects on the children. The most effective results were achieved with those children who were in the program continuously from age three months through three years. It was suggested that sustained gains resulted from changes in maternal attitudes and feelings about education, about the child, and about themselves. (Author/BRT)",

The first experiment involved a task which eliminated the usual spatial and representational components of the classic 3-mountain task, but provided conflicting visual experiences for subject and experimenter. The second experiment was designed to examine the child's ability to choose a representation of his own view and views of the experimenter when the experimenter was seated opposite and to the side of the child. Task variables and types of errors were investigated. Also,  response latencies were measured to check whether responses on task were meaningful or indiscriminate. Results indicate that the young child's difficulty on traditional perspective-taking tasks is related to his lack of an integrated Euclidean spatial system and not to a lack of awareness that others have different visual perspectives.

Subjects were 20 male and 20 female children, half of each sex being reared primarily at home and half primarily in day care. Each child was observed with his mother in an experimental setting for a total of 16 minutes in 4 conditions, with mother sitting far from (3-4 meters) or near to (1 meter) tethered toys and facing so that she could or could not see the toys. The child's physical position and behavior along several modalities were recorded at 2- second intervals. Findings suggest that 2-year-olds are aware of the mother's activities and that if contact with the mother is reduced children will initiate behaviors to reestablish that contact.  Reduction in visual accessibility of the mother appears to be as important as reduction in proximity. These findings are related to others which stress the centrality of eye-contact in the attachment relationship. (Author/GO)",

The subjects were 20 infants, 10 boys and 10 girls, 7 and 8 months of age. Each infant was visited twice when both parents were at home. All visits were made by the same two persons: a male observer, who maintained a narrative account of infant and adult behaviors and a female visitor, who provided an alternative interactive partner for the child. Comparisons were made between the frequencies of affiliative- and attachment behaviors (including smiling, looking, vocalizing, reaching, approaching, and seeking to be held) which were directed by the infant toward each adult. Results of multivariate analyses showed a significant preference by infants for their fathers  over their mothers and the visitor, and for their mothers over the visitor. When data were compared on the individual measures, neither parent emerged as a preferred attachment object but there was far more affiliative type interaction with father than mother. It was noted that fathers also engaged in more physically stimulating and unpredictable games. The author suggests that the prominence of play in the father-infant relationship helps to make the father a person with whom interaction is pleasurable, varied, and unpredictable. (Author/BRT)",

Each child was observed with a time sampling method for approximately 50 minutes over three nonconsecutive days. The observer, who was not aware that sex was a relevant variable, rated the children's play behavior with regard to its focus and context. The focus was categorized as being directed toward people, objects, or other and the context as being solitary, parallel, associative, or cooperative play. The mean scores on focus and context were summed to form a single  index of People versus Object Orientation. The results showed no differences between boys and girls on People versus Object Orientation or on either of the component measures of focus or context. One minor difference between the sexes was that the most object-oriented and the most people-oriented children tended to be boys, while most girls tended to divide their attention fairly evenly between people and objects.

A total of 24 infants between 5 and 6 weeks of age were divided into three groups and given pretest to show that they had no initial preference for either of two stimuli, which differed in complexity. Next, all infants were given some familiarization with one of the stimuli, followed by a posttest on both stimuli. During the familiarization period, the three groups were treated differently: each of two groups was familiarized with either the complex or simple stimulus, and the  third group was familiarized with the complex stimulus, but allowed only half as many familiarization trials. Results indicate that: (1) 5-week-old infants do habituate to visual stimuli, (2) previous failures to demonstrate habituation were due to stimulus and procedural limitations, and (3) preference for novelty is found following attainment of individual habituation criterion, while preference for familiarity is found following a period of familiarization too short to permit attainment of such a criterion.

        "description":"This study investigated children's performance with the passive-transformation when both the mode of presentation and the mode of response were verbal. The study was also designed to provide a framework for the examination of theoretical issues regarding strategies in speech perception. Kindergarten and first-grade children individually heard 6 sentences all in the same voice and all either harmonious with or contrary to children's previously expressed expectations regarding the likely actor in the sentences. After each sentence the child heard a question about the content of the sentence. The score for each child was the number of questions answered correctly. Results of this study support the hypothesis that children do not rely exclusively on any single sentence processing  strategy. Instead, they combine their knowledge of the world, of words, and of language in the perception of speech. The results also indicate that an exclusively verbal mode of presentation and response is quite difficult for children. (Author/GO)",

        "description":"This paper discusses the need for innovative research paradigms in assessing the impact of television on children. Past research has shown that television, as part of a child's environment, can influence the social behavior of young children in positive and negative ways. It is suggested that researchers now study ways in which children's programing can become a medium which interacts with the child, performing a type of &quot;surrogate&quot; function. It is also suggested that effective programing would allow the child to learn about himself in relation to what he sees on television, leading to growth in self concept and self esteem. One such television program for children, &quot;Fat Albert and The Cosby Kids&quot; is presented as an example of an attempt to look at issues, problems and concerns  faced by children as they grow and develop. A study which investigated the Fat Albert series to determine to what extent the prosocial messages of the program were communicated to children found that almost nine out of ten children (89.3 percent) received one or more specific prosocial messages from viewing an episode of Fat Albert. The findings do not indicate whether the messages were accepted or if they modified subsequent behavior. Research models and methodologies aimed at improving the theory and evaluation of television as it relates to the child are called for. (BRT)",

        "description":"This paper describes an on-going research program focused on the development of attention in children with specific reference to the strategies and patterns of activities which children use in seeking information and in directing and controlling their own attention. Findings from three earlier studies suggest that older children are better able than younger children to select only relevant information, to remember only potentially relevant information, and to shift quickly from selecting one type of relevant information to another. These findings provided evidence of a developmental trend towards more flexible, efficient strategies of attention. This evidence, together with the conceptualization of attention as the selectivity which characterizes a variety of cognitive  activities, suggests general questions regarding the formulation of attention development. More is known of environmental factors which are related to children's attention than is known about the way children control and direct their own attention. Little is known about the ways in which one's own behavior controls what one attends to. At present, attempts are being made to identify developmental trends in search strategies. Instances in which young children are more accurate than adults (as in the Stoop effect) show that adults are not universally more accurate, flexible, and efficient attenders than children. The development of search strategies is being studied by asking children to engage in search activities which simulate search as it occurs ordinarily, by asking about children's  discovery and use of redundant information in this search task, and by employing tasks which dictate two distinct search strategies.

The paper describes three studies designed to determine the extent to which first, second and third grade children use outcome and norm cues to make judgments about ability, effort, and task difficulty attributions. The results of the 3 studies indicate clear developmental differences in the use of achievement-related information in making evaluative judgments. In addition, it appears that social norm information was not used predictably even by second and third graders, though outcome information was.

The 195 children (187 black, 8 white) who participated in the study ranged in age from approximately 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 years, and were randomly selected from compensatory education programs for preschool children of migrant workers in Florida. In order to insure that the characteristics examined were of an affective nature, a cognitive ability measure was used as a covariate to remove achievement variance due to the child's cognitive  ability. Tests used to determine the characteristics in question are explained in detail. Results indicated: (1) self concept accounted for a significant percentage of achievement variance for both boys and girls; (2) self concept, delay of gratification, and motor inhibition accounted for a significant percentage of variance for boys but not for girls; and (3) risk taking was related to school readiness for girls but not boys. It is suggested that future program planning take these sex differences into account. (Author/ED)",

The data included 44 groups of subjects obtained from 36 studies in which Piagetian and intelligence tests were administered to intellectually normal children (mean IQ=109) from the preoperational through formal operational periods (40 to 216 months of age). Results revealed that averaged correlations between Piagetian tests and MA were consistently higher than the corresponding correlations for IQ and CA. The mean age of the subjects and no effect on the size of correlations between Piagetian tests and IQ, MA and CA, but  the size of the age range was found to significantly affect the IQ and CA correlations (Piagetian tests/IQ correlations were higher within a narrow age range; Piagetian tests/CA correlations were higher within a wide age range; Piagetian tests/MA correlations showed no effect for size of age range). It was concluded that MA scores yield higher and more consistent correlations with Piagetian tests than either IQ or CA scores, and are not affected by the age range or mean age of the subjects sampled.

Three possible procedures are proposed and illustrated in a study of interactions between mothers and their 8- to 18-month-old children. The first strategy is to operationalize complex concepts and define loose constructs behaviorally and quantitatively (e.g. maternal responsiveness.) The second general research strategy is to analyze static complexity. It is suggested that a wide range of variables be measured in the same investigation and that rather than computing individual correlations between variables, multivariate statistical analyses should be performed. This method of analysis would serve to  uncover broad patterns of behavior which would more likely reflect the complexity of human nature. The third general research strategy suggested involves examining behavior patterns and mother-child relations as they change over time. This strategy calls for a longitudinal design and the use of cross-lagged panel correlation. (BRT)",

The results indicated that, for the middle class group, many of the variables measured at home were significantly correlated with later scores on cognitive  tests. Although fewer correlations were significant for the working class group, most were in the same direction as for the middle class group. Analysis of the laboratory data and the scores on the cognitive tests revealed a highly consistent set of correlations between early attachment measures and later test scores, especially for the middle class group.

        "description":"This manual uses charts and outlines to present a kindergarten program based on the theory that learning is developmental and continuous. The program's integrated subject approach is aimed at enabling children to develop communication skills, intellectual abilities, a positive self-image, and academically appropriate psychomotor skills. These four general goals are outlined in terms of specific behavioral objectives. A working draft of suggested approaches to achieving the stated objectives forms the largest portion of the manual. It includes descriptions of teaching/learning strategies for each objective, organizational alternatives (learning centers, teacher-aide teams, or a combination of the two) and evaluation processes (initial and follow-up assessment tasks for each  objective, and guidelines for communicating with parents and maintaining progress records). Appendices to this section of the manual provide further information on planning; reading instruction; use of learning materials and activities such as beads, blocks, tools, and field trips; use and interpretation of the draw-a-man test; and a sample progress report form. A final section offers suggestions for selecting and ordering appropriate classroom equipment and consumable and nonconsumable materials sufficient for a class of 25 students. (ED)",

        "description":"This paper describes the production of three 30-second prosocial television spots and the evaluation of the effects of these spots on children's behavior. The psychological process of observational learning was used to conceptualize the way television viewing influences children's behavior; the three stages of observational learning (exposure, acquisition, and acceptance) served as guides for the production and evaluation phases of this project. Five major principles were followed in planning the content for these spots: (1) the same theme was presented in all three spots, (2) situations were chosen to optimize immediate recognition and understanding by child viewers, (3) physical action was emphasized, (4) verbal statements were used to complement action and explicate both the  conflict and solution, and (5) the positive consequences of the behavior to be modeled was accentuated. The rationale and research evidence to support the use of each of these principles was given. The spots were evaluated for the attraction they held for youngsters (exposure), the clarity with which they conveyed the intended message (acquisition), and the overt changes they produced in attitudes and behavior (acceptance). It was concluded that the approach described in this paper was a viable model for the production and evaluation of the whole range of television programming for children. (JMB)",

        "description":"This study examined the effects of heavy versus light television viewing on the degree to which children possess sex role stereotypes. Reference was made to content analyses of children's television programs, prime time dramatic programs, and commercials, to show that traditional sex role stereotypes are present in most aspects of television programming. It was thus assumed that children who watched more television would acquire greater knowledge of sex role stereotypes. A TV program checklist was used with children in grades K, 2, 4 and 6 and their parents, to determine the amount of time the children spent watching television. Those who watched 10 hours or less per week were categorized as low TV watchers and those who watched 25 hours or more were categorized as high TV  watchers. A total of 80 children (5 boys and 5 girls in each category from each grade level) participated in the study. Each child was given Brown's It test to measure his or her sex-typed toy or activity preference. High TV watchers made significantly higher scores in the It test than low TV watchers, suggesting that TV viewing plays an important role in children's acquisition of sex typing. An attempt to measure longitudinal changes in followup testing one year later did not produce the expected results due to ceiling effects on the It test. Another sex stereotype measure was described and suggested for use in future research. (JMB)",

The findings reflected outcomes expected from the educational component. Test scores for the experimental children were compared to national norms on the Preschool Inventory (PSI) and Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) and to scores for groups of Home Start children tested prior to their enrollment in Home Start programs in other communities. Descriptions of procedures used included information on tester training, instrument adaptations, testing  problems, and validity. Data were subanalyzed by group, rural/urban setting, sex, and age. Scores of PCC children were somewhat better on a majority of items than either national norms or scores of the Home Start comparison group, especially on questions dealing with labelling, concept formation, shapes, and colors. Groups showed minimal differences on the DDST. Overall conclusions indicated that PCC seemed to have an impact on the children enrolled, though the evidence is not statistically strong. (ED)",

        "description":"This study provides a historical setting for the current interest in preschool education by examining the assumptions and efforts of educators and politicians involved in establishing preschool programs in Boston during the 1830's. Parallels are drawn between the early education experiments detailed here and those undertaken recently, in order to provide a basis for evaluating current problems and establishing future directions. The main concern of the study is the dynamics of the interaction of Boston social elites, educational theorists, public school officials, and a larger body of civic-minded supporters of the schools as revealed in diaries, public and infant school records, and the social data of Boston and Concord from the period. The history of the development, impact,  and demise of these early experiments is examined by describing the influence of English social reform precedents on the founding of American infant schools in the mid 1820's, the character and objectives of the early infant schools in Boston, and the conflict over educational assumptions which eventually led to the decline and collapse of support for preschool education by the 1840's. These early efforts apparently were forgotten by the time the kindergarten movement began in the 1860's. Some conclusions are drawn concerning the shifts in attitudes toward early childhood education in the nineteenth century. (ED)",

Learning how to be a parent does not appear to be a routine part of the growing-up process today. Therefore, in order to maximize the essential early development of children, parenthood training becomes increasingly important. People can be taught to become effective parents by teaching them about child growth and development. It is suggested that this training should take place in the secondary school since this is often the last formal education many young citizens will receive. Several existing programs which train people to become informed parents are described. Additional programs are needed through which parent education and child  development services could be delivered to communities through neighborhood schools. (BRT)",

In addition, separate analyses are presented for whites and racial minorities and for South and nonsouth regions (since analysis is limited to those counties having at least 250 racial minority residents and since 2/3 of these are located in the South, the analysis of national level nonmetropolitan data is heavily weighted by southern counties). This analysis indicates that when compared with growing nonmetropolitan counties, the declining nonmetropolitan counties have: (1) a deficit of working age population; (2) a higher proportion of dependent age groups; (3) a lower median  educational attainment among the minority population; (4) a lower rate of female participation in the labor force (33.7% vs 37.9%); (5) a lower median family income ($6,546 vs $8,027); (6) less employment in manufacturing (23.1% vs 26.9%); (7) a higher than average amount of employment in low-wage/low-skill extractive industries (20.1% vs 6.5%); and (8) a higher percentage of families whose income falls below the poverty line.

The variables employed were: occupational and educational aspiration (dependent); father's and mother's education and father's occupation (exogenous); and high school grade point average,  educational encouragement (parental, teacher, and peer), and peer modeling behavior (intervening). Results indicated that peer modeling influence had the strongest effects on aspirations when contrasted to other forms of significant-other influence. The impact of peer modeling behavior on aspirations was found to be singificantly greater in rural than urban communities, while an opposite residential trend was observed for parental influence.

        "description":"In an effort to understand the dynamics of the status attainment process, the effects of significant-other influences were analyzed in terms of sexual and racial differences. Data were derived from a proportionate, stratified, random cluster sample of Louisiana high school seniors. High schools were stratified on the basis of residence (urban/rural), school type (public/parochial), race (black/white), and size of senior class (less than 100, 100-500, and over 500). Group administered questionnaires provided responses for: 1,175 white males; 287 black males; 1,168 white females; and 390 black females. The variables employed were: father's and mother's education and father's occupation (exogenous); high school grade point average, educational encouragement (parental, teacher, and  peer), and peer modeling behavior (intervening); and educational and occupational aspiration (dependent). Results indicated that: (1) school performance and peer modeling were the most important variables in the formation of career aspirations of all respondents, regardless of race/sex criteria; (2) peer influence was a modeling influence for black and white youth of both sexes; and (3) mother's education influenced black and white female aspirations, while school performance and peer modeling significantly influenced male aspirations.

        "description":"The Clinton County (New York) Community Development Center (CDC) system was examined to determine its appropriateness for Cooperative Extension Services. Nine active CDC's were investigated via personal interviews and report review to assess CDC scope, activities, audiences, successes, failures, local government support, and potentials. Emphasizing the necessity for a systematic flow of information, findings indicated that successful CDC's should make provisions for: (1) definitive goals and objectives; (2) evaluation of objectives; (3) the director's role, employment guidelines, and pre-job and on-job training; (4) decisions about CDC policy making and implementation; (5) CDC location and facility availability; and (6) CDC relationship and coordination with other centers,  community organizatns, and extra-community agencies. It was concluded that Cooperative Extension could provide CDC with support and leadership via: (1) record keeping, reporting to town officials, and publicity; (2) educational provisions for middle class families in addition to established low income educational provisions; (3) educational provisions for CDC directors (a 16 week course on decision making, supervision, etc.); (4) provision for systematic performance evaluation; and (5) assistance in extended involvement of community volunteers to facilitate CDC communications.

        "description":"In replication of other studies, the natural decrease of Texas population was examined in terms of the effect of migration and fertility. Utilizing Texas and U.S. vital statistics and the 1970 U.S. Census of Population, Texas population trends were analyzed for the 1968-72 period by dividing the 254 Texas counties into: (1) 65 natural decrease counties (those registering more deaths than births); (2) 132 low natural increase counties (those below the state average); (3) 57 high natural increase counties (those above the state average). Findings indicated natural decrease counties: (1) were smaller; (2) consituted less than 6% of the population; (3) were primarily rural; (4) experienced net-in-migration gains in 18 of the 65 counties; (5) had a population with an average median  age of 41.1 years; (6) had a low proportion of Spanish-speaking population; (7) had a lower fertility level than the increase counties, but had a level above replacement levels. It was concluded that: (1) the presence of Spanish-speaking populations influenced fertility differentials, since counties with large Spanish populations experienced high levels of natural increase in spite of high levels of out-migration because of high fertility; and (2) migration trends for longer time intervals and by age should be examined to determine the effect of migration on age structure and natural decrease.

Farmworkers were defined as persons 14 years and over in the civilian noninstitutional population who performed farm wagework at some time during 1973, even if only for one day. Data were obtained in December 1973 from the annual Hired Farm Working Force survey conducted as a supplementary part of the Current Population Survey. Approximately 45,000 households were interviewed during this month. This sample was drawn from 461 areas including 923 counties and independent cities, with coverage in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Among the findings were: (1) only 4.4% of  the employed Spanish origin population were engaged in agricultural work as farmers, farm managers, laborers, and foremen; (2) approximately 13% of the total 2.7 million persons in the farm working force were of Spanish origin, 14% were Blacks and others; (3) Spanish origin farmworkers were an older group of workers; and (4) within the Spanish origin farm labor force, a larger proportion was migratory compared with other ethnic groups.

The 1st section of this report is devoted to an analytic framework for intersystem interaction which entails a donor/recipient construct designed to achieve intersystem diplomacy by taking account of all professional, human, administrative, and political components in each system. The concepts of an international elite and a superiority syndrome are also presented in this section. Section 2 presents an analytic framework for rural development (defined in terms of underdevelopment, overdevelopment, and balanced development cycles as measured by utilization of resources),  and presentation is made of a rural development model which describes 8 major components and their linkage systems, providing for: (1) analysis of the effect of a component change; (2) evaluation of the equity and cost-benefit ratio of individual components; and (3) measurement of the direction of component transactions. In light of the models presented, the 3rd section proposes a doctrine of interactive reciprocity between the rural social systems and the governments of each country and between nation/states to facilitate a rural renaissance.

Data were obtained from 374 (78 Anglo, 102 Black, 98 Mexican American, and 96 Indian) male heads of unbroken households, under 60 years of age, able to work, who had lived in the county for 12 months or longer, and were employed as farm workers or had been so employed within the past 10 years. Analysis involved cross classification of data into numerous contingency tables as well as scales and indexes. Scales utilized involved (1) material possessions, (2) the awareness of informants of certain local organizations and  activities, and (3) statements concerning satisfaction with the urban environment and its correlates as they had experienced them. Among the findings were: (1) attitudes of Blacks and Anglos were more closely related to each other than to the other groups; (2) relatively more Mexican Americans and Indians remained in farmwork after moving into the towns; and (3) Mexican Americans demonstrated a higher level of satisfaction with their new residence even though they were still concentrated in farm occupations.

Emphasizing the trader's economic control over the Navajo people, this report deals with the following areas of concern: (1) History (cites treaties, laws, and sanctions governing the trader-Indian relationship); (2) Role of the Trader in Navajo Society (banker, creditor, pawnbroker, special claims agent for the Railroad Retirement Board, and interpreter of both mail and phone  communications); (3) Attitude of the Trader Toward Navajo Clientele (mental and physical abuse, paternalism, economic exploitation); (4) Effect of the Multiple Roles of the Traders (control over Navajo money, employment, and communication); (5) Sanitation and Safety (cites poor conditions in the older trading posts); and (6) Price Survey (compares trader's prices with wholesale prices). The report concludes that control of the trader is the responsibility of the Secretary of the Interior, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. (JC)",

Procedures for identifying Prairie City power actors in both 1962 and 1973 involved interviews with: (1) external identifiers; (2) internal identifiers; and (3) the power actors themselves. Power actors (25 in 1962 and 33 in 1973) were querried as to: (1) the amount of social power other power actors and themselves possessed in specific issue areas; (2) their social participation in organizations; (3) role expectations of power actors; (4) bases of social power of  power actors; and (5) their personal and social characteristics. Variables tested were: age; education; occupational prestige; income; length of residence in community and State; political orientation; number of memberships in local community organizations; and number of memberships in noncommunity organizations. Findings supported the general hypothesis but indicated that the power actors themselves were likely to change over time, as only 8 of the original power actors were among those identified in 1973.

During 1974-75, 32 low birth weight children handicapped by physical difficulties, learning aptitude (IQ), perceptual and motor problems, language handicaps, and economic, cultural, and education deprivation participated at Clovis, New Mexico. The program was divided into comprehensive components: instructional, staff development, community-parental involvement, and media. The evaluation design focused on the instructional component and a follow-up study of  former REPSAC students. Language development in English and Spanish, IQ, sensory and perceptual development, and school readiness were measured using pre and posttests. Periodic subjective evaluation of the students' self concept and personality development were conducted. Using a time-series analysis, personal interviews, and questionnaires, 27 former REPSAC students were studied. Some major findings were: students made significant gains in language ability, sensory and perceptual discrimination, and school readiness; showed positive and continuous self concept and personality growth; however, significant gain was not evident in learning aptitude.

        "description":"Wilderness, as a state of mind, has persisted among men since the beginning of time. Written history has documented man's struggle with and against it. It has only been during the last century that man, in a societal context, has designated vast tracts of land as wilderness. The extent to which wilderness attributes are perceived and the meaning attached to them varies with the observer. Over the years, it has been regarded both as an enemy to be conquered in the name of civilization, Christianity, and progress, and as something of value to be cherished and preserved. Thus, the dichotomy emerges between wilderness as a physical entity and wilderness as perceived by an individual encountering a previously unencountered, operational environment for the first time. For many people,  particularly those who are born and raised in an urban environment, the wilderness begins at the edge of the concrete. For others, it exists at the bounds of their limitations. Therefore, each individual perceives wilderness in the context of his history, maturation, and exposure to different types of operational environments. As exposure increases and the individual matures, so does his concept of what a wilderness might be. (Author/NQ)",

Extension specialists were provided to train and support the paraprofessionals in surveying local leadership, identifying problems, establishing objectives, organizing group action, and serving as linkage to outside resources. Evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses in the use of these paraprofessionals revealed that: (1) the dual role of extension worker and researcher may give the paraprofessional insights into the community, otherwise not apparent, but may also present problems via conflicting objectives; (2) supervision can be a problem relative to  the level of the organizational structure from which it is administered and the amount administered, but it can also be an asset, providing the paraprofessional with a close tie to the action oriented agency; (3) while maintaining an indigenous status, the paraprofessional may not have certain insights afforded the professional, and his familiarity with the people may erode the necessary aura of confidentiality; and (4) use of the paraprofessional allows a higher degree of economic efficiency, but a high rate of turnover among paraprofessionals presents additional problems.

Consequently, the teacher regulates his actions to conform to community norms. Since the migrant is a transient, marginally related to the community in which he works, it is often difficult for the community members to understand the necessity of providing education, health care, and other services for him. Therefore, this responsibility should rest within an agency authorized to deal with Federal and out-of-state agencies and to establish minimum standards of education for all migrant children. This center should provide the information and coordination necessary to develop specific migrant education programs and to train teachers to implement them.  It should obtain data from private and governmental agencies concerning crew composition, migration, kinship, cultural factors, and point of origin facilities. This information should then be transmitted to local programs providing summer education in the form of suggestions for methodology and subject matter. Special classroom material specially designed for the type of crews in the program should also be included. Thus, the center would relieve community pressures by accepting responsibility for programs which the local areas may not be able to obtain or justify to its residents. (NQ)",

Part I presents an analysis of information needed by teachers to plan occupational programs for individual  adult migrants and an investigation of other retrieval systems that could supplement the MSRTS. In Part II, 4 areas are discussed: (1) technical aspects of utilizing the system; (2) the current MSRTS administration's policies in regard to expanding the system, maintenance of confidential information, etc.; (3) specific implementation guidelines and a time-line for implementation of the system; and (4) recommendations and follow-up procedures.

        "description":"Recently those in the teaching profession have begun to realize the importance of listening skills. Of the 4 areas of language arts, listening is the primary skill. Phonics and listening are related in that there is a significant relationship between the child's ability to discriminate between letter sounds and his ability to listen. The child must master sound-to-letter associations in order to learn to spell. Listening skills must be improved if teachers are to reach the disadvantaged child--the youngster with limited vocabulary and short attention span, the child who seems to be in his own little world, and the child who is not ready to read in first grade and seems to fall further and further behind his classmates. This book presents a general discussion of the listening  skill and raises some questions pertinent to the development of this facet of the language arts program. Ideas which the teacher can use \"as is\" or as a springboard for developing her own program are provided. Effort has been made to select, modify, and develop materials to meet the unique needs of the disadvantaged child; however, many of the procedures would work equally well with primary children in various situations. Topics covered are: importance of listening; factors influencing listening ability; listening and the language arts program; listening levels and goals for instruction; and evaluation. (NQ)",

Although these Indians have worked in the State since 1945, no &quot;serious&quot; study had been made which included their home life in Quebec, reasons for migrancy, types of work done, and conditions of employment while on the farms. Therefore, a 35-minute slide/tape presentation illustrating the home life was prepared. The Reserve was visited 9 times since 1970, for approximately 3 days each time. Cassette recordings were made of: (1) several conversations with the band's Chief, band counselors, and teachers; and (2) traditional Algonquin songs sung by  some of the older people and young children. The presentation illustrates and describes housing, educational programs, medical and dental problems, production of native crafts, and traditional pursuits of these Indians. This report discusses how this presentation has been used and the initiator's continued involvement with the Algonquins. Also included is a narrative which was included with a proposal for a full-time outreach worker to work with the white, Indian, and Puerto Rican families on the fur farms in East Bloomfield, Ontario County, New York.

Data were obtained by the Bureau of the Census as a supplementary part of the regular Current Population Survey  conducted in December 1971. The relative well-being among the 3 classes of farm wageworker households is based on a comparison of family income and number of household members.

Before comparing the incidence of poverty culture across ethnic and residence lines, the question \"Do alleged poverty culture traits become more pronounced as level of economic deprivation increases?\" was studied. Derived from the sample obtained by 7 states participating in the NC-90 project, the following populations were represented: metropolitan whites; nonmetropolitan small town whites; rural farm and nonfarm whites; metropolitan blacks; village and small urban place blacks; metropolitan Spanish-speaking (primarily Mexican American and Puerto Rican); migrant labor camp Spanish-speaking (Mexican  Americans); migrant labor camp Spanish-speaking (Mexican nationals); metropolitan Hawaiian Orientals; metropolitan Hawaiian \"mixed ethnics\"; and metropolitan Polynesians. Data, obtained through interviews with the main female homemaker, pertained to demography; family resource procurement and expenditure; social structure and activities of the family, both internally and within the community; and the homemaker's value-orientations regarding education and employment. Findings indicated that, on some indicators of some traits, sizeable differences existed among ethnic and/or residence categories. (NQ)",

Del Norte, Aspen, and Craig, Colorado were selected as the research sites because each: (1) was relatively small (under 5,000 population) and isolated from larger urban areas, (2) was not economically dependent upon a single source of revenue, (3) was the governmental seat of their respective counties, and (4) had experienced divergent rates of growth in the past decade. Data were obtained in 1971 from surveys of 265 adults and 179 high school students. The junior class from each of the community high schools  comprised the adolescent sub-sample, while random sampling procedures provided the adult sub-sample. Some findings were: (1) data indicated strong support for the suggestion that adolescents and adults diverge in their evaluative responses to their community situation; (2) adolescents reacted, overall, substantially less positively toward their present communities than their adult neighbors; (3) students in Del Norte and Craig responded markedly lower in evaluations than did Aspen students.

Examination of migration patterns, employment variables, and industrial patterns revealed a net inmigration into 17 rural counties which had previously experienced population losses (1950-60) and a predominance of low wage/low skill industry in these  counties. It was concluded that subsequent research might focus on: (1) barriers to industrialization (decreasing supplies of easily trainable labor, shortages of skilled labor, poor schools, unsophisticated community leadership, poor transportation facilities, underdeveloped amenities, and poor images) and (2) the &quot;filtering down&quot; process, wherein manufacturers rely on the existence of pools of low wage, surplus labor and have to move out of areas as the surplus disappears via competition with other, higher wage employers.

Building on recent research of black-white patterns, the model related some structural characteristics of metropolitan areas (manufacturing employment, the presence of two important minorities, recent increases in the size of a minority, population size, and region) to educational, occupational, and income differentiation. The overall results suggested the model's utility. Differentiation in 1970, measured by the index of dissimilarity between two percentage distributions, was highest between Puerto Ricans and Anglos in the Middle Atlantic states and between blacks and Anglos in the South. Four separate analyses indicated the  importance of occupational differentiation and particularly educational differentiation in influencing income differentiation. The regional analyses showed manufacturing employment to be particularly important in lowering black-Anglo differentiation; percent black in lowering Puerto Rican differentiation (in contrast to expectations about the impact of interminority competition); percent Spanish heritage minority in raising Latino-Anglo differentiation in the Southwest (an index of Anglo gains from Latino subordination); and area population size in lowering Latino-Anglo differentiation elsewhere.

        "description":"The number of farms in rural America continued to decline. In 1974, 23,420 farms went out of business. Farm subsidy payments, originally designed to assist small farmers, contributed little to the survival of the small farmer. The 1974 increased costs in fuel and fertilizer alone reduced net farm income by $5 billion--approximately a $2,500 reduction in net income per farm. Although farm prices declined during 1974, prices paid by consumers at the supermarket continued to climb. Yet, the farmer received less than 41 cents of every food dollar spent by consumers. Evidence showed that market concentration (the lack of competition) led to higher food costs. Agribusiness not only contributed to increased food costs but threatened the existence of the independent farmer as well.  Nearly 25 percent of all food production was \"vertically integrated\" through outright corporate ownership or through contracts. Farmworkers also suffered from low wages, seasonal work, limited coverage under protective labor legislation, increased mechanization, poor education, and critical health and housing needs. However, organizations such as the National Sharecroppers Fund, farmer and craft co-ops, and land-reform groups are working on these problems, showing that reform and revitalization in rural America are possible.

The brief analysis highlights some of the most pertinent changes and trends in the size and composition of the hired farm working force. Data were obtained through a survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census as a supplementary part of its monthly Current Population Survey made in December 1974. In 1974, there were approximately 2.7 million persons in the hired farm working force. The annual employment of farmworkers appeared to have become stable after the long-term downward trend of prior years. Generally, hired farm wageworkers were young (median age 23 years), white (83 percent), male (79 percent), and  resided in nonfarm places (76 percent). They earned an average of $1,447 in annual cash wages, or $16.60 per day for 87 days of farm wagework. Approximately 1.6 million workers were employed solely in farm work during the year; the remaining 1.1 million performed both farm and nonfarm work. About 209,000 (8 percent) of the total were migratory farmworkers in 1974, the third consecutive year of increase. Annual earnings for these workers averaged $1,688, or $21.60 per day for 78 days of farmwork. Forty-nine percent of all migrants were employed only in farmwork during the year. (Author/NQ)",

        "description":"The American Indian population is in a period of transition. It is young, growing, and becoming more urban. There were some improvements in income, housing, education, and health in the 1960-70 decade, but Indians remain the most disadvantaged of the minority ethnic groups in the United States. By most of the above measures, Indians, especially rural Indians, are not as well off as the U.S. population as a whole. But the Indian people are moving toward self-determination, or self-government, in programs to enhance their lives. Both excessive paternalism and termination of the trust relationships have become discredited as national policy regarding Indians. As the President's Message of 1970 states, &quot;Federal termination errs in one direction, Federal paternalism errs in the  other.&quot; It is also widely accepted that the integrity of the Indian culture should be preserved, not only as a contribution to cultural pluralism which enriches society as a whole, but also as a reflection of the desires of the Indian people themselves. The Indian culture is in a transition period, but the roots of Indian customs and values are deep and will not yield quickly or easily to alien customs and values. The process of moving toward self-determination is underway, and some measure of change is in the Indian picture today. (Author/NQ)",

        "author":["Spurlock, Hughes H."],
        "description":"In 1971, a U.S. Census of Housing surveyed the financing of homeowners and rental properties, including characteristics of mortgages, properties, and homeowners. Data were obtained on places located outside Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA) and in places of less than 10,000 population, and on rural areas located outside SMSA's. These area classifications were considered as being close approximations to the \"rural area\" defined in the 1949 Housing Act. Areas classified as SMSA's were considered proxies for urban areas. To determine rural-urban differences, a comparative analysis was made of data contained in the survey on credit terms and usage in SMSA's, in non-SMSA's, and in places of less than 10,000 population and rural areas located within the non-SMSA counties.  Analysis showed home buyers in rural areas paid higher interest rates on conventional mortgages, had shorter repayment periods, and had fewer choices of lenders. Yet, credit conditions did improve during the 1960's in rural areas. Savings and loan associations, the major home mortgage lenders, became more active in rural areas. They held 35 percent of the first mortgages in 1971 as compared with 23 percent in 1960. Expansion of activities by Federal agencies in rural areas tended to narrow the gap between the percentage of loans guaranteed and insured in rural areas as compared to metro areas. (Author/NQ)",

Concepts and processes are illustrated pictorially, and many exercises are included. Chapter 15, the first of two chapters in this volume, concerns measurement. The need for standard units is discussed and, after some work on computation with mixed numbers, both English and metric units are introduced. Measurement of angles using the protractor and computation of area are also discussed. In chapter 16 perfect squares are presented, and  the idea of finding the sides of squares with given area is used to motivate an introduction to the real numbers. Computations with radicals, the Pythagorean theorem, and circumference and area of circles are also developed. (SD)",

In the last chapter the slope-intercept form of a linear equation is discussed, and the method of solution of simultaneous linear equations is detailed. Equations of parallel and perpendicular pairs of lines are  examined. The concepts of absolute value and distance are introduced, and the method of computing the distance between two points in a plane is described. (SD)",

One of the central purposes of the unit is to develop independence and self confidence by encouraging the student to think through a problem clearly. The questions and activities give the student practice examining facts at hand and drawing logical conclusions in a nonthreatening atmosphere. For this reason, there are no tests at the end of each section. This is a seed crystal approach; its purpose is to begin building an accurate picture of the planet. Awareness, not mastery of concepts and terms, is the major objective. The first section of the unit, \"Physical Nature of the Planet  Earth,\" is conceptually oriented; the student learns facts about the planet and uses that information to solve a problem. The second section, \"Physical Nature of Rocks, Minerals, and Fossils,\" is more concerned with application; the student learns a skill which is used to solve a problem. Also included is a section about careers in geology and paleontology. (Author/MLH)",

Definitions of attitude by L. L. Thurstone, L. W. Doob, and M. Fishbein are presented as a basis for the investigation. The difficulties involved in assessing attitudes are revealed through examples which illustrate the interrelationship among expressed opinions, beliefs and intentions, behavior (responses), and actual attitudes. Empirical studies which examine the correlations between attitude and achievement are discussed. The paper proposes that it is probable that an observed relationship between attitude and achievement does not necessarily exist. The paper concludes with the implications of the  last statement for educators. These implications include the need to study more carefully the reasons why attitude is not a strong correlate of achievement. A second implication is that educators should not be too hasty nor too sure in making assessments of attitudes from students' expressed opinions or overt behavior. (JBW)",

Problems of the form a/b = c/x varied on four dimensions: size of a/b, equality or inequality of b and c, complex or simple fractions, and form of the test. Tests consisted of six proportionality problems involving sizes of stick figures. Thirty-two seventh-grade students served as subjects. Responses were scored on the 10-point scale developed by Karplus, and the resulting data were submitted to several analyses of variance. Results indicated that only one-fourth of the problems were solved by strategies based on understanding of proportionality. Subjects were able to solve some of the easier problems, suggesting that they had (or were developing) some  intuitive understanding of proportionality.

The results of the study suggest that a child's understanding of proportionality is dependent on the task being performed. It is suggested that in teaching proportionality concepts teachers use the simplest possible arithmetic. (SD)",

        "description":"Over a period of five semesters, the attitudes of preservice secondary mathematics teachers participating in seven varieties of educational experiences were measured using the Mathematics Teaching Inventory (MTI). Items on the MTI were scored for modern versus traditional attitudes. Seven subscales were generated by classifying items on the basis of whether they involved perception of mathematics teaching or teaching in general and whether there was a teacher or non-teacher focus. Data collected for the seven groups on these seven scales were submitted to an analysis of variance. Results indicated that, in general, students with only observation experiences held more modern and open attitudes than students with teaching experience. This result was most significant for the  subscale concerning mathematics teaching behavior. On the basis of this study and related research it is recommended that early school-based experiences should be offered to preservice teachers, but that these experiences should be carefully selected to avoid negative effects on attitudes.

By focusing standard measurement techniques on the item difficulty (the proportion of students answering an item correctly), it was determined that up to two-thirds of the reliable variance of a classroom test is held in common with identical tests given in similar classes. The particular wording of the test item measuring a concept was shown to be a critical factor in knowledge assessment. Classes were given identical terms measuring common concepts and changed items measuring a different set of common concepts. The correlations between classes of item difficulties for identical items is approximately .70, whereas the correlation for changed items is  approximately .35. Suggestions are made for utilizing the high correlation between identical items in instructional decision making. (Author/SD)",

All areas are assessed by a group of educators who design objectives for each area and create measurement tools appropriate to the objectives. When the exercises prepared by the test developers have passed extensive reviews by subject-matter specialists and measurement experts, they are administered to probability samples of various populations. Approximately 100,000 persons participate annually in these exercises. This report includes information on the ability of American youth to utilize the inquiry skills stressed in the new science curricula. The  students participated in eight individualized activities which included the use of scientific apparatus to conduct testing procedures and simple experiments, the application of knowledge to the observation of materials in order to make generalizations, and the demonstration of principles by using models. Descriptions are given of the eight activities which were designed for students of ages 9, 13, and 17, and specifications are included for the sample populations which took part in the study. The results of the assessment are reported for each activity and include a breakdown according to geographical region, sex, color, parental education, and size and type of community.

        "description":"The long-forgotten debate of 1929-31 between T. L. Kelley and W. H. Kilpatrick is reviewed with the aim of reviving the crucial, but dormant, issue of the competence of quantitative empirical research to answer educational questions. They debated the need to supplement scientific method with a philosophical approach sensitive to needs, impulses, and interests. First, the causes and objectives of the debate are placed in historical and intellectual perspective by describing the wave of technological optimism that occurred about 1890-1920. Then, the principal points made by the debaters are reviewed and examined. It is concluded that Kilpatrick won the debate by making a strong case for the complementarity of scientific and philosophical methods in education. But, it can be granted  to Kelley that educational analysis and theorizing has often seemed undisciplined and concerned more with displaying cleverness or doctrinal purity than with getting things right. Today, the situation of the late 1920s still exists: a narrow positivist orthodoxy among influential methodologists coupled with dissatisfaction on the part of others about triviality, irrelevance, and inconclusiveness of research using the scientific method. It is suggested that it is possible for research to be both rigorous and relevant; thus, the issue should be reopened. (Author/ND)",

One of the major problems in the field of social studies education is the looseness or nonspecificity of many of the definitions and terms which play such an important role in the planning, organization, and assessment of instruction. This looseness of definitions may contribute to a discrepancy between what teachers would like to teach and what they, in fact, teach. One way to improve instruction and increase student learning in the social studies is to develop precise definitions for the concepts used while simultaneously assisting teachers in the use of logical modes of  instructional behavior.

A general reflection on the genesis of the field of education and the evolution of philosophy of education is offered. Two main parts of the educational complex are examined: the field of education as a general branch of research, study, and professional training; and the field of philosophy of education within it as a subject matter for teaching and scholarship. After a brief clarification of concerns, the paper offers an impressionistic sketch of developing and changing conceptions of the field of education and philosophy of education over the past 75 years. Then, an interpretation is  presented of the complexity of both the field of education and philosophy of education and what this complexity may mean to the efforts of philosophers of education as they close out the last quarter of the 20th century.

From the point of view of the wearer in any culture, the decision as to what to wear is based on two kinds of information: the nature of the occasion and the wearer's image of his social identity. People, therefore, use clothing to project information about themselves. An analysis of the clothing behavior of Tzeltal speaking Tenejapa Indians of Chiapas, Mexico, initially shows clothing as a symbol of ethnic differentiation from Spanish-speaking Ladino families. Within the Tenejapa society, there are accepted combinations and types of clothes for specific occasions which express the wearers' social identity and his degree of self-esteem. Any other form of clothing is marked by the addition of  descriptive features termed &quot;cues.&quot; Consequently, special outfits are worn by such little seen figures as civil-religious officials to identify them to the community. Variations from the accepted form of attire by the elements of the general population indicate the amount of freedom within the society. (Author/DE)",

Large amounts of data on the psychological and sociological settings of subjects are gathered, along with information on opinions toward past and emerging political situations. Macro-analytic techniques sample large sections of the general population and usually take the form of national or subnational opinion polls. Prior to the measurement of any changing attitudes, it is necessary to first establish a knowledge base of currently held opinions and attitudes. The advantage of macro-techniques is that they produce a wide range of standardizable data about voting behavior, political opinions, and attitudes towards the system. The  disadvantage is that they record stages in the change process, but are incapable of analyzing the process. The major deterrent to micro-analytic work is that such studies cannot be readily generalized to a national population. However, samples drawn for micro-analytic research are representative of behavioral types and, therefore, offer superior techniques for studying complex learning processes. (Author/DE)",

It is hypothesized that primary principle attitudes will be more stable than middle range attitudes which in turn will be more stable than topical issue orientations. Secondly, it is hypothesized that the cognitive maps (Showing cognitive dissonance and/or cognitive balance theory) which explain these attitudes will respond to  both maturation process and events in the political environment. The results of analysis of variance indicate that, despite maturation, all of the attitudes measured display a very high degree of stability. A Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) of the data supports the second hypothesis, even though attitudes remain stable. It is suggested that a more complete understanding of attitude formation, change, and their relation to political behavior will depend on the development and use of more complex models than those provided by cognitive maps.

However, legitimate authoritative communications by a teacher must have the potential for reasoned elaboration. These communications then mark off the boundaries of rational and authoritative communication from non- and irrational communications. The backing by reasons of these authoritative statements must be made apparent at some level meaningful to the child if genuine authority is to be established, even if the child is not capable of fully comprehending the concepts and relations involved. In Kohlberg's three stages of moral development, authority can be used to mark out and develop the sphere of reason up until the child reaches the postconventional,  autonomous, or principled level. In the political education of young children, authority can be used to make clear to children that political party allegiances and strong positive feelings about the Presidency are not genetically inherited from parents but are choices made from rational political thought.

Political learning is seen as an invariant sequence of developmental stages dependent upon physical and intellectual growth, and current events. The data consist of interviews with children at the third through the ninth grade levels. The data are further stratified along an urban/rural dimension for purposes of sociocultural comparisons. Results indicate that there is a relationship between stages of cognitive development and the evolution of political orientations in children. There is an association between age level of the children and the degree to which they support or have confidence in the government. Opinion samples taken before and after the Nixon resignation and  pardon indicate a decrease in the degree of government support and confidence. The author concludes that the present distrust in government is therefore due to situational factors. (Author/DE)",

The general proposition tested is that the association between selected personality resource assets and the desired outcomes of resource conversion settings will be different for different levels or types of resource settings. It is found that (1) the interaction of children's early abilities and their family socioeconomic environments has strong effects on future educational attainments; (2) the interaction of early ability and educational attainment has a low but significant impact on the development of ability at maturity; (3) the two interactions between educational attainment and job status, and  between ability at maturity and job status account for variance in earnings over and above the direct effects of ability at maturity and job status; and (4) the impact of schooling on net earnings of job status and ability at maturity is neglible. Attention is given to the relevance of these findings for the development of status attainment theory, and some suggestions are made for extending the analysis by fitting more accurate statistical models. Tables and graphs illustrate the findings throughout the document. (Author/JR)",

Creativity is defined as the process of sensing gaps, finding a means of effecting closure, and formulating hypotheses to eventually produce a novel product. The greater the pressure to conform, however, no matter what the source, the fewer the individuals who can preserve their creative functioning. The extent to which a culture encourages diversity and tolerates individual deviation affects this creative development. Samoan culture has relatively few discontinuities. Roles are assumed at birth and rarely change throughout life. Obedience to those higher in authority and power over those slightly smaller or younger is consistently upheld. There is a great lack of stimulation  which might produce changes. Pressures are brought to bear when any tendency to change appears. However, the one major source of discontinuity is the impact of United States culture. The conflict between the two cultures creates extreme frustration among young Samoan students and leads to a high dropout rate in Samoan schools. Samoan educators are encouraged to be highly sensitive to creative students' needs in order to decrease the role conflict of Samoan students. (Author/DE)",

The focus is on the mechanisms involved when, in the absence of complete instruction, a person must \"invent\" a new solution to a problem by assembling previously learned skills. To describe this type of problem-solving behavior the authors set forth an information processing model characterized by three classes of processes: problem detection, feature scanning, and goal analysis. A series of studies on invention, in which children are taught component skills and their behavior is examined in situations where these skills must be combined in a novel  fashion, elucidates this model.

One recent movement in public administration strongly attacks the notion of neutral scientific training and emphasizes that public administrators should administer policy according to social equity. However, this standard does not provide any objective criteria for distinguishing among the various claims of disadvantaged minorities and cannot differentiate between equality and justice. The function of administration in a democratic regime is to be more than a mere reflection of the people's wants and more than a mirror of the bureaucrat's particular view of \"social equity.\" To develop values and judgment capabilities, administrators should be educated in relating current issues with American  political thought and tradition. The study of constitutional law, an apprenticeship with a public administration organization, case studies of decision making, and a research project which requires the student to develop a policy on a particular controversial question are suggested as a possible program for public administration education.

The findings from a study carried out in the Near Southside Chicago community of South Commons, built in the late 50's are presented. Methodology included informal conversations, interviews with adult residents of all income levels and ethnicities, and observation of children. Findings show that inner group conflict is a function of class difference rather than race, and physical design and landscaping reflect such differences and exacerbate them; and that the school is fundamentally pivotal to interaction and community organization because as a sociophysical institution it has the quality of bringing together rich and poor. Four  hypotheses for further work emerge from the study. Among these are that persons moving into a community out of desire to live in a mixed setting would be more committed to the specifically attracting features, and that institutions directly affecting children are fundamental to community stability and cohesion.

The purpose is to provide a historical record on the subject of women's history. Women from the four cultural traditions were bound by different conventions which influenced their reactions to the Revolutionary crisis and affected the ways in which that crisis would change their lives. American women were as deeply influenced by the Revolution as were American men, though not always to their benefit. The successful war for independence marked a significant turning point in the status of women. Documented stories are recounted of individual women's activities during the Revolution in each of the  chapters titled: Four Traditions; Choosing Sides; Soldiers, Refugees, and Camp Followers; Treason and Espionage; and Aftermath. Some of the stories depict heroic acts, but some show wrongdoings as well. They all indicate the importance and necessity of the roles women played and the tasks they undertook during the Revolution.

        "description":"The introduction and study of Canadian political systems are recommended as a model for use in political science courses at American universities. In the past, recognition of the worth of Canadian studies has been minimal. New and interesting topical areas such as Canadian nationalism, missionary activities, energy resource problems, and pollution have redirected the emphasis on Canadian studies. Four major areas of Canadian studies are examined which bear directly on important topics of interest to American political scientists: nation building, policies, institutions, and international relations. A brief historical narrative of each area is included, along with techniques for incorporating Canadian studies. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"Some possible new directions for the political science discipline are presented. Within the context of current, formal undergraduate education, political science has two major functions: (1) to provide part of the required general, social science education, and (2) to attract and prepare future recruits for the profession. These functions are referred to as \"old uses.\" The discipline's most common career is teaching; therefore, political scientists as professionals are best at reproducing themselves. The premise for \"new uses\" is that, in addition to contributing to the general education of college graduates and preparation of more teachers of political science, the discipline could make a major contribution toward the preparation of professionals in the public service. Generally  defined, the public service comprises that component of the world of work that is supported by public funds. The potential for \"new uses\" of political science lies in a conscious and determined effort within the discipline to create programs relevant to the preservice and inservice education and training of competent professionals for the public service.

        "description":"The relative influence of stages of political socialization on the adult political orientation and activities of former American and Japanese student activists is examined. A causal model of the stages of political socialization, including family and school, student activism, and adult roles, is compared with the political fate of student activists who participated in the 1960 antisecurity treaty movement in Japan and the civil rights movement in the American South. The results indicate that student activism in college is the best predictor of adult politics in both countries. Family and early school political socialization are only weak predictors of future adult politics. Adult political socialization can be either a facilitator or a constraint for maintaining political  commitments. In the United States, career choice has no direct effect because student activism strongly affects career choice. In Japan, career choice has a strong effect on adult politics. Former Japanese students in the knowledge and human services industries have greater left-wing commitments. For American student activists, remaining free of family affiliations is a facilitator for left-wing politics; while in Japan, family obligations are a facilitator of left-wing politics.

Self-theory, like other knowledge, is dependent on the theories in one's culture about human nature and the biological, social, and physical world. Language expands or limits the concepts available for thinking about one's self-image or sense of self. Yet there is little in behavioral sciences literature which traces these changes. Three possible models are provided for further research. The theory of personal control interprets self-image as the growth and decline in the feeling of power, control, and mastery of the key tasks of life. The progression from early age on into the career can be characterized by an increase in realism about what is possible, and by a steady lowering of  aspirations to correspond to the gradual foreclosing of reality. The theory of change in oneself stresses that every person must have as a component of the self-theory some hypothesis about the kind of person he can become in future time and, hence, the possibility of personal change.

These estimates allow annual examination of the extent to which various educational subgroups have participated in recent fertility trends. The sample population was divided into five age groups from 15 to 44 years and five educational levels from junior high through college. The single pervasive finding is that fertility increased during the 1950's and decreased in the 1960's for virtually every group examined. The increase in fertility during the 1950's was greater among younger women and among better educated women; and the decline in fertility during the 1960's was largest among women who  attended but did not complete high school or college. With few exceptions, the pattern of fertility rise and decline over the two decades was similar for black and white women of comparable educational attainment. (Author/DE)",

The three criterion levels used were 90 percent, 80 percent, and 70 percent of the correct responses on each of 41 lessons in &quot;Population Growth in the United States and Mexico.&quot; Aptitude was measured by a word meaning text. Aptitude was a major independent variable because of the premise that mastery procedures may overcome achievement difficulties of low aptitude students. Contrary to most of the literature on mastery learning, the results indicate that mastery on formative exercises did not contribute to higher levels of achievement on the summative test. The study also failed to show  that achievement, retention, or attitude toward the unit differed among the three criterion groups. The study confirmed that previous knowledge, as measured by a word meaning test, was a more potent factor in achievement than were differential criterion levels. (Author/DE)",

Four aspects of the learning process suggested the usefulness of special training: identification of important or unfamiliar material, applications of techniques for the comprehension and retention of this information, efficient retrieval of information, and skill in coping with distractions during the foregoing processes. A training program was developed for teaching selected specific strategies, including comparison of the three alternative comprehension/retention strategies (referred to as connection techniques) of paraphrasing, question answering, and the use of visual imagery.  The results indicated that minimal strategy training showed significant results in long-term retention, although no reliable differences were found in immediate testing. Further refining of the techniques was recommended. An effective strategy training program suitable for implementation in technical training was created, modified, and assessed. (Author)",

Since the common problems of choosing a topic and locating needed resources often require more time than is necessary, suggestions which increase efficency in these stages are emphasized. A short annotated list of African history textbooks with clear opinions and controversial generalizations are suggested as suitable materials for leading a student to a topic for research. The fundamental controversy in African historical writing today is over the degree of continuity or change from precolonial times, through colonial rule, to the present. This controversy can lead to specific questions which are suitable for research papers. In the process of defining a topic, the student should move  from an assumed generalization to the testing of a hypothesis about the generalization. Nine assumptions and possible hypotheses are suggested for further study. Relevant bibliographical aids include instructions on how to use the card catalog, indexes, handbooks and encyclopedias, bibliographies, the human relations area file, scholarly journals, maps, and atlases.

AIF seeks to engage Americans in serious consideration of the nation's institutions, values, and traditions through a calendar which sets forth and elaborates on the fundamental American issues contained in nine monthly topics and weekly subtopics. The units, designed for secondary social studies and history classes, provide students with a special, activity-oriented one-day discussion unit for each of the 36 weekly subtopics of the calendar. The first volume (the second to be published in October) contains the 16 units for the first four months of the calendar beginning August 31, 1975.  Each of the one-day units is a self-contained package which includes suggestions to the teacher for procedures, readings, instructions, and questions.

The purpose of the Leadership Packet is to provide those who are interested in developing AIF Programs with suggestions about how to plan and with information about supporting materials, services, and activities. The key to the American Issues Forum is a Calendar of nine monthly topics--issues that have been fundamental to American society throughout history. The Calendar--part 2, following an introduction--is designed to stimulate serious and coordinated exploration of American's abiding accomplishments and problems during the Bicentennial celebration, providing a framework for  a variety of programs. Part 3 suggests kinds of programs which could be planned for communities and organizations. General how-to-do-it suggestions for programs development, resources, promotion, and coordination are contained in part 4. Extensive bibliographies for adults and students are contained in part 5. A directory of AIF-related materials, media efforts, and supporting organizations comprise part 6. Part 7 lists various Bicentennial exhibits and displays. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"This report gives the basic definition and purpose of competency-based teacher education (CBTE) cut-off scores. It describes the basic characteristics of CBTE as a yes-no dichotomous decision regarding the presence of a specific ability or knowledge, which necesitates the establishment of a cut-off point to designate competency vs. incompetency on stated objectives. Statistical considerations for establishing CBTE cut-off scores are reviewed, and, based on test scores, two types of classification errors are identified. These are false acceptance, i.e., nonmasters erroneously classified as masters; and false rejection, i.e., masters erroneously classified as nonmasters. The report recommends that cut-off scores should not be arbitrarily established, but should be based on decision  theory, the goal of which is to increase correct rate and decrease error rate. It was found that increasing the cut-off score will decrease false acceptance error and increase false rejection error, while decreasing the cut-off score will decrease false rejection error and increase false acceptance error. It was concluded that since shifting cut-off points reduces one error at the expense of the other, the direction of shift should be in the direction of the less serious error (false rejection). Numerous figures and tables are included. (BD)",

It was determined that this course was of vital importance since it was an introduction to the field of professional education for students and the first systematic contact the faculty had with prospective educators. The first step in the study was a survey of the current literature, which revealed tentative directions for the new program. These new directions included preprofessional experiences, concentration on first undergraduate courses, self-concept, and more student involvement in course decisions. The second step was to send a questionnaire to 78 universities, seeking information on the role and function of the first course concerning  admissions, course content, department where housed, and innovative techniques utilized to introduce students to the field of education. Responses showed a common concern for examination of teacher education programs and a specific concern for using preprofessional experiences in the first course in selection procedures. Using this informational input, a design model was drawn up to provide overall first course aims and objectives. The first course was taught on an experimental basis for one semester to gain feedback as to process of class work and field experiences. A teaching team made up of professional staff met periodically prior to, during, and after the course to determine how to operate more effectively. (RC)",

Teacher organizations feel strongly about competency based teacher education, and although they have always stood for having only competent teachers in the classroom, they will fight governmental intrusions into all professional prerogatives. The organized teaching professions will provide inservice programs for its members. Higher education members of the profession will be invited to be a part of these programs as equal members, but the organized profession will seek expertise at whatever level it is  available. The teacher organizations are planning to take new initiatives to enforce their own code of ethics, but will resist outside interference by those who would wish to use the code for their own benefit. Finally, teacher organizations plan to have a greater say in student teaching/intern programs. They desire more input in the field experiences of future teachers. Teachers are now demanding their professional rights, and the new initiatives of organized teachers will overlap on what has formerly belonged solely to institutions of higher education. (RC)",

The task force was established in 1972 to determine and conceptualize the best thinking of the higher education teacher education community concerning the reform of American education. The report presented the following three recommendations: (1) accelerated educational reform; (2) creation of personnel development centers; and (3) partnership or shared responsibility in teacher education. The report suggested a number of significant issues, three of which are examined and challenged in this paper. This paper states that the questions of the purposes which  formal schooling should serve is completely ignored in HETFIRE; hence we continue to retain and support a conservative, subject-matter centered, alienating form of education. The paper also disagrees with HETFIRE's suggestion that university professors move into the realm of pragmatic problem solving in the schools. Instead of its confusing the roles of theoreticians and practitioners, the paper suggests that the HETFIRE report should have urged the continued need and support for educational theoreticians at all institutions preparing teachers. The paper also disagrees with HETFIRE's advocacy of giving equal power to teachers, school administrators, community groups, representatives of industry, and interested lay people. (BD)",

One of the most difficult processing tasks in sport is motion prediction. To examine motion prediction it is necessary to consider factors about the individual, the environment, and characteristics of the object which affect the successful completion of the goal. The factors about the individual which necessitate prediction are processing, delays, movement organization, reaction time, and movement time. It is also necessary to consider other variables such as depth  perception, just noticeable difference, age, and experience. Aspects of the environment which affect performance are the number of potentially relevant stimuli in the environment, the placement of stimuli in the environment, the size of the display, the complexity of the background, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the degree of prominance of the regulatory stimuli. It is also possible to make some tentative statements on the effect of object characteristics on performance. Variables which may be considered are speed, direction, angle, viewing time, prediction distance, and object flight characteristics. Knowledge of the characteristics and effects of these three factors should aid teachers in facilitating learning and performance in skills. (BD)",

An advisory ensures that advice is received from segments of the community that usually have no voice in policy making. The purpose of the advisory should be established immediately. Familiarization with holidays, vacations, budgeting periods, and other events that will affect the advisory should then take place. Once the basic purpose of and the context in which the advisory must operate has been agreed on, membership becomes an issue. It is essential that care be given to the kinds of people that should be on an advisory. The process of developing membership is continuous; as people agree to serve, a sense of what other kinds of people are needed is developed.  After membership selection is completed, the firs meeting should be planned. The agenda for the first and subsequent meetings should be worked out in advance with several members and then checked for acceptance with the whole group at the beginning of the meeting. Hopefully, by the end of the first meeting the group will have (1) shared a common understanding of their mission; (2) selected a temporary chairman; (3) reached agreement on how often, when, and where to meet; and (4) settled on an agenda or process for creating an agenda for the following meeting.

It explains that this is necessary since most teacher education innovations in the United States extensively use technological support, and involve high cost personnel, materials, and systems. The report also notes that the present state in planning and cost projections requires not only establishing present and projected realities as to type of school, instructional program, personnel, organization, and management system; but that it also requires organizing the pieces of the training support system in order to support this proposed reality. The report then presents a model for personnel development which specifies activities that surround and support the training event, so that cost factors can be analyzed.  The report also describes some of the situational factors which surround the event, and which may or may not affect cost. All of the factors involved in the training event have an actual social and financial or personnel cost, and each has its own outcomes as well. According to the report, the model makes it possible to sort out these outcomes as well as to identify and project cost for the training event outcome itself. The report also states that the model enables evaluation of training programs, identifies gaps to be filled, and points out where redundant effort has been placed. (BD)",

It then discusses abstract definitions and program realities of PBTE, as well as the kinds of considerations that must go into deciding whether or not the competency based movement will have an impact on improving the quality of teacher education. The second paper, by a representative fom NEA, begins by  considering the negotiable interests of teachers in teacher education, and why teachers want and require a major role in the activities in teachr education.

In order for the teacher to be able to fulfill this function, it is essential that support mechanisms be established and maintained. Whatever support mechanisms are to be created should evolve from the objectives learners will be asked to accomplish. One simple hierarchy to use for this task includes knowledge level objectives, performance level objectives, consequence level objectives, and affective objectives. Since knowledge level objectives are normally the foundation on which the others are built, the creation of a resource center will play an important part in the development of all four levels of the hierarchy. The purpose of the center should be  to provide a gathering point for students, to provide all materials necessary to achieve specified objectives, and to have help available when necessary. Learning packets or modules should be stored and distributed, and pre- and postassessments administered when appropriate. Materials such as filmstrips, videotapes, and simulations should be provided to support module objectives, and the center should have study tables, small group rooms, and learning carrels.

        "description":"College sports were started by students in the post Civil War period of the 1860's and 1870's. By the 1880's football, baseball, crew, and track and field were popular intercollegiate sports. The desire of the nation as a whole for diversion after World War I provided an impetus for sports in general and intercollegiate athletics in particular. During the 1920's intercollegiate athletics reached unprecedented popularity. New sports such as basketball, golf, tennis, soccer, lacrosse, swimming, gymnastics, and fencing were added to the program. Colleges were forced to provide new facilities, including large stadiums and new and bigger gymnasiums for popular indoor sports. This increased emphasis on college athletics led to some serious problems, such as commercialism, proselytizing  and subsidization of athletes, and coaches who believed in winning at any cost. The formation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 1906 resulted in colleges and universities assuming some control over their athletic programs. This in turn created a number of administrative problems. Fortunately, during this period physical education was undergoing some changes too, and its new emphasis on games and sports moved it closer to the athletic programs. By the end of the decade the merger was complete, and the physical education teacher and athletic coach were one and the same. (Author/RC)",

A 17 page questionnaire was mailed to a provincial sample of women teachers who were teaching during the 1971-72 school year. It was designed to elicit a wide range of information on biographic and demographic characteristics, career development and satisfaction, professional interests and attitudes, and economic consideration. This report is the first in Canada to present descriptive information of women teachers both comprehensive in scope and generalizable to a provincial population. It is intended that the data on which this normative report is based will be used for a  series of analytical studies on such questions as (1) determinants of professional and community involvements of women teachers, (2) factors affecting women teachers' support of militant professionalism, (3) determinants of the probability of women teachers making permanent careers in teaching, (4) analysis of the work satisfaction of women teachers, and (5) women teachers' attitudes toward their professional training.

The primary objective was to operationalize the \"systems approach\" to field supervision by showing how the theory/practice synthesis, learning theory, and variation of newer instructional designs could be used in the student teaching practicum at the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle Campus. The instructional design, placed in the context of learning theory, consists of nine components and a flow chart model depicting the components and their relationships in achieving objectives applicable to a specific skill(s) or concept needed by the student teacher. Included in the report are guidelines for developing a self-instructional package (SIP) focusing on a  specific skill or concept needing mastering by the student teacher. The concomitant use of the SIP based on this instructional design in a learning/teaching classroom setting is intended to (1) provide self-paced, individualized learning for the student teacher; and (2) provide systematic feedback and evaluation of the student teacher's performance by both the classroom cooperating teacher and the college supervisor. A self-instructional package, with self-contained units, developed within the framework of a nine-component instructional system is currently being used to help students acquire specific skills associated with the open classroom concept.

The activities for the tutorial sessions were decided upon cooperatively by the tutor and the tutee's teacher. The sessions took place at &quot;Tutor Stations&quot; which were located in the hallways of the elementary school, in quiet corners of some classrooms, or in unused rooms. To implement the program a preschool training program was conducted to permit the involved staff to develop the tutoring program. Tutoring kits were completed that contained instructional materials and progress charts. Tutors were  then trained by the elementary teachers. The tutors were evaluated on the basis of interviews with their parents, their teachers, the tutee's teacher, and the tutors themselves. The experience may have helped to maintain the tutor's academic growth and did enhance their desirable personal qualities. Evaluation of the tutees was conducted by interviews with their parents, their teachers, their peers, and the tutees themselves. The tutees made very satisfactory progress with regard to their personal development and academic performance. (RC)",

Each project description includes theory, actual experiences, and, in some cases, a survey of the project's effectiveness. The projects concern merging theory and practice, the inner city,  language and cultural differences, the handicapped, day care centers, junior high school students, individually guided education programs, the audio-tutorial technique of instruction, open classrooms, affective education in teacher training, and performance objectives. The report recommends that ideas which emerge from these projects be incorporated into the mainstream of teacher education in the state.

        "description":"A method of individual classroom research is proposed and demonstrated in this paper. Its purpose was to show that by capitalizing on baseline data collected from a similar prior class and focusing treatment on difficult test items, the instructor can develop sensitive within-class designs for the detection of treatment effects. An experiment using written objectives given to students to aid their learning and using the single classroom design shows that objectives significantly improve learning. The experiment was conducted with 54 students in an introductory psychology class at the University of Washington. Students were given lecture objectives but no objectives for the reading assignments for the first four week period. During the second four week period a reversal was made  and objectives were given with the reading assignments but not with the lectures. Student performance was measured with multiple choice test questions. In addition to improving learning, the experiment showed that written objectives interact with item difficulty. These results lead to the recommendation that instructors engage in personal inquiry into their efforts to influence student learning and that such inquiry be added to the educational research literature.

The resource system is usually a formal organization whose expert knowledge of the innovation is available to the user system. This interaction, called collaborative linkage, is ideally characterized by open communication, which allows the resource system to assess the individual user's needs and concerns, and to select personalized intervention strategies based on this assessment. It is hypothesized that there are different, identifiable stages of concern about, and levels of use of an innovation. The user  system's advancement to higher levels of use and concern is a developmental process. The intervention strategies of the resource system are aimed at answering the user's concerns, arousing higher concerns, and thereby advancing the level of use of the innovation. (Author)",

The purpose of the council is to provide input into decisions made concerning inservice teacher education and staff development. A systematic observational study of the council was undertaken to analyze its operations. Findings revealed that the tempo of the meetings was controlled by the project director, and that patterns of interaction developed among members of the council. These patterns  represented regularized exchanges of verbal behavior, sequencing of activity, and the use of space. Leadership of the council was also found in the project director. Next in line were three or four council members who tended to take prominent roles in discussion and decision making. In conjunction with its more general interaction patterns, informal groups made up of those members who interacted regularly apart from the formal setting, formed within the council. It is through these structures and behavior patterns that individual members taught themselves how to fit into the operation of the council. (RC)",

In order to obtain this evidence, a questionnaire was sent to 324 public secondary school principals in New Jersey and 220 academicians at Trenton State College. Sixty-eight percent of the principals and thirty-five percent of the academicians surveyed returned the questionnaire. The questionnaire asked the subjects to rate seven educational media competencies according to their importance for secondary school teachers on a scale of 1 to 5. From eight academic approaches listed on the questionnaire, the subjects were also asked to indicate the approach they viewed as best for the development of the seven  educational media competencies in secondary school teachers. It was concluded from the findings of this study that secondary school principals and academicians place \"great importance\" on the seven educational media competencies, and that they view a three-credit introductory course in educational media as the best academic approach for the development of educational media competencies in secondary school teachers.

The subjects were 59 women enrolled in four beginning fencing classes taught by the same instructor at the University of Iowa. The data collected included performance on a test of combined reaction-movement time, similar to the parry; a wall target test of accuracy of the thrust with the foil; and a test of speed of the advance-retreat movement. Measures of the fencing success of each subject were obtained from class round-robin tournament results, and two criterion measures were computed. The first measure was based on the touches the fencer made  against opponents; the second, on both the touches made against opponents and touches scored on the fencer. Results indicated (1) that speed of the combined reaction-movement time variable had significant negative relationships with the two criterion measures of fencing success, (2) that the two criterion measures were significantly related to each other, and (3) that the wall target accuracy variable had a significant relationship with criterion 1.

Both by the involvement of some 100 practitioners, administrators, and researchers as panelists, and by the public debate and criticism of the panel reports, the institute aims to create a major role for the practitioner and research communities in determining the direction of government funding. The conference panels were organized around the following major points in the career of a teacher: (1) the teacher's recruitment, selection, and  retention (Panel 1); (2) training and performance, as approached from various perspectives (Panels 2-6); and (3) instructional personnel utilization (Panel 7). In addition, several special problem areas for planning and research were covered by another three panels. These were the role of the teacher in new instructional systems (Panel 8), research methodology (Panel 9), and theory development (Panel 10). Within its specific problem area, each panel refined its goal statement, outlined several approaches or overall strategies, identified potential programs within each approach, and outlined illustrative projects so far as this was appropriate and feasible.

The panel formulated six approaches for research and development within the general area of recruitment, selection, and retention which were proposed and considered on the basis of the sequence of activities or decision points in a teaching career. These approaches were concerned with analyzing and improving methods for recruiting teachers and teacher trainees, methods for selecting teacher trainees and teachers, methods for teacher placement and orientation, and the supervision and inservice education of teachers. They also dealt with investigating the relationship of teacher preparation objectives and curriculum to teacher competency and effectiveness, and the decision-making processes underlying position changes in teaching.

The panel organized its work around needs in teaching as human interaction, and proposed three research approaches based on these needs. The panel's discussion focused on these approaches as well as the organization of specific programs and projects under them. The first approach concerned research on human interaction within education settings, the goal of which was the creation of knowledge and understanding of the process of  teacher-pupil and pupil-pupil interactions during teaching and learning. Research on teacher education, which builds on the knowledge developed in research on teaching as human interaction, was the second approach. The third approach dealt with issues of methodology, instrumentation, and professional communications, and focused on the special difficulties of research on teaching as human interaction. Finally, the panel emphasized the need for taking into account the ways in which teachers will adapt research-based knowledge and teaching skills to their own classrooms, students, and styles. Such adaptations will determine the validity and utility of the knowledge to be derived from research on teaching as human interaction. (BD)",

The second discussed the development of procedures for installing and maintaining effective teaching and teacher education techniques and systems in new settings. The third approach presented procedures for the development of more effective teacher performance through teacher training, and the development and improvement of existing teacher support systems. The fourth approach concerned the  development, through empirical research, of systematic procedures that could be used to define the goals and objectives of educational programs. The development of a community education training program for parents was discussed in the fifth approach.

The panel focused on research to improve teacher performance of instructional skills and identified two basic approaches to this research. The first approach dealt with the identification of important teaching skills by (1) utilizing statements drawn from psychological, developmental, and pedagogical theories, as well as theories of subject matter; (2) analyzing observed teacher practice into skill components and showing the relation of these components to educational outcomes; and (3) utilizing reports of teachers and other persons concerning what they believed to be important teaching skills. The  second approach dealt with the identification of training and validation procedures which demonstrate how teaching skills are related to educational outcomes. This approach looked at (1) the transferability of skills, (2) the school conditions needed to optimize maintenance of important skills, (3) the development of measures to define the effectiveness of teaching skills, and (4) the relationship of skills possessed by individual teachers to educational outcomes. The panel identified specific programs of research and development related to each approach. Each program included descriptions of the criteria for judging the relevance of research projects within the program. (BD)",

From this, the panel formulated the following six approaches in order to meet their goal: (1) determine the rules governing classroom discourse and the relationship between classroom discourse and frame factors in the school; (2)  study the acquisition by students of rules for school disclosure; (3) determine ways in which differences in dialect, language style, and interactional norms affect learning in the classroom; (4) describe and analyze patterns of student-teacher communication in order to determine the effect of the social identity of the participants on ways in which teachers overtly and covertly present information; (5) specify the critical components of characteristics of natural communication situations that are necessary for the acquisition of a second language, and that will encourage native language maintenance; and (6) develop and field test materials and procedures to improve teaching, and thereby learning, on the basis of knowledge of linguistic process in classrooms.

Attention was, therefore, focused on four independent mechanisms that seemed to be most potent in attacking the difficulties involved in theory development.

The first approach called for the establishment of one or more permanent working groups for the comparative analysis, evaluation, and integration of theoretical  developments. The second approach dealt with individual programmatic theory development. Within this approach the panel identified four programs that might be supported through five-year renewable grants. In the third approach, the panel was concerned with instruction in theory development.

        "description":"State and federal educational policy is increasingly directed toward the use of business management techniques to introduce more accountability into the operation of public schools and, in the process, often to hold teachers responsible for objectives over which they have little or no control. This paper examines the concept of Management by Objectives (MBO), its mixed results in the business world, recent trends in management science, and some problems associated with setting objectives for human systems. Such concerns are related to basic differences between the educational and the industrial sectors of society, and it is concluded that business management techniques such as MBO are usually inappropriate at the instructional level with teachers and students. When MBO becomes  immersed in the instructional process as a rigid mixture of behaviorism and business management, it becomes increasingly difficult for teachers to discover and nurture creativity. MBO stresses conformity and lock-step learning and discourages deviation from established objectives. Although there is little supporting evidence, MBO may be used to improve the administration of a total educational enterprise provided the unique differences between a school and a business are anticipated.

The appropriations for the department were reduced almost immediately, and the status of the agency was undercut by reassigning it as an office in the Department of Interior. From 1867 to 1954, the United States Office of Education (USOE) and the federal government were bystanders in the field of educational research. The first breakthrough in federal policy toward educational research and development (R and D) came with the passage of the Cooperative Research Act in 1954. This Act authorized the commissioner of education to enter into \"contracts or jointly financed cooperative arrangements with universities and colleges and state educational agencies for the conduct of research, surveys, and  demonstrations in the field of education.\" In 1965, a second major breakthrough in educational R and D occurred with the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The new programs brought about by the Act typified the expansionist mood of the 1960's. It was within this mood that the National Institute of Education (NIE) was established to coordinate the government's investment in R and D. Today the policy of the federal government is more comprehensive, vigorous, and supportive than any previous policy or combination of policies have been. However, there is considerable doubt about and dissatisfaction with the federal dollar investment in educational R and D in both the executive and legislative branches of the government.

The report also discusses and considers professionalism among teachers. The major part of the report explains and discusses the structure and method of the study. The section wich deals with the results of the study contains a discussion of the original hypotheses and a general analysis of the results. The concluding observations presented and discussed stated that (1) the great majority of teachers prefer nonmilitant methods; (2) the perceived needs of the teachers focus on their professional autonomy and the recognition they receive as persons; and (3) self-fulfillment is the key to the new professionalism that is emerging.

First, the major types of physical exercise programs and the schools in which these programs operated are presented. Types of exercise programs identified include military training and exercise, gymnastics, manual training, domestic economy, calisthenics, and sports and games. Second, the major factors identified as influencing the development of physical education in New England between 1789 and 1860 are listed. They include the following: (1) concern for the health of students, (2) major contributions toward the implementation of physical education by such educators as Horace Mann, (3) influence exerted by school  leaders to bring about school reforms including reforms in physical education, and (4) the inclusion, in public schools, of physical exercise programs that had been previously used in academies and private schools. In conclusion, the author states that the time period between 1789 and 1860 was one of testing various physical exercise programs as a means of providing for the healthful physical development of students, and that many of the present day physical education concepts and activities can be traced to those begun in New England during this time.

A number of different ways of resolving the higher order commonality values into their lower orders were tried and the number and nature of solutions generated from them were examined for their meaningfulness and variability. In general it was found that this could be a meaningful exercise because it allows an analyst to test his assumptions about the nature of the confounding to see if a solution can be obtained. If one cannot be obtained then his assumptions must be revised. But if one can be obtained, then he can examine them to see which kinds of  variables have the greatest sensitivity to the assumptions. The resulting output also allows one to gauge the variability of regression coefficients that will satisfy the same set of commonality values and the effectiveness of the regression system. This technique called &quot;Reverse Commonality&quot; is best suited for an interactive computing arrangement so that an analyst can use it rapidly in a sequential manner. Since, for a large number of variables the sheer volume of commonality values become unmanageable and, since a number of different ways are available for resolving the confounding, an algorithm is needed which uniquely resolves the higher order values according to one's assumptions.

        "description":"Commonality analysis is an attempt to understand the relative predictive power of the regressor variables, both individually and in combination. The squared multiple correlation is broken up into elements assigned to each individual regressor and to each possible combination of regressors. The elements have the property that the appropriate sums not only add to squared multiple correlations with all regressors, but also to the squared multiple correlation of any subset of variables, including the simple correlations. Commonality analysis may be used as a procedure to guide a stepwise regression. Commonality analysis does not tell us anything that cannot be deduced from a table of squared multiple correlations. However, commonality analysis does help us make comparisons in an  organized manner. The purpose of this paper is to explore commonality procedures, to develop its properties, and to present a multivariate generalization for the explorations of commonality in a situation where there is more than one regressor. A new computer-oriented algorithm is also presented. (Author/BJG)",

This survey, conducted during March, 1975, involved 9,695 individual respondents; approximately one-third of which indicated that they were parents of students presently enrolled in Dade County Public Schools.  The respondent groups were: community advisory committees and other community or school-related groups, county/area administrators, elementary and secondary school principals and assistants, and elementary and secondary teachers. The degree of agreement between respondent groups was consistently high.

This scale is designed for use with third grade children. Each of the 34 items describes a positive or negative achievement experience followed by two response alternatives: one stating that the child caused the event to happen; and one that the event occurred because of an external behavioral action of someone else in the child's  environment. A score is obtained by adding all positive events for which he takes credit and all negative events for which he takes blame.

        "description":"A Markov model for predicting performance on criterion-referenced tests is presented,. The model is expressed mathematically as a function of transition matrix, a current state vector, and a future state vector. The matrix is defined in terms of conditional probabilities, i.e., the probability of making a transition to a specific future performance state given data pertaining to the student's current performance state. Performance is expressed in terms of mastery, a theoretical construct that is defined in the paper. State vectors indicate either the probability of mastery or the degree of mastery. The current state vector can be computed from available observed criterion test scores. Three examples are included which indicate how transition matrices may be computed. An example  is also provided which shows how the model can be used to predict future performance. Finally, a research application and a management application of the Markov model are mentioned.

Several additional models are also introduced. The purpose is to describe, compare, contrast, and evaluate these models while extracting such useful ideas as may be found in these approaches. The models of Thorndike, Cole, and Linn are judged to contain operational contradictions because of their use of the wrong conditional probability within the context of the probabilistic structure. These models, deriving from a concept of group parity, are also shown to have highly objectionable practical implications. It is suggested that the use of any of these models is contraindicated and that, indeed, the very  concept of culture-fair selection is unworkable. It is then suggested that the necessary level of compensatory treatment for disadvantaged persons can be guaranteed only through the formal use of an appropriate model based on the Von Neumann-Morgenstern theory of maximizing expected utility. The models of Cleary, Einhorn and Bass, Gross and Su are based on what we judge to be the correct conditional probability and are special cases of the Expected Utility Model, but each has limited applicability.

The present study describes six factors of &quot;behavioral cognition&quot; or social intelligence suggested by Guilford's Structure of Intellect model. These social intelligence factors are defined by 23 tests using photographs, cartoons and other drawn materials, and tape-recorded sounds. The six behavioral-cognition factors are shown to be distinct from factors defined by 24 tests of verbal aptitude, spatial ability, and  creative thinking. The 18 reference and experimental factors hypothesized and demonstrated are described and discussed. To date no similar factors, reflecting the abilities involved in understanding the feelings and intentions of others, have been reported.

Results indicated the flexilevel score distribution better reflected the underlying normal distribution of ability, and that the flexilevel test had a higher paralleled-forms reliability and a higher relationship to underlying ability level than did the conventional test. The overall test-retest stability of the two tests was equivalent, but there was evidence indicating that memory effects inflated the stability of the flexilevel test scores less than that of conventional test scores. The flexilevel provided more accurate measurement at almost  all ability levels, although its information function was similar in shape to that of the conventional test. However, the interpretation of differences in the level of information provided were confounded by differences in the average discriminating power of the items in the two tests. The flexilevel test also appeared to reduce random guessing behavior in comparison to the conventional test. (Author)",

        "description":"Under contract with the Oregon State Department of Education, Educational Testing Service (ETS) assisted in the preparation of a fourth grade reading assessment test based on, or modified from, Instructional Objectives Exchange materials. ETS produced test books, answer sheets, and all required ancillary materials necessary for test distribution and administration to a sample of 104 schools, previously selected on the basis of geographic region, district wealth, and district size. Rights, Wrongs, and &quot;Don't Know&quot; pupil scores were reported to schools and districts for 25 specific reading objectives and 4 grouped objectives (word attack, vocabulary, comprehension, and application). Summary statistics for schools were also prepared and distributed. A special vocabulary self-report  section/score was included in both reports. At the state level, a number of item analyses were performed, and a series of weight frequency distributions prepared. A total of 4,127 pupils at 102 schools actually took the test with 299 pupils reported as absent. (Author)",

        "description":"Responses on both the state and trait scales of the State-Trait Anxiety (STAI) Inventory were examined under two conditions. The first condition presented a simulated real-life situation containing competitive and evaluative cues without directly suggesting faking and asked subjects to complete the STAI. After an intervening task, the STAI was readministered under standard instructions. The hypothesis that subjects would respond consistently on the A-trait scale, while demonstrating increased levels of A-state was confirmed. Results were interpreted as consistent with the distinction between trait anxiety as a relatively permanent attribute of the individual and state anxiety as a transitory characteristic which fluctuates with the environment. However, the results conflict with  traditional notions of social desirability response bias, which imply that &quot;faking good&quot; should lead to consistent changes on both scales. There is little doubt that &quot;faking good&quot; can lead to distortions of scores on affective measures. However, subjects do not necessarily actually &quot;fake good&quot; in situations where they have no definite instructions to fake. (Author/RC)",

The computer programs were written in A Programming Language (APL). The current implementation of the program is characterized by its capability to: read responses from a DATRONIC answer sheet; allow the faculty member the option of omitting items from the analysis; check for omitted items; allow the faculty member the option of selecting specific reports; and collect descriptive statistics concerning the system performance and characteristics of the test analyzed. The complete set of reports generated by the test analysis program provide information normally included in an analysis of a norm-referenced test. The fixed costs for the test analysis system are the  3M Datronic System and the Anderson Jacobson terminal. If you assume a lease option for each component of the system then the approximate cost will be $240 per month. This fixed cost can be allocated on the assumption of full utilization of the system with an average cost of $1.50 per hour for a 40 hour week. When the costing formula was applied to the data base of 88 sets of tests, the average and median cost were determined to be $8.37 and $7.83 respectively. (Author/RC)",

Ten measures of a battery along with a reading test were administered to adolescent males, 14 to 18 years of age, held in pretrial detention. The 11 tests were validated against 37 criterion variables encompassing post-detention performance outcomes in areas of social, community, and job adjustments. Criterion information was obtainable from about one-quarter of the sample who could be followed up about 6 to 11 months after release. Some descriptive characteristics were: they read at a \"functionally illiterate\" level; 67 percent had obtained full-time employment mostly in low paying, poor quality jobs; they adjusted fairly in terms of family and  community relations, and expressed a desire to stay out of trouble. In terms of validation content, eight measures produced patterns of significant validities to support their potential for further development as guidance tools applicable to adolescent offenders.

The problem addressed was one of maximally mapping all students into 8 of 12 vocational programs in terms of their preferences for studying each of the programs and the assignment restrictions established by the school. To minimize the errors of misplacement and produce a successful algorithm for the problem faced, it was found that a procedure had to be devised which both individually-referenced and group-referenced students' program preferences into one meaningful statistic. In general terms, this problem was one of combining bipolar data so that every plus-minus combination produced a unique scale point. The values of this latter scale made it possible to  determine which students should be assigned to what programs under the criteria specified. Once all students were assigned to programs, this same scaling procedure was used to develop a sequence statistic which allowed programs to be maximally ordered for those students most likely to be affected by this variable. Twelve percent of the student body (N=440) expressed dissatisfaction with the program assignments they received. Interviews, however, revealed that most of these students misunderstood the restrictions governing assignments. (Author)",

        "description":"The Rasch item analysis model is supposed to yield norm-free estimates of ability and easiness values, but there are several possible interpretations of the nature and extent of such norm-freeness. One such interpretation was that to involve the scores of one single experimental group of testees which were embedded in four differently skewed distributions of other scores, the testees had been administered easy and hard sets of items for the verifications of person-free and item-free ability estimations. Similarly for the verifications of person-and item-free easiness estimation by the Rasch model, the study involved the formation of four differently skewed sets of items in terms of their proportion right easiness values among which the same single set of experimental items had  been embedded. These four sets of items were administered to bright and dumb groups of examinees. The no-guessing and constant discrimination power assumptions of the Rasch model were respectively made to be satisfied by using the cloze test blanks as items and by removing those blanks outside a narrow range of discrimination indices. Because of the possibility that the estimation errors may critically depend on the number of ties at each raw score level making the Rasch estimates of ability and easiness statistically different from one group of examinees or set of items at each of these score levels, a linear prediction model was used with the raw pupil scores or item easiness as predictors.

The Classroom Attitude Observation Schedule technique has been implemented in a number of school districts as a means of assessing program implementation of the Tucson Early Education Model (TEEM). Teachers have found this a useful way to learn more about the effects of the program on the social functioning of children. The Children's Language Assessment-Situational Tasks represents a new direction in the assessment of children's language development at the preschool and early elementary level. The developmental program has led to the conclusion that this technique samples aspects of children's development  in a valid context, and provides information for teachers which is applicable to improving the instruction of young children. Situational tasks have proven valuable in the elusive task of evaluating an innovative open classroom program. Future efforts will be directed toward other areas of the TEEM program, such as the development of cognitive skills through the cooking experience. (Author/RC)",

Significantly higher scores were observed for MTs organized in groups of five premises and for MTs designed to measure higher-order achievement levels.

The overall purpose of the notebook is to provide sufficient numbers of test items at various levels of difficulty so that reading development at a given level may be monitored periodically with the administration of a series of comparable test forms. The starting point for the notebook has been literal comprehension, and the work in process has two  emphases: one is applying the cloze technique in testing literal comprehension; the other is systematizing the writing of multiple-choice items for literal comprehension by specifying the type of questions to be asked and establishing rules for writing them.

These factors aid the researcher, teacher, and counselor in understanding the individual's preferred mode of behavior in groups as well as indicating the students' reaction to group situations. Primarily research instruments, the tests are based on the conceptual framework of the Hill Interaction Matrix (HIM) (1965). This is a two dimensional matrix which describes a person's preferred content and work-style modes of group behavior. The tests are based on the 16 cells of the HIM. Four items were included for each cell for a total of 64 items. The original item pool of the HIM as well as the cell labels were used as  criteria for development and selection of the items. Items were simplified for children in respective grade levels and were rated by judges as to their appropriateness for each cell. The response format was simplified to a two position &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; format for the primary form and to a three position--&quot;Usually&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Not Often&quot;, format for the intermediate form. Besides the tests, data are provided on: reliability, validity, factor analysis, norms, scoring, and correlations. (Author/RC)",

The centers were supported mainly by the Minneapolis Public Schools although ESEA Title I funds provided teacher aides. This report covers the fifth year's operation of the project. Substantial changes made in the centers' operations are described. The goals of the program included remediation of subskill weaknesses, achievement of functional reading levels, and raising the rate of reading growth of children in Target Area schools who were one or more years below grade level in reading. Individualized instruction was provided for 604 students from grades 4-9 from 23 schools. A multimedia approach was used which included programs used in a variety of teaching machines as well as  individual instruction in related classrooms. The students, who came from Title I Target Area schools, made grade equivalent gains well above what would have been expected for average children working at the reading levels of the Gates-MacGinitie and Stanford Primary Achievement tests which were the measuring instruments. About 70 percent of the students made grade equivalent gains on the Gates Comprehension test over those expected for the pre-posttest span of six months. Two thirds of the pupils made such gains on the Stanford Word Study skills tests. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"In developing tests for the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) survey, methodological problems arose in three areas: curriculum, communication, and culture. Efforts to identify the core of common objectives and the penumbra of distinctive, sometimes partly shared but sometimes unique, goals operated through a system of national and international committees. Each country was given the responsibility of assembling a national committee, each having the task of preparing a national blueprint of content and process objectives that would be appropriate at the specified age or grade levels in that country. Through interaction with national and international committees, items were selected, edited, and assembled into preliminary forms for  try-out. Communication was a problem in maintaining the flow of information, materials, and actions out to the participating countries and back to the central coordinating office. In a more specific sense, communication was a problem in the domain of language and translation. Problems involved in the area of culture were semantic and in picking a set of quantitative alternatives giving good differentiation between countries. (Author/RC)",

A gain of one month or more in grade equivalents (using Gates-MacGinitie tests) for each month of attendance at the centers by at least 50 percent of the students was the specific objective of the project. In 1972-73 the program again more than achieved its goal. Test results showed that 85 percent of the 218 students with gain scores made grade equivalent gains in comprehension greater than gains expected for length of enrollement in the program. The median grade equivalent gain was +1.6 although the students had been on roll for less than half the school year. The project featured the use of TV-like  teaching machines and educational materials developed by Dorsett Educational Systems. Machines were housed in two large trailers which were located at Bryant and North secondary schools. Although students operated the machines and tested their own progress at the end of each lesson, assistance was available from the certified reading teacher and paraprofessional who staffed each trailer. Financial support for this project came from Title I, ESEA. Several recommendations, including continuation of the project, were made. (Author)",

It is reasoned that such a model would furnish a bridge between task analysis and test selection, and also a bridge between test selection and test validation. Such a mechanism might answer some fo the EEOC criticisms of psychological testing because of the inherent content validity of the technique. In addition, the technique could be used to produce task analyses of both a job and training for that job. A comparison of the structural task analyses of the job and job training would expose discrepancies where abilities not required on the job are required for training. It might be then possible to modify training to bring the abilities required for training  more in line with those required for the job, thus ultimately providing a bridge between task analysis through selection to training.

The committee recommended that tests be given in the spring instead of the fall, as before, that tests be given in grades 3, 6, and 8, and that a pilot study be conducted by the Research and Evaluation Department to select one test for each grade from among those tests which had passed the initial screening. Five tests were under consideration at the third grade level (the SRA, the CAT, the Stanford, and the Metropolitan Form F and Primary II), four at the sixth grade level (the SRA, the CAT, the  Stanford, and the Metropolitan Form F), and three tests at the eighth grade level (the SRA, the CAT, and the Stanford). The Stanford series was eliminated because testing materials could not be obtained in time for the pilot test. Each of the tests was given in three classrooms. Each teacher administering one of the tests responded to a questionnaire on the test used. Similar ratings were obtained on all the tests for: face validity, reading difficulty, cultural bias, pupil motivation, administration instructions, and interpretation instructions. Based on the limited evidence from this pilot tests, it was recommended that the SRA be selected. (Author/RC)",

The primary objectives of the center are to improve basic skills achievement and to modify inappropriate behavior. Approximately 50 students attend the center at one time. Most are 8th and 9th graders although several are 7th graders. The center's students made excellent progress in the basic skills area of reading and math as measured by standardized reading and math achievement tests. Similar results were made during the 1971-72 school year. The YES Center has clearly demonstrated during the past two years that low-achieving students who exhibit antisocial behavior have made good  progress in basic skill subjects of reading and math. The center's typical student made vocabulary gains of 1.5 months on the Gates-MacGinitie Test and 2.0 months gain on the Stanford Word Meaning Test for each month they were in the program. On the Gates-MacGinitie Comprehension Test the students made 1.8 months gain for each month in the program. They made 2.2 months on the Stanford Paragraph Meaning Tests for each month in the program. The grade equivalent gain for Arithmetic Computation was 1.8 months gain for each month in the program; for Arithmetic Concepts, 1.8; and for Arithmetic Application, 2.3 months gain for each month in the program.

This is accomplished by use of a large national sample of males and females, along with analyses that incorporate both descriptive and causal approaches. Specific priorities of student choice and the potential influences stemming from family, peers, school, and skill-achievements that shape educational and vocational decisions are described. In addition, assessment is made of the relative contributions of each of those personal-demographic characteristics and causal modes by which they are likely to exercise their impact. Not only should such information provide clues for shaping high school curricula, or  individualizing courses and programs, it should also aid in guiding students along more effective educational paths through an understanding of the consequences of their decisions. Thus, a major focus of the analysis is on identifying, where feasible, the comparative differences between plans and aspirations of students enrolled in differing curricula and unique influences that impinge on such decisions for members of each group.

        "description":"This paper examines urban schools serving minorities, and begins by arguing that inservice development is the greatest need of the American school system, one that needs many things. The time that a teacher spends in effective inservice activity is more important for the future of pupils than the same amount of time spent with those pupils. Though the impact of formal instruction is as ineffective in an inservice progam as it is in most other settings, a program of formal instruction is an integral part of inservice development. It is held that such a program should be designed to supply instruction in specific skills, attitudes, and knowledge that will complement and reinforce the problem-solving in which staff members are engaged in their daily lives. In discussing the informal  inservice climate within the school building and of the school district, the paper emphasizes the role of the principal. It is asserted that no other function gives the superintendent so much power to effect improvements in school districts as the power to appoint and assign school principals. Finally, the paper focuses on the importance of responsible problem-solving at the school building level. Four issues seen as vitally affecting instruction in multiracial and multiethnic school districts are briefly dealt with -- integration, isolation, time, and collective bargaining. (Author/JM)",

The sample interviewed was said not to fit into the stereotype of the isolated ghetto dweller who has no concern for, or contact with his or her fellow residents. It pointed to the importance of both the kinship system and that of other primary ties such as friends and  neighbors. Two logical and important extensions to this urban network research are said to include a study of the social networks moving out beyond the individual black respondent and her immediate circle of friends and relatives, and a controlled longitudinal mobility research study of black families in alternate housing--with an interview before the move and followed by a series of repeated interviews subsequent to the move.

These are: (1) the depopulation of the family, said to be largely attributable to the changes, assumptions, and newly generated demands for consumption, and not to the faults of individual parents; (2) the intellectualization of the child, said to originate in the nature of the American economic system and its influence on the school systems -- quantifying, measuring, and using these measurements to perpetuate the relative positions of existing groups in the society; and, (3) the problem of perpetuation of exclusion, siad to affect children  characterized by the four factors of race, poverty, handicap, and parents overwhelmed by life. This last problem is discussed and explained in terms of the economic system. A final section on individual uplift and social change concludes by underlining the posited contrast between individual blame and uplift, and the need for social and economic change. (Author/AM)",

        "description":"This document examines the data on changes in the ethnic composition of the schools in Milwaukee, and relates them to student achievement. A consideration of the relationship of ethnicity and academic achievement is said to entail six questions as follows: how ethnic proportions of pupils have changed over a ten-year period; their patterns of achievement in reading and math during an eight-year period; the relationship between percent of minority in school and reading/math achievement; whether the strength of the relationship changes with an increase in proportion of minority pupils; whether the rate of change in ethnicity affects the proportion of the relationship; and the extent to which open enrollment serves as voluntary desegregation or resegregation. Minority subgroups  included American Indian, black, Asian, and Spanish-surnamed children. Findings of the study noted an increase in the number of minority pupils with a decrease of non-minority pupils in the ten-year period. Open enrollment is said to have had a slight effect in increasing segregation. Although achievement in reading and math are said to have decreased, a reduced rate of decrease had been found. A double proportion of minority students in the eight-year period had not been found to increase the strength of the relationship between proportion of minority students and achievement, and rate of change in ethnicity not found to show a stable relationship with the variable of student achievement.

Language and gestures are said to define the involvement of these groups with authorities either as joint participation in policy making or as conflict. Whether a political action is perceived as either a form of participation or as a form of conflict is said to depend on linguistic and gestural categorization. This dichotomy is stated to hold far-reaching consequences for public support or opposition to regimes, and compliance with or resistance to rules. The poor are seen to lack informal sanctions that confer influence, but can threaten elites by causing disorder-a political weapon which the poor renounce on becoming  politicized. Among the topics discussed are private versus public issues, politicization as co-optation, influences versus ritual, the use of disorder, the structuring of perception through politicization, intense politicization, clarification and blurring of adversary relations, and antipolitics.

A basic goal of the study is said to consist in accounting for the educational experience of children over time. Two beginning chapters describe public schools and American society, and the methodology of the study. A third chapter on the St. Louis public schools provides a backdrop from which is analyzed the activities of an individual classroom within the system. An introduction to the Attucks School follows, along with a description of its social and cultural milieu. Four subsequent chapters which follow are said to demonstrate the impact of teachers' expectations, initially based on a series of  subjectively interpreted social criteria for both the anticipated academic potential and subsequent differential treatment accorded to students perceived as having dissimilar social status. A final chapter on black children in a public school provides a summary, conclusions, considerations for innovation (policy and programs), and the perceptions of low-income children.

Among the significant results listed are a decreased incidence of drug abuse, a raised level of youth employment, and an  increased input of young persons to organizations having effect on youth. An unsuccessful resolution of the conflict between the agency's commitment to advocacy and the city's lack of desire to be associated with what were stated to be &quot;politically sensitive&quot; issues is listed as a negative finding or shortfall.

One, the Mobile Learning Unit, said to have been designed to measure changes in fourth and fifth grade students' self-concept in a reorganized desegregated school environment, focuses on whether a positive self-concept comes (1) from a decrease of academic deficiencies through remediation procedures or from a program designed to increase success identities; (2) from neither of these; or (3) from both of these treatments. Results did not support either treatment, yet the self-concept changes were stated to be encouraging. The other program consists of a telephone hotline said to have been designed to allow students who have problems to  telephone a central location and receive advice and direction with some degree of anonymity. The assumption that pre-adolescents are more apt to talk to an unknown peer was proven invalid. Hotline helpers were found to be unable to relax enough to calmly discuss the caller's problems in depth. The program as operating under its present structure was not recommended for continuation.

A rationale for in-service training in the context of the under-achievement of children from minority ethnic groups is provided. There is also a discussion of four basic ideas agreed upon by the discussants to represent the range of present provisions: those of diversity, school oriented courses, training trainers, and resources. The booklet is also said to provide some evaluation of the differing purposes and influences of the various courses which have taken place through a presentation of five case studies. A need for  diversity of provision within in-service training, and clarification of purpose and implication of each type of course are among the needs identified by the conclusions. Seven recommendations, among which is the need for interaction between school management and total staff, are made.

One hundred children participated in this six month program considered to be strongly oriented toward reading improvement. A program description is followed by a listing of program objectives, which focus on the improvement of reading and reading skills through motivation and interest in the arts, and on correction of reading weaknesses by workshops devoted to reading. Methods and procedures used in conducting the evaluation follow. The program is considered to exceed the requirements of its stated objectives, particularly in terms of reading improvement scores.  Several conclusions are drawn from the evaluation. Among them are that it is possible to effectively teach reading in a program focusing on the arts, and possible to enhance attitudes toward academic subjects, along with aspirations and self-concepts, through this program of instruction. A series of recommendations made include continuation and extension of program to a year-round five-day basis and the initiation of additional programs patterned on the present program. (Author/AM)",

Findings reveal that 33 percent of the families with adequate money expenditure on food had inadequate diets, while 77 percent of the families require larger expenditures to provide adequate diets. Families with the lowest per capita incomes were found to have the most inadequate diets. Most diets were below recommended allowances of fruits, vegetables, milk, bread, and  cereals. Inadequate nutrition was stated to be related more to lack of use of knowledge than to lack of knowledge itself, and to family size rather than to amount of money income. Recommendations included that further research be conducted with these families regarding dietary behavior and the application of nutrition education. (Author/AM)",

Two considerations are said to have been employed in reviewing the effectiveness of SEA practices: the extent to which Title I funds are used for high priority educational needs and the extent of improvements due to the use of funds. Although variations among the 14 states reviewed are found, a pattern of change for the better is stated to exist, perhaps due to clearer guidelines from the USOE, more effective Federal and SEA monitoring processes, and better familiarity and acceptance of the  requirements of the program by many SEA's. Further improvement is considered to be necessary as 12 percent of Title I funds are still not being used for high priority needs. Recommendations include (1) closer monitoring of procedures used by SEA's in reviewing and approving projects, along with on-site monitoring; and (2) requiring SEA's to provide LEA's with information and training on the requirements for educating deprived children.

A section on currently operating projects focuses on areas of the State Board of Education priorities and federally mandated areas. It categorizes 24 projects among human relations, early childhood education, and reading. While complete evaluation data is not available for new projects, a sense of direction is said to be indicated for those in operation for two years. One  additional program in early childhood education, said to have been funded for representing an area of national concern, is also described. The biggest impact of Title III on Maryland is held to consist in the advancement of early childhood education and education for the handicapped. Projects are summarized in chart form and appear in the appendix. The appendix also includes information on state educational needs considered critical and on project funding in priority areas.

Areas concerning educational decisions, shared as goals by lay communities and school people, are considered to be: institutional responsiveness, affective and material community support to schools, educational achievement, and the democratic principle (said to express the norm in this society that people affected by public institutions should participate in their governance). Four paths through which involvement may affect educational achievement (believed to be the most important shared goal) are cited: existing evidence to support the paths of parent self-efficacy; institutional/child congruence; community support; and, student self-efficacy. Speculations about needed additional  research are also made. (Author/AM)",

Information and data used in evaluation utilized both quantitative and qualitative measures such as standardized achievement tests, questionnaires, and interviews. The instructional improvement efforts are said to have resulted in significantly higher achievement of children enrolled in the target schools. Those children enrolled in preschool experiences sponsored by the project also had a higher degree of  achievement in elementary school than did comparable children not provided such preschool experiences. Positive influences on teacher attitudes and performance are reported. The overall evaluation is stated to be positive but more systematic efforts to evaluate the impact of the project desirable.

The first section examines the fair administration of disciplines and includes such topics as psychological perspectives, a principal's viewpoint, and the politics of administering a student discipline code. Under the general rubric of the present scope of school authority and student rights, the second portion considers various substantive and procedural issues such as changes in special education, student records, fact  finding techniques, attendance policies, alternative placement, due process, police-school contacts, juvenile courts, and public schools. Three models focusing on curriculum, school policies, and inservice training are introduced and described in detail in the final portion of this report.

Through individualized study packets and a community survey, the students acquired information about job opportunities in the clothing field. Certain basic skills were developed by the students in the course of the program, and positive work attitudes and habits were fostered. The program consisted of three phases. In the first phase, self-contained learning packets instructed  students in very basic skills and permitted extensive skill attainment, providing them with specialized interests and an opportunity to concentrate on one area. A simulated laboratory was operated in the second phase with all students participating in the various roles needed for occupational garmentmaking services. The third phase provided on-the-job training in local businesses for 12th grade students with the adequate skills and competencies. A followup study conducted after one year of employment indicated a third of the students who had completed the program were employed in a related field.

In the elementary grades the program stressed the importance of work and workers and introduced some very basic careers. On the junior and senior high school levels, a career guidance and placement center served as the hub of career exploration, planning and placement, providing resource materials, and coordinating community involvement. The program also provided career information to parents and teachers to enable them to more adequately fulfill their guidance responsibilities. Operation Partnership surveyed local business and industry to gain information to more effectively educate students for the world of work.  Provisions were also made for field trips, on-the-job experience, and job training. The results of the independent third party evaluation are included in the report. (Author/NJ)",

Business, industry, and labor became involved and loaned support to the project. A K-14 curriculum guide was developed and career information centers established in all four schools--elementary, junior high, senior high, and postsecondary. A job bank of microfiche proved to be the most effective activity to bring interested high school students into the career information center. Results of the third party evaluation were positive for teacher and counselor roles and attitudes, the career centers development and use,  community awareness and interest, staff workshops, student awareness of post high school education, and career awareness in elementary children.

The general objectives involved the development of a guidance program, integration of occupational information into the classroom, skills training, placement, and attitude adjustment. Career education curriculum material suitable to all levels of elementary classes was developed. The counselor-coordinator coordinated guidance activities, parent conferences, home visitations, placement activities, and information dissemination. Occupational training programs were conducted, and six skill development classes were held in automotive services, data processing food services, clerical procedures, offset printing, and typing. Regular  assemblies focusing on student accomplishments were held. Other features of the program were outside speakers, weekly group guidance sessions, group trips, newsletter, and various social functions. It was concluded that the program has made a definite impact on the students and the school community, reaching students who were unskilled and uninvolved and helping them to regard themselves as potentially valuable employees. A third party evaluation, occupational information, student inventory forms for the elementary and secondary level, and tabulated inventory results are included in the report.

A total of 37 school corporations in an economically depressed rural area participated in an effort to infuse career education concepts into their existing curriculum. Through inservice activities, teachers experienced the techniques involved in unit writing and curriculum development and were exposed to the variety of ways career related concepts may be integrated into the subject areas. Both teachers and students became better informed of the career opportunities available in their communities and observed firsthand, workers functioning in their roles. As a result of the mobile units, a large population  became acquainted with the variety of resource materials available in the area of career education. Utilization of community personnel in program development increased the community's awareness of career education and its many merits. Appendixes contain a model for the infusion of career education concepts into current curriculum, public relations materials, teacher performance objectives (K-12), and the third party evaluator's summary of the second operational year.

Occupational information of entry level type jobs was disseminated to the teachers. In evaluation, it was found that the experimental materials were superior to materials currently in use when criterion measures were achievement and  performance tests.

The purpose of the program was to provide classroom instruction and exploration-placement activities that would enable the student to gain knowledge about himself in relationship to his personal worth, relationship to others, his attitudes, interests, capabilities, and to use this self-knowledge in making occupational decisions. The program involved simulated activities, work experiences, classroom instruction in job acquisition skills, and classroom experiences in clarifying values, identifying interests and abilities, and in developing goal-setting and decision-making skills. A teaching resource  guide and student handbook are appended to the project report. The teaching guide is a compilation of learning activities engaged in during the project year. The materials were selected and developed by the teachers to meet the students' needs in occupational competencies through exploration experiences both within the schools and within the community.

The project design consisted of an awareness component for grades 1-6, an exploration component for grades 7-9, a preparation component for grades 10-12, and a guidance component integrated with the other three. A regional career education staff directed and coordinated the program which sought to involve the community as much as possible. The five phases of the project described are: orientation, preparation, inservice, implementation, and evaluation. The report concludes that a regional concept to the delivery of a program in career education is workable and effective and provides  a means of reaching a great number of persons. During the second year, the program reached over 22,000 students. Appended are: (1) a 75-page section covering teacher workshops in career awareness and career exploration, with detailed outlines of individual learning modules; (2) evaluation instruments and results; and (3) agendas of other related workshops and conferences.

The author first describes three groups of children with different life environments--the advantaged, the silent majority, and the disadvantaged. The significance of possible educational alternatives is then related to the three groups. The first educational alternative is renewed academic planning, holding that there is nothing basically wrong with the present subject-centered curriculum and educational practice. A second alternative is the free-school movement, or the \"de-schooled society\" of Ivan Illich, proposing a structureless school in which the child guides himself. There is a real potential in the concept of a freer school,  which would emphasize choice and individual determination in place of authority and control. However, this existentialist structureless school does not place human development in the proper context of social relationships. The educational system has an obligation to society as well as to the individual. The third alternative is career education, which would give all children the means of coping with the problems of their environment through developing a sense of vocation. (MF)",

The growing recognition that home economics at the secondary and middle school levels provides important knowledge, attitudes, and skills for the adolescent male is discussed. The existing barriers to male students' involvement in home economics classes are described and identified: community involvement, parental attitudes, peer attitudes, attitudes of school personnel, and teacher attitudes. Some general observations on understanding and teaching boys are presented. The need for considering the masculine self-image is also discussed. Detailed suggestions for curriculum development include  methods of recruitment and ideas for adapting course content and activities to the needs of males in co-educational classes. Specific areas of the curriculum discussed are: child development, clothing and textiles, food and nutrition, housing and home management, personal development and family relations, and occupational home economics. The report concludes that the inclusion of males in the home economics curriculum is a forward step which requires teachers to become acquainted with male students' characteristics, needs, and attitudes in order to provide relevant and interesting instruction.

The Health Education Curriculum outlines 10 basic concepts and areas of study: social living, mental health, nutrition, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, hygiene, physical fitness, consumer health, and birth/aging process/death. Health Careers lists jobs in these areas and presents instructions for classroom activities, with an outline of elements to be studied in terms of each career area given. The Business Education Curriculum presents separate outlines for each grade with a two-page guide regarding specific texts and audiovisual aids not identified in full. Public service, communications and media,  marketing and distribution, transportation, and business and office are covered in the seventh grade curriculum outline; job orientation and a review of clusters studied in seventh grade are in the eighth grade outline. The Industrial Arts Curriculum outlines separate curricula for each grade, with a two-page guide regarding a specific text, Exploring. The seventh grade outline covers natural resources, environmental, marine science, manufacturing, agri-business, transportation, construction, and a sample unit on agri-business, with the eighth grade curriculum adding a mini course in careers.

        "description":"The guidebook is intended to acquaint vocational educators with two specific management strategies: Management by Objectives (MBO) and the Program Planning and Budget System (PPBS). The long range goal of this project is the formation of a model local annual plan and model five year plan for vocational education in local school districts throughout Indiana. For this reason, it was necessary to examine the theoretical bases for MBO and PPBS as well as to develop detailed, practical steps for implementing the systems at the local level. Chapter 1 presents the rationale for the development of the MBO system, and examines its benefits and pitfalls. Chapters 2 through 5 detail the theory and practical applications of the four phases of MBO: (1) establishing mission and role  statements, (2) setting and validating objectives, (3) developing action plans to achieve objectives, and (4) developing a performance appraisal system. Chapter 6 defines PPBS and discusses its advantages and disadvantages. The document concludes with appended worksheets and evaluation forms. (Author/BP)",

A pretest was administered to 75 adults not currently involved in formal educational programs, and 40 participants were selected whose pretest indicated no knowledge or limited knowledge of the metric system. The learning experience was presented by the Plato 4 computer system, which recorded each participant's learner trail (record of moves) and the corresponding time data. A posttest was administered after participants' decision to end the learning; the posttest was followed by an interview to determine learner reactions. The data strongly supported the idea of learning styles, as each participant  had a particular way of moving through the lesson (sequencing, pacing, and distribution of moves), and it also was possible to cluster participants according to learning styles. No relationship was indicated between membership in a particular learning style cluster and level of prior knowledge, age, sex, educational level, or recency of education. Approximately one-fourth of the participants were aware of a conscious strategy or plan of study. The high scores on the posttest made it impossible to determine the relative effectiveness of various styles. (EA)",

The syllabus is arranged in three columns: (1) minimum acceptable content of study which requires 80 percent of the course time in instruction, (2) instructional objectives based on student performance, and (3) teaching suggestions. The course of study is divided into six sections: general orientation (2 areas), the medical assistant (4 areas), body structure and function (15 areas), administrative duties (4 areas), clinical duties (5 areas), and technical duties (3 areas). A discussion on the relationship of clinical experience, a sample  clinical experience agreement, procedures for obtaining certification, a resource list of instructional materials, and source directory of suppliers are appended.

        "description":"The handbook is comprised of materials related to the implementation of Operation COPE, a Washington, D.C., demonstration Adult Basic Education (ABE) project for low-income young mothers who are heads of households, developed by the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW). The project featured a curriculum which integrated coping skills with Adult Basic Education; a method of inservice training for professionals and paraprofessionals in ABE programs; and a model of an advisory committee for ABE programs. The handbook reveals the work processes by which Operation COPE intervened in the cycle of poverty, functional illiteracy, and deprived family life by involving the mothers in diagnosing their own needs and in planning, conducting, and evaluating their own learning; by involving  them in parent and citizenship training and enrichment activities; by providing participants with the added support of NCNW's network of volunteers; and by establishing opportunities for them to acquire needed services through the project's linkages with other community agencies and organizations. The young mothers, interested in acquiring job skills, requested typing, sewing, and crafts classes; reading, mathematics, parenting, home economics, and other skills were introduced only as the mothers perceived needs for them. Sample instructional materials and participant data are among the materials included in the document. (Author/AJ)",

Questionnaires were sent to 2,523 graduates of which 1,796 were returned. Information was collected regarding their employment patterns, economic and social factors that affected their career choices, and educational patterns. Most program graduates were employed in education (96 percent) upon program completion. Data are analyzed and compared for graduates who were currently employed in education (84.3 percent) and in business or industry (12.1 percent). Those who left education found employment in the professional, technical, and managerial fields. Conclusions based on the data showed that both groups of  respondents came from comparable home backgrounds, they were influenced by similar conditions in their decision to enter the program, they had similar familial occupational patterns, and graduates employed in education obtained more postbaccalaureate education and earned less than graduates employed in business or industry.

Findings are arranged under four headings, discussing: (1) documents, examining all project documents from 1973-75 in terms of objectives, structure, and achievements; (2) policy board, examining perceptions of role, outcomes, judgments, objectives, evidence, and  decision making; (3) administrators and supervisors, listing interview questions and responses; and (4) other findings, including data on advisory boards, questionnaires, staff perceptions, and follow-up on previous recommendations. A numerated summary of findings includes the following statements: the purpose and objectives of the project have remained constant; very little change has occurred in Board member perceptions; administrators and supervisors consistently rate the project highly; and there is no consistency in advisory board organization throughout Region 8.

The handbook includes four types of information; (1) an introduction to the Appalachian Adult Education Center (AAEC) experience, (2) justification for ETV utilization in open broadcast, (3) a management planning system for adult ETV, and (4) ETV utilization data collection forms, and figures illustrating analysis systems. The discussion and the systems design are based upon the AAEC experience in a comprehensive demonstration study of an adult educational television series, Kentucky Educational Television's General Education Development Preparation Series (KET/GED),  a high school equivalency examination preparation series. The study was conducted in Kentucky as part of an AAEC project entitled Community Education: Comparative GED Strategies. The handbook identifies even the most nominal person-to-person contact as the critical element in the successful utilization of ETV, critical to student involvement, retention, perseverence, and successful achievement. The administrator is advised that, since the goal of the adult education program is the adults achievement, not the maintenance of the program or class, monies invested to ensure the maximum numbers of adults achieving are appropriate.

Currently, individual program areas are predominantly one sex or the other, with the exception of distributive education. Females comprise approximately 55 percent of all vocational education enrollments, but half of this number exit from the system without specific skill training. Agriculture/technical education/trade and industrial programs contain only limited numbers of females. While females account for 45 percent of the total distributive education enrollment, their employment is concentrated at the lower levels of retail trade. Under Education Amendments of 1972, vocational education will have from one to three years to eliminate any sex-based course requirements, both written  policy or attitudinal constraints. Priority areas for vocational education include: (1) a recruiting and informational plan conducted with guidance personnel to encourage males and females to enter non-traditional vocational programs; (2) a focus in home economics courses on examining male/female role expectations and their limitations; (3) units on discrimination in the work world; and (4) additional training and education programs for mature women, especially in skilled trades and apprenticeable occupations.

A total of 117 supervisory nurses and unit managers from four Western Michigan short-term general hospitals in the 410-540 bed range participated in the survey in February-March 1975. The survey's specially constructed questionnaire (provided in an appendix) contains five sections: the first four cover biographical information, educational and work history, present work situations, and management training; the fifth lists 101 task statements organized into seven functional management areas for each of which respondents completed scales for frequency, importance, and desire for additional  training. Although the importance scale was found to be unusable, the other scales were not. The study concluded that: supervisory nurses are managers by definition of the tasks they perform; management tasks, as identified by functional areas, differ between job titles; head nurses demonstrate a high level of management task performance across unit specialties; the presence of unit managers does not affect the pattern of head nurse management task performance; supervisory nurses desire additional training in management tasks; and supervisory nurses feel inadequately trained for their management role.

        "description":"Except for several Human Resources Research Organization studies of the military, no systematic study has been made of the effects of attitudes and incentives on manpower availability. One such study explored the effects of early Army experience in the career orientation of Army recruits and found that early positive motivation for service was inversely related to effectiveness. Another study explored the enlistment recruiting process and found that two-thirds of the potential recruits actually enlisted in the Army but that the occupational options chosen did not adequately match recruit qualifications or Army needs. A third study analyzed career orientation questionnaires of 2,000 Warrant Officer aviators and found that combining items on background, wives' attitudes, career  attitudes, and career intentions into a simple composite score produced a correlation of 0.63 with retention vs. departure. These and other studies demonstrate that studies of motivation and incentives can play a significant role in shaping decisions about national policies regarding military service and civilian occupations. With present-day data systems and data processing capabilities, much more can and should be done to continually update knowledge of the effects of motivation on manpower availability. (JR)",

The second phase of the research required developing an occupational survey instrument specifically designed for Air Force basic trainees. Criterion comparison (CRICOM) or error values were used with an analysis of variance design to determine the relative validities for subjective time rating scales. It was found that five-point relative scales were inferior to the other scales tested and that job incumbents could use scales of greater complexity than had previously been indicated in the literature. Results of the  investigation indicate that a nine-point relative time spent scale yield the most accurate job description data from job incumbents using the Air Force developed occupational analysis methodology. Four appendixes covering 35 pages provide hypothetical job descriptions, time spent scales, and basic trainee job-task inventory. (Author/JR)",

Questionnaire techniques were used to scale a list of 62 potential incentives for attractiveness, feasibility, and other characteristics. Personal motives, background variables, and ambiguous surface structure, ones with ambiguous underlying structure, and ones considered social incentives from the original list were redesignated as social behaviors which should be encouraged in training environments to enhance performance. On the basis of the questionnaire and administrative assessments of feasibility data, 18 additional incentives (both social and non-social) were proposed for use in a field experimental situation.

An introductory section discusses FJA, pointing out that it conceptualizes experience in terms of human functioning and growth, uses the language of experience to bring into focus the definition of work, defines the unit of work in a way that results in a stable element of design, and links together in a single interacting system worker, work, and work organization. Entries are listed for the years 1951, 1953, 1955-65, and 1967-75 with items arranged alphabetically by author  within each year grouping. The early papers are mostly concerned with the theoretical formulations and the research that implemented the development of the occupational classification system used by the U.S. Employment Service for the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. These are followed by the applications of FJA to the study of the impact of automation on job structure. More recent papers describe the application of FJA to various practical manpower needs.

Data were collected on applicants referred by the Employment Service: whether or not hired, reason for not being hired if not hired, applicant characteristics, and job characteristics. A telephone follow-up, made approximately 150 days after placement, determined tenure on the job, wage rate, hours worked, reason for termination, and date of termination when applicable. Applicants who were referred as a result of a computerized job search had a better chance of finding jobs, stayed on the job longer, and earned more money than applicants referred through self-service microfiche  readers. There was not evidence, however, that the computer increased the chances of placement or duration on jobs over those achieved by manual applicant searches for special target groups. Speed of retrieval and consequent cost decreases favor the computer search procedure over the manual. With better applicant and job descriptors, the system could likely be improved. Nearly 50 pages of appendixes provide an abridged version of the users' guide, referral status file descriptors, and regressions. (Author/JR)",

Operation COPE: A Family Learning Center served the needs of educationally disadvantaged, low-income young mothers who head households. The learners' expressed interests and needs determined the curriculum (typing, sewing, and arts and crafts) taught to equip the students for employment. Reading and mathematics were incorporated into these skill subjects; homemaking was gradually introduced into the sewing classes. Individualized instruction was available in reading and math. Family and citizenship education, field trips and audiovisual aids, and utilization of service agencies were also program  elements. The project's second thrust was developing inservice training for ABE professionals and paraprofessionals. Implementation of the program's essential elements is described: recruitment, counseling, climate, team approach, curriculum, community linkages, volunteers, staff development, advisory committee, and research and evaluation. Included are sample instructional materials and participant data and testimonials. Concluding the report are principles which underlay the successful model, e.g., the low-income mothers see themselves as self-directing, respond to respect, and can be helped to diagnose their needs and to plan, conduct, and evaluate their own learning.

Data were gathered about students in secondary and postsecondary vocational institutions in nine geographic regions of Mississippi. Information was supplied by center directors, teachers, and questionnaires given to students. Findings relating to the students' plans for living and working location, their need for social change, and the factors tending to affect their mobility patterns are mentioned. (Author/EC)",

Discussion and analysis focus on the 1971-74 period. The study used analyses of Project Baseline's Common Data Base; many of the results are contained in the text, and information on others is appended. Evidence of a number of achievements, as well as evidence of problems, is presented. Intended as more than a summary of progress and problems, the document describes social, economic, and political conditions affecting vocational education's evolution, in an attempt to define the role of vocational education in a broad social context and to identify the major variables which promise to influence future directions  of the program. Research on the relation between education and work revealed radical changes in the value and function of education, with vocational education shown by the study to be in the forefront of the change. In the light of research, the report identifies 20 major issues of importance to the continued development of vocational education and makes specific recommendations for responsive congressional policies.

The longitudinal study, planned to cover a 10-year span, was begun in the fall of 1968. The project was developed to identify the effects of the high school experience on youth in vocational guidance. The sample consisted of the total ninth grade enrollment in three medium-sized Pennsylvania school districts--Altoona, Hazleton, and Williamsport. Data were collected at several stages through standardized aptitude and achievement tests and inventories of interests, values, and vocational development. Information on family and environmental background, occupational and educational aspirations, as well as school-generated data  were also collected and analyzed. The report presents the background of the project and describes procedures involved in sample selection and data collection, handling, and storage. The VDS project resulted in 20 published research monographs and numerous papers and articles. Copies of the monographs and papers and a list of the articles are included in the report. In addition, a one-year graduate followup survey was made of the Altoona class. Several questionnaires are appended. (NJ)",

Each of 24 subjects was given a choice of three responses in a marble-dropping task and was required to make one choice, after which an experimenter either imitated or did not imitate a subject's behavior. The results indicated that when a response is imitated by an experimenter, the response frequency is maintained; however, when a response that was previously imitated was no longer imitated, the response frequency significantly decreased. These results were interpreted as providing evidence that behavioral similarly produced by an experimenter has positive reinforcing properties. (Author)",

After being extensively interviewed, both volunteers and probationers are matched on the basis of mutual interests and the probationer's specific personal needs. The volunteer serves as friend, role model, supervisor, or counselor, depending on the probationer's needs. The relationship is designed to help the probationer understand himself better and see the world more realistically and constructively. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the likelihood that he will turn to more serious crimes. Using this  approach, the Lincoln program has worked with high-risk misdemeanant probationers.

The most influential questioner and critic has been Mischel. The essential criticism, advanced and buttressed in a number of ways, is an empirical one: namely, the research evidence accruing over the years supports only weakly or not at all the assumption by pshchologists that traits or dispositions importantly govern behavior. Mischel develops this conclusion in a widely-read review of the personality assessment literature. Mischel's 1968 conclusions have become widespread and blandly accepted. This paper offers an &quot;assessment of Mischel's assessment of the state of personality assessment,&quot; and indicates  some of the ways in which his negative evaluation can be countered. This essay reads the research evidence differently and, in addition, introduces some recent pertinent findings that permit a different structuring of the accomplishments and deficiencies characterizing personality research.

The manual first addresses itself to the rationale for program evaluation, and then examines the evaluation process from the definition of objectives through the selection of criteria. The design for program evaluation is discussed in view of research methodology and the selected focus of program research. After a detailed discussion of the nature and process of various forms of evaluative research, the issue of innovation is considered. The utilization of results obtained through program evaluation is considered in regard to the dynamics of  organization and resistance to change. Recommendations for overcoming resistance, implementing program evaluation, and utilizing new information are provided. (SJL)",

        "description":"This paper presents an overview of the knowledge afforded man from research into personality. Approaching his topic from a position valuing the study of persons from complementary psychological perspectives, the author attempts to derive some conclusion about human behavior and personality. He discusses the findings that there is basic continuity in personality; each person is capable of great differentiation in behavior; there are multiple determinants of human behavior; and there is a need to analyze social and psychological environments in order to understand individual behavior. From this common ground, the author suggests the need to specify clearly the goals, purposes and objectives of personality research. Different goals require different foci and different measurement  strategies. The author views humans as active organisms interacting in active environments, where person variables must be taken into account so as to understand this interaction. In conclusion, the author suggests that researchers actively involve subjects in their own personality assessments, that information processing may yield increased knowledge of personality, and that a synthesis of various psychological constructs is needed. He further suggests an image of man as an active, aware problem-solver who is multi-faceted, multiply influenced, uniquely organized, yet open to study by scientific methods. (SJL)",

Vocational programs were modeled on those existing in trade schools, while general education stressed personal development. At present, career education has gained greater acceptance and status. Present occupational programs have improved due to greater experience of the staff and better planning. No longer is a liberal arts education required to precede career career training; personal and social development can now take place effectively in occupational programs, enabling one to develop one's ability to think and communicate effectively. In the future, individualized programs in career education will be available to all individuals who need them. Students will assume greater responsibility for their  education, pursuing in-depth study in various fields. Another anticipated development will be the incorporation of ethnic studies as an integral component of liberal arts studies. (SE)",

Indeed, it will be an important feature of the program to explore the effects of changes on attitudes to these features.

Third party power (ability to force an agreement on deadlocked negotiations or merely recommend one) and generalized reputation (favorable or unfavorable) were manipulated in a laboratory experiment to determine their effects on negotiator behavior, perceptions, attributions, and satisfactions. Questionnaires were used in measuring the latter three categories of results. Reliable differences in pre-intervention impact of third party agents possessing differential power were found. One such finding was that those anticipating a high power agent felt more pressure during bargaining and took  longer to reach agreement than those in the low power condition. With regard to perceptions, significant and consistent interactions between third party power and reputation were also found. In sum, this study demonstrates the importance of constituent forces on negotiator behavior. (SJL)",

The results indicated that competition led to the greatest intergroup hositility while cooperation between groups led to the greatest intergroup attraction. In the second phase of the study, the two groups were combined to work on a series of superordinate goals. They received feedback that their combined effort had either succeeded or failed in obtaining the superordinate goal. Intergroup attraction scores taken after this stage of the study showed that in groups that had previously  competed, failure on the superordinate tasks increased intergroup hostility while success of the combined tasks reduced hostility. However, for groups that had previously cooperated, failure on the superordinate tasks reduced intergroup hostility to a greater degree than did success on the combined effort.

This consortium, through university and public school system cooperation, aimed to effect change within institutions while aiding pupil personnel workers to achieve a balance between task and interpersonal dimensions of schooling. This evaluative report begins with a section reflecting the emphasis on program definition, data collection and program change considered by the Center to be essential components of the evaluation effort. The entire consortium is evaluated by examining the individual satellites and their outcomes within the context of the project goals and their interventions. The second section is an  evaluation presented by an evaluation counselor. He describes the counseling steps he took and the conflicts and frustrations experienced along the way. He then discusses some alternative evaluation procedures based on the issues he has raised. The final section presents a view of the project from an administrative director. Such issues as decentralized funding, modes of decision making, and prospects for implementing change through university-school system consortia are discussed. (SJL)",

A collaborative project was conceived wherein the universities, school district, and community get together to find new ways of cooperative planning which would produce classrooms and curricula that would meet the needs of their students. The model employed attempts to  train a new professional able to serve the student client as well as the system client. The major objectives were: (1) development of new degree programs at the university level, (2) development of experimental pilot courses which could identify and teach newly needed skills, and (3) development of courses related to the practical problems of inner-city schools. A second set of objectives included organizational development, staff development, and program development. The fully-developed program was shown to have considerable impact. (Author/NG)",

A major goal of this Satellite Project was to bring together university staff, parents, and teachers for the purpose of collaborative planning and programming. The Satellite operations formally extended over three project years. During the first year the goals of the target communities, schools, and university were defined and synthesized. Needs of the schools and communities began to be assessed (and continued to be throughout the  project). From the needs assessment came the development of training modules for university students, community persons, and school staff members. These efforts dominated the activities of the second year. In the final project year the training programs continued, but greater emphasis was placed upon institutionalizing desirable changes at school, university, and state educational levels. Dissemination of project findings and evaluations then began. Key features of the Satellite project were; (1) collaboration and planned systems change, (2) learning by doing, (3) competency-based learning, and (4) incorporating an inner-city counseling program with an attending course of study. The program had considerable impact. (Author/NG)",

The SCP Project was based on the hope that with training and directed practice, the interns could be of help to the school districts in which they worked at the same time that they were learning about school social work. To this end, evaluative information kept project faculty informed of program strengths and weaknesses and encouraged revision of course content and internship plans as needed. The academic courses emphasized planned change in institutions. Instructors prepared  students to identify school situations which were, or might become, problem situations for children, such as desegregation, ability grouping, and antisocial behavior. Working with the school administrators, field supervisors, and social workers, the student interns applied problem-solving techniques learned in class to actual school situations. With administrative sanction, then, student interns were encouraged to contact teachers, pupils, psychologists, and parents in their efforts to alleviate problem areas. Over an experimental period of three years, the SCP model was practiced by 52 interns in school systems in Illinois. The results of the program evaluation indicate that the SCP approach to school social work should be continued. (Author/NG)",

A third goal was the recruitment of minority group members as &quot;new professionals,&quot; to work in Black urban settings. In working toward this goal, the Ohio Satellite operated in three directions: (1) seeking to improve the counselor education program at Ohio State University, which was achieved by adding four new courses to the basic counselor training program, and requiring counselor trainees to have continuous field experience; (2) operationalizing a collaborative decision-making model in relation to a fully functioning  guidance program, which took the form of a modeling process wherein team leaders were trained, and workshops were held; (3) developing a process for assisting the faculties of target schools in using the &quot;teaming&quot; model within daily operations. The Ohio Satellite established a demonstration site for testing and operationalizing guidance as an institutional function in a public school setting, as well as developed a field experience program which gained the acceptance of those responsible for the counselor education program at Ohio State University.

The author used the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men (NLSYM) data to control for these four factors and find the contribution of each to dropout rates (D). A theoretical model incorporating the four factors and others is explored, and seen as accounting for the reasons given for dropping out. Main findings from this study  are: (1) IQ has the most important direct effect on D for whites, while knowledge of the labor market is the most important for non-whites; (2) the quality of high school attended does not have a direct affect on D for either racial group; and (3) parental education level is the only socioeconomic index affecting D rates for nonwhites, while other indexes affect D of whites. Based on these results, some policy implications for dropouts are discussed. (SE)",

The author suggests the substitution of \"school-leaver\" for \"dropout\", since the latter has derogatory implications. Dropout prevention programs are of two types: those that attempt to promote student conformity to existing norms, (counseling, behavior modification and parental involvement efforts are the means used to achieve this goal); and those that attempt to modify the norms (efforts to change students' environments through job training  and classroom innovation are some of the means used to attain this goal). The author considers these prevention programs as unsatisfactory, offers certain suggestions as to which norms should be adopted, and makes recommendations about how schools could function according to these norms.

The research stemmed from assumptions that (1) speech characteristics of the counselor or therapist may well affect both the client's image of the counselor and the value of the counseling itself, and (2) an identification of speech characteristics that might influence client perceptions of counselor effectiveness would be valuable to counselor-therapist educators and to counselor-therapists engaged in professional practice. Twenty male counselors-in-training recorded a phonetically balanced reading passage, and 96 undergraduate students  listened to the recordings and predicted how effective they believed each speaker would be as a counselor or therapist. The listeners were also asked both to identify and rank-order the speech characteristics which had influenced their judgment. The data indicated that (1) the students were in general agreement about how effective each of the speakers would be as a therapist (either a counselor or speech therapist), and (2) the vocal characteristics associated with predictions of effectiveness were either a good vocal stresspattern, a good speaking rate, good articulation, or a combination of these factors.

He further hypothesized that (b) based on these data, an instructional package could be constructed to teach children a skill-strategy based on selected behaviors and dispositions identified as being central to achievement. Following an analysis of the relevant literature, the author selected major achievement behavious and developed Achievement Competence Training (ACT) based on those behaviors to instruct learners in a strategy for setting and achieving goals. The effects of ACT and an alternate set of instructional materials upon goal-setting behavior, perceived locus of control, and  self-evaluation were tested in three fifth-grade classrooms in each of 33 schools. ACT significantly increased belief in internal control as compared with the alternative Treatment and an Uninstructed Control group. Students using ACT also demonstrated (a) greater tendency to prescribe self-directed solutions to problems; (b) lower (more realistic) personal performance standards for favorable self-evaluation; and (c) less discrepancy between self-predicted performance and personal standards for good performance. In addition to these measurement data, interviews, observations, and anecdotes reflected positive results of ACT. Results are discussed in relation to a theoretical model of achievement in which achievement behavior is sustained through covert self-reinforcements.  (Author)",

The setting was a simulated school board-teacher's union dispute over a new contract. Each side was represented by one person who was instructed to bargain tenaciously and obtain as much as possible. The job of the representatives was either in jeopardy (High Accountability) or not (Low Accountability). In the content intervention condition, a reasonable settlement was suggested to the representatives by the third party. In the process intervention condition, he taught them how to paraphrase. In the passive condition, he had them take a break from their negotiations. For the high accountable representatives, as  predicted, the order of effectiveness of the interventions (number of agreements, average joint profit, and speed of resolution), from most to least, was content, process, and passive. Contrary to expectations, the process intervention did not produce the highest average joint profit for the low accountability representatives. The representatives who did reach agreement in the low accountability-process and content conditions, however, did achieve higher joint profits than the representatives in the passive condition.

Counseling is conducted informally through telephone calls, in cafeterias and in classrooms. The student counselors are trained and provided with various reference materials they may need in their work. Some tentative results which reflect the success of the student-to-student counseling program include: (1) a decrease in the total number of withdrawals; (2) a decrease in the total number of program changes; and (3) a feeling on the part of faculty, staff and students that the image of the university in responding to the individual has been  strengthened by the program.

The results indicated that the measures of empathy were statistically independent of each other and the attitude scale. Of all supervisor rating--helper empathy correlations for counselors and natural helpers, only counselors' empathy skill significantly correlated with supervisors' ratings. Also, the &quot;natural helpers&quot; who were not trained or oriented to the concept of empathy needed to be provided with &quot;test taking skills&quot; before completing the skill measure of empathy. For both the  trait measure of empathy and the attitude scale on psychological effectiveness, a developmental trend was indicated with freshmen students scoring lowest, upperclass &quot;helpers&quot; scoring higher than upperclass &quot;nonhelpers&quot; and counselor trainees scoring highest.

The third section is a sketch of a linguistic model based on the assumption that the function of language is to communicate information.

It also reports on the effects of the program on certain academic, affective, and behavioral measures taken on those students. The program, called the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), included five teachers, two pupil personnel interns, a media intern, and four aides. Out of the 98 students involved in the program, at least 20 of them had repeated a grade sometime during their school careers. Initially, several baselining sessions were held and observers recorded the off-task behaviors of the subjects. After a wide variety of pretest measures was collected, several ICU methods were instituted. These included individualized prescribed  instruction for each student in the core academic areas of reading, mathematics, and science. At the same time, behavior management techniques were also instituted. To shape behavior, teachers combined continuous, social reinforcement with material rewards. It was concluded that students who participated in the ICU program did significantly better academically and were better adjusted in the classroom than those who did not participate in the program.

An exploration is made of the possibility of learning more about reading comprehension and readability by examining responses made to sentences described by transformational grammarians as structurally ambiguous. A group of fifth grade students were asked to identify paraphrases of three kinds of sentences, ones with ambiguous surface structure, ones with ambiguous underlying structure, and ones considered to be unambiguous. (An example of a sentence with ambiguous surface structure is, \"Small boys and girls are easily frightened.\" An example of a sentence with ambiguous underlying structure is, \"Flying planes may be dangerous.\") Although the fifth graders did not do well on the test,  the order of difficulty of items was found to be similar to that found by other researchers. The order of difficulty ranged from unambiguous sentences as easiest, to surface structure ambiguities as next in difficulty, and underlying structural ambiguities as most difficult. Oral interviews with eight of the students after they took the test resulted in improved scores. A comparable study by Montague is reviewed and similarities in research findings are noted. (MKM)",

Sixty-nine subjects completed the two tests. Results showed that there is a curvilinear relationship between affect and estimates of English word frequency; that subjects believe that positive and negative English words occur  equally often, but more often than neutral words; that the influence of affect on frequency estimates was strongest in the personal instructions condition and in the lower frequency range; and that subjects tended to make more conservative judgments in the Kucera-Francis condition than in the personal condition.

The grade level placements of the textbooks were obtained from the Smog formula, the estimates of two reading teachers, and the estimates of the instructors whose books were being used. It was concluded that only four of the twenty-four books were on the freshman level. Of the  remaining twenty books, seven were on the fourteenth level, five were on the fifteenth grade level, six were on the sixteenth level, and two were on the seventeenth level. It was recommended that a coordinated effort be made to help these students by developing a full year's course of special help in reading and study skills and that instructors use supplementary aids for teaching the subject matter.

Data was gathered from approximately 5,800 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students in five New York State school districts during the spring semester of the 1974-75 school year. The main design of the analysis is based upon the \"production function\" paradigm used by economists, in which attention is paid to how the inputs of \"ingredients\" to a production process are mixed together to produce outcomes. To pinpoint instructional resources going into reading, teachers, aides, and specialists were asked to supply figures for minutes per week of reading instruction in each of four instructional modes: whole group, small  group, individualized instruction, and individual help. Outcomes were measured by a standardized achievement test and a set of criterion-referenced tests. An important finding was that minutes of classroom teacher instruction seem to be related to student performances when measured by the criterion-referenced tests but not when measured by the standardized test.

The respondents were asked to rate twenty criteria according to relative importance and to judge fifteen current themes in children's fiction books according to appropriateness for boys and girls. Significant differences between the editors and teachers were found for ten of the twenty criteria. Teachers gave the use of a readability formula, controlled vocabulary in fiction books, high-interest books for slow  readers, books enriching the curriculum, books developing appreciation for beauty, and avoidance of controversial themes significantly higher mean ratings than the editors. The mean ratings of the editors were significantly higher on criteria relating to excellence in writing and quality illustrations. Ten current themes were approved by over 60 percent of the editors and teachers. A much greater percentage of teachers than editors approved of traditional roles for boys and girls as a theme.

Twenty-two commonly taught phonic generalizations were analyzed using a computer. It was concluded that consistency alone is not a sufficient criterion on which to judge the utility of a rule. The authors found that when the rule was a simple one-to-one correspondence (e.g., \"ch\" is always pronounced, as in \"chair\"), then direct rule learning was most effective. However, when the rule was more complex (simulation of the final \"e\" rule), then direct rule learning was not as effective as a more inductive approach. This suggests that teaching rules directly is only advantageous over the other  approaches when the rule is a simple one-to-one correspondence. (RB)",

Twenty female secretaries, median age 22.1, and 20 female members of a senior citizens' center, median age 69.4, were asked to learn lists of pictorial and word stimuli under free recall conditions. Eight trials were given on each list and recall was untimed to allow subjects maximum opportunity to develop and use retrieval strategies. Some of the findings indicated that pictorial stimuli were recalled significantly better than the word stimuli. The average number of errors per trial was 4.96 for pictures and 6.63 for words. The young subjects made significantly fewer errors than the old subjects. The young subjects made an average of 4.28 errors per  trial whereas the older subjects made an average of 7.31 errors per trial. Performance improved for both groups as the number of trials increased. The results led the investigators to the conclusion that memory processes for the visual and verbal modes differ only quantitatively, and not qualitatively, as a function of increasing age. (MKM)",

Thirty-six native speakers of English participated in the experiment, receiving four dollars plus a bonus for accurate performance. The present research correlated different measures of fusion in an attempt to determine the nature of the basic phenomenon. The measures of fusion included accuracy of temporal order judgments, ignoring stimuli from the left ear, and discriminating instances in which a real word occurred in both ears from instances in which the word components appeared in each ear. It was concluded that most people  fused words very little when assessed by the accuracy of discriminating real words from word components. The fusion phenomenon appears not to be a true fusion that impairs discrimination of the components, that is, language appears to bias the response of certain people only. (Author/RB)",

They differ from criterion referenced tests in that the latter involve assessment in comparison to an absolute standard or specific performance objective while in a norm-referenced test assessment is made in comparison to other students taking the same test. Standardized tests can be abused in some of the following ways: failing to recognize limitations within the testing situation that obscure the \"true\" level of competence; making decisions on the assumption that the score derived from the test tells all; making decisions on the assumption that reading and intelligence tests measure exclusive domains; assuming that a standardized test can give specific direction to an instructional program; interpreting  results without reference to the composition of the norm group; making the assumption that anyone below the 50th percentile is a disabled learner; and treating a grade score on a reading test as a functional reading level. However, standardized tests do have many positive uses: as an accountability check, as a screening device to determine further diagnostic needs, and as a way to generate hypotheses regarding instructional needs.

A significant positive relationship was found between reading skill level and performance on this task. Reading skill level was a better predictor of &quot;Promise&quot; performance than were age or IQ. Experiment two investigated the effect of the composition of the experimental presentation list on performance by  comparing comprehension when the list contained only &quot;promise&quot; or only &quot;tell&quot; sentences with that obtained when the list contained both types of sentences. For half the subjects, performance differed as a function of the list composition. In experiment three, the sentences were embedded in a paragraph context.

Taking part in the study were kindergarten children from (1) classes whose teachers were using PRS for the first time, (2) classes whose teachers had used PRS during the previous year, and (3) classes whose teachers were not using PRS; and first grade children who had not used PRS in kindergarten. The major result of the study was  that kindergarten children who used PRS scored significantly higher on five prereading skills tests than children who did not use the program.

Two opposing hypotheses were tested regarding four vowel digraph spellings. Six synthetic words were constructed for each vowel cluster according to contextual and word position constraints. The subjects were 51 undergraduates whose task was to read the synthetic words and note how they pronounced the underlined vowel cluster. Three models were constructed to assess the hypotheses and to predict responses for each vowel cluster. The models were a final consonant model, a variant  type-token model, and an invariant principal response model. Several data analysis techniques were used. The final consonant model was superior to the other two models, but it was found that other factors, not yet assessed, were present in the results. (Author)",

By varying the number and position of the letters distinguishing graphic patterns (positive condition) in a short-term recognition memory (STRM) task, the relative use of information from different parts of the graphic pattern can be determined. Under STRM, the subject must analyze, remember, and utilize the graphic information from the Target (T) stimulus, in judging whether or not the Comparison (C) stimulus is the same as the T stimulus. In Experiment one, Exposure Time (ET) of the T stimulus, Retention Interval (RI) between T and C stimuli, and the Positive condition were  varied. The results indicated that both second semester prereading kindergarten children and first graders are more likely to detect a difference between the T and C stimuli in the initial letter position than at the middle or final position. Experiment two used a similar paradigm with a fixed ET and RI. The results revealed neither a position effect nor any indication that entering kindergarten children's performance changed during the study. (Author/TS)",

        "description":"The systematic study of reading dates form the beginnings of experimental psychology in the late nineteenth century. Cattell measured reaction times for naming letters and words, investigated parallel processing, and compared legibilities of letters and printing types. From the end of the 1880s to the publication of Huey's 1908 text, reading processes were a central focus of experimental psychology. After this period, however, the influence of behaviorism turned experimental psychologists away from the investigation of mental processes, while educational psychologists became preoccupied with testing and measurement. A revival of experimental work occurred in the late 1950s. With the current rise in popularity of information processing, studies of reading once again occupy a  central role in psychology. Almost all of the problems attended to by the first researchers remain unresolved today: control of eye movements, the strategies involved in word recognition, the amount and types of overlapping processes, the role of subvocalization, the nature of the eye-voice span and the optimal methods for reading instruction. How to translate research results into educational practice also still remains a problem. (Author/MKM)",

In the second experiment, different subjects learned verbal discrimination lists consisting of both abstract and concrete pairs. While the usual concreteness effect was obtained when abstract and concrete items differed widely on phenomenal frequency, it disappeared when these items were equated on perceived frequency. The finding that appropriate frequency manipulations can eliminate the concreteness/imagery effect, coupled with similar findings for other stimulus  characteristics, lends strong support to the frequency theory of discrimination learning.

The subjects for the first experiment in this study were 45 fifth grade students. The control group was given regular discrimination learning instructions. The image-trace group was told to note the correct item during feedback, and then with a picture of it in their minds, to turn their heads away and trace the outline of the picture in the air with their fingers. And the trace group was instructed to trace the outline of the correct item during feedback. The second experiment involved 63 kindergarten children and was based on an earlier observation that the ability to derive memorial benefits from self-generated  imagery strategy seems to improve with age. On the basis of the evidence assembled in these experiments, it was concluded that copying a correct stimulus directly is not nearly as effective as is reconstructuring it from memory and that imagery rehearsal is a skill which is more sensitive to age differences than is verbal rehearsal.

Program effectiveness for both general and job reading training is described in data based on the reading performance of some 3,000 adult students at six Army Training Centers at which the program was implemented. Reading Training performance was measured by both a standardized test of general reading comprehension and an experimental measure of the job reading task skills required to learn and to perform a job. This research also investigated the feasibility of three alternative systems for providing job reading training concurrently with other components of  job training, rather than as preparatory training. Major findings indicate that: (1) a substantial portion of job trainees are deficient in job reading skills; (2) six weeks of focused job reading training improved job reading skills to the seventh grade reading level (a gain of two reading grade level years specific to job reading skills); and (3) programs of integrated job reading and job skills training are feasible.

Two graphs are defined: a graph G that characterizes the a priori structure of the item set defined by a researcher, and a graph R that characterizes a subject's protocol. Two indices of clustering, denoted by gamma and omega, are obtained by evaluating the sum of the pairwise products of the weights on the corresponding edges of the two graphs. The gamma statistic is a direct generalization of the commonly used clustering indices and reduces to the number of repetitions whenever G represents a standard categorical decomposition of a stimulus list. The omega statistic, on the other hand, extracts more information from the  protocol graph R than does gamma and incorporates a distance measured based on the number of intervening items in a subject's recall sequence.

Test, and the verbal section of the SAT) taken by 154 senior students throughout their high school careers. Statistics resulting from computations indicated that all tests shared a large common variance, with reading ability more closely related to verbal aptitude than to intelligence. To determine the key element most likely linking the three tests, reading ability and then intelligence were held constant for these correlations. Resulting  partial-order correlations pointed to reading ability as the factor most highly related to standardized test scores. Sex accounted for insignificant differences while race is a far more significant variable as a predictor of verbal ability and test score results. It is suggested that inexpensive and easy to administer standardized reading tests can be used more efficiently by educators in the schools. (Author/JM)",

Forty-two passages of differing readability (ranging from grade 2.5 to 10.0) were analyzed for within word, within sentence, and between sentence characteristics. The measures used for quantifying these characteristics were: index 1, average semantic load per word; index 2, average depth of within sentence modification; and index 3, average depth of between sentence modification. Each index represents a hypothesis as to the nature of the major skill of comprehension. A multiple regression analysis was conducted using indexes 1, 2, and 3 as predictor variables and passage readability as the criterion. Results show that  index 2 was the only significant predictor of the criterion, that index 2 accounted for 76 percent of the variance in comprehension levels of the passages, and that indexes 2 and 3 are highly correlated with each other. Thus, the major skill of reading comprehension can be described as one of identifying main and subordinate ideas within and between sentences. An empirical test of this single skill model should be conducted. (JM)",

Four groups of trainees were tested. One group read training text while simultaneously listening to a speeded auditory version of the same text. A second group listened to speeded text without concurrently reading the material. The third group simply read material silently, with no auditory input. The fourth group was a control group which took pretests and posttests only. All groups except the control group showed sizable but comparable increases in unaided reading rate and comprehension performance. Thus, it appeared that the salient aspects of all procedures provided trainees with specific learning  goals and precise feedback on their progress, coupled with teacher encouragement to improve.

In experiment one, schematic retention is related to Tulving's distinction between episodic and semantic memory. With the passage of time, memory for prose reflects decreasing output from episodic memory and increasing output from semantic memory. In experiment two, Bartlett's theory is related to Craik and Lockhart's levels-of-processing framework. Comprehension of prose involves the creation of multiple codes which are forgotten at different rates. Bartlett's schema is interpreted as a higher-level code that is exceptionally durable over long intervals. The research supports the validity of Bartlett's theory. (Author)",

Blacks are seen as ludicrous or unnaturally good, as ghetto bound, and--when portrayed in a group of characters--as the only dialect speakers in the group; American Indians are portrayed with depersonalization and ridicule; and Spanish American characters (including Mexicans and Puerto Ricans) suffer from the perpetuation of negative myths and the failure to define them as persons. Not only is it necessary to eliminate stereotypes in children's books, but it is also essential to bring minority group members into all phases of writing and publishing. In addition, teachers should select nonstereotyped reading materials, teach critical reading skills, and emphasize an  understanding of other people through book discussions and role play. (JM)",

They prevent girls from realizing that all occupations and careers are open to them, and they present a man's role in the world as quite different from that of a woman. Sexual bias in reading material (both text and trade books) may be seen from the frequency of use of masculine and feminine proper names and pronouns (masculine appeared more than twice as often as feminine) and a disparity in the scholastic understandings of girls aged nine (equal to that of boys of the same age) and girls aged thirteen (beginning a decline which continues into adulthood). In order to avoid sexual bias and to encourage girls to reach their full potential, educational materials should reflect the reality of the past and the  contributions made by women in history and politics, present both boys and girls in exciting adventures, avoid the stereotyped portrayals of both boys and girls, and emphasize both sexes engaging in similar activities and making responsible decisions.

        "description":"The Word Meaning section of the Metropolitan Readiness Test, Form A, was questioned as a true measure of the capabilities of culturally disadvantaged children. Therefore, an attempt was made to compare the Metropolitan Reading Readiness Test with a test in which as many objects as possible were renamed to coincide with the language of the students being tested. In order to test this two alterations were made to the Metropolitan Test. First, nine items on the original test were modified to reflect greater cultural relevance. Second, a test in which all items were redesigned was constructed. Both were administered to 180 first grade students by their individual teachers and scores were compared with initial scores on the original Metropolitan. The two modified tests were  administered to the same students a second time as a check for reliability. Scores were significantly higher for the culturally modified tests. These results seem to support the statement that use of regional or colloquial language expressions of children will increase children's scores on a reading readiness test. Both the partially and completely modified tests are included in the appendixes. (Author/MKM)",

The subjects were 95 second-grade pupils in a low-to-middle class suburban community in central New Jersey. The plan was to expose an experimental group to fourteen stories presented at 200 words per minute over a period of five weeks. The control group listened to the same stories presented at the normal rate of 140 to 150 words per minute. Both groups answered comprehension questions which immediately followed each story. Pretest instruments were the Goodenough-Harris Draw-A-Man Test and the Durrell Listening Test. The posttest instrument was another form of the Durrell Listening Test. Some of  the findings were that no evidence was observed which would indicate that a gain in listening skills will result when a faster rate of presentation is used as compared to a normal speaking rate of presentation and neither the control nor the experimental group improved their listening skills.

        "description":"The linguistic atlas projects have provided much information on the regional distribution of pronunciation, vocabulary, and syntax and have given important evidence for a greater understanding of problems involved in semantic change, particularly in pointing out transition areas where dialects become fused. In a study supplementary to that originally conducted by Harold B. Allen for the atlas of the upper midwest, Gary Underwood interviewed two generations of three farm families in rural South Dakota to determine if later generations have resolved any of the semantic confusion in that area. Data collected from the study show that when dialects fuse and there are two or more terms for the same referent (as with &quot;comforter&quot; and &quot;quilt&quot;), one term either drops out of use in the area  (as with &quot;fried cake&quot; for &quot;doughnut&quot;) or semantic fusion takes place with one term becoming a generic term (&quot;quilt') and the other becoming a specific term (&quot;comforter&quot;).

One way of employing a tale from the oral tradition to produce a modern fantasy is to superimpose the old story on a new one in such a way that it is tightly interwoven in the action and meaning of the new story. This technique may be seen in three recent novels. &quot;The Owl Service&quot; by Alan Garner, &quot;The Seal-Singing&quot; by Rosemary Harris, and &quot;A Game of Dark&quot; by William Mayne. These books exhibit three different ways of combining the old and the new story so that each novel provides a double perspective and is a fantasy of unusual fascination and depth. (JM)",

The study involved two questionnaire surveys: the first a survey of 235 chairpersons of departments of speech and English in institutions of higher education in the state of Illinois--132 responded--and the second a survey of 315 teachers of persuasion in departments of speech and English in Illinois institutions of higher education--102 responded. Although 83 percent of the responding teachers said they attempt to prepare students as both senders and receivers of persuasion, 43 percent of these emphasize the role of sender and only 15 percent emphasize the role of receiver. Teachers mentioned using 68 different  texts in their teaching of persuasion, but only one of these was used by as many as 10 respondents. Supplementary materials from the mass media were used frequently by only 25 percent of the English teachers and 33 percent of the speech teachers responding. Conclusions and recommendations for improving the training of students at all educational levels in the reception of public persuasion are provided, as are suggestions regarding the training of teachers of persuasion.

Although the criticisms have been sincere, they are based on total misinterpretations of the works involved. As may be seen from the excerpts taken from five books under fire, the objections may be to sexual references, obscene and profane words, the general tone, improper life styles, or religious sensitivities. However, in an atmosphere conducive to censorship, objections might be made to almost anything in a book. It is essential, therefore, that English teachers equip students to understand and to respond to literature and to resist being persuaded by the rhetorical skills of any writer. (JM)",

An approach to training English majors to explicate and evaluate literature on their own is described. Students should understand that literature is not often autobiographical, that the writer's original intent is not fundamental to the understanding of a work, and that writers are most often intelligent. Exercises that focus discussion on explication and evaluation should be offered to give students the challenge of spontaneous thinking and solving a given problem as a group. James Tate's poem \"Dark Street\" is used to illustrate the value to the approach described. (TS)",

As a result, women in their works are presented as female stereotypes of one kind or another. Hemingway shows a split attitude toward women, depicting realistically only those women who are either destructive or docile. Faulkner presents women in a vicious manner, revealing a definite misogyny, and Steinbeck portrays very few women, giving those few subordinate roles while the plot usually centers on the relationships of men. Unfortunately, the influence of these novelists on other American writers has been strong. (JM)",

The assumptions underlying the approach are that the central instructional task is the idea toward which the writer must adopt an interpretive posture, that the idea sentence (an analogic assertion) then becomes the thesis statement, that writing competence can be increased through acquisition of editorial skills, and that rhetorical instruction is best provided in an editorial context. Students first learned to identify analogic assertions and to recognize unity, coherence, and emphasis (without using  these terms). The method was comparative and inductive. The students then progressed through a series of editorial activities, helping one another through their editorial efforts and increasing their own writing (and reading) skills. Results of this project show that if written discourse is considered as thought that is shaped and designed, directed and controlled, there is no child who lacks the conceptual resources to engage in the task.

Each step in the proceeding should make bias less likely to survive.

Only two cases relevant to the advisor's First Amendment rights have been decided. Although both decisions were adverse to the advisors concerned, considerations other than First Amendment rights were of primary importance to the courts in each decision. Several out-of-court settlements have supported a trend toward granting advisors the same constitutional rights given students, and two pending cases should serve to further clarify the issue. However, taking a case to court may not always be the wisest resolution. Litigation is costly and time-consuming, and a compromise may be  much more effective if reached out of court instead. The key element in any compromise is that the groups concerned should be well informed about what the high school press may and may not do, how those rights are supported by the First Amendment, and why such an amendment must be exercised in a free, democratic society--even on the high school level.

Questionnaires were sent to 175 schools, selected through stratified sampling, with 94 responding. From the information gathered in this survey, it was concluded that the report contained in &quot;Captive Voices&quot; is guilty of sweeping generalizations and over-simplification. Further, there appears to be general agreement on the charge that censorship is widespread, but there is little agreement on other charges lodged in the report. Generally, respondents  indicated that journalism in the schools has an equal priority with all areas in the school except sports. A majority of the advisors responding said they were not assigned to the press against their will, although they indicated that they were not well compensated for their time and added responsibilities.

Psycholinguistics is relevant to both the material and the learner. In teaching spelling, it is possible to draw insights from behavioral and cognitive psychology as well as from Noam Chomsky's theory that language has both deep and surface structure. The English spelling system which reflects the underlying abstract meaning of words is discussed in its relationship to students' syntactic maturity. Teachers must select words and ideas within the possible range of students' understanding. It is concluded that English spelling patterns are definitely related to sound sequences. (TS)",

This approach was used in examining the results of a study of a self-instructional program in narrative writing which was prepared for and tested by secondary school students. During instruction, a process approach to writing, students were taught to use a set of questions to systematically and sequentially select a subject for a narrative, to develop a rough draft, and to make additions to expand the narrative. The goal of instruction was that students would achieve and/or maintain control of the structure of the narrative while learning to expand their narrative for the sake of  completeness, development, and interest. An instrument was designed to measure three qualities indicative of control of structure and three characteristics of expansion. Of the 27 students who completed the program, the majority showed positive pretest-posttest changes in the variables related to expansion and demonstrated control of structure on both pretests and posttests. The baseline measures were found to be very useful. (JM)",

The subjects were 72 black kindergarten, third-, and sixth-graders in a predominantly black community in Toledo, Ohio. All children attending the school were considered lower-class, since 90 percent of the children's families were on ADC and 100 per cent of the children were eligible for the federal school lunch program. A variation of the Fraser, Bellugi, and Brown test of imitation, production, and comprehension of grammatical contrasts was used. The following categories were used to generate four practice items: affirmative/negative, change in noun, and prepositions. Eight categories were used to generate 24 sentence  pairs for the test itself. Sentence pairs were in both Black and standard English. A speech production task was also used. The results showed that production of Black English decreased significantly with age. This finding suggests that, at least in a school setting, older black children have the ability to respond orally to a language task in standard English if they perceive the situation to be one in which they should do so.

The purpose of this paper is to conduct a critical analysis of a number of studies which have appeared in communication literature on the concept of topoi and to discuss the function of topoi in communication. Utilizing the Aristotelian concept of topoi, a number of writers, including Bacon, Wilson, and Arnold, have developed topical systems of their own. All systems are based on the fundamental principle that topoi can provide one with a procedure for searching one's memory in order to discover material appropriate to any particular subject. The studies discussed in this paper affirm that topoi do seem to facilitate the generation of discourse for a variety of  communicative contexts and a number of communicative tasks. It is concluded that topoi provide an area for additional investigation, one with great practical and theoretical implications. What is needed is to build on the possibility that topoi can improve the generation of discourse by looking more closely at what topoi do, how well, and in which forms in various communicative contexts.

Some of the conclusions reached by this study are that according to etiquette books women should not gossip but men can; men should not discuss politics in the company of women; women are advised to talk little but smile a lot; men are sometimes advised not to yell, but women at all times should be serene; while men are advised not to use too much slang, women should never use  slang; and swearing or profanity should not be practiced by either sex but especially not by women or by men in the company of women.

One hundred-twenty-five students who were enrolled in a basic introduction to mass communication class at the University of Utah were randomly assigned to two experimental treatments. While caution must be taken in generalizing the results of this preliminary study to other visuals and other populations, there appears to be little doubt as to the potential value of semantic differential scales for future visual communication research.

Rhetoricians have been preoccupied with moving men and not societies. A &quot;macrorhetoric,&quot; in other words, seems possible by abstracting to a social or cultural level the traditional principles and operations of audience-oriented &quot;microrhetoric.&quot; There is no difficulty in deciding what moves in society and history--arguments move. Rhetoricians also are symbolists and thus can beg the ethical problem of determining what progress really is or ought to be. Speculations about movement can be documented, giving rhetoricians a clear indication of  which documents produced by which advocates seem to be most important in terms of producing or accomodating social and historical movement. Rhetoricians should not be bothered by problems of meaning; the rhetorician studies events in the past only as they have already been mediated by advocates--politicians, statesmen, and other historical figures--who had the power to legislate a movement in society with the arguments they made.

A paradigm for judging is presented and discussed in terms of the following core concepts: analysis, investigation, evidence, reasoning, refutation, and rebuttal. Analysis is the arriving at an understanding of the proposition and the discovering of the inherent issues. Investigation is the process of accumulating information about a proposition. Evidence is an informative statement believed by the listener and employed by an arguer to secure belief in another statement. Reasoning is the process by which we infer a conclusion from premises. Refutation is the  attempted destruction of the opponent's argument. Rebuttal is the attempted rebuilding of an argument once it has been attacked. It is concluded that this paradigm is an excellent one for judging an academic debate. (TS)",

A figure of the paradigm is presented and contains the following elements: audience or judge, communication skills, persuasion skills, formal debate, and persuasion syndrome. The paradigm illustrates that debate is primarily a persuasive process within a larger persuasive syndrome; it is an arena for the exhibition, utilization, and application of interpersonal communication skills.

In order to interpret this result, alienation was considered as a process beginning with difficiulties in situation definitions. It was assumed in this study that heavy information of the mass media offers such definitions. In the beginning of the alienation process people thus feel difficulties in defining the situations and assumedly react in such a situation compensatively, with heightened intake of heavy information. If this does not help in defining situations, a second reaction, restriction of or withdrawal from heavy information is plausible. Some results supported this interpretation, but there were conflicting results,  too. (Author/RB)",

The behaviors were coded from videotapes of 88 dyadic conversations where each subject participated in one conversation with a stranger of the same sex and one conversation with a stranger of the opposite sex. A total of 54 behavioral variables were derived from the ratings and grouped into eight general categories: behaviors related to speaking turns, back channel behaviors, filled pauses, laughing and smiling behaviors, gazing behaviors, postural shifts, hand movement, and foot movement. It was concluded that sex of subject, but not sex  of partner, had a significant effect on many of the nonverbal behaviors displayed during the conversations. Sex differences in the correlation between subjects' scores on the behavioral measures and their scores on several personality measures on a post-conversation questionnaire were used to generate hypotheses linking specific behavioral differences between the sexes to more general differences between interpersonal styles.

It is not, however, the tools such as merit salary plans, voucher plans, and management techniques that are used to achieve accountability. Accountability has from its earliest days been tied to testing. In discussing testing, it is necessary to discuss the pros and cons of standardized, or norm-referenced, tests and of criterion-referenced tests; to consider the numerous against testing in general; and to examine the suggestions for alternatives to the usual methods of assessing student achievement. An administrator faced with the decision of what methods of evaluation to use for accountability will find that there are no easy answers. Most authorities on testing seem to agree that traditional standardized testing is not  adequate. Yet there is still a great deal of disagreement about which other methods can do the job best. It seems clear that, for the time being at least, all the best methods of assessment and evaluation are going to involve a great deal of time and money. The method of evaluation chosen depends on one's definition of accountability, which in turn depends on one's idea of what good education is. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"To understand the controversy over busing, it is necessary to understand the relationship between busing and the issues that are actually at the root of the controversy: desegregation and freedom of choice. Much of the political activity surrounding busing is a subtle transfer of attention away from the basic issue of desegregation. Other opponents to busing see it as another needless restriction on the freedom to choose one's residence and, concurrently, to choose the school to which one's children go. Because the Supreme Court has not rendered an absolute verdict on busing, school decision-makers are forced to live with the frequently fuzzy guidelines available. Congress and the President have adopted a wait and see stance that offers no leadership on the question. Social  science research on busing is not helpful either as the research is not definitive in its findings. It is clear, however, that the attitudes of school officials and community leaders help to shape the attitude of the community and that the ultimate failure or success of busing and its goals, true integration and equality of educational opportunity, depends on the local community and its school leaders, not on Washington.

Kimbrough's research suggests that formal groups are subordinate to the informal power structure in establishing policy, though formal groups make important contributions to decision-making. Some researchers support the view that important policy decisions are made by a few people in the informal power structure. Other scholars argue that the power is not monopolized by a small group but is diffused among many competing groups. This paper accepts both views; however, only one type of power structure can exist in a community at a given time. In the monolithic power situation, the informal power structure holds a complete monopoly of power. Where  power is diffused among competing groups, the decision-making process seems to be much more complex; action will probably not occur until a policy has been widely considered by a number of subsystems within the community. The task of the school administrator is to identify the power structure in his community and to respond accordingly as the decision-making process progresses from one stage to another. (Author/JG)",

As there is no one generally accepted definition, it is difficult to categorically characterize a style as democratic. Democracy in a pure form is based on the assumption that no member of the group is superior to other members. In operation, no organization exists as a pure democracy and no leadership can exemplify pure democracy. Society and organizations recognize the person with superior judgment and special skill. People may discuss and agree on directions of action, but detailed activities are left to those to whom authority over these activities has been delegated. In considering leadership styles, there is a question of how much focus will be attached to the leader. Decentralization  is an extension of delegation. Delegation refers mainly to the granting of authority and the creation of responsibility. Decentralization is the situation that results from a systematic delegation of authority. Decentralization of leadership increases opportunity for development of leaders; it does not preclude centralization of goal-setting, funding, and policy-setting. (Author/JG)",

The bill attempts to resolve differences in valuation, tax rate, and wealth while providing basic educational services as well as services to nonpublic schools and to handicapped and special students. On the negative side, the bill does little to solve the inherent inequalities of the property tax itself, does not address the problem of the cities that have to spend an excessive amount of their tax revenues on services other than education, does not resolve the differences in expenditures between rich and poor districts, does not keep pace with inflation, and does not address the question of how much per pupil expenditure is needed to provide a good education.  On the positive side, the bill does allow low property valuation districts as much choice as more wealthy districts in deciding how much money to provide for their schools, does provide incentive for poor property wealth districts to increase their tax rates, does compensate for economic and enrollment changes, and does facilitate longer range planning.

Position analysis allows for a detailed cross-section analysis of a position in terms of authority and responsibility within an organization. The current study was conducted to determine the special education director's current operations tasks, his necessary behaviors, skill, knowledge, and attitudes. The task analysis revealed the main areas of the position fell under the following headings: procedures and policy making; program planning, research, and evaluation; organization and pupil services; personnel administration; school operations; office work; relations with the community; and budgeting/accounting. The analysis indicates that the position should include a master's  degree in educational administration and/or special education, experience in public school administration, and training in program design and certification as required by the Minnesota State Department of Education. Also suggested is a basic understanding of the special education system; child development; laws, regulations, and guidelines pertaining to special education; local school organization; and community resources.

The purposes of the course were to present a rationale and philosophy for integrating special needs children into mainstream settings and to offer a variety of intervention strategies to accomplish mainstreaming in the classroom. The course content was selected by a modified goal analysis method. The following areas were designated as important and served as the content units in the course: normal child development, issues in integrating handicapped children into mainstream settings, parent involvement and training, attitudes and myths concerning handicapped children, identification and  assessment techniques, behavior management, and programming skills with handicapped children. Students were exposed to a variety of teaching methods in the 10 sessions that made up the two-week course. The students evaluated each session and made recommendations. In the future, students could be clustered by background and need, topics could be organized into more palatable units, and course continuity could be assured by encouraging the instructor to play a more dominating role in instruction and selection of lecturers.

The author bases his analysis on data collected from 304 randomly selected Minnesota school district administrators. Administrators were classified as either task-oriented or employee-oriented, according to their responses on the Least Preferred Coworker scale, a 16-item semantic differential scale. Employee group morale was rated by subjects on the 10-item Group Atmosphere scale. Analysis of the data showed a significant difference in group atmosphere between employees under task-oriented administrators and employees under employee-oriented administrators. In addition, administrator orientation appeared to change with increasing years of administrative experience;  employee-oriented elementary principals had significantly more years administrative experience and more years in their current position than did task-oriented elementary principals.

Strickland and the provisions of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Different sections of the booklet examine the potential liability of board members, suggest how a school board should operate to avoid liability problems, discuss possible steps a school district can take to protect its board members from personal financial loss, and consider the pros and cons of purchasing  liability insurance coverage for school board members.

        "description":"In essence, the Policy Institute has explored the contributions that tested educational research (including reputedly viable educational innovations not based on formal research and development) might make to actual school and classroom practice within the context of the Experimental Schools Program's planning. The Policy Institute set itself three tasks--to construct a \"research-readiness\" spectrum, a \"criteria-of-importance' typology, and a \"host-readiness\" synopsis. A highly eclectic applied-social-science research method was used. This method included commissioning two independent papers, conducting interviews, and searching the literature. What emerged was a reexamination of assumptions about the innovative process. It seems that emphasis on the suitability for  implementation of research results and innovations, in an abstract sense, reflects an unconscious prejudice, favoring the perspective of the researcher over that of the practitioner. As a result, the group has been led to place greater emphasis on the characteristics of the potential host. The major outcome of this discussion is a set of questions intended to be used by an evaluator as a means of focusing his judgment of the suitability of potential Experimental Schools grant recipients. Numerous appendixes are included. (Author/IRT)",

The study was conducted under the assumption that any new plan should achieve equalization of access to educational opportunity and equity in taxation. The committee concluded that the following factors should be reflected in the revised plan: ad valorem taxes should continue to be a major source of revenue, ad valorem tax reform is necessary to assure equity, local enrichment above the statewide program should be limited, taxpayer burdens should be equalized, and  school districts should have equal access to education program funds. The preferred new plan improves support levels for most school districts, allows some local flexibility in setting tax rates, limits enrichment prerogatives, increases local control by allowing districts to determine staff composition, provides an limprovement in the equity of taxation, uses ad valorem tax collections in the districts in which they are collected, and continues to distribute Available School Fund proceeds on a per capita basis.

Results showed that the loan size criterion specified by subjects was typically greater than the optimal criterion when the optimal criterion was small relative to the maximum loan size, and less than the optimal criterion when the optimal criterion was large relative to the maximum loan size. That is, subjects specified criteria that would result in the reporting of too few exceptions (a case of informational overdecentralization) and too many exceptions (a case of informational overcentralization) when  the optimal criterion was relatively small and large respectively. The behavior exhibited was attributed in part to a subject's utility function, which was inferred to have a Friedman-Savage double inflected structure. (Author)",

In addition, the relationships between the topics of information demands and selected background factors and psychological characteristics of the supervisors were examined. The topics of information demand were determined by recording the title of reports read by supervisors during a simulated curriculum decision-making task. It was concluded that when supervisors consider curriculum-related decisions, their information demands (1) are multidimension; (2) include the topics of general information about the subject areas of the curriculum decision, specific information about the content of the subject area, the views of the  school situation held by teachers and other interest groups, resources of the schools, student ability, the strength of present curriculum offerings in areas related to curriculum decision, and information about the background of the community and community views of school issues; (3) are not completely consistent with the information needs implied by either the comprehensive/prescriptive decision model or the incremental/remedial decision model; (4) are not related to the background of the supervisors; and (5) are not related to the personality of the supervisors.

        "description":"Elementary students recorded large gains in academic achievement in the two years their school was involved in an intensive instructional improvement project that employed team teaching, flexible scheduling, open classrooms, and individualized instruction. A study was done to determine if the achievement gains would continue through a third year if the principal was not involved in instructional planning and to determine if the return of the principal to extensive involvement in planning in a fourth year would result in another upward surge in achievement. Although there were some losses when the principal was absent from the planning, the scores in all areas in two of the three grades surveyed continued to be significantly higher than the scores obtained in the base year and the  Hawthorne effect was dismissed as a major factor in the original increases. The return of the principal to team planning sessions resulted in additional achievement gains in all the areas at all the grade levels except second grade arithmetic. The extensive involvement of the principal in instructional planning with teacher teams can make a positive contribution to the success of the faculty in improving academic achievement of pupils.

Unfortunately, the technological terms have frequently become distorted and value-laden through attempts to apply them to compelling economic and political issues. As a result, administrative attempts to implement processes associated with the terms as well as attempts to increase teacher productivity have been perceived by teachers as an unreasonable demand to provide more service for less money. This paper relates the terms \"accountability\" and \"productivity\" to the educational context, identifies criteria presently used for the measurement of productivity, reports on some of the current practices used to increase  productivity, and proposes some directions for future research. The proposed research efforts are concerned with defining productivity, defining programs, adopting more efficient record-keeping systems, understanding the teaching process, examining employee motivation, investigating successful strategies to implement innovative practices, and increasing the activity of teacher organizations in developing strategies for improvement of education.

        "description":"The commission was charged with drafting a framework for overhauling education in California's 1,600 intermediate and secondary schools. The Superintendent of Public Instruction asked the commission to envision an educational system that could respond continually to changing needs in the next quarter century; to identify the skills and competencies individuals will need to survive and function effectively in the next 25 years; to chart ways to make school more effective, more enjoyable, and more conducive to a continued interest in learning; to identify the goals California's schools should be meeting now and through the year 2000; and to recommend immediate and long-range changes to bring about the desired results. The commission was not charged with designing methods of  implementation. In this document, the commission presents its philosophy of reform, together with its recommendations and rationale for changes. The recommendations are grouped by subject--the new learner, the new learning environment, the new emphasis on learning, the new educator, and new resources and responsibilities. In a special section the commission deals with concerns for the early adolescent. Numerous appendixes are included. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"The research reported on here was conducted to evaluate the initial introduction of innovative classroom management techniques in selected classes of four elementary schools. The evaluation phase was conducted during the 1970-71 school year following a series of summer inservice workshops on instructional objectives, learning modules, and contingency management. The primary emphasis was on introducing and evaluating contingency management concepts and techniques for eliminating problems commonly experienced by elementary teachers. Data were also collected for reading and mathematics achievement, school attendance, and indicators of interest and attitude. Contingency management practices were more widely implemented by the program teachers than were the instructional objectives.  All the teachers in the program implemented the general procedures using approval, praise, and learning success and eschewing scolding, punishment, and learning failure. Although the emphasis was on student behavior rather than on achievement, students of teachers who met a substantial portion of the program objectives showed small, but clear, gains over the other students.

It is, in essence, a management plan to deal with work stoppages on as high a professional plane as possible. Modification must be made to meet local and state circumstances. Each school district must write a plan in line with its own philosophy and the board of education policies and state statutes. The point is that each school district in the nation must have such a readily available plan of action. A brief historical review of work stoppages by employee groups is included to give a greater understanding of the development of the more militant stance of school employee groups across the country. The scope and causes of strikes are also discussed, but the major portion  of the handbook is devoted to what the administrative team should do before, during, and after a strike. An appendix contains a checklist on the operation of the school, a prestrike questionnaire, a school report form and a strike checklist. (Author/IRT)",

        "description":"Power, or influence, in educational governance is increasingly becoming diffused. Everyone in education now feels relatively powerless. A political model of decision-making, emphasizing consultation with representatives of interest groups is now appropriate. In this model, the school board functions as &quot;meta-mediator.&quot; This modifies the role of senior administrators. The pluralistic power structure, characterized by interest group politics, is now the most common kind. In such systems activist educators are likely to cause and encounter conflict. The skillful exercise of influence in coping with conflict in pluralistic environments is a vital skill for senior administrators. Conflict occurs when groups perceive a divergence of interests, as opposed to a commonality of interests.  The chances of peaceful adjustment are maximized when a degree of shared interests exists and when some other conditions, including the existence of institutional arrangements for negotiation, are met. Conflict between the organization and clients is increasingly common and can be extremely difficult to deal with. Two common strategies, attitude change and power, can be used alternately. Conflict management is increasingly a common activity and an essential skill of senior administrators. Training or experience in it is thus an increasingly important qualification for leadership roles. (Author/IRT)",

The most recent decision of a federal circuit court upholding a school's rules was decided in 1975. In this instance, the court reversed the position it held only three years earlier. There are some guidelines that should be kept in mind if a school has hair regulations or is considering their adoption: rules should be drawn as narrowly and specifically as possible and should be clearly related to the educational purposes of the school; the strongest legal basis for hair and grooming regulations are the protection of health, safety, or educational performance of the students; if the rule is based on the need to prevent disruption of the educational process, the school  should be prepared to meet the test outlined in the Tinker decision; it should be made sure that the rule is not grounded solely on sexual stereotypes or other presuppositions that cannot be defended against charges of sex discrimination; and the rule should be spelled out, preferably in writing, and made known to everyone it will affect, before it is enforced against anyone.

All the students attended the ninth grade in one school and then went to one that used a 10-12 pattern. The results showed that (1) achievement as measured by grade point average was not statistically significant on the T-test at the .05 level; (2) there were few differences in the students' perception of school experiences and those that were found were more related to socioeconomic status and sex rather than to trends that could be attributable to  previous school organizational structure; (3) there was no meaningful difference between the students in stability of socioeconomic aspiration level; (4) there were no inhibitory effects of organization patterns in participation in extracurricular activities; and (5) there was stability of performance within each socioeconomic status classification.

The second area deals with the problem of analysis, the problem of developing a body of curriculum theory that will help in the understanding of curriculum policy as well as the development of evaluation of curriculum practices. The third area of the literature seeks, through a wide variety of empirical studies, to provide data regarding the consequences of various curriculum  choices. The latter two groups are discussed here under the headings of curriculum theory and analysis, curriculum structure, subject-area curriculum research, curriculum and teaching method, noncognitive outcomes in curriculum, and curriculum research and curriculum decisions.

The first section presents an array of programs that were being supported as Demonstration Projects during the 1975-76 school year by the U.S. Office of Education. The second section presents shorter descriptions of projects that are also approved for diffusion but, in view of scarce resources, could not be funded during the particular school year. The back of the book contains a list of state facilitators, with names, addresses, and phone numbers. Each facilitator serves as a matchmaker within that state to assure that local education  agencies obtain information about and access to those validated innovations that fit identified needs of particular schools, regardless of where in the nation the original program happened to have been launched. The demonstration projects deal with a wide variety of areas: alternative/secondary education, early childhood and parent readiness, the environment, reading/language/mathematics, specialized curriculum/special interests, special education, and training/organizational arrangements.

The purpose of the conference was to provide a meeting place in which teachers, other education professionals, and laymen could enter into substantive dialogue on accountability. It was hoped that those concerned could discuss their similarities and differences and find a means of having a dialogue about those differences. Four principal topics were covered: the goals and objectives of accountability, the means by which the objectives can be accomplished, assessment and evaluation, and the question of who should  be accountable, to whom, and for what. Two speakers, one representing teachers, addressed each of the topics and then the participants divided into small groups to attempt to find their areas of agreement and disagreement on the topics. The report is made up of summaries of the speakers, the small-group discussions, and the related events. Also included is an evaluation of the conference and of the positions of those who attended.

This interstate comparison of permissible variance cannot be easily accomplished without agreement on criteria and increased sophistication of statistical techniques.

Data were obtained from administration of the Infant Psychological Development Scale and the Inventory of Home Stimulation (when Ss were 23- to 38-months old); and from administration of the Home Inventory, the Utah Test of Language Development, a structured mother-child interaction task, and a classification task (when Ss were 36- to 54-months-old). Findings revealed that the early cognitive development of deaf children through what J. Piaget terms the sensori-motor stage proceeds quite normally, but that cognitive development which is more clearly dependent on verbal  interaction with the environment, or what Piaget terms social transmission, does show a discrepancy when deaf children are compared to hearing children on the classification task. Results suggested that early intervention programs with deaf children need to focus on improving communication abilities and developing curriculum materials which better teach those concepts usually transmitted through social interaction with the environment.

The S was videotaped in spontaneous interaction with her mother or the experimenter for approximately 1 hour each month, and the films were transcribed into an English gloss notation by a team of deaf adults. Use of the negative headshake, a linguistic component of sign language, was the primary focus of study. Results revealed that the S acquired negation through stages comparable to those involved in hearing children's language acquisition. Findings suggested that the deaf are fully capable of learning to understand and use negation, and that a deaf child of deaf parents should not be  considered to be communicating in a primitive or gestural manner if he negates sentences by using only a headshake.

Ss were given a battery of seven measures grouped under the following four headings: standardized test approach; controlled laboratory approach; classroom-oriented approach; and teacher observation. For each of the seven measures, both a visual and an auditory mode were presented to each child. A series of four analyses was performed. The first series generated descriptive statistics on 81 variables in kindergarten and on 79 variables in first grade. The second series studied the standard z discrepancy scores between auditory and visual performances in the  context of several complex factorial designs. The third series used the standard z scores of the second to study the incidence and nature of various types of sensory modality profiles. The fourth series used percentage correct (mastery) scores embedded in complex factorial designs to examine various types of auditory-visual comparisons. (Author/DB)",

Parents of the children were provided training in curricula and strategies designed to intervene and remediate in areas of assessed disabilities. The parents were taught behavior management principles and kept records as to their participation. Home visits by the investigators were made on a regular basis. Children were reevaluated on all instruments at the end of a 12-month period. Data derived from this study will provide information  as to the effect of intervention programs on neuropsychological functioning. (Author)",

        "description":"A model for identification of hearing impairment which combined tympanometry and the puretone procedures outlined by the American Speech and Hearing Association was tested with 8,528 elementary age children from six Connecticut towns. The nine goals of the project included obtaining pass/fail ratios for puretone audiometry within minus 1 percent and plus 3 percent of national prevalence statistics, obtaining a normative data base for a combined puretone-tympanometry model representative of the various populations within Connecticut, and determining the reduction of false positives resulting from a rescreening of all initial screen failures. All goals were met except the goal of having the model adopted in at least two of the participating towns. It was concluded that routine  inclusion of tympanometry in hearing conservation programs for schools is both practicable and desirable, and that nursing and hearing personnel can be taught quickly to operate the equipment and obtain reliable data. (Appendixes to the document include statistical findings from the screening, guidelines for puretone testing and tympanometry, and various forms for recording information and for referral.) (LS)",

        "description":"The paper reviews educational, medical, and psychopharmacological research concerning the academic, behavioral, and psychological responses of hyperactive children to stimulant medication. In Chapter 1 on the problem and plan of study, brief sections are included on the educational community's lack of knowledge regarding stimulant medication, the procedure used for collecting data, and research methodology in psychopharmacological studies (including guidelines for studies with groups of children and individuals). Covered in Chapter 2 are the academic, behavioral, and psychological responses to stimulant medication, and responses (such as unorthodox interpersonal relations) which need treatment other than drugs. Among conclusions presented in Chapter 3 are that many hyperactive  youngsters show positive academic, behavioral, and psychological responses to stimulant medication; that if the child has experienced much school failure, he will need guidance in thinking of himself as a successful person; and that parents of hyperactive children find counseling helpful in relieving guilt and improving their relationship with their children. Appended are a list of seven distinct patterns of performance with their characteristic drug effects, a graph of the effects of stimulant drugs on psychological tests, Conners' Teacher Rating Scales, position papers from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American School Health Association, and the Report of the Conference on the Use of Stimulant Drugs in the Treatment of Behaviorally Disturbed Young Children.

The visual task produced a greater number of correct responses than did the auditory task. There were no differences among groups on either task. Scores on the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistics were analyzed both between and within learning classifications and were correlated with scores from both paired associate tasks.

        "description":"Many preschool children with developmental delays in cognition and language are in the preoperational stage as defined by Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development. The preoperational stage is divided into the preconceptual and the intuitive phases. During the preconceptual phase, the preschooler is unable to form true concepts and often reasons in the form of unrelated judgement without logical organization. In the intuitive phase, the child's reasoning is tied to his perceptions and therefore his thinking is often distorted. Implications for parents and teachers are that in a special preschool class, activities should be of a wide variety and should include exploring with all the senses (such as imitating the actions of people, animals and objects); that at home, parents  can emphasize real experiences (including planting seeds and cooking); and parents and teachers should use language related to what the child is experiencing as well as to his general level of language functioning.

        "description":"As part of a larger study of transplantation and chronic disease and the family, 124 children (10-18 years old) who were chronically ill with kidney disease (n=72) or were a year or more post-transplant (n=52) were included in a study focusing on the effects of chronic kidney disease and transplantation on children's psychosocial development. Ss along with their mothers and the &quot;normal sibling&quot; closest in age were interviewed with a survey questionnaire. The major difference revealed between the chronically ill, the transplanted children, and the controls involved body image, specifically satisfaction with looks. Compared to controls, the ill children were significantly less satisfied and the transplanted patients most dissatisfied because of growth retardation and the cushingoid  appearance which results from steroid therapy. External ratings of disease severity reported by the physician and mother (including seriousness of condition, number of hospitalizations, and frequency of symptoms) were correlated with various aspects of the self; and in general, objective severity of the disease does seem to have disadvantageous effects, although the tendency to hide one's feelings is most significantly and consistently affected. Findings showed that the child's own perception of the disease as a significant problem seems to have a more pervasive effect on adjustment than objective ratings of disease severity. A set of background demographic factors was investigated, and it was found that variables generally affect sick and normal Ss similarly with urban children having  higher self-esteem than rural children.

It is explained that Ss were matched on sex and ethnicity with regular class and non-decertified EMR students. Attempts to identify differences at EMR placement of those later decertified vs. those not are said to have produced no results, forcing a conclusion of educational equivalence at that time. It is noted that regular class means on current Metropolitan Achievement Test scores were highest, EMR lowest, but regular class and decertified distributions greatly overlapped; both were several grade levels below nominal placement. Among results reported are little  ethnic difference and little difference between regular class and decertified Ss on teacher ratings of citizenship and achievement, and the same broad range in social acceptance and adjustment for decertified Ss as regular class matches on teacher questionnaire responses (both means tending to be under average for their classes). It is concluded that while decertification did not make the students average, the students nevertheless tended to succeed nearly as well as regular class matches. (Author/CL)",

        "description":"This report covers research conducted between July 1972 and March 1973. Experiments were conducted on the automatic detection of constituent boundaries and location of stressed syllables by analysis of fundamental frequency and energy contours, for recordings of six talkers reading the Rainbow Script, two talkers reading a paragraph composed of monosyllabic words, and ten talkers involved in speaking sentences pertinent to man-computer interaction. A program was implemented which successfully detects over 80 percent of all boundaries between major syntactic constituents, by the use of fall-rise valleys in fundamental frequency contours. A panel of three listeners provided judgments of which syllables were stressed, unstressed, or reduced in the speech texts. Questions yielded  more stress level confusions than declaratives or commands. An algorithm was devised for locating stressed syllables as high energy portions of speech with rising or nonfalling fundamental frequency. This algorithm succeeded in locating 85 percent of all syllables that had been perceived as stressed by two or more listeners. Further work will involve implementation of the stressed syllable location algorithm, refinements of syntactic boundary predictions and detection procedures, further tests with designed speech texts, and applications to distinctive features estimation and syntactic parsing.

Morphologically, some &quot;-age&quot; suffixals which can be denominal in Quebec French can only be deverbal in European French. Semantically, &quot;-age&quot; deverbals are subdivided into &quot;factives&quot; and temporally relevant suffixals. In this latter class the temporal relationship can be anteriority, simultaneity, and posteriority. Nouns ending in &quot;-ure&quot; are most often resultative, whereas nouns in &quot;-age&quot; designate results only if they also designate actions. &quot;-Xtion&quot; and &quot;-ment&quot; are more direct rivals. Where &quot;-age&quot; designates the entire process or duration of an action, &quot;-ment&quot; designates the individual acts making up the process or a singular act. The suffix &quot;-age&quot; has become specialized for  action, and &quot;-ment&quot; and &quot;-Xtion&quot; for result of an action. Deverbals in &quot;-eux&quot; usually have a corresponding noun in &quot;-age,&quot; which often has a pejorative connotation. Adjectives in &quot;-able&quot; are more productive in Quebec French than in European French. Deverbals in &quot;-age,&quot;&quot;-eux,&quot;&quot;-able&quot; have the same surface stem as that of the present participle of the base verb. This mode of formation is common to standard and Quebec French. The productivity of the &quot;-age,&quot;&quot;-eux,&quot; and &quot;-able&quot; deverbals is correlated with the simplicity of their formation. (Author/CLK)",

Compound sentences are divided into conjunctive, disjunctive, and adversative types on the basis of the semantic relations they express. A conjunctive clause is either non-emphatic or emphatic, a disjunctive clause is either alternative or ultimative, and an adversative clause is either contrastive (oppositive) or exceptional. Relative clauses are divided into attributive (restrictive) and appositive (non-restrictive) relative clauses with the conclusion that an attributive relative clause modifies an antecedent which has a multiple referent [-unique], while an appositive relative clause modifies an  antecedent which has a unique referent [+unique]. Both relative clauses result from the reduction of a non-emphatic conjunctive compound with a coreferential noun. Ezafe constructions (Adjectival and genitive) are shown to be formed by the reduction of a non-emphatic conjunctive compound with a coreferential noun in which the second clause contains the verbs \"budan\" (\"be\"), or \"dastan\" (\"have\"). The complement clauses are analyzed as sentences that serve as an argument (supplement) to a specific class of impersonal, intransitive, and transitive verbs.

For these programs the volunteers use the Volunteer's Manual (written in English) and the Korean English teachers use the Teacher's Manual (written in Korean). The Volunteer's Manual is divided into nine Units: Introduction, Pattern Practice, Utterance/Response, Dialogue, Reading, Visuals, Sounds, Testing, and Writing and Homework. The Introduction contains a set of exercises that the volunteers can use to explain to the Korean English  teachers the objectives of the inservice training program and to explain how the teachers will study methodology during the program. The other Units contain one \"Process\" each, i.e., one approach for teaching a pattern practice, utterance/response, dialogue, etc. Each Unit contains a set of \"Suggested Activities,\" a step-by-step approach for teaching the appropriate Process to the teachers. Finally, each Unit contains a \"Rationale\" and a \"Notes\" section. The Rationale introduces the Unit and the Notes section gives more detailed information about the Process in the Unit.

        "description":"A situation of linguistic contact often produces various degrees of change in at least one of the languages involved. It is shown that the syntactic, as well as the phonological and the lexical, components are the locus of interference from one language on the other. Features of interference are described as part of a systematic pattern build on a strict hierarchy of occurrence. The study takes as an example two languages spoken in Mauritius. Bhojpuri, an Indo-Aryan dialect, appears to be undergoing a rapid evolution under the influence of the island's dominant language, Creole (French based). An implicational scale is set up, based on speech samples, to show which features of Creole interference in Bhojpuri imply others: in the variety of Bhojpuri which is the least influenced  by Creole, only lexical items naming modern concepts are found. The variety of Bhojpuri which is the most influenced by Creole contains syntactic transfers, phonological borrowings, and words belonging to the 100-word list of the lexico-statisticians. The in-between varieties are specifically defined by the order in which innovations appear on the scale. In this way, the scale of interference represents the systematic pattern of change which Bhojpuri appears to be undergoing. (Author)",

        "description":"This paper explores the differences between the understanding or knowledge of certain social rules, and their use, as seen in pronoun selection, by children in two different social settings within the same culture area. Different philosophies concerning the interdependence of social, cognitive, and linguistic development are reviewed. The specific study described involved three age groups of Hungarian children living in two different locations. They were required to complete a multiple-choice test and a role-playing test, designed to examine the interrelationships between the acquisition of social and linguistic rules, and the development of logical structures, based on the complexity of the Hungarian personal pronoun system. It was assumed that different social environments  affect both the acquisition of sociolinguistic knowledge and role-taking ability, so that the two areas chosen differed in the areas of the adult role system and the amount of verbal and social interaction to which the children were exposed. Results indicate that though there are noticeable differences in the overall performance of the two groups, both groups performed better on the multiple-choice test than in role playing. Social environment has limited effect on knowledge of appropriate forms, while it definitely influences ability to use proper forms. (CLK)",

        "description":"There is wide variability in the type and degree of bilingualism exhibited by persons from the various Spanish-speaking groups in the USA. Within particular subcultural groups, there is significant variability among individuals in the use of language patterns. An empirical study investigated the use of language pattern in specified social contexts among two generations in three distinct Spanish-speaking groups: New York Puerto Ricans, Central Texas Mexican-Americans, and Miami Cuban-Americans. A total of 295 families participated in the study. The Central Texas Mexican-Americans showed the greatest degree of displacement of Spanish by English as well as by \"Spanglish,\" and the New York Puerto Ricans the greatest degree of \"mother tongue\" maintenance. Previous research suggests  that language use are positively related. Contextual language use is an important factor which interacts with language learning and with academic achievement. It behooves teachers of persons from Spanish-speaking backgrounds to assess the language proficiency and the contextual use of language patterns of their students and to gear their curriculum accordingly. Contextual language use may be assessed by teachers through interviews and by behavioral observations, and the resulting data may be used to individualize instruction. (Author/CLK)",

On March 25, 1970, a suit was filed by 13 non-English-speaking Chinese students in the District Court in San Francisco, on behalf of nearly 3,000 Chinese-speaking students, against the San Francisco Unified School District. The complaints were: (1) non-English-speaking students were being denied their rights to education because they couldn't function in the medium of instruction; and (2) these students were being doomed to becoming dropouts, and to unemployment, as a result of their language problems. Basic issues were whether the San Francisco school district should be required to provide special instruction in English, and whether instruction  should be handled by bilingual Chinese-speaking teachers. While the school district and the federal court argued that the school district had no responsibility to rectify the situation, the Supreme Court ruled that the failure of the school system to provide English-language instruction to non-English-speaking students constitutes denial of opportunity to participate in the educational program. Furthermore, it was recognized both at the federal and state level that to be effective, the instruction must be bilingual. (CLK)",

        "description":"An extreme view of language acquisition sees base structures as innate, and acquisition of the grammar of a particular language as a process of learning the transformation rules needed to get from base structures to surface structures of adult native speakers. Base structures are understood to most resemble simple-active-affirmative-declarative sentences (SAADs) on the surface level. This has resulted in the treatment of SAADs as basic and normative, and other surface forms as derivative. This paper challenges this approach from a pragmatic standpoint, and attempts to explain units of linguistic expression as instruments to fulfill intentions. The propositional interpretation for linguisitc description is not considered to be a norm for acquisition. Work done by  Tonkova-Yampol'skaya defines intonation as the beginning of speech development, the crux of that approach being the distinction between natural and intentional sounds. This natural/intentional distinction is drawn on the basis of relaxed as opposed to controlled articulation. The conclusion is that intentional articulation begins at the onset of the babbling stage and that request-demand and interrogation intonemes increasingly dominate infant speech in the second year. Suggestions as to how the transition occurs from initial speech patterns to SAAD forms are made, with specific reference to focus. (CLK)",

The particle -A occurs in the syntactic configuration Noun 1 -A Noun 2 and has been traditionally described as reflecting relations of possession and attribution between the two nouns in construct. By identifying the meaning-carrying function of this particle in communication, it becomes possible to understand how speakers are able to employ a single linguistic form to convey a wide variety of messages. In explaining these possibilities, context is crucial. A premise of the paper is that the differences observed in the various contexts of -A enable speakers to communicate different messages with the single form. \"Context\"  in this usage may be linguistic or non-linguistic. According to differences in context, the meaning of -A is manipulated to express what initially appears to be totally different relationships between the two nouns linked by -A. However, it is shown that the form has essentially one communicative value, meaning, and that the different messages result from inferences on the part of speakers and hearers alike about the precise nature of the message conveyed by -A in a given context.

        "description":"This article describes an undergraduate course in creative writing offered by the Department of English at the University of Hong Kong. Most students in the course have Chinese as a native language and have received their secondary education in English. They have had extensive practice in writing English in connection with their studies. The course is offered during the last two years of a three-year degree program, and the actual writing instruction is preceded by exposure to various literary styles and by analysis of contemporary English writings. The student is allowed to concentrate on one genre or experiment with several. This paper specifically deals with prose works, and focuses on the special problems faced by the students as a result of having to write in a second  language. Many of these problems are directly related to the setting, the characters and the themes that the students choose, which can be grouped into the western-oriented, the traditional Chinese-oriented, and the present-day-oriented. The language necessarily varies according to a munber of factors, including age, sex, educational level, social status, and geographical origin. Students experience more problems in capturing the language of situations unfamiliar to them than with technical writing details. (CLK)",

        "description":"This article reviews the history of bilingual-bicultural education in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The U.S. government has administered the area since 1945. The original educational policy called for bilingual education with use of the local languages at the elementary level, but implementation was hampered by budget limitations. Native Micronesians also felt they were being discriminated against by not receiving sufficient English instruction. Other problems included the choice of an orthography for the native languages (each of which is briefly described), development of extension materials, the fact that not all native languages belonged to the same language families, and resistance on the part of the American staff to learning the local languages. Despite  arguments in favor of native language literacy, English was eventually introduced in the first grade. The local languages were reintroduced into elementary education in 1967, and the arrival of the Peace Corps volunteers in 1968 markedly affected both attitudes toward local languages and implementation of the policy. The 1968 Pacific Language Development Project helped develop dictionaries, orthographies, and grammars. Increased Trust Territory administration budgets and federal legislation in support of bilingual-bicultural education finally led to the implementation of policies that had existed since 1945.

Much of the information is summarized in a number of tables. Table 1 is a classification of the 20 distinct Alaskan languages into major linguistic families, with an approximate number of living speakers per language. Three basic types of language communities are distinguished (table 2): (1) monolingual native, including fluent native language speakers of all ages; (2) bilingual, having few or no native language speakers under age 10; and (3) monolingual English, with few or no native  language speakers under age 30. A short history of the development of bilingual education programs in Alaska is provided, and statistics are presented and discussed concerning the numbers of school-age children receiving bilingual education and the relative proportions of bilingual programming for the three types of communities (tables 3 and 4). Various tools used for evaluating the effectiveness of the program, including assessment of literacy, numerical, and linguistic skills, are discussed and summarized in four additional tables. Children in bilingual programs appear to perform significantly better than children in nonbilingual programs. (CLK)",

A distinction is drawn between ESL countries, in which English instruction begins at the elementary level and is frequently used as the medium for other subjects (Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore), and EFL countries, in which English is taught as a foreign language, usually beginning at the secondary level, and where the medium of instruction is the national language (Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of China, and Thailand). The common objectives of English instruction are: (1) helping students to develop cultural awareness of people in countries where English is a  native language, (2) helping students see the necessity of studying English as a medium of international communication, (3) enabling students to use English for communication, (4) developing the desire to increase one's knowledge of English, and (5) enabling students to continue study at higher levels of education. Unofficial objectives include enabling students to pass college and university entrance exams, and enhancing employment possibilities. Problems in the areas of teacher training, teaching methods, and materials development make for large discrepancies between these objectives and the actual situation. (CLK)",

        "description":"This article discusses the language planning problems that India faces. The distribution and usage of the various languages are outlined. There is considerable linguistic heterogeneity, with 80 languages currently being used as media of instruction at least at an elementary level, and 14 languages being used at the secondary level. Since language has become a political issue, there is a need for legislation determining the role of language in public spheres of communication such as education and administration. The main problems revolve around a confrontation between tradition and modernity concerning the role of language in education. The basic issues concern: (1) the objectives of education, (2) the role of language in education, (3) the choice of the medium of instruction, (4)  requirements qualifying a language as a medium of instruction, and (5) the pace of change. The established elite generally opposes the use of regional languages and mother tongues as media of instruction; it fears a lowering of standards and wants languages of wider communication for international interaction. Defenders of the use of regional languages are in favor of cultural regeneration and cohesion at a national level. It is suggested that the implementation of bilingual education at the secondary level would contribute to the solution of India's language problems. (CLK)",

The performance of these mentally disadvantaged children is compared with the performance of 200 normally developing children by using a clinical procedure for estimating syntactic development in children's spontaneous speech. The analytical procedure followed is that presented in Laura Lee's \"Developmental Sentence Analysis\" (1974). At the present time the knowledge concerning dysfunctions of auditory language is based primarily on data from adults who have acquired language and subsequently lost a portion of it. Most of the literature speculates that mentally disabled children undergo  a \"delayed\" language development and have a linguistic system that corresponds to younger normal children. The findings discussed in this paper indicate that there are significant linguistic differences between the speech of mentally disabled children and the speech of younger normal children. The two groups are paired by means of a developmental sentence score which determines overall sentence complexity. A four-year longitudinal study of a subgroup of these mentally disabled children indicates that there is a developmental plateau beyond which these children did not progress. (Author)",

        "description":"&quot;Done&quot; occurs outside of the participle paradigm in several varieties of English particularly those associated currently or historically with the South. This feature is also found in Appalachian English. Grammatical classifications have been proposed, including that of quasi-modal, pre-verbal form, and adverb. None of the labelling attempts successfully explains the non-participle &quot;done&quot; paradigm. Clearer understanding of non-participle &quot;done&quot; emerges in the light of its semantic and pragmatic characteristics. Scott treats the non-participle &quot;done&quot; in Black English as &quot;a focus-marker, to emphasize the completion&quot; of the accompanying verb phrase, and points out its semantic incompatibility with certain verb forms. An expansion of this approach can be supported for the &quot;done&quot; in  Appalachian English. Data are presented to argue that: (1) the semantics of &quot;done,&quot; as a marker of completion or perfective aspect, explains its co-occurrence restrictions with other verb forms; and (2) the functional aspects of its use determine its general incompatibility with clause types other than assertions where it is used to add emphasis. It is argued that syntactic classification alone is not sufficient. The proposal made here is that &quot;done&quot; has the semantic content that indicates the perfective aspect, or completion, and that its pragmatic function is to add emphasis or to intensify an assertion.

Errors also provide insight into how speakers plan discourse and syntactic structure,. Different types of discourse exhibit different types of error. The present data are taken from interviews concerned with domestic tasks, such as routines for preparing family dinners and dinner parties, getting the family off to work, the organization of a baby-sitting pool, and the layouts of apartments. There are almost no phonological errors, and few syntactic errors. The most common type of corrections are of semantic errors or errors of discourse ordering. Four major types of semantic errors are discussed: (1) semantic  error involving the correction of potential ambiguity, if both interpretations would be plausible in the context; (2) the correction of the level of lexical specificity; (3) the correction of memory or fact; (4) the correction of the ordering of the discourse components, which provides crucial insights into the process of planning discourses. Cases not marked as errors by speakers, but which current syntactic models do not consider well-formed sentences are also discussed. (Author/CLK)",

The student desirous of utilizing a foreign language in a career other than literature and linguistics has very limited opportunity for adequate training in college. The job market for literature majors is, and will remain, depressed. A study by Olympus Research Corporation indicates promising job possibilities in government and industry. Needs analysis indicates that priority languages for business and industry are: (1) Spanish, (2) French, (3) German, (4) Portuguese, and (5) Italian. Cross-training is in demand for: (1) business administration/management, (2) marketing/sales, (3) engineering, (4) secretarial and (5) finance. Various government  positions also require language skills. Colleges must break with tradition to accept languages for non-humanities applications. Language Departments must team with other academic specialties to provide relevant programs, with priority assigned according to job demand and local resources. Non-academic resources in government, business and industry should be utilized in implementing such cooperative cross-training in language and other disciplines. (Author/CLK)",

We must re-open the liberal arts curriculum to its fullest extent. Six categories of study are used to examine the various options for liberal arts graduates; physical sicences, biological sciences, social sciences, humanities, education, and preprofessional. The student, in trying to fit himself into a particular job slot, should try to think in terms of interests, skills, strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes, and in  what type of work setting he would be most comfortable. Ultimately the usefulness of the job hunting resources and techniques at your disposal will depend on three factors: (1) your background and qualifications, (2) the type of work you are looking for, and (3) the setting in which you will feel most comfortable.

Attention is directed to the makeup of its membership, the composition of his board of directors and the functions of the board, relationships to the other higher education associations in Washington, and the ACE's own internal organization. Consideration is given to the operations of the commissions, governmental affairs, data and research, human resources development, political development, and communications and publications. A reappraisal of other ACE programs and their financial implications is also presented. It is concluded that, while considerable dissatisfaction and  distress was found among those interviewed with respect to the present and recent roles played by the ACE, there was also virtual unanimity that this is an organization that is badly needed and that must function effectively.

The state legislature earmarks university research funds specifically for projects related to state government in Florida, and the practice is growing throughout the South. Although most universities have public service programs, the real increase in state-university liaisons has been relatively recent. The emphasis on relevance and accountability is seen as a reason for the increased stress on public service as a function of the university. It is also noted that usually colleges and universities comprise the state's largest pool of expertise in many and diverse areas of thought, and the university resources include large, well-stocked libraries, computer capabilities and research facilities.  Research studies are reviewed which have assessed the level of public service activities and funding. What a university does in the way of services for the state depends upon several factors, including the size and mission of the school. Certain subject matters also dictate involvement with the state or local community considerably more than others. (LBH)",

These impacts consist of increases in employment due to both direct and indirect effects, increases in Gross Regional Product (GRP) due to income effects, and increases in GRP due to inter-industry effects. The aggregate impact of the proposed $248.5 million capital improvements proposal for higher education on the state is conservatively estimated to be a maximum of $302.3 million increase in GRP due to inter-industry effects, and additional $365.7 million due to income-consumption effects, and 38,000 new jobs created. It was found that in each of the individual communities affected by the budget proposal, a positive impact on  employment and income could be expected. The size of this impact is a function of, among other things, the number of dollars expended. The community impacts study is organized by county. Tables are included on employment effects, income multiplier effects, and inter-industry multiplier effects. (Author/LBH)",

About 70 presidents and other administrators attended each of the seminars. Their major concern was not the repression of student dissent but finding ways of dealing with disorders so as to protect students' rights and lives and yet satisfy the need for order on the campuses. All seminar discussions were based on the premise that the maintenance of order is an essential obligation of the administration of colleges and universities. The participants discussed ways of preventing disorders before they occur and it was agreed that the most important step is student involvement in  decisionmaking. Some specific suggestions included the creation of the office of ombudsman and improving internal communication with such measures as an administration newspaper. Discussion was also concerned with advance preparation for dealing with student disorders and centered on the formulation of clear policies on student rights and responsibilities and a detailed plan of action for handling disorders including the use of campus police and outside police, and the use of injunctions.

The author expresses some skepticism about the strength of these influences. The birth rate is declining, but enrollments are influences by population shifts, the cost of tuition, the types of programs offered, and the ability of the institution to attract the older, nontraditional student. The lack of public concern for postsecondary education is suspected to be relative to the supply of the services offered. As the supply decreases, public concern will rise. Resources may be scarce, but if people can be convinced they are getting a good buy for their dollar,  the proportion of available resources dedicated to postsecondary education can be changed if the need is demonstrated. This involves identifying and assessing the benefits of postsecondary education both measurable and unmeasurable and, at the same time, improving management so that the best use possible is made of these resources. The Kirschling-Postweiler Plan for federal financing of postsecondary education is outlined as providing for tuition reductions, student grants, or general institutional grants to improve access.

The projections of the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) indicate that for a range of 421 occupations (the Comprehensive Projection), there will be a deficit of college educated workers. These occupations extend outside the traditional professional, technical, managerial jobs. The supply/demand comparisons for individual fields of study indicate that health, engineering, accounting, computer science and business administration majors will find a favorable labor market. Education and law school graduates will find a saturated market. Humanities and social science majors will experience difficulty if they are seeking jobs  that specifically relate to their educational preparation. (Author/JMF)",

Total college-related spending in North Dakota was $76 million during the 1973-1974 school year. This included purchasing supplies, materials, equipment, buildings and services, spending by faculty, staff, students, and visitors. The state appropriated about $36 million in support of higher education during the same period. Thus, for each $1 the state contributed to higher education, the colleges and universities returned $2.10 to the economy of North Dakota. Although limited, the Financial analysis data indicates that college related  sources are an important source of credit in the state. Time and demand deposits have expanded the credit base in commercial banks as well as savings and loan associations and credit unions. (JMF)",

It was found that: (1) after consideration of parental contributions and student self-help, there is an aggregate need for assistance of nearly $113 million, and there is $92 million available, including federal aid and grants or scholarships; (2) because of distribution methods, nearly $34 million in additional need-based student aid would be required to meet all students' need; (3) the need is greatest in the four-year private institutions; (4) families with incomes between $9,000 and $12,000 experience the most unmet need; (5) Iowa residents receive proportionally more aid at  public institutions and proportionally less at private institutions. These findings are based on the characteristics of students, institutions, and aid programs during the 1974-75 academic year. Possible changes which might occur in the coming year are forecast as a basis for planning. Estimates were made of the impacts of shifts in the proportion of high school seniors going on to postsecondary education, of changes in institutional costs, and of the impact of inflation on student needs. The problems of Iowa residents attending institutions in another state were not addressed. (Author/LBH)",

It involves identifying activities undertaken, organization, constraints, and phenomena of decisions and behavior and explanations for them. An approach to planning is outlined which includes a model of decision making and policy formation. Procedures are given for changing decisions. Two additional views on  management are also cited, those of Henri Fayol and Paul Drucker. For Fayol, managing means looking ahead, which makes the process of forecasting and planning a central activity.

Teacher performance measures are identified as: (1) the average A level points score of enrollments compared with the average A level points score anticipated or some similar measures of the quality of client response; (2) the ratio of successes, failures and dropouts to  enrollments; the learning gain; the relationship of each direct input (academic staff, teaching spaces, departmental administration and technician support, consumables and equipment) to enrollments, successes, and learning gain; and (3) feedback on graduates' initial employment and salaries. Statistical comparisons are given for the 1972-73 year, and projected research on such problem areas as measurement of learning gain is outlined. (LBH)",

The information system used is designed for Fribourg University but could be applicable to other Swiss universities and could serve Switzerland's universities policy. In general, it should improve forecasting, decision making, and the monitoring of results in the management of higher education establishments at local and national levels. It should especially lead to quantifying an important factor in university discussions: the cost of a place occupied by a student or research worker at the different levels of the different courses of study or lines of research. The system of analysis involves student record cards,  time budget allocation cards, cards showing costs of elementary units of activity, and indirect costs--all used for computerized data processing.

The system illustrates the use of a management method to secure better utilization of university resources. Departments decide how to use the appropriations granted to them and establish a system of internal prices that reflect the cost to the university community of the use of its various resources. This decentralized management method requires the university authorities to have rational criteria for determining the appropriations to be allocated to the various departments. The analysis of unit costs is seen as an essential stage in the introduction of a decentralized management method. It should serve as a basis for defining objective standards to be applied to  departmental budgetary requirements. User reactions and problem areas are discussed, including planned jobs, time sharing, increase in volume of budgetary appropriations, and surpluses arising from external work. (LBH)",

After an initial phase devoted to working out a common methodology, it was decided that the latter should be put directly to the test and that devices would have to be found to bridge the gaps in existing data, as, and when, the necessity arose. Each of the universities associated in the research project conducted a number of studies and worked out numerical evaluations set forth in separate reports. It is emphasized that the evaluations are very provisional. The main results are covered in terms of inputs available to the universities (staff, capital operation), as well as the activity and output costs. It is noted in conclusion that the  retrospective knowledge of costs is only a stage, not a goal itself, and to be meaningful must be placed in its true perspective, i.e., the improvement of the decision making and management procedures of the university system.

Those calls have not been fruitless. Thirty-nine states now have some program of direct or indirect support for private colleges and universities. In many cases, programs seem to have been developed in response to specific needs, and once established with their own power base and natural lobby, continually increased. The ad hoc nature of much state support strongly suggests that it has been built in the absence of an adequately conceived and carefully analyzed policy base. It is important to think systematically about the relationship of state policy and private higher education. Issues involved are policy  objectives for all institutions of higher education, whether or not the survival, quality, functions, purposes or outcomes of these institutions of higher education are a matter of state concern; the establishment of consistent outcome indicators; inducements for change; and policy alternatives.

It provides a method of estimation of staff and costs at departmental (or equivalent structure) level in terms of twelve broad subject areas and these are then used to derive staff, areas, recurrent and some capital expenditures at the overall university level. The results of a typical example are given. The second part presents a generalized conceptual/data-based methodology for the calculation of university departmental academic, supporting and  administrative staff by broad subject area and geographical region. The methodology has been specifically formulated to accommodate different types of student programmes and the method is illustrated by example to a typical British University.

Equally important consideration is being given to technological developments in the country. Thus far, an inquiry covering 1,200 secondary school dropouts in the autonomous region of Voivodina came to the conclusion that eight high school pupils out of ten intend to continue their education at a university and that they are interested in studying law, arts, economics, engineering,  and technology. A thorough investigation of student flows at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Novi Sad came to the conclusion that forecasting the number of incoming students must take into consideration the large variations in the number of entering students, the relatively small number of graduates, and the relatively large number of dropouts after the first and the second year of study.

This publication, based on a survey conducted among the 130 member institutions of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC), is an attempt to show the dimensions of the financial crisis besetting large public universities. The colleges and universities represented in this report together enrolled slightly more than 30 percent, or 3.1 million, of the 10.2 million students attending all higher education institutions in Fall, 1974. The questionnaire attempted to identify possible trouble areas. Analysis of the data is designed to show the effects of inflation and of continued  enrollment increases on the financial resources of these universities. Special attention has been devoted to the growing problem of inadequate state appropriations. Economy measures being taken to help combat rising costs and other efforts to cope with crisis situations are emphasized. Implicit in every aspect of the financial crisis is the question of quality. This is evidenced by the major unmet needs as analyzed by the universities themselves. (Author/JMF)",

        "description":"Because of the growing emphasis on tenure and faculty evaluation the Southern Regional Education Board conducted a survey of faculty evaluation procedures. Questionnaires received from 536 private and public institutions in a 14-state region illustrate the picture of who evaluates, how, and why. The survey showed that the department chairperson and the chief academic officer are those persons primarily responsible for evaluation. Others involved in the process at various institutions included high administrative officers, faculty committees, and students. Alumni, joint student faculty committees, or peers from other institutions are used very little in the evaluation process. The primary reason given for faculty evaluation was faculty development and improvement. Other reasons  listed were to provide diagnostic information on teaching behavior and effectiveness, and to provide data on which to make decisions regarding reappointment, promotion and tenure. Evaluation is generally based on instruction, advising, administrative activities (e.g., serving on decision and policy-making committees), personal attributes, research, publications, activity in professional societies, public service, and civic activities.

Increasing restrictions have been placed on the qualities of freedom and diversity, which this nation has historically valued in its institutions of higher education. But there is also a heightened awareness of the enormous powers the people have entrusted to their government, and the potential and actual dangers of abuse of these powers. The persistent failure by the executive branch to consult the education community on matters which affect it, particularly in the development of regulations implementing Federal programs, is a cause of these problems and a reason for demanding broader participation in the decision making  process. With such consultation, the college community would obtain a helpful understanding of the problems the regulations are intended to address and program officials would obtain an early warning of possible difficulties that might arise in administering the regulations.

Through this program, Hofstra has received summary statistics on the students who have requested that their SAT scores be sent to Hofstra, those who apply, and enrolled students. Normative data are also included for prospective applicants to all colleges and to other four-year private colleges to provide a perspective for determining unique characteristics of Hofstra prospective applicants. The profiles are based on responses to the Student Descriptive Questionnaire (SDQ), which provides information concerning student interests, backgrounds, activities, and educational plans. The main questions asked in this document have to do with the  characteristics of: prospective applicants as compared to those of other four-year colleges and to other colleges in general; the accepted applications as compared to the enrolled; the enrolled as compared to the no-shows; and Hofstra applicants who requested financial aid as compared to the total group. In addition, each subgroup's profile can be compared with each other and all groups can be compared over time. These data provide much information that can be used for admissions criteria, financial aid policies, plans for academic programs, and particularly for recruitment purposes. (Author/KE)",

A total of 364 other institutions of higher education, including 44 universities, also participated in this continuing national study of higher education. This document presents a comparative analysis of various demographic data, opinions, and projections of the entering freshmen at USC. USC entering freshmen were compared as a whole to the national norms; they were also compared by the colleges in which they were enrolled. Sex differences were reported where they appeared to be important. Eleven areas of interest were selected for this analysis from the original 52 areas contained in the questionnaire. The eleven  areas selected to provide a composite profile of the entering freshmen were: (1) age; (2) racial background; (3) average grade in high school; (4) highest degree planned anywhere; (5) reasons noted as important for selecting the college; (6) estimated parental income; (7) probable major field of study; (8) current religious preference; (9) political orientation; (10) &quot;students estimate chances are very good that they will&quot;; (11) residence planning during fall term. Results showed that the U.S.C. entering freshmen as compared with others, generally achieved lower in high school; academic reputation of U.S.C. was of less importance in selecting school; were more likely to be Black less confident academically; more likely to be Protestant; and more likely to live at home than in a college  dormitory.

        "description":"This document summarizes some of the major findings and basic conclusions of a study conducted during the 1973-75 period, the goal of which was to assess the impact of collective bargaining on conflict resolution practices in higher education. The population of institutions operating under collectively negotiated contracts with faculty in September 1973 was matched with a corresponding sample of colleges (for size, level of degree offering, type of control and region of the country) not then operating under negotiated contracts. Both groups were subsequently surveyed to establish: (1) the nature of formal mechanisms used for resolving faculty conflict; and (2) the extent to which these procedures had been used. The most general conclusion reached is that more universalistic and  secular principles of conflict resolution are replacing the older more informal norms based on the traditions and values of a shared concept of academic life. Greater and greater emphasis on procedural protection appears in general to be supplanting the mechanisms on consensus, trust, and shared authority as the accepted mode of dispute resolution.

        "description":"On January 25, 1973 the Board of Trustees and the Faculty Federation of Southeastern Massachusetts University ratified what each party considered to be a unique and broadly optimistic collective bargaining agreement. The agreement was germinated as the progeny of two strongly shared beliefs: (1) in the need to create a system for the development of a participatory democracy within the academic processes of the University; and (2) that the academic processes of the University could be structured through collective bargaining to most effectively achieve such a system. In attempting to structure the university's decision-making processes, responsibility and authority have been given credence through accountability. This is in keeping with all good administrative practices and  applicable to all forms of institutions and offices. However, it has not always been rigorously applied within the academy. Southeastern Massachusetts University has learned through experience that a well conceived and well structured collective bargaining agreement is not a panacea for curing the ills of colleges and universities, but it has also learned that such an agreement can go a long way toward making them healthy, functional, and effective.

This study was conducted to determine the level of agreement among faculty, student services staff, and students before major collective bargaining activities, such as a run-off election, take place. Assessed are attitudes held by faculty, students who are active and assumedly concerned with the welfare and the dynamics of the University, and staff members under the Office of Student Services toward aspects of collective bargaining at the Ohio State University, Columbia campus. Findings point out a variety of areas, such as fringe benefits, working conditions, and student participation that have the potential to become areas of conflict. In the event of  collective bargaining at Ohio State, the question whether decisions will be made in the distributive model as a result of power, coercion, and formalization, or in the integrative model as a result of trust, reason, and shared goals will be partly dependent upon a change in the attitudes of the parties involved. Those parties must understand that they are not simply interest groups but that they constitute the University and share a variety of common goals and interests. (Author/KE)",

It presents four factors as possible participation rates in National Institutes of Health (NIH) training grants and in other federal programs: (1) propensity of the medical school to produce graduates later employed in academic medicine; (2) experience of the faculty with respect to previous participation in federal programs; (3) emphasis on graduate training in the basic sciences; and (4) clinical orientation of  the medical school. Utilizing nine variables to describe the four predictors, a model was devised that predicts faculty participation rates in the NIH training grant programs among the medical schools.

The training was conducted with 15 trainees participating in each session. Trainees were state employees who were employed to determine eligibility for food stamps, medical assistance, SSA unemployment insurance, etc. Their formal education was generally less than 2 years of college. The instructional objectives were to develop interviewing and counseling skills, understanding of human behavior, and appreciation of values held by different groups. Enrollees were first trained in discriminating among different qualities of responses that workers might make to clients' statements. They then practiced responding, first in writing and then orally, to client statements.  A pre- and posttraining assessment of enrollees' communication skills was made by administering paper-and-pencil tests and by analyzing the content of role-playing interviews. The data suggested that the interviewing skills of the participants were considerably better at the end of training, but short-term training is not adequate to produce the level of interviewing skills possessed by effective counselors or therapists. Pre- and posttraining measures of the participants' values were also obtained. The data indicated that by the end of training the trainees were more accepting of the values desirable for professional social workers. Tables and appendixes of paper-and-pencil tests are included.

        "description":"A major problem in social work field institution is that there is very little organized structure or order to field teaching. This document discusses the creation and evaluation of a training manual in performance-oriented field instruction that can be used as a tool for clinical faculty to develop an orderly and systematic progression of teaching. In developing the training manual, the behavioristic psychology of learning was utilized as a basis for developing a systems approach in which field instruction is conceptualized as a course for which content can be selected, behavioral objectives defined, learning activities planned, and student learning assessed. It was designed as a self-instructional guide for field teachers to use in operationalizing a systematic method of  preparing instructional units for students and developing curriculum for field work. The first draft of the training guide was utilized and critiqued by three experts in methods of field teaching, then revised according to their recommendations. The revised guide was then evaluated and field tested by agency instructors. Participants' evaluations were extremely favorable. (Author/KE)",

        "description":"Congressman O'Hara, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education, has presented a bill for student financial aid for higher education (H.R. 3471). The first question is how well do the provisions of the bill serve broader societal goals? After summarizing the bill and examining provisions and implications of the bill that affect the furtherance of equal access and a viable postsecondary educational system, the bill was found to do little in the way of furthering these goals and, in fact, it neutralizes some of the progress made by the Educational Amendments of 1972. H.R. 3471 offers nothing to encourage greater institutional diversity and in some instances it is positively harmful, discriminating against high-tuition schools and schools that price at cost. While it  does include provision for protecting the student as consumer, this amounts to little more than recognition of the issue. Insofar as the bill enables more people to obtain some kind of postsecondary education, it promotes greater access; however, by using &quot;the leverage of Federal student aid in such a way to encourage the creation and utilization of low-cost educational opportunities,&quot;the bill, in design and implementation, leads toward a kind of access that is neither equitable nor efficient.

Using data provided by the institutions and additional material obtained from numerous campus visits, this study identifies the support functions and their costs that fit into student, academic, and institutional support classification at five first-rate, independent liberal arts colleges. It provides a synoptical view of the academic year 1973-74. It is basically a fiscal analysis of costs of support operations. Detailed comparative analyses  of this information provide the basis for the conclusions and suggestions for possible improvements in economy of operation. Suggestions are a reduction of cost in the following categories: academic administration and personnel development; financial aid for operating funds; physical plant; and community relations. Other possible methods are: a reduction of faculty; an increase in enrollment; and an increase in student financial aid from government sources. (Author/KE)",

This contrasts with the question typically asked: \"What does the person being socialized have to do to succeed?\" It shifts the focus of attention from children or students to parents or faculty. In this research the focus is on theological faculty. The sample consists of 269 faculty teaching at 15 theological schools. Fifteen of 33 schools were chosen and stratified by university affiliation and denomination. There were 389 full-time faculty at the rank of assistant professor or above who were the universe sampled. A representative sample of 269 (69 percent) were chosen as respondents. Research consisted of visiting each school for a week, interviewing faculty, talking informally with  students, and researching the history of the school in the library. Interviews focused on and covered these areas: personal background, major curricula shifts since 1960, students, faculty colleagues, career development, intellectual context, and future of the church. Findings and conclusions are: (1) the schools are more alike than different; (2) since there is no vision of theological education that commands widespread respect and authority, changes occuring in format, teaching technique, and student freedom are based on a system of trial and error; (3) schools are less than 3 percent female or black; and (4) theological language, in its traditional sense, is used very little.

Four times as many high school graduates from high-income families enter the University of California than do graduates of low-income families. The entrance rate to the State University and Colleges for high-income graduates is twice the rate for low-income graduates. An examination of the educational and work choices of 1,600 random graduates of 20 Los Angeles high schools revealed that only 4 percent and 9 percent of all black graduates enter UC and CSUC, respectively. The inequality of college opportunities largely results from the disproportionate numbers of low income graduates who are ineligible to enter the University of California or the State University and Colleges. Findings also indicate that UC  entrance requirements that focus on high school performance in math and science courses discriminate against women graduates, Los Angeles high schools are greatly segregated, and entrance rates to private colleges and community colleges are surprisingly equal. Several steps to overcome inequities are: (1) expansion of student financial aid programs to further alleviate financial barriers to college; (2) expansion and improvement of outreach programs; and (3) greater flexibility in UC and CSUC admission requirements.

        "description":"Using effectivemess, efficiency, self-sustenance, and communicability as criteria, a conceptual model, called SCRAPE, was developed at the University of Texas to systematically describe educational behaviors. The key elements of the system are: (1) diagnosis and prescription, (2) instructional events, (3) achievement evaluation, and (4) consequent activities. Within each of these elements, behaviors can be classified as either input processing, recording, monitering, or output. Having outlined a course in this fashion, an instructor could then use the assistance of an instructional engineer to determine which teaching processes should be human and which should substitute technology; the engineer could then take the responsibility to design the nonhuman elements of the educational  system. This report offers a paradigm for developing educational systems, and it includes detailed examples of the variables that could effect each element of the system. (EMH)",

The assumed model of design behavior predicts that the design behavior can be determined by measuring the information interchange between the designer and his environment.

As part of a comprehensive evaluation plan, the summative data base was augmented with subjective interpretive information derived from three case studies. The case studies conducted as part of the STD data collection activities were expected to produce four major benefits: (1) insights which would help in refining and modifying the data for summative purposes; (2) insights into the sequences of events and motivations occuring at sites; (3) information to amplify and clarify the interpretation of other statistical  data received from all sites; and (4) validation of statistical information derived from site visitation serving as a data check for the large quantities of information collected from STD sites. The data collected from the case studies were largely subjective and response to various treatments at the sites varied at both extremes, depending on the methods used and the influence of the local staff. It was concluded that extensive data collection efforts were endured and supported probably because the STD was perceived as having an experimental base.

The report first describes existing treatment and institutions and gives the author's opinions as to how to make constructive changes in both public attitudes and the system, of which he is highly critical. The counter-productiveness of the mass conformity imposed on the boys in the camp is emphasized. There follows a discussion of libraries in such institutions, the narrow, protected places they often are and the open, idea-producing places they ought to be. The author describes his attempts to give the library a real, rather than institutional, atmosphere and to engage the boys' enthusiasm by making them  participants in the library with projects that ranged from cleaning windows to selecting books and music criticism. He concludes, however, that since the library is part of a controlling institution, it cannot perform its major function--teaching the boys to take control of their lives. (LS)",

Library trustees, Friends, concerned citizens, and librarians from all types of libraries heard talks by state and local government officials, social planners, and eminent librarians. Topics discussed included library planning, librarianship in general, new technology, libraries and local government, library program funding, interlibrary loans and cooperative programs, urban and rural libraries, library systems, library legislation, and the California Library Authority for Systems and Services (CLASS). Several presentations were also made concerning the Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Company (PMM) report &quot;California Public Library Systems: a Comprehensive Review with Guidelines for the Next  Decade.&quot; A midweek opinion poll showed support for the PMM report in the areas of transaction-based interlibrary loan funding formulas, funding the program, and equal access to libraries, but the participants preferred resource sharing based on existing library structures and a statewide on-line union catalog rather than the structure suggested by PMM. Small study groups considered the report and other aspects of California's library future and produced programs for structuring and funding interlibrary activities. Recommendations were then developed for a new legislative program. (LS)",

Participants also learned about communication and change processes from the behavioral sciences, and were exposed to the general topics of perception, language, meaning, development of understanding, conflict resolution, consensus achievement, communications relationships, implementing change, and planning for change in public libraries. Finally, the participants were given tools for teaching what they had learned when  they returned to their communities. Outside evaluators prepared two narrative evaluations of the institute, and quantitative evaluations were made at the midpoint and end of the institute by administering questionnaires to participants. All were generally favorable. Appendixes contain institute documents, letters, and brochures, as well as a biographic information about the participants. (LS)",

        "description":"Because the volume of information circulating in our society has proliferated since World War II and become increasingly subject to processing by electronic hardware, the public has a vital interest in knowing how information performs, how its flow is controlled, and on what terms it is made available to the public. Since all information systems are concerned with one or more of the following basic functions: creating information, storing information, processing information, distributing information, and/or using information, there has been much duplication and interchangeability of information technology. The Program on Information Technologies and Public Policy aims to develop an understanding of these merging technologies and to use that understanding to illuminate public  discussions of information policies. The research group at Harvard University frames issues and hypotheses prepares background documents, and analyzes data that are subjected to review and criticism and then released to a wide public audience. This first volume of a two volume annual report concentrates on the program scope and aims, and it includes graphs and tabular data showing the growth and organization of the information industry.

A library science course in principles of materials selection was designed to fulfill these three learning requirements. The method used was an adaptation of the American Society for Information Science 1975 poster sessions; it consisted of a number of simultaneous informal student presentations using graphs, diagrams, data, pictures, and a small amount of text. The class was divided into teams that took turns making presentations and being active participants. In  informal evaluations the participants indicated that there was more active learning taking place in this interactive, informal atmosphere than in traditional lecture textbook courses. An additional advantage was seen in the students' opportunity to use and improve communication skills they would need when working in libraries. (LS)",

Library school faculty members are available to nearby libraries as resource people and, in return, invite area librarians to serve as advisors or guest speakers. Cooperation is also possible in making the curriculum of the school relevant to the personnel needs of the locality, as well as in preparing students for the job market and matching student strengths to specific job requirements. Finally, librarians and the library school may cooperate in developing continuing education activities based on the needs of  the local librarians. (LS)",

Blacks and Asian Americans were being recruited into the library profession in numbers comparable to their representation in the pool of college graduates, but the Spanish-surnamed and American Indians were not. While three quarters of all master's degrees and 6th year certificates were earned by women, the women earned only one third of the doctoral degrees. White men outnumbered white women  on library education program faculties, and more men than women held positions at the higher levels. Among minorities on faculties, blacks predominated with other ethnic groups appearing in very small numbers. Data tables are attached. (Author/LS)",

Arizona State University (ASU) has chosen a data base management system (DBMS) to coordinate disparate existing systems and eliminate extensive manual integration of data from the various systems. However, raising a budget for the project is not a simple matter. Difficulties also arise in convincing the diverse elements of a university's bureaucratic hierarchy to cooperate on a DBMS. At ASU, a Data  Base Review Committee, representing major administrative areas, has been set up to encourage effective management/technical interaction and inter-departmental cooperation in data base development.

There is a need for the development and application of critical standards that recognize and utilize the unique characteristics identified by Marshal McLuhan. Television audience response is often judged by a simple head count which is an archaic method of determining listeners. Public television programing needs to encourage audience participation with programs whose content has been thoroughly researched; but instead of researching why one program succeeds while another fails, PBS is satisfied to borrow from the British Broadcasting Company. One alternative would be to use the programs rejected by commercial  networks, but which are acceptable to the PBS audience. The second alternative would call for PBS to take a more aggressive and systematic research approach to determine its audience and its preferences. (Author/DS)",

Social responsibility began with the Fairness Doctrine, the Equal Time Rule, and other Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations, but was expanded further when cigarette commercials were banned in 1971. Freedom of speech in programing must be retained and the truth encouraged in advertising. Legal challenges involving the social responsibility of television stations are centered around three main issues: (1) station awareness of the needs and interests of the local community, (2) station discrimination in employment, and (3) the need for more programing of a particular type. These issues will be an important point for media students to study in the future, and a strong  background in media theory will be needed to cope with these problems. Social responsibility can either initiate an era of examination and development for the good of society or it can clog the courts with petty complaints. (Author/DS)",

        "description":"The feasibility of computer applications in teacher education programs and growing importance to educational professionals of knowledge of computers provide a framework which justifies the need for a computer utilization survey course in the teacher education curriculum. Instructional management systems to keep records and to monitor student progress are increasing, and the use of computers in the classroom is just beginning to develop. Teachers need to understand and to be able to use computer resources which are available to them. One study in higher education revealed that computer applications have made little progress in the humanities. A computer assisted instruction course on statistics and test construction was favorably evaluated by most of the teacher education students  enrolled. A concise, nontechnical introduction to the use of computers in education is a viable alternative to the direct acquisition of computer skills. (CH)",

In conjunction with the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), the college undertook an extensive probe into information networks to see if the institution's demands for information, data processing, and planning could be supplied by an IBM system. A six-man team of college staff and IBM personnel conducted interviews and collected data attempting to spell out the administrative processes and information flow required to supply leadership with more perfect information. It was found that the information flow was poor, restricted by departmental provincialism. The development of an  institution-wide, computer-based system was recommended. (EMH)",

Many feel that broadcast education in higher education should return to a greater study of humanistic, liberal arts courses with a de-emphasis on the vocational aspects of the curricula. Vocational training is defined as teaching &quot;how to,&quot; but not &quot;what&quot; or &quot;why.&quot; Conversley, liberal arts education teaches the power of understanding and judgment. Expanded perception and extension of the ability to think logically and thoroughly about any subject, to learn the difference between dogma and reality, to note discrepancies and to acquire the habit of precise and accurate communication--in short, the development of critical thought, which may not be  relevant to getting the first job but may be relevant to the survival of our civilization--should be the aim of broadcast education.

The military community is also expected to use computer networks to satisfy an appreciable portion of its requirements. Commercial terminals and available computer networks provide the basis for an effective and economical user interface to military CAI systems. (Author/EMH)",

Three episodes of Medical Story were prepared. In two, antisocial endings were presented; in a third, a prosocial ending was presented. An entirely different episode created a fourth (control) condition for the three experimental variations: (1) antisocial behavior with punishment, (2) antisocial behavior without punishment, and (3) prosocial behavior. In several experiments, various versions were shown to audiences, and subjects were tested later by their reactions to an  experimental situation. Milgram and Shotland concluded that television's influence on antisocial behavior was &quot;not proven.&quot; A careful examination of these experiments shows them to be flawed and poorly conceived, largely irrelevant to prior research, and a minor contribution to the large body of scientific evidence relevant to the topic.

While the Marin ROP was jointly sponsored by three secondary school districts and a two-campus community college, the ROP was administered by the Marin County Superintendent of Schools. As a component of the Marin ROP, a practicum was designed to teach eighteen vocational teachers how to use video equipment in order to: (1) increase the diversity of teaching styles, (2) sharpen self-assessment skills, and (3) use the equipment as a teaching tool. Sixteen teachers produced videotaped lessons and fifteen teachers chose to incorporate the videotaped lessons in their annual  teaching evaluations. The author concluded that while videotaped lessons are a valid tool for increasing teachers' self-assessment awareness and capabilities, self-assessment as a stated objective for producing videotaped lessons created high degrees of teacher apprehension. Therefore, it was speculated that if teachers simply learned how to operate the equipment as a teaching tool and produced lessons for classroom use, self-assessment would automatically occur because teachers would see themselves teaching and begin to change.

State and federal trends towards accountability and detailed cost accounting restrict the administrator's ability to cope with the problems of the institution. Similarly, efforts to make each component of the institution operate on a profit basis provide incentive, but they limit flexibility. If the economic flow of the institution is charted in detail, it can serve as a model used to identify the institution's weakest elements, but it should be remembered that encouraging departmental self-sufficiency can lead to fragmentation and internal dissonance.

Specifically, its purpose was to demonstrate the relevance of &quot;shape&quot; in relation to the properties of matter from the molecular level to the galactic. Some 180 students enrolled in a first year chemistry course, and 17 freshman chemistry teachers took part in the evaluation of the program which involved responding to a set of questions after viewing the program. The students found the programs stimulating, informative, and neither boring or confusing. Most found the analogies in the program very or somewhat helpful in understanding the various properties of matter and very or somewhat relevant to their chemistry  course. Teachers responded even more favorably than students. Over 90 percent found the program somewhat to very stimulating and neither boring nor confusing. Most teachers also found it very informative. Like the students, the teachers found the analogies very or somewhat helpful in understanding the various properties of matter and very or somewhat relevant to a first year chemistry course. They also preferred a combination of both the method used in the program and a conventional lecture-type method and stated they would like to see more programs of this type used in their classes. The findings suggest that programs like &quot;Quest into Matter&quot; would be readily welcomed as supplementary material to textbook information. (Author/HB)",

For example, an experimental color television camera developed recently is no larger than a 35mm camera; resolution in video equipment has been vastly improved and changed to a digital mode which can be used to generate extremely realistic computer animation; advances in fiber optics and lasers may lead to the development of high-density audiovisual recorders with no moving parts; and reducation of electrical components to the molecular size also provides some interesting possibilities for the near future.

        "description":"The effect of feedback on group cohesiveness (measured in terms of group and task attractiveness) for a person who is performing a simple, highly repetitive task was studied. One hundred business administration students, randomly assigned to five member groups, completed a series of trials having the goal of determining the number commonly held by the other members of their group as quickly as possible. In each group communication was restricted to written messages and partitions restricted the flow of messages among members according to a predetermined wheel or circle communication network. Half the groups participated in feedback at the end of each trial, the other half did not. All subjects were measured for their feeling of group and task attractiveness at the beginning,  middle and end of the experiment. Based on a nested hierarchical design, feedback was found to positively affect a member's opinion of his group, but neither the opportunity for feedback, the network nor the individual's position within the network had a significant influence on the member's attractiveness to the task (findings are significant at the .005 level). The findings suggested group attractiveness was facilitated through formalized feedback mechanisms. However, feedback does not change an individual's opinion of the job performed. Similarly, programs designed to furnish feedback to workers performing menial tasks may not enhance the workers attractiveness to the job. (HB)",

Designed to be an affective stimulus in the classroom, the series was analyzed to document how women were portrayed and the extent to which stereotyping occurred in the work roles shown. Five categories of common sex roles were established: (1) female job ghetto; (2) male career domain; (3) woman in a man's job; (4) man in a woman's job; and (5) nonsexist career presentation (a job or career in which the skill required is the main criteria for doing it). The characters were analyzed both in terms of the jobs they were shown doing and the context in which they were shown. In terms of the amount of time each category was  shown, over one-third of the characters portrayed in nonsexist roles were from one program, and only one program focuses on a character who was portrayed in a nonsexist way. It was found that no woman was portrayed as competently and confidently doing her job in a leadership position. Also, while many nonsexist role models were briefly portrayed in the series, in terms of the context in which women are shown, little was done to break down commonly held stereotypes of women and men in the work world.

In order to evaluate the program, questionnaires were sent to: (1) administrators of agencies that had participated in the project; (2) those who had not participated; (3) the staff of the public library of Youngstown and Mahoning County, Ohio; and (4) the staff of Project Outreach. It was concluded that  Project Outreach represented a creative response to an urgent community need and should be continued. The four questionnaires and the statistical data used to tabulate the response are included. Supplementary data cover the oral history project and a timescale of local historical events from 1890 to 1945. A log of the hours spent in data gathering and evaluation is appended. (Author/DS)",

Comparison of this report with two previous reports evidences continued growth in diversity and number of programs. Apparent, too, is the evolution of many significant programs from relatively small beginnings. In general, DCE offerings are of two types: those developed for particular groups through grants and contracts, and those offered to the public on a tuition basis. Through collaborative efforts with other community institutions, DCE identifies educational needs, selects courses, recruits students, and evaluates outcomes. Although DCE offers only non-credit courses and programs, it can  stimulate the development of credit and degree programs. In the past two years, DCE has attempted to involve the departments of the College in early stages of curriculum planning. This has created the opportunity for departmental faculty to make larger contributions to program design. DCE has also strengthened its relationship with students, involving them not only in the evaluation of teaching and course content, but in planning for new programs. Specific programs and community service projects are described, and statistical data are appended. (Author/NHM)",

Leading towards an Associate in Arts degree, courses are designed to meet transfer and admission requirements of U.S. colleges and universities. This self-evaluation report proposes to present an accurate account of the college, its philosophy, educational programs, and aspirations  for the future. It provides descriptions of the academic program (curriculum, curriculum development, academic travel program, and co-curricular activities), students and student life (admissions, counseling, services, athletics and extra-curricular activities, and the student association), faculty and teaching, physical plant and facilities, college organization and administration, finances, and the continuing system of college and program evaluation.

It became evident while researching course content materials for the current trends course that the personal and vocational relationships course required of Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) students was very similar. Because of this similarity, a core nursing course was proposed which would be equally applicable to ADN or LPN programs. The core course was centered around a common textbook entitled &quot;Historical Perspectives and Current Trends in Nursing,&quot; and was offered to students in 12 ADN and 12 LPN programs in public community colleges in Illinois. In order to test  the hypothesis that the two levels of community college nursing students would each achieve a satisfactory level of attainment in the core course, 12 unit review tests consisting of 12 items each were administered to 505 ADN students and 469 LPN students. Performance was evaluated through testing for content validity and correlating scores of ADN and LPN students. Mean test scores proved to be essentially equal, verifying the applicability of the course to either program. Data are tabulated and a bibliography is appended. (Author/NHM)",

Potential students had two 20-minute interviews: one by a staff member of the program to which application was made, and one by another staff member. Interviewers rated the applicants on several personal characteristics including: perception of nursing, stamina, personal integrity and maturity, self insight and self concept, interpersonal competency, problem solving skills, social conscience and empathy, ethics, communication skills, ability to work with hands, and personal appearance. Interviewers also gave each applicant a percentile rating and an acceptability rating. Final selection was made by ranking applicants  according to a total summed score obtained by adding the rating scores of the two interviewers. A bonus of 10 points was given to all Johnson County residents. An evaluation of the results revealed that nursing staff and non-nursing staff tended to give comparable ratings to the same applicant. A survey of the 34 interviewers showed a favorable overall reaction to the structured interview instrument and related procedures. Data are tabulated, previous selection methods are summarized, and the interview instrument is appended. (NHM)",

Four major input variables are then incorporated into the model: (1) death rate--deaths are projected for males and females as a function of the number of people for each age; (2) birth rate--three equations are offered, with the most popular projecting the number of births by using the fertility rates of women by age; (3) net migration--total subarea net migration (the number of people moving in minus the number of people moving out of a given area) is assigned by age and sex; (4) land  use--designations are based on zoning. Categories employed in this model are: special, agricultural, industrial, commercial, residential (low, medium, and high density), and unzoned. Zoning is specified for the beginning year, and the user has the option of incorporating anticipated zoning changes into the model. Mathematical and computer procedures used in this model include regression analysis and the two-point logistic curve.

Approximately 300 faculty members responded, giving heaviest weight to classroom effectiveness, however measured; least weight to personal life style; and preference to performance over outcome as a means of measuring teaching effectiveness. With the help of the responses to the questionnaire, the committee produced this report which recommends that evaluations for faculty growth be kept  separate from evaluations for promotion and retention, and makes some suggestions for ways of promoting growth. The report also specifies what should be considered in promotional evaluations, and the relative weight each item should be given. This report, accordingly, is divided into two parts, with part 1 addressed to growth and development, and part 2 addressed to criteria for promotional evaluation. The questionnaire and tabulated responses are appended. (NHM)",

        "description":"The academic suspension policy at Harrisburg Area Community College prescribes minimum grade point averages which must be maintained for students to remain academically eligible. In order to study the effectiveness of this policy, the faculty council held it in abeyance for a period of three semesters. The intent of this research was to compare the academic progress of those students placed on suspension and readmitted after a period of nonacademic activity (Group 1), and those students who would ordinarily have been suspended, but were permitted to re-enroll during the subsequent semester (Group 2). Variables identified included: demographic data, curriculum admitted to, current curriculum; semester suspended, GPA of suspension semester, credits carried during suspension  semester; readmit date; GPA's first and second semester after readmit, credits taken those semesters; cumulative GPA, cumulative credits, and graduation. During the period of spring 1970 to fall 1975, 1,302 students were suspended, of whom 259 returned to school, and 21 graduated. In Group 1, 82 percent did not return, and in Group 2, 77 percent did not return. The success (measured by GPA) of students after readmission was lower in Group 2 than in Group 1. Data are organized into 46 tables on the basis of the variables identified above. (NHM)",

Utilization as herein defined is restricted in scope and applies only to regularly scheduled classes which meet during the hours listed in the registrar's schedule of class-hour meetings. This study assesses the degree to which available instructional space accommodates the various instructional programs and their corresponding student loads. An equally valuable outcome of this study rests on its value in estimating future space requirements. Four basic types of rooms are identified: general classrooms, seminar rooms, teaching laboratories, and teaching auditoriums. Relevant considerations include the building in which the room is located, the number of square feet, and  the number of student stations. The utilization of instructional space is analyzed according to the following variables: days of the week, hours of the day, building, size of room, class size in relation to room capacity. This report recommends that lectures normally be scheduled in general purpose classrooms, thus freeing laboratories for additional laboratory-oriented classes. Also discussed are courses not requiring the assignment of regular instruction instructional space, and the use of off-campus facilities. Data are organized into 10 tables. (Author/NHM)",

The historical review begins with 1874 because the decision made that year in the Kalamazoo Case confirmed the right of communities to support high schools by taxation. It ends with 1921 because two pivotal events occurred in that year: first, the organization of the American Association of Junior Colleges, and second, the establishment of the first unitary two-year junior college, namely, Modesto Junior College in Modesto, California. It reviews the historical development of secondary schools, liberal arts colleges, professional schools, universities, and junior colleges in that time period.

        "description":"A 10-member panel of judges selected two North Carolina community colleges with a high degree of democratic governance and two community colleges with a low degree of democratic governance. All full-time instructors at these four institutions were mailed a research instrument based on the semantic differential technique, and designed to test six needs: security, social, the esteem of others, self-esteem, autonomy, and self-actualization. One hundred eighty-eight usable responses were returned (59 percent). It was found that democratic governance has a positive, significant relationship to needs satisfaction, especially for academic instructors. Thus, if a community college assigns a high priority to faculty needs satisfaction, its management system should make provisions for  involving the faculty in decision-making. In particular, community college administrators should attempt to involve academic instructors in decision-making. Efforts to satisfy the needs of technical and vocational instructors could be concentrated more on classroom-related issues and on benefits. To eliminate role strain, community colleges should try to attract instructors who are committed to the community college philosophy. Data are displayed in four tables, and the semantic differential instrument is appended. (Author/NHM)",

Fifty students (25 in each subject area) were tested by the regular cloze method of testing readability. The cloze test consists of selecting a passage of prose material of approximately 275 words from the students' textbook and deleting every fifth word. Students are instructed to fill in the blanks with words appropriate to the context. The remaining 50 students were given the cloze test  after exposure to a SQ3R &quot;preview&quot; of the material. Since there was little difference between the raw scores of the control and experimental groups in either subject area, it was determined that the SQ3R &quot;preview&quot; was of no value in augmenting test-taking skills. Since students were able to fill in correctly fewer than 38 percent of the blanks, it was determined that the welding and air-conditioning/refrigeration textbooks in current use were probably beyond the readability level of the students.

The opening chapter presents a detailed philosophic argument in favor of general education as a principle, and in support of the innovative aspects of the Los Medanos model. The argument is for general education as a hub of the total curriculum and as a requirement for the institutional endorsement of a degree. However, Los Medanos has full-blown programs in vocational areas, in transfer fields, and in continuing education as well. The Los Medanos model provides for interdisciplinary generic courses to be offered under the categories of: the behavioral, social, biological, and physical sciences, language arts, and humanistic  studies. The 10 chapters of this document address such topics as the local context, generic and discipline courses, intensive student projects, the evaluation design, evaluation of the planning phase, impact of the planning process, problems with the model, and further developments.

The instructor/coordinators were asked questions concerning their teaching and employment background and plans, and their perceptions of the work experience program.

In fall 1975, 9,508 students new to higher education and 4,123 transfer students applied for admission to the seven community colleges; 8,886 (94 percent) of the new students and 3,619 (88 percent) of the transfer student applicants were admitted. Three-fourths of the admitted new students and two-thirds of the admitted transfer students actually enrolled. Of the 4,636 new students applying for admission to the liberal arts programs, 4,425 (95.4 percent) were accepted and 3,293 (74.4 percent of those accepted) actually enrolled. Of the 4,073 new students applying for admission to the vocational education  programs, 3,711 (91.1 percent) were accepted and 2,751 (74.1 percent of those accepted) actually enrolled. Of the 1,733 transfer students applying for admission to the liberal arts programs, 1,538 (88.7 percent) were accepted and 1,007 (65.5 percent of those accepted) actually enrolled. Of the 1,607 transfer students applying for admission to the vocational education programs, 1,333 (82.9 percent) were accepted and 929 (69.7 percent of those accepted) actually enrolled. Additional tabular data on applications, acceptances, and registrations are provided by sex and institution. (DC)",

The 141 usable responses to the mail survey represent a 65.9 percent rate of return. The survey instrument was desgined to initiate responses from the graduates in terms of: (1) appropriateness of the course of study to the work situation; (2) possible improvements of the course of study; (3) work history; (4) name and address of present employer and supervisor; (5) the nature of work; and (6) salary. Upon receipt and tabulation of the data, a second questionnaire was prepared and mailed to employers and supervisors to determine the adequacy of training from the college with reference to the needs of the employment position. A usable return of 86  responses (81.9 percent) was received. Results indicate that a majority of the graduates are working full-time in positions directly related to their area of study; the graduates have found the curriculum presented by the college appropriate to their work responsibilities, and are satisfied and impressed with the quality of instruction at Maple Woods Community College; employers were satisfied and impressed with the graduates in terms of their skills, general preparation, and attitude toward work.

Services which have been requested have fallen into five basic categories: individual personal counseling, group counseling, family counseling, professional development for educators, and seminars and workshops designed for small business management personnel. The professional staff for HRDC has been carefully selected to assure expertise in each type of counseling. Staff counselors and psychologists, all of whom hold either doctoral or masters degrees, have previous work experience in mental health research centers, state hospitals, colleges and private practice. Consultants in the  fields of psychiatry, finance, and management have been obtained by the center for dealing with specialized problems. The center is operated on a break-even basis. The fees paid by clients ($13 per hour) are used to reimburse the professional staff. Administrative costs are defrayed through grants and college district funds. Since the beginning of fall semester, 1974, 918 clients have been counseled in approximately 10,000 counseling hours, in addition to the hours devoted to seminars and workshops. (NHM)",

The total approach presented here would have the entire Los Angeles Community College District as its service community, and would provide programs too costly or impractical for the 10 individual campuses through a college-without-walls. This report is organized along the lines of the research, discussions, and reflections of a 12-member planning Commission organized in April 1975, and is divided into eight chapters. Chapter I discusses the formation, assignment, and organization of the Commission. Chapter II discusses  the need for new planning and organizational strategies. Chapter III describes current district-wide programs and services, including the overseas program, programs for individuals, cooperative and community programs, and student and media services. Chapter IV presents three possible organizational models, along with a recommended model for which personnel and financing are discussed. Chapters V and VI deal with innovations in programs and services. The concluding two chapters deal with needs assessment, detailed planning, and implementation. (NHM)",

Issues selected include: appointment, promotion, tenure, merit (salary increments), and curriculum. For the purpose of this study, the decision-making process was sequenced into six stages: initiation, consultation, recommendation, review, choice, and veto. At least 10 faculty and 10 administrators from each institution were interviewed and asked to describe their participation in the six stages of the decision-making process in regard to the five issues under investigation, and to relate their observations of the involvement of other personnel.  Respondents based their evaluations on a five point continuum: administrative dominance, administrative primacy, shared authority, faculty primacy, and faculty dominance. The community colleges in the sample generally were characterized by adminstrative dominance or administrative primacy, although there was evidence of increasing consultation with the faculty. On the other hand, the state colleges were likely to be characterized by shared authority or faculty primacy. Faculty involvement was high on the curriculum issue for both types of institutions, followed by promotion, and low on merit. (Author/NHM)",

Each trainee was enrolled in McLennan Community College and received either four or five semester hours of credit for the four weeks of experience and training. Trainees worked directly with the Camp Director and Resident Coordinator and were responsible for a particular  instructional activity (swimming, canoeing, horseback riding, archery, riflery, and nature study). The Camp Director and Coordinator worked together in orienting the trainees in the organization and operation of the camp. Instruction was given in child growth and development, with emphasis on social development principles, behavior modification, recreation skills and crafts for individuals and groups, and total communication skills including finger spelling, signs, body language, and vocabulary.

Goals of the Exploratory College include: (1) the creation of a center for exploring new ways of learning; (2) the creation of a relaxed learning setting with flexible scheduling; (3) the provision of guidance in the determination of personal and  professional goals; (4) an increase in the self-awareness of students and faculty; (5) the perception of the interrelatedness of various academic disciplines; (6) involvement in the community as an integral part of the learning environment; (7) the provision of standard college credit within a non-threatening grading system; (8) the development of personal values and attitudes through exposure to the values and attitudes of different cultures.

Data were collected by examining four-year college catalogues, correlating this information with course descriptions in the Virginia Community College Curriculum Guidelines (VCCCG), and surveying mathematics department chairpersons to validate the correlations. Of the 66 different mathematics sequences described in the VCCCG, 16 have potential counterparts at the senior colleges. The remainder are either remedial or especially designed for technical or vocational programs. Of the 16 equivalent courses, six are taught by almost all the Virginia community colleges. Although it appears that the mathematics courses  listed in the VCCCG are well designed to meet the needs of Virginia's two-year college transfer students, one possible exception is the absence of a course specifically designed to provide a mathematics background for the elementary school teacher. Summaries of the general comments offered by the four-year college mathematics chairpersons concerning curriculum articulation are included, information is organized into five tables, and lists of textbooks used at the community and four-year colleges are appended.

        "description":"This study examines the effects of initial response training and criterion training on the discrimination shift performance of preschool children; results are discussed in terms of differing theoretical orientation. After an initial task involving either criterion training or response training, 109 subjects were presented with either intradimensional shift (ID) or extradimensional shift (ED) problems. Subjects who failed to learn the criterion training task (nonlearners) were found to learn the ED shift more quickly than the ID shift. These results are best explained in terms of mediation theory, since an explanation based on the single stage process would require that preferences or dimensional dominance increased the initial habit strength for the irrelevant cue or dimension.  Attention theory could also explain these results, because attention to relevant and irrelevant dimensions determines the ease of shift learning. The response-trained group, after 10 trials of reinforced motor training, learned a reversal (ID) shift more rapidly than the ED shift. This finding can be explained in terms of attention theory, because alteration of orienting probabilities would result in shift performance demonstrated by children who went through all the work of attaining criterion. Since such results are not well explained by mediation theory, the attentional model of children's learning is supported. (GO)",

        "description":"This paper focuses on a study which replicates and extends earlier work employing a recognition memory paradigm to investigate children's memory and developmental changes in dominant word associations. On the recognition test the implicit associative response can lead to better memory for the original items (this is the hit rate), and it can also lead to errors on associates which are new items (this is the false-alarm rate). The paradigm predicts that children given instructions would make fewer errors on old items (higher hit rate) yet more errors on associates (higher false alarm rate). Children from second and sixth grades were presented lists of words orally and asked to state the meaning of each word and generate its associative antonym or synonym. Results indicate a number  of methodological problems with a recognition memory paradigm where the false alarm rate is employed as an index of developmental change and suggests that the synonym-antonym developmental shift in memory organization should be treated with caution.

In the first study, six experimental paragraphs were read individually to a total of 60 children in grades K-5. Each child was then asked four verbatim recall questions (specific adjectives and prepositions) and four inferential questions. The results indicated that the amount of both explicit and implicit information comprehended from the paragraphs increased with age. Due to a question about the saliency of adjectives and prepositions in sentences, the second study used verbatim recall questions with nouns and verbs. A total of 48 children in grades K, 2, and 4 participated in this study and were administered the  same tasks as in the first study plus a delayed free recall task. The results showed specifically that the ability to draw and remember inferences improved with age. The third study used a cued recall paradigm to determine whether the spontaneity of inference drawing was related to age. A total of 48 children in grades 1, 3, and 5 heard action sentences with the instruments used stated explicitly in half of the sentences and only implied in the other half. They were then given a cued recall test which included the appropriate instrument nouns. Results suggested that children apply inferential operations more often and more effectively with increasing age. (JMB)",

Five examples of fear are given: (1) learned fear, in which the infant associates some unpleasant action with an agent, (2) unlearned fear, in which the infant experiences an intense sensory phenomena such as a loud noise, (3) stranger anxiety, (4) fear caused by a violation of the infant's expectancy, and (5) the child's fear of the loss of its mother. No specific behaviors have been found which are characteristic only of fear. Patterns of infant behavior can be interpreted as fear within the situational context in which the behavior occurs. Problems in the measurement of fear behavior, such as individual variability, the interpretation of stimulus meaning to infants, and the effect of prior  experience are discussed. It is theorized that an infant's affective response is the result of a complex process involving the organism's status, cognition plans, and strategies, as well as the stimulus properties and the context of the situation.

The special advantages of family day care over group care are indicated, and it is noted that family day care has a personalized quality not found in group care. The day  care home appears to benefit infants and toddlers particularly because less adjustment is required of the child and because there is opportunity for a more individualized continuous relationship between caregiver, parent, and child. The present criticism of family day care appears to be related to the quality of personnel rather than to the actual model involved. (GO)",

During the first experiment, the Stephens-Delys Reinforcement Contingency Interview (SDRCI) was developed to assess internal locus of control development in preschoolers. When used with 24 4-year-olds in a Head Start program, the measure was found to have rater and retest reliability; the race of the interviewer did not significantly affect scores. The second experiment indicated that the performance of 32 preschool boys on a mirror-tracing task was positively related to internal locus of  control as measured by the SDRCI. In the third study, investigators tested 55 Head Start preschoolers and 50 middle-class nursery school children with the SDRCI. Lower internal control scores were found for the Head Start children than for the middle-class nursery school group; no differences were found between black and white Head Start groups. A final study of 114 children found a nonsignificant tendency for Montessori preschool experience (and to a lesser extent, parent cooperative nursery school experience) to increase internal control, as measured by the SDRCI, more than Head Start or a more structured compensatory preschool program.

Results showed that mothers maintained a strong positive attitude towards day care programs, services, and personnel. Educational benefits, supervisory services, and other child-centered factors were the primary reasons that the women perceived day care positively. The availability of group day care appeared to support  their initial decision to work. Most women decided to go to work for financial reasons, although the jobs they secured were usually low status ones with low wages. Success in employment was found to be positively related to amount of education, working experience, and a favorable job market.

Experimental versions of advertisements were inserted into a cartoon program which was shown to the children. There were nine areas of experimental manipulations: (1) premium offer strategy (a toy offered with a breakfast food), (2) exaggerated product performance claims, (3) program characters appearing in commercials, (4) racial characteristics of the performers  in the commercials, (5) rational message strategy, (6) learning about littering from public service announcements, (7) consequences of the advertising of medicine, (8) product accessory disclaimer (i.e., batteries not included), and (9) clustered versus dispersed structure of commercial presentation. A hidden camera measured the children's eye contact and reactions while they watched the program. The children were personally interviewed or placed in a play situation after viewing the stimulus tape. The findings for each of the nine experimental manipulations are presented, and the responses to the commercials by age and race are discussed. (JMB)",

A total of 400 elementary school students of varying socioeconomic status participated in the study, with 50 second-third graders and 50 fourth-fifth graders in each experimental condition. The children viewed stimulus tapes containing children's news, entertainment, and advertising content and then circled answers on a questionnaire read by an experimental assistant. The content of the commercials was manipulated across conditions, with subjects seeing different video or audio versions of an ad (some subjects were exposed to a particular  commercial and others not exposed). The questionnaire measured several cognitive, affective, and behavioral intention variables for each of nine experimental advertising manipulations. The maniuplations were; (1) occupational sex role socialization, (2) recreational sex role socialization, (3) adolescent hygiene socialization, (4) learning about health from public service announcements, (5) learning appropriate medicine usage, (6) hero-figure endorsements, (7) sex of announcer's voice, (8) comparative message strategy, and (9) message repetition.

A total of 153 children in grades K-6 were interviewed about the entertainment, informational, and advertising content of 24 programs popular with children. The language maturity of the children was assessed using a word association paradigm to measure the complexity of their recognition of the relationships among words in the language. Respondents were divided into four age groups, and partial correlations were computed between television viewing and language maturity, controlling for intelligence, number of older siblings, and socioeconomic status. Averaging across the  four age groups indicated a slight negative partial correlation between viewing and each language variable, suggesting that television exposure generally inhibited language development. Slopes were graphed to determine how television viewing affected the rate of development across each point in time compared to the previous norms. This analysis provides further evidence of the retarding effect of television viewing, especially in the 8- to 11-year-old range. (JMB)",

Data were collected by means of a questionnaire (mailed) which presented 29 attitude statements to be rated along an agree-disagree scale. The analysis of these data revealed that the Action for Children's Television (ACT) sample generally took a position on one side of the issue, the advertiser and agency samples took a position on the opposite side, with the government sample tending to fall in between. The areas in which the consumer and industry  groups were far apart on the attitude rating scale included: (1) the need for regulation, (2) locus of regulation, (3) effects of commercials, (4) evaluations of advertisers and advertising, (5) products allowed on television, and (6) proposals for the future. The advertisers, agency personnel, and government officials tended to be highly accurate in estimating the ACT group's positions on key issues, but estimates of the advertising agency positions were somewhat more extreme than their actual attitudes.

A recording was made of the verbal and nonverbal interactions in 20 mother-child dyads during a one-hour session in the home. The linguistic level for each of the children, who ranged from 1.9 to 5.0 years in age, was computed from the average length of utterance, and the stream of verbal actions was divided into verbal episodes. These episodes, comprising one or several utterances of each interaction partner which are temporally contiguous, meaningfully related, and form a structural whole, formed the basic unit of analysis. Results indicate that mothers actively teach all aspects of language and that the interactional structures employed in  the course of this teaching encompass feedback cycles and calibration processes. The mother-child dyad is described as a self-regulating and relatively closed system and it is suggested that the amount, the type, and the timing of the observed teaching/learning processes suffice to explain the phenomena and products of first language acquisition.

A total of 80 children between 3 and 5 years of age were tested individually on four spatial tasks and five conceptual tasks and rated on the levels of egocentrism employed. Analysis of the data suggests that elementary role-taking problems are most profitably understood in terms of the component skills required to solve them, and that these components have a step-like interlocking nature which suggests a stable path for advancement in the acquisition of role-taking. The decline of egocentrism appears to depend on the presence of functional relationships in the task which do not exceed the capacities of the  child. It is suggested that role-taking episodes do not demand overall decentration but that various types of skills are tapped by various role-taking tasks. (GO)",

Approximately 220 children in eight kindergarten classes were involved each year. The average entering subject was a middle class child 5.5 years old, who had one sibling and had attended nursery school for one year. Each child was evaluated on a basic diagnostic measure, the Kindergarten Inventory of Development  (a combination of the Boehm Test of Basic Concepts and the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities), which identified 20 percent of the children as high risk. Half of the high risk group received an at-home parent-directed program in addition to the personalized school program recieved by all children. All high risk children showed good progress, with the group receiving supplementary at-home enrichment achieving highest maintained gains. Data analysis showed the percentages of entering kindergarteners who lagged in one or more areas of development.

        "description":"This paper deals with one view of cognitive social learning and its applications to the psychological analysis of moral competence and moral conduct. The concept of cognitive and behavioral construction competencies is explained and cognitive competencies are said to be among the very best predictors of &quot;honesty&quot; in conduct. Moral competence includes the ability to reason about moral dilemmas, the skill of role-taking, and the kind of empathy required to take account of long-term consequences of actions as they affect other people. Although an individual may be capable of moral conduct, his decision on whether to act morally at any given time depends on his behavior-outcome expectancies. The young child's behavior is governed primarily by expected immediate, concrete consequences  for himself, but as he matures the evaluation and reinforcement of his behavior become increasingly independent of external rewards and punishments and include more temporally distant and abstract considerations and self-reactions. It is thus concluded that age-related changes in the style and content of moral reasoning and conduct reflect changes in the individual's cognitive and verbal capacities in interaction with the social learning variables salient for him at different points in the life cycle.

Sixty subjects, 3 to 5 years of age, were given a choice between two rewards and then placed in a delay of gratification situation. Half of the subjects were left in the waiting situation with the real reward present, and the other half had a realistic picture of the reward in front of them. Subjects were either instructed to pretend that the real or pictured reward was real, to pretend that the real or pictured reward was pictured, or the subject was not given any additional instructions. Results showed that having the actual reward object in front of the subject presented as  real led to low delay of gratification and pictures of the reward, presented as pictures, facilitated delay. However, these effects were reversed by instructing the child to construe the actual object as pictured, and the pictured object as real. (BRT)",

The studies included satisfy three criteria: (1) role-taking and communication efficiency are measured independently; (2) tasks used to measure the two skills are significantly different in content and type of response required; and (3) abilities are related with chronological age held constant, either by examining the relation between skills within age groups, or by partialling out chronological age. Three studies show consistent, significant positive relationships between communication performance and role-taking, four studies have mixed results (showing some significant results and some nonsignificant results), and two  studies show consistent, nonsignificant relationships between the two abilities. Conflicting results are attributed to (1) some third variable (e.g., intelligence) with which role-taking and communication are related independently, (2) statistical factors such as reliability of the tasks, (3) differing methods of measuring the two abilities, and (4) other variables besides role-taking ability which may determine communication skill. Language development, spatial role-taking skills, perspective-taking, and patterns of children's errors during tasks in these areas are discussed as they apply to the relationship between role-taking and communication.

Discussion includes the impact of legislation and the question of responsibility for delivery of services. Five areas of concern in child care policy are investigated: money (source and flow), eligibility, administration, control,  and program quality.

A total of six first grade teachers in two schools were given the Open Program Structure Index (OPSI) and, based on their scores, were rated along a continuum from restrictive to accommodating. Ten students, randomly selected from each teacher's class, were observed while they engaged in each of three types of tasks: (1) closed (workcards), (2) relatively closed (books and table games), and (3) open (creative activity). Their interest in each of these tasks was rated as high, medium, or low, based on the Interest Rating Scale which measures persistence in activity, ease of  distractibility, and whether contact with others is work related. The findings revealed a significant negative correlation between the teacher's OPSI scores and the students' interest ratings across all four tasks. This correlation suggests that students of restrictive teachers display higher levels of interest in common classroom activities than students of accommodating teachers.

        "description":"This study examines the degree to which young children are influenced by the familiarity of an adult participant in their pretend play with toys which vary in resemblance to highly prototypical objects (e.g., cup-like cups or doll-like dolls). A group of 29 children, mean age 21 months, was divided into two experimental groups balanced by sex; 15 children were assigned to an unfamiliar adult experimenter, and 14 to a familiar one. Each child was observed in two 12-minute play episodes in which pretend play suggestions were made by the experimenter. Results suggest that: (1) pretending with highly prototypical objects is enhanced by thematic proposals of a familiar adult, whereas pretending with less prototypical objects is reduced by these proposals; (2) suggestions from an  unfamiliar adult produce a low level of pretending regardless of toy type; (3) children's difficulty in transforming less prototypical objects to suit proposed themes is cognitive rather than motivational; and (4) in the situations studied, girls are more sensitive than boys to the characteristics of people, and boys are more sensitive than girls to the characteristics of materials.

        "description":"This study examined the impact of culture, language, and familiarity with materials on the ability to solve traditional conservation problems. A total of 80 Tzeltal speaking children from two traditional Mexican Indian (Mayan) villages participated in the study: 5 boys and 5 girls drawn from each of four age group (6-7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13). The men in both villages are agriculturalists; the women in one village are potters and in the other village they embroider blouses. Conservation of continuous quantity was examined using beans, clay, and water. Conservation of weight was studied using clay. Each child completed all tasks. Analysis of the data suggests that the ability to make conservation judgments improves with age among Mayan children as it does elsewhere in the world, but  that performance lags behind U.S. norms by about 3 years. Language and culture differences which may explain this apparent performance lag are described. It was concluded that the conservation paradigm may not be a &quot;culture free&quot; test of cognitive competence. (ED)",

        "description":"Evidence which suggests that pretend activities become increasingly independent of the presence of realistic objects is examined in this paper. Results of research on pretend behavior in children 1 1/2 - 2 years of age are described and analyzed. Striking changes in pretend behavior are shown to occur during the second year of life. Pretend play is treated as a paradigm for understanding how children represent objects and relations. It is argued that the child can pretend that one thing is another when he can represent objects (or object activities) as prototypes and when he can use the core properties of prototypes to transform representations of immediate physical stimulation. The analysis suggests a three-phase sequence in the development of pretending based on a progression  from the analogue mapping of representations to the selection and, eventually, the production of the core properties of object representations.

        "description":"This study examined the extent to which situational context differentially influences components of play. Two groups of play variables were distinguished: (1) style variables, (reflecting the overall tempo and diversity of play) and viewed as relatively sensitive indicators of short term reactions of situations; and (2) structural variables, viewed as relatively sensitive indicators of more enduring aspects of cognitive development. Children were observed either in the presence of relatively familiar of unfamiliar adults in a structured play situation in the home at 18 and 24 months, and in a more naturalistic home observation at 22 and 23 months. Multivariate analyses were used to examine the sensitivity of measures of style and structure to situations and age. Style variables  revealed short term situational effects; however, both types of variables revealed changes with age and differences between situations which were sustained over time. Results suggest that the manipulation of context factors and multivariate procedures might provide a useful way of analyzing components of play as a complex system of behavior. (Author/ED)",

          "Salapatek, Philip"],
        "description":"This study investigated the way 12 infants, aged 1 month and 2 months, scanned the still and expressionless faces of their mothers, of strange women, and of strange men. Each infant was placed in a padded head-restraining cradle under a half-silvered mirror which was angled at 45 degrees to enable the child to view an adult's face at an optical distance of 48 cm. Infant eye fixation was recorded on videotape by corneal photography and replays were used to score the fixations of duration greater than 2 seconds on eight facial features: hairline, chin, right eye, left eye, nose, mouth, right ear and left ear. Data indicated that at 1 month of age infants fixated away from faces most of the time, looked at their mothers' faces even less often than at the strangers' faces, and looked  at a limited portion of the facial perimeter. In contrast, 2-month-olds fixated the faces most of the time, looked at more facial features, and were more likely to look at internal features--especially the eyes. These results suggest that infants as young as 1 month old can discriminate their mothers' faces from strangers' faces, a discrimination which is probably based on differences in hairline and chin. Possible bias in results across the two age levels may be due to the use of motionless expressionless faces, which have been avoided by 1-month-old infants in other studies: results are compared to those obtained for infant scanning of inanimate two-dimensional shapes.

        "description":"This study provided a review of literature related to peer tutoring and investigated the effects of three variables on peer tutor and peer tutee performance. The variables were (1) the achievement level of the tutor, (2) brief tutor training in reinforcement and corrective feedback procedures, and (3) tutor expectancy about tutee performance. A total of 112 high and low achieving second graders in a Follow Through program were selected as tutors. Half of these tutors were randomly selected to receive two half-hour training sessions. The training was conducted in a small group setting and emphasized two reinforcement and feedback procedures: (1) responding to a correct answer with a positive comment, and (2) responding to an incorrect answer or no answer by providing the correct  answer and giving the tutee a chance to say the correct answer. A group of 112 first graders was randomly selected to serve as tutees. Instructions to tutors prior to the tutoring session contained either high or low expectancies about the tutees' academic performance. Both tutors and tutees were pre- and posttested on 30 sight word flash cards, with which the children worked during the tutoring session. Results showed that both tutors and tutees learned a significant number of words. Tutors' achievement level was not a significant factor, as measured by words learned, but tutees tutored by trained tutors performed better than tutees tutored by untrained tutors. Tutor expectancies did not affect tutee performance on the posttest. (Author/BRT)",

A total of 50 children, aged 3.0 to 4.7 years, were divided into three groups according to age with a large number clustered around age 4.0 years. Children were randomly assigned to one of two order effects. In the first effect, called the MORE condition, the child was presented with unequal rows of M&amp;Ms and asked &quot;Which row is (has) more, or are they both the same?&quot; Following the child's response, the M&amp;M's were equalized, then rearranged into unequal rows. The child was told &quot;Take the row you want to eat, and eat all the M&amp;Ms in that row.&quot; In the second effect, called the EAT condition, the same two instructions were given  in the reverse order. Results indicate that children's comprehension of the &quot;more&quot; question increases with age; however, the children demonstrated better comprehension of numerosity when told to &quot;eat&quot; a row than when asked which row had &quot;more.&quot; In addition, the children clustered at age 4 appeared to be transitional in verbal concept development regarding semantic contexts (the prior instruction &quot;eat&quot; cued them regarding the meaning of &quot;more&quot;). It is suggested that the results reflect on the young child's verbal concept development regarding number. (ED)",

        "description":"The two studies reported, on teacher reinforcement of and teacher attitudes toward children's sex-preferred behaviors attempted to clarify some issues concerning the differential treatment of boys and girls at the preschool level. The first study looked at teacher reinforcement of sex-preferred behaviors in children aged 3 to 5 years as a function of the experience of the teacher. Six children of each sex in each of four independent play groups were observed with their teachers; a coded observation schedule was used to compare the patterns of teacher reinforcement for sex-preferred behaviors and the amounts of teacher response for boys and girls and for experienced and inexperienced teachers. Results indicated that all teachers responded in equal amounts to boys and girls and  reinforce feminine preferred behaviors not only in girls but also in boys. The second study compared sex stereotyping and educational attitudes of college students of both sexes who were either experienced or inexperienced in dealing with young children. Subjects were asked to rate 31 child behaviors either on sex appropriateness or on importance for future academic performance. Results showed that 12 behaviors were considered sex stereotyped, six male and six female, and that inexperienced persons rated behaviors as stereotyped significantly more frequently than experienced persons. The two studies indicated teacher experience rather than sex of teacher to be a determinant of teacher classroom behavior and brought into question the differential effects on boys and girls of being  reinforced for behaviors which are preferred by girls and nonpreferred by boys.

A group of 10-month-old infants were pretested for level of object permanence and person permanence, and 18 males and 18 females were chosen as study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) stranger near, (2) stranger far, or (3) stranger absent. In each treatment group, there were three 5-minute trials with the mother near, far, and absent. Observations of the infant (proximity to mother and stranger, fussing, crying, and playing with a novel toy) were made by the experimenter, who was concealed behind a wooden partition set up in the infant's living room. The results indicated that stranger distance from the infants was  unrelated to their behavior but that both mother distance and trial number had significant effects. As mother-infant distance increased, babies fussed sooner and longer, and played less with the novel toys. As the trial number increased, the infants crawled to their mothers earlier in the trial, fussed sooner, and played less with the novel toy. These findings were interpreted as supporting Bowlby's contention that attachment behavior is related to the degree of maternal accessibility. (JMB)",

Brief descriptions of the program's background purpose and components, and of the children served are included in the report. Evaluation of the instructional component was based on a pre-posttest design (without a control group) which measured language development in English and Spanish, school readiness, and self-concept and personality development. The community-parental  involvement component was subjectively evaluated using observations, records, and self-reports by the staff. Major findings include: (1) students made significant gains in language development in English and Spanish and in general school readiness; (2) students developed and/or maintained a positive self-concept and substantially developed in various dimensions of personality growth; (3) children and parents were involved in a variety of activities through home visits; and (4) parents maintained a positive attitude toward the program.

A student interview questionnaire, the Self-Responsibility Interview Schedule, was constructed to assess children's knowledge about what they do in school, and whether they perceive that they, rather than the teacher, are responsible for managing their own learning. A total of 134 second graders enrolled in individualized instruction programs at two schools were divided into three experimental groups: (1) a class which adopted the Self-Schedule System; (2) three classes (from the same school) serving as one comparison  group; and (3) classes (from a second school) serving as another comparison group. The majority of children in groups 1 and 2 came from low-income black families; children in group 3 came from suburban lower middle class white families. Measures of self-responsibility for school learning, student perception of intellectual achievement responsibility, and student task performance were used in the investigation. Results indicate that the Self-Schedule System significantly affected children's perception of self-responsibility for their school learning as well as their rate of task completion. (Author/ED)",

        "description":"The purpose of this longitudinal study was to describe kindergarten children's abilities, evaluate the effect of teacher expectations on kindergarten performance, and explore the predictive validity of kindergarten performance for later reading ability. An original sample of approximately 450 kindergarten children was tested with a school readiness measure. By the time the children were tested on reading ability at the end of third grade, 122 children remained in the sample. For entering kindergarteners, performance on school readiness test tasks was significantly related to socioeconomic status, age (older children performed better), and sex (girls performed better). Attending preschool and watching &quot;Sesame Street&quot; were also found to be slightly related to readiness task  ability. Kindergarten children in 1971 performed better on most school-related tasks, except those involving perceptual-motor skills, than did kindergarten children in 1968. Teacher judgments of the subjects' abilities at the end of the kindergarten year were better predictors of the subjects' reading success in first, second, and third grades than school readiness test scores. Past reading ability was found to be the best predictor of future reading ability. Through the primary grades, girls continued to perform better than boys in the measured abilities. Data showed that children who stayed in the same school from kindergarten through third grade read better than the class as a whole, when all other factors were held constant. (BRT)",

A hierarchy of the kinds of regulation is defined: (1) basic preventive/protective requirements (related to zoning, fire and safety, sanitation, and basic day care licensing); (2) administrative standards for publicly operated programs (equal to or better than basic private day care licensing requirements); (3) funding standards or fiscal regulation of publicly financed programs; (4) qualifications of the staff regulated by credentialing; and (5) standards of quality for model programs (accreditation). Some of the problems involved in establishing and administering these kinds of regulations are discussed. Consultation, technical assistance, education of the public, community  organization, staff development, evaluation, and information centers are identified as nonregulatory ways of pursuing quality child care. (Consultation and information services are briefly discussed.) Some of the special problems involved in licensing family day care homes are explored, and a workshop sheet of questions pertinent to quality child care is provided. (ED)",

The evaluation consisted of pretesting all the children on gross motor skills during the first week of school and posttesting them with the same skills inventory after 16 weeks in the program. The results indicated that the children as a group were able to achieve a higher level of skill in the areas tested after participating in the program for 16 weeks.

The findings do not indicate a current or impending overall shortage of early childhood services or that low-income families suffer inequities in the costs or distribution of care. Further, no evidence was found of long-term child benefits that would justify a large, immediate increase in federal expenditures for custodial or educational services for preschool children. Five policy conclusions are drawn: (1) proposals for increased federal support of day care do not reflect any clear and present national need; (2) adjustments should be made in the present system which would provide the same profile of  incentives for families at all income levels, respond to individual choices in the style and setting of day care services, and reflect realistic assessment of the value of currently demonstrated child benefits from preschool experiences; (3) studies of the mechanics of day care choices should be undertaken; (4) heavy emphasis on the development of new early childhood education models should be discontinued; and (5) research funds should be redirected to encourage the replication of successful early childhood education models in secondary sites.

Analysis of data revealed: (1) In both years, the great majority of all farm people resided in the same household as the farm operator; (2) About 1/10 of the farm population lived in rent-free dwelling units on farms; (3) Negroes and other racial minorities on farms were disproportionately of nonoperator status; (4) Most farm people lived on farms operated by an owner rather than a tenant or manager; (5) Despite an overall farm population decline of 15 percent during 1966-70, there was population growth on farms with annual sales of $20,000 or more; (6) Due to population loss among Negro farm residents, farm population decline was most rapid in the South.

There were 365 children enrolled during the regular term and 1,601 during the summer. Children were recruited through: visits by school personnel to the migrant camps, information supplied by other project participants, and the Migrant Student Record Transfer System. Teacher and parent referrals and teacher-made and standardized tests were the most frequently used to determine the children's needs. Subjects taught most often were reading and oral language development during the regular term and reading and mathematics during the summer. Individualized and small group instruction, tutorial assistance, drill, and field trips were used to implement the  various activities. Teacher-made tests and observation were most frequently used to assess the students' performance. During the year, medical and dental services were expanded and parental involvement was increased. This report provides: (1) a summary of data and recommendations; (2) descriptions of the migrant summer programs at Princeville, Hoopeston, and Part Forest; (3) an interview with the project director regarding his program assessment and future plans; and (4) a description of program implementation, based on information submitted by the local projects on the FY 74 Self Assessment Questionnaire.

In order to meet the unique academic needs of these children, 5 main goals have been established: (1) extend funds to insure the success of program projects; (2) provide technical assistance to program personnel in the development, implementation,  operation, and evaluation of migrant programs; (3) continue to identify impacted areas of migrant populations; (4) develop models for intercommunication between the permanent and migrant communities; and (5) encourage coordination of intrastate programs and cooperation of interstate programs and projects in order to provide continuity of educational experiences. This booklet provides guidelines to aid State Office of Education employees and local school personnel in developing effective migrant programs which comply with national and state policy. Topics are: eligibility; national, State, and local policy; State and local operations; the Migrant Student Record Transfer System; and program design. (Author/NQ)",

These priorities were met through the implementation of approximately 60 projects, administered indirectly through 29 local education agencies. During the year, 9,685 migrant children were served. Emphasis of regular school term projects was to supplement and strengthen existing instructional programs offered through State, local and other Federal funding sources. Summer programs focused more directly on the interstate migrants' needs and  provided a full range of instructional and supportive services. All projects used some type of achievement measurement to document attainment of major project objectives. Overall, test results reflect the program emphasis. After reading and processing all available information from project evaluations, test data, and monitoring reports, this 1975 evaluation report was prepared. All available information indicated that the North Carolina Migrant Education Program was adequately meeting the legislative requirements and the national program objectives. (NQ)",

BIA data indicated that for 1973 about 13,600 Indian students had received BIA grants and 64 colleges and universities had enrolled 25 or more Indian students with BIA grants. Findings indicated that the OE and BIA philosophies of awarding financial aid to Indians  conflicted, for the BIA's operation manual stipulated that scholarship funds should be supplemental, while OE regulations did not require aid officers to disregard available BIA scholarships when determining student financial needs. Other actions which reduced OE assistance were: (1) BIA educational specialists who disregarded the supplementary philosophy; (2) late applications from Indian students; (3) the use of BIA grant funds to supplant loans and work-study funds. It was recommended that the BIA make its policy well known and take action to see that Indian students make applications on time. (JC)",

The results of this survey were compared with a similar 1971 survey (1,171 and 399 responses from the experimental and control areas respectively). Variables examined were: (1) Income (earnings and additional income of household heads and income of other household members); (2) Social Characteristics (% female-headed households, years of education, family size, status of current job, and age); (3) Group and Type of Income (female and male-headed households, farm  and nonfarm households, household heads 65 years or older and those under 65 years); and (4) Social and Income Characteristics by Length of Residence. Findings indicated that development: (1) did not have a dramatic effect on level of income; (2) increased equality of income; (3) substantially and adversely affected the elderly; (4) adversely affect the average earnings of female household heads but positively affected female household heads but positively affected female income per dependent; (5) did not create a greater rate of in-migration (immigration appeared to increase median earnings and decrease income equality, as immigrants were of a higher socioeconomic strata).

        "description":"The end of the bracero program after 1965 brought about a major change in the growing, harvesting, and processing of California tomatoes which dramatically influenced the structure of the harvesting labor force. In order to determine the social consequences of the transition from man to mechanized harvesting procedures, the following areas of interest were examined: (1) the significance of the tomato; (2) tomatoes from seed to can; (3) the history of agricultural labor in California (a review; (4) the shift to the machine (the actors and the circumstances; post machine problems; and the role of the California Tomato Growers Association); (5) the technological development and job organization of mechanized harvesting (jobs and skills and working conditions); (6) the harvest labor  force (identity; recruitment; supervision; and crew types); (7) the social effects of the transition to mechanized harvesting. The social consequences identified were: (1) concentration of tomato production in the State of California; (2) concentration in the number of growers and increased specialization; (3) a geographical shift in California production; (4) the development of price bargaining for tomato growers; (5) sharp changes in the structure of the harvest labor force; (6) introduction of a system of factory-like production while maintaining primitive employment relationships.

Objectives of the summer program were: (1) career exploration; (2) cultural enrichment (i.e., art, history, heritage, and music); and (3) swimming and water safety. The daily programs concentrated on these 3 objectives. Several field trips were planned to reinforce the career training objectives. Representatives from the 4 tribes on the Colorado River Indian Reservation served as consultants during the program to teach Reservation history, ceramics, jewelry making, and American Indian culture. Children had the opportunity to  participate in controlled athletics every day and to visit the public library once a week. The 173 children were divided by age rather than by grade. Classes lasted until noon. A breakfast snack and lunch were served. An attitudinal test was administered to the older children as a pretest for self-awareness and as a posttest to gauge the change in attitude. The Monroe Oral Language test was given as a pre- and posttest to all classes. The summer program was very successful. (NQ)",

The control variables included: age, income, education, and organizational participation. Findings indicated: (1) perceived susceptibility was not related to  either eating habits or physical activity; (2) perceived difficulty of the preventive behavior was positively correlated with both dependent variables; (3) knowledge of calories was positively related to getting regular exercise; (4) education was positively correlated with preventive eating habits.

Tested was the relationship between cognitive learning and: (1) field independence, (2) abilities to perceive and compare attributes, (3) category width, (4) level of abstraction, (5) memory, and (6) general intelligence. Results suggested some support for the proposed model and identified some areas of cultural differences. For Euro-American children,  field independence was correlated with the ability to perceive attributes and both were related to the ability to verbalize concepts. For the Stoney children, more than one ability or set of abilities was involved in concept learning. Memory played a greater role in problem solving for Stoney Indian subjects, and they did better on the first two Stone Games and relatively better on the tests of field independence and memory, while Euro-American performance was more markedly superior on the remaining measures.

Initiated in 1972, the project was designed to improve the quality of life of rural youth from low income families via community clubs for youth between the ages of 9 and 16. In order to measure the attitude changes (aspirations and expectations) of club members, a questionnaire was designed which included items relative to: (1) education, (2) residence, (3) occupation, (4) marriage and family, (5) community, (6) self-image, (7) self-concept, (8) concept of chance for success. Useable data were obtained from black and white, male and female, youth in attendance at club meetings (n=509) and summer camps (n=559). The research effort failed to measure any pattern of statistically significant changes in  the attitudes of program participants. It was suggested that possible reasons for failure to measure change might have been: (1) the sophistication of the questionnaire, (2) the lack of overlap in interviews, (3) the variations in time lapse between questionnaires, (4) the use of responses from youth who had not been in the program long. The evaluation team did make some &quot;impressionistic&quot; observations which indicated: (1) program variations had met the different needs of differing groups; (2) participants and their parents had accrued positive benefits from the program; (3) the program had been successful since members wished to continue club activities.

Useable data were obtained from 75 white and 75 black males and 50 white and 50 black females who had been contacted as 10th and 12th graders and again as young adults in 1972. Responses relative to occupational aspirations indicated no marked changes, though: (1) white male managerial and white female technical/professional aspirations had increased; (2) black male glamour aspirations had decreased and their service worker aspirations had increased; (3) black female service worker aspirations had decreased while their sales/Clerical aspirations had  increased. Responses relative to value changes and occupational choice indicated: (1) the chance to make money had decreased in importance while a somewhat more altruistic attitude had increased among all groups; (2) the chance to become an important person had decreased in importance for all groups except white females; (3) steady employment had increased in importance for all except white males. Responses relative to goal blockage indicated: (1) an increase in black male and female perceptions of race as a job deterrent, (2) a decrease among all group perceptions of lack of technical schools as a deterrent, (3) a decrease among all groups in geographic immobility perceptions.

Among the procedures, processes, problems, and conflicts described are: (1) selection of the education project director; (2) use of a community survey to determine community educational needs and preferences; (3) creation of a 4-member team of advisors to aid the chief and council in deciding on facility type and program direction; (4) securing an architect who could be made to respect Reserve authority rather than that of Indian Affairs; (5) recruitment of a suitable director; (6) a communication breakdown between  the school board, the chief, and the advisory team; (7) conflict between the Reserve and Indian Affairs over land, money, personnel, etc. (an &quot;approved&quot; budget went from $313,000 to $250,000); and (8) authority conflicts among all decision makers. Despite the numerous problems cited, this report indicates that the school did open sometime in 1975 but still needs: (1) an acceptable education agreement; (2) renewal of discussions between the chief, council, and school board; (3) negotiation of a realistic budget and fiscal control with Indian Affairs; and (4) on-going staff and curriculum development.

Although each local educational agency (LEA) approached the migrant child's educational problems differently, the individualized instruction concept was central in all programs. There were 229 migrant children served during the year. Standardized testing, Migrant Student Record Transfer System printouts, and teacher judgement determined the grade level instructional activities. Normal age-grade criteria was used for grade classification during the regular school term; during the summer, instructional grouping was established by  attainment level with the actual age range limited to a 3-year differentiation. Although summer programs were integrated with the regular Title I summer programs in the morning, afternoon sessions were for migrant children only and included such enrichment activities as art, swimming, field trips, and club activities. Coordination with other program concerned with the migrant's problems was maintained. Each LEA provided inservice training for their entire migrant program staff. Each LEA reported that the migrant educational program was successful. This report includes the Muscatine Community School evaluation report to show in more detail the LEA perspective in migrant education. (NQ)",

An interim evaluation of the program's progress during 1971-72 was conducted. Because of the project design and data collection timetable, many of the program's objectives could not be assessed at the time as to whether they were being met. When this was the case, it was indicated that data collection had not been completed. Preliminary findings were reported when the preliminary data yield information felt to be a useful indicator of program progress.  Instructional goals for children could not be assessed until post-testing was done. However, based on available records, all the process goals concerning the instructional program to be offered were being met. Training goals were being met although on a delayed schedule. Goals for materials development were either being met or were substantially completed, with the exception of the development of the cultural heritage materials which was behind schedule. Goals for carrying out a relocating program delivery system were met beyond the minimum standard set, and far beyond the level of comparable programs in offering continuity to moving families.

The program has three permanent sites--two year-round sites in Washington which serve both mobile migrants and seasonal farm workers' children, and a home base site in Grulla, Texas which serves only mobile migrant children. Teachers from Grulla site move into the migrant stream when the families move north. Each teacher continues to serve a small cluster of migrant children in a series of temporary field locations in Washington, Idaho, and Illinois. Thus, continuity of educational services is offered throughout the migration of this mobile population from Grulla.

By continuing to work with these children outside of regular school hours, the children receive the continuation of instruction in the Spanish and English  language program, the cultural knowledge lessons and activities, plus reinforcement of the instruction they receive in school in math and reading through continued work in the reading and math series begun as preschoolers. Covering the program's operations from July through December 1974, this report presents the third evaluation of the program's progress toward achieving the instititional, procedural, and educational outcome objectives. Overall, the objectives have either been met or partially met. Rationale for this program is briefly discussed. (NQ)",

        "description":"The Bilingual Mini-School Tutoring Project offers parents a major role in their children's education as decision makers responsible for hiring and other areas of program operations and as teachers providing bilingual, bicultural instruction. The program design has two components: the mobile and the non-mobile component. The non-mobile program has been in operation since February 1974 at Connell and Moses Lake, Washington while the mobile program has only been in operation since May 1974. Program objectives are of three types: institutional, procedural, and educational product objectives. Institutional objectives involve coordination with school administrators and enrollment of children. Procedural objectives involve the use of Spanish and English, dual language teaching skills,  and teaching bicultural lessons, math, and reading. The educational product objectives include gains in first and second language, mastery of cultural heritage lessons, and accelerated gains in math and reading. This fourth progress report covers program operations from July 1, 1974 through June 30, 1975. The narrative section of the report describes the functioning of the parent advisory groups, the logistics of the mobile program, and the way in which the program has managed to follow children to eight different communities in four different states. Overall, the objectives are being met or partially met. (NQ)",

The seven studies are presented via consideration of: (1) the characteristics of the student who has dropped out of school; (2)the characteristics of the student who has remained in school; (3) the differences between the students who have and those who have not dropped out of school; (4) the reasons certain dropouts have returned to school; and (5) the attitudes of students toward the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) boarding schools. In view of the studies under consideration, this report also examines: (1) the limited future orientation of the dropout; (2) the  negative self-concept of the dropout; (3) the effects of school-community-planning and coordination; and (4) the relationship between parents and the educational system. Among the major recommendations presented are: (1) re-examination of school curricula and counseling services; (2) development of village procedures to prepare prospective boarding school students for boarding school life; (3) development of a school oriented identification system which would report dropouts to the appropriate agencies; (4) development of a school oriented post dropout plan; and (5) development of a planning and coordinating system within the BIA offices.

The OB group underwent a series of individual and group wilderness problems involving cross-country back packing, rock climbing, white water rafting, and a three-day wilderness solo without food. The OB students were also given a dime and asked to &quot;make do&quot; in Atlanta, Georgia for several days. Learning by doing and group cooperation were emphasized. During the remaining 8 weeks of the semester, these students taught in a classroom. Pre- and post-assessments by OB students of their overall professional  education and their personal teaching readiness and performance were positive, as were their summarization statements. Evaluations by public school classes and college supervisors did not indicate significant differences among the groups, but pre- and post-inventories relative to the total contribution of professional education to teaching readiness showed marked changes in favor of OB, while the other groups' responses did not vary. Specifically, the OB group gained in: (1) teacher self-confidence; (2) student involvement (involving students); and (3) humanism (humanistic receptivity to others). (JC)",

In addition to base line school and community data, occupational, educational, and social data were obtained via questionnaire for both experimental and control groups (graduated seniors) in each model location. The participation of the target population in summer, in-school, and out-of-school model programs was evaluated in terms of the following criteria: (1) placement in a job; (2) placement in a higher education experience or an additional training opportunity; and (3) preparation for the transition from rural to urban  living. Although after the first year of operation, the Minnesota and Iowa projects attempted to bolster their vocational counseling and education programs for high school seniors and did manage to obtain a high rate of participation in one or more of the school year activities, the follow-up study indicated that either these services were not likely to have a significant impact on the post-high school behavior of these youths, or the impact was not sufficiently great to be measured in quantifiable terms. With a few exceptions, there was no statistically significant difference between the post-high school behavior of youths in the experimental and control groups. (JC)",

        "description":"The effectiveness of a leadership development program for rural lay leaders on promoting community improvement in Lawrence County, Alabama was evaluated. The sample consisted of 16 disadvantaged rural lay leaders who participated in the 2-month program and 24-month follow-up activities; 60 disadvantaged rural lay leaders who only participated in the follow-up activities; and 200 disadvantaged heads of households. Pre- and post-data were obtained relative to: (1) attitudes toward public school officials and school programs; (2) attitudes toward organizing local community development programs; (3) participation in local community development activities; (4) home ownership; (5) public assistance recipients; and (6) opinions on community quality. Eight null hypotheses tested via  community surveys, questionnaires, community attitude inventory, and community solidarity index scale revealed: (1) significant attitude changes among the 16 and the 60 lay leaders relative to public school officials and the school program; (2) a significant attitude change among the 200 heads of households relative to organizing a local community development program; (3) a significant change among the 200 heads of households relative to participation in local community development activities; (4) a significant change in the proportion of the 200 who owned their own home; (5) a significant difference between the mean community solidarity scores.

The student project provides a method for student involvement and inquiry-based learning. The five instructional objectives presented are based on the above-mentioned advantages. Under each objective are teaching strategies, specific instructional procedures, and some sample questions to raise. The  objectives, strategies, and procedures serve as the basis for process activities and outcomes that can be realized through all problem-solving projects. Three projects that can be utilized and adapted by secondary and college students in their study of communication on environmental issues are outlined. Two of the projects concern environmental impact; the third, environmental research. Each project is sub-divided into objectives, focus, suggested approaches, project design, and evaluation. Appendiced information pertaining to organizations of environmental concern, expanded problems for study, and a bibliography of materials is to be used in conjunction with the projects. (BP)",

Each trained classroom observer, utilizing classroom environment instruments for large group and for small group observation, visited USMES and control classrooms nine times in a period of one year. Several classroom activities were marked for frequency of occurrence, and interactions were tallied as either child-child or child-teacher. Chi-square analysis was used to compare USMES and non-USMES scores in a variety of categories. The most dramatic differences were found to be a greater amount of  small group work in USMES classes, the far larger number of ideas added by USMES students during class discussions, and the higher incidence of child-child interaction during small group work in USMES classes.

Present ambient air quality standards are analyzed in terms of existing data. In addition to health effects, the report analyzes emission effects on agriculture, forestry, ecosystems, and building materials. The second part of the report deals with strategies for controlling sulfur-related power plant emissions. Attention is focused on electric utility generation, relationship of emissions to ambient air quality,  efficient pricing, improving conversion efficiency, fuel shifting, and fuel preparation, flue gas desulfurization, and tall stacks and intermittent control systems. The second part also contains recommendations for abatement strategies. The formula involves a comparison of marginal cost with marginal benefit, the harmful effects of emissions, and the relationships between point source emissions and patterns of dispersion and deposition as it applies to each power plant. The final part of the report assesses nitrogen oxides in terms of sources of emissions and techniques of emissions control. (MR)",

Forty students were given these devices for introductory work with subtraction; they were told to use the aids only as long as they needed them. The instructional phase lasted 30 days, with students performing subtraction problems each day. Third-grade students were given 20 problems to perform in 30 minutes; other subjects were given 10 problems and 15 minutes. In all groups, substantial gains in ability to subtract with borrowing were recorded. Eighty-five days after the  special instruction ended, students were retested on subtraction without using their Calcumates, and achievement continued to be high. (SD)",

        "description":"This teaching guide is for the instructor of an introductory course in computer programming using FORTRAN language. Five FORTRAN programs are incorporated in this guide, which has been used as a FORTRAN IV SELF TEACHER. The base eight, base four, and base two concepts are integrated with FORTRAN computer programs, geoblock activities, and related exercises. Each statement of the first FORTRAN program is described in detail with suggested discussion questions and activities. (Subsequent programs are given without detail.) The FORTRAN programs included are: (1) change base eight numerals to base ten numerals, (2) determine the number of significant places for a given input data, (3) list the even numbers less than 200 for the base eight, (4) give the integral powers of ten in  scientific notation, and (5) give the multiples of four in the base eight. Teaching suggestions include the modification of illustrated programs as well as activities for teaching of the design of a simple computer, unconditional and conditional transfer statements, and DO LOOPS. Fixed point (integer) system and floating point systems of computation in the digital computer are described. Problems with mathematical operation symbols complete the activities in the manual.

The studies examined concern all grade levels from 1 through 12, and relate to grouping on the basis of general ability and on the basis of prior mathematical achievement. Differential effectiveness of grouping patterns on students of high, middle, and low ability is examined. Grouping within individual classrooms is also discussed. On the basis of the analysis of the literature, three recommendations are made: (1) school systems should be encouraged to experiment with homogeneous grouping; (2) teachers should be encouraged to experiment with grouping students within the classroom; and (3) research on  team-teaching should be done. The second part of this paper provides an annotated bibliography. Seventy-seven research reports related to ability grouping are annotated. For each report bibliographic information, a summary of the research methods, and a list of findings are provided. (SD)",

Students in both the experimental and control groups were pretested using the Pupil Opinionnaire, Attitude Toward Mathematics scale, and the Stanford Achievement Test. After a year's instruction, students were again tested using parallel forms of these instruments. Differences between groups at each test administration and differences between pre- and post-test means were submitted to analyses using the Chi-square statistic. Although there were some differences between the groups at the outset of the study, the individualized approach was shown to be quite effective with  fifth-grade students. The authors observe that independent influences on the control group resulting from increased systemwide emphasis on computational skills and curriculum supervision tended to enhance the learning of students in the control group.

Three instruments are described which were used as pretest and posttest measures of attitudes of participants in a one-week Open Education Workshop. The instruments are: (1) a Likert-type attitude scale with 52 items dealing with formal/informal and teacher-centered/child-centered attitudes; (2) an adaptation of the Rokeach Value Survey, which calls for a ranking of 18 terms representing values; and (3) a semantic-differential task, which requires 10 responses to each of 12 items. Data presented clearly support the conclusion that it is possible to change the attitudes in a positive direction, during a one-week workshop, as measured by the  AOA Attitude Scale. Pre- to posttest changes seemed to be reasonably stable. The last instrument indicated short-term changes in the perceptions of the participants toward open education but long-term effects were shown to be less consistent. (Author/EB)",

        "description":"Reported is a research project conducted to train teachers in methods of open education for future implementation in their classrooms. The format of the program allowed participants to experience an open classroom in action by actually living the experience. Prior to participation in the workshop, the participants were asked to read five books to acquire some background in open education. The 48-hour workshop was attended by over 150 teachers. Four research instruments were administered as a pretest situation and of these three were re-administered at the end of the workshop. Six months later all four instruments were mailed to each participatnt for completion and return. A 35 percent return was received. A description of one instrument, \"Sketch Your Classroom,\" is presented.  Data presented in this paper represent only those 46 participants who completed both the Attitude Inventory and \"Sketch Your Classroom\" instruments in June and November 1974. Thought evidence of positive attitudinal changes were noted, it was concluded that a one-week workshop cannot serve to achieve significant gains. (Author/EB)",

The Lake Michigan Federation, one of the new environmental groups developed from the Open Lands Project, was publicly proclaimed in September 1970. The official goal of the federation is to &quot;save the lake.&quot; This study is an evaluation of the Lake Michigan Federation and was undertaken: (1) to provide the federation with means of examining its performance, (2) to monitor the use of grant monies, and (3) to provide useful information for other environmental groups. The study contains six chapters: History and Organization of the Lake Michigan Federation, Lake Michigan  Federation Operation, Political Effectiveness, Public Information and Membership Evaluation, Lake Michigan Federation Leadership, and Conclusion. The conclusions of the study include: (1) the group functions effectively as a political interest group, (2) federation leadership is very centralized and dependent on the work of the organization's Executive Secretary, and (3) the federation can be used as a model for other groups.

        "description":"This volume records the papers presented at a Northwestern University symposium concerning the articulation of cognitive psychology with mathematics education. Piagetian theories are described and extended to classroom applications in several of the papers; other psychological theories such as information processing are also discussed. All of the papers are concerned with students' learning mathematics in an active environment. Charles Smock's paper addresses the ways in which students organize mathematical ideas. Related to this question is Max Bell's paper on the role of applications in learning mathematics; Professor Bell explores the question of whether concepts must precede applications, or, conversely, application is a necessary part of the learning of concepts. Zoltan  Dienes' discussion of finite geometries and Robert Davis' consideration of computer-assisted mathematics laboratories carry this theme further. The extension of Piaget's research to concepts ordinarily taught in the mathematics classroom, and to the development of children between the stages of concrete and formal operations is discussed by Leslie Steffe. The related issue of using Piagetian tasks in educational diagnosis is also discussed by Davis. An overview of psychological research as related to mathematics education, especially in the area of problem solving, is provided in Harry Beilin's paper. (SD)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken to investigate the relative effectiveness of two instructional options offered at City High School, Iowa City. Students enrolled in algebra and geometry courses at this school may elect to participate in a self-paced Program using learning packets, pretests and posttests developed by the faculty, or to be taught by traditional classroom methods. For all students completing these courses in 1974 or 1975, the following data were obtained from school records: grades for ninth-grade algebra (taught by traditional methods in junior high schools), high school algebra and geometry grades, ACT Mathematics score, Iowa Tests of Educational Development (ITED) - Quantitative score. These scores were submitted to several analyses of variance and covariance in order  to test possible relationships among the variables. No significant difference on ACT scores was found for the two instructional methods when scores were adjusted for initial ability as measured by ITED or grade in ninth-grade algebra. However, it was observed that high-ability students were more likely to select the self-paced program, and to take more mathematics. The author notes several other relationships, but states that conclusive evaluation can not be achieved without further research. (SD)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate a practical procedure for determining the optimum sequencing of pictorial classification tasks in science using mean difficulty indices generated by a standard sample of grade two students. Acquisition of such skills can affect the learner's performance on subsequent material and the teacher's efforts in diagnosing specific learner problems. It was predicted that: (1) an ascending order of difficulty in the sequence would be more effective than a random order and (2) a random order of task difficulty would be a more effective sequence than a descending order. Fifty-one grade two subjects constituted the standard sample. The experimental sample was composed of another group of 134 second grade subjects from the same school and from a  nearby school. Subsequently, the experimental subjects were randomly assigned to three treatment groups of ascending, randomized and descending orders of task difficulty. The effects of three presentation sequences of the science tasks were experimentally evaluated in terms of total student performance. The results indicated that a highly consistent series of a pictorial classification tasks sequenced in an ascending order of difficulty was more effective than a random order and that a random order was more effective than a descending order of difficulty.

Twenty preservice elementary education students enrolled in a nontraditional elementary teacher education program participated in the study. Two treatment groups were randomly selected and assigned to a structured instructional treatment group or an unstructured treatment group. A Semantic Differential Attitude Inventory was used to measure change and the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale (Form E) was used to determine the degree of open- or closed-mindedness. Subjects were both pre- and posttested (after four weeks) using the same instruments.  Instructional treatments were reversed and the same procedure was followed. Data were analyzed using a multivariate analysis of covariance. A final conclusion made was that the degree of initial open-mindedness appeared to be the single most important factor in producing attitudinal changes. Structured teaching strategies led to more closed-mindedness than nonstructured. (EB)",

Each of these tests is designed to cover a half-year of work; items are included to sample skills listed in the Catalog of Basic Skills used in the system. The tests are used in grades one through eight. The procedure by which the tests were revised involved twelve sequential steps. Skills listed in the catalog were revised, and items were individually examined to test their coherence with the revised skills. Item statistics (r-biserial and a difficulty index) were computed and negative discriminators were eliminated. Teacher criticisms of items were used in  revising or discarding items. Items were compared on the basis of statistical properties with others from the same skill areas or strands to determine acceptability. Four criteria were used in selecting among items remaining in the pool. The author describes this method as an unorthodox combination of criterion-referenced and norm-referenced techniques which is dynamic, responsive to change, and acceptable to educational decision makers in Cincinnati.

The two psychological positions identified within the curricula were stated to have been operationalized in the two programs developed for the elementary school, Elementary Science Study (ESS) and Science - A Process Approach (SAPA). The former reflects the cognitive restructuring approach and the latter, the behavioral approach. The paper presents briefly the procedural factors of the research to include instruments used and a brief report of the results of the study. It was concluded that the results of the study suggested that the two environments were perceived differently by teachers and  functioned differently in practice; some objective evidence was obtained to indicate that student outcomes were sensitive to the two environments.

Significant curriculum-specific transfer effects were found for the seriation instructional condition, whereas little differences were found for the classification, verbal intelligence, and far-transfer conservation task measures. Sex differences, school location effects, teacher biases, and pretesting effects were generally absent. The apparent feasibility of seriation skill instruction for preschool-aged children and the general noneffectiveness of the classificatory and combined instructional conditions, particularly insofar as far-transfer effects are  concerned, suggest a nonunitary picture of cognitive functioning during the transitory phases between preoperational and concrete operational period thought.

This book describes a course intended to remedy this by providing for both a comprehensive study of geometry as an axiomatically defined structure describing spatial relationships and a thorough consideration of the purposes and techniques of teaching geometry in the high school. The author intended that this course follow the study of educational psychology and professional ideals and responsibilities, and that students enrolled be familiar with the basic theorems of Euclidean geometry. After listing the deductive relationships among these theorems, the book deals with the history  and function of geometry. Principles of teaching high school geometry including induction and deduction, laboratory methods, and heuristics are then discussed. The use of high school geometry materials is discussed at length. Nearly half of the book is devoted to the structure of geometry and methods of proof; the underlying principles of the analytic method are described and many problems suggested. Coordinate geometry and topics related to projective geometry are introduced. A bibliography is provided. (SD)",

The schools responding to the survey were quite varied in size, and in the numbers of mathematics education majors and minors among the student body. The required number of semester hours in mathematics (exclusive of  methods) ranged from 25 to 40 with a mean of 32.29. In half these schools, the methods course was taught in the mathematics department. Student teaching requirements were quite varied, as were arrangements for supervision.

        "description":"In the pair of experiments reported here the authors investigated the relationship between meaningfulness of problem statements and subjects' use of these statements in problem-solving tasks. Subjects (96 university students) were required to memorize meaningful formulae such as \"volume = area x height\" or corresponding symbolic formulae such as \"v = a x h.\" Formulae were memorized in three sets of three. Some subjects were tested on one formula from each set, while others were tested on an entire three-formula set. In the first experiment subjects were asked to compute values using the formulae, or were asked unanswerable (incomplete or inconsistent) questions about the formulae. In the second experiment subjects were asked to judge computability of a quantity given several  others. In both experiments analysis of variance revealed a three-way interaction between meaningfulness, problem type, and grouping. Symbolically stated problems involving more than one formula took much longer when the formulae came from different sets; for meaningful problems no such difference occurred. The authors conclude that subjects reorganize meaningful material for themselves, but use the instructor's organization for symbolic material. (SD)",

To test this hypothesis the author constructed materials for each of ten treatments as defined by two levels of abstractness of the advance organizer used and five levels of recalling the organizer to the learner. One-hundred thirty-two pre-service elementary teachers were randomly assigned to treatments which were administered in 13-page booklets. Immediately after the 50-minute treatments, a 23-item test was administered; this experimenter-developed test included a skill subscale and a theory subscale with KR-20 reliability of .690  and .665, respectively. Data were submitted to three analyses of variance. Interaction of the two main variables when the skill subscale was analyzed was the only significant effect (p less than .05). The author suggests that the advance organizers used may not have been stable enough for the population, and that forced recall may have disrupted the cognitive processes of subjects. He also suggests that prior knowledge may have affected the results. (SD)",

The specific purpose was to develop the competence of the funded institutions in preparing research scholars (as certified by their awarding of the Doctor of Philosophy degree) and in conducting research projects (as evidenced by their receipt of research grants). The Science Development program awarded over $230 million to 31 universities. The leading research universities in the country (the so-called &quot;top 20&quot;) were excluded from participation, as were institutions deemed too weak to advance rapidly. The institutions selected were those that seemed to have potential for developing  their science capability markedly in a short period of time. This evaluative study assesses the overall effects of the Science Development program, using nonfunded American doctorate-producing universities as controls. The major indicators were: faculty size, faculty mobility, scholarly productivity, graduate school enrollment and quality, Ph.D. production, and postdoctorate employment. (Author/MLH)",

        "description":"In 1965, the National Science Foundation began an experiment in institutional funding, the Science Development (SD) program. Setting as dual goals an upgrading of the science capabilities of second-tier universities and a broader geographical distribution of scientific resources throughout the nation, this program awarded over $130 million to selected universities during the 1960's and early 1970's. In an effort to assess the impact of this funding mechanism, the National Board on Graduate Education undertook an evaluation of the SD program. The data gathered for this study covered the 15 years from 1958 through 1972. All nonfunded doctorate-producing American universities were used as controls. The three fields that received the largest share of the SD funds were chemistry,  physics and mathematics. Among the major findings were that the funded institutions registered an increase in the rates of publication in key journals and were able to attract higher quality graduate students as measured by an improvement in the scores of first-year graduate students on the Graduate Record Examination. Of the 31 universities in 21 states that were funded, 25 fund recipients were distributed among 17 states that did not have a leading university in 1965. Therefore, the goal of geographic dispersion of funds was largely achieved. (Author/MLH)",

DMP is an activity-based program developed around a comprehensive list of behavioral objectives. The program is concerned with the development of intuitive geometric concepts as well as arithmetic ability and provides for use of individual guidance and pacing. The evaluation reported here concerned achievement gains on the Stanford Achievement Tests and attitudes of pupils, teachers, and parents toward the program. The program was used in the 1973-74 school year. The previous years' standardized test scores were to predict grade equivalent means for the subsequent year. When scores obtained on the Spring 1974 test were compared  with predicted scores, they were higher at all grade levels, but the differences were not statistically significant. Teachers, parents, and pupils all gave the program favorable ratings. Copies of the instruments with item-by-item responses are included in this document. (SD)",

        "description":"In this paper, selected evidence on the effects of Japanese schools is presented. The author believes that Japan is one modern society where the schools have fostered individual and social development. The primary focus is on the effects for individuals in the area of cognitive skills, motivation, educational and occupational attainments, and sociopolitical attitudes and the characteristics of Japanese schools which contribute to their effectiveness. Political conflict over education, the school-job link, and the high esteem Japanese culture and heritage places on education is reported as having a significant bearing on their success. Other suggested indicators of the school's success, discussed in some detail, include: (1) Japanese students' high scores on Science Achievement  Tests administered by the International Education Association (IEA); (2) an interest and aspiration of students to achieve; (3) an increase in educational level attainment; and (4) a substantial effect of education on occupation attainment. In summary, individual changes effected by the schools are plausibly linked to some social and economic developments of postwar Japan. In conclusion, however, it is noted that not all school effects are perceived positively. For example, the conservative element in Japan believes that it is not receiving enough from Japan's schools. Although a major program for school reform has been launched, it is difficult to predict what reforms from the current debate over Japanese education will be implemented. (ND)",

        "description":"The first part of this manuscript relates the initial efforts of a teacher who attempted to apply the value clarification approach in an eighth grade social studies class. The approach is based on Louis Rath's seven-part approach to values clarification which encourages children to choose and to prize one's beliefs and behaviors, and to act on one's beliefs. Value clarification techniques used in the classroom take place in a broad methodological framework that begins with readings on Africa and Asia, and continues with discussion of universal topics and short thought papers to instill a particular set of values through the Rath technique. In Part II, the author discusses his concern for the need to develop evaluation tools to assess the effectiveness of the value clarification  approach, and the steps he takes to design such formative and summative evaluation instruments. In one case, the author analyzes the data he compiles and then modifies his teaching strategies to increase the effectiveness of the value clarification approach. (Author/JR)",

        "description":"By recounting findings from three studies, it is shown that the ecological approach to education has the potential of promoting understanding of relationships between society, schooling, and life opportunities. The ecological approach means that one must attempt to see whether and how the organization of schools, school districts, or national systems of education may transform environmental inputs into aggregate outputs of cognitive attainment. The common assumption that cognitive learning is important in contemporary societies, both for persons and society, leads to an assumption that there are thresholds of learning below which there are very limited chances for a reasonably full share of the society's goods and participation in its institutions. Thus, if we want to foster  equality of life chances in the United States, then at the very least we must maintain a system of schools in which the essential elements that affect opportunities to learn and to achieve academically are distributed as equally as possible. Because what transpires in the classroom may have substantial consequences for what and how much students learn, and consequently their positions in society, an ecological view of schooling is necessary.

        "description":"The major purpose of this study was to compare self-instructional mastery and nonmastery treatments to determine if there are differences in learning, retention, and time-to-testing of high, middle, and low aptitude students. Twenty grade 7 classes from the Savannah-Chatham County School District served as the experimental population. Students were tested for placement in one of three levels of aptitude; then, classes were randomly assigned to two groups and treatment was randomly assigned to groups. The nonmastery treatment received a student text and a workbook which contained prescribed activities and a single review test for each chapter. The mastery treatment received the same student text; however, the chapters in the workbook contained two review tests. If the criterion  level was not attained in the first review test, mastery students were required to correct and relearn material and then take a second review test. A multiple choice test and recall test was administered to measure learning and retention of the content materials. Findings showed that differences in aptitude were not reduced when self-instructional materials were used. An implication of this study is, however, that the lack of teacher monitoring in administering the review tests may have contributed to the poor performance of low aptitude students, since typically low aptitude students require close supervision.

To conceptualize the domain of ought-to-be ideas, a social studies professional belief system is agreed upon as the major determinant of role behavior in social studies education. The responses of 82 social studies teachers to a questionnaire measuring what ought to be emphasized in social studies education provide the research data. From these data six tentative dimensions of a social studies professional belief system are  named--curriculum focus, instructional focus, sociocultural focus, historical study, resource allocation, and program derivation. Also included are the manner in which scores in these six dimensions predict teacher personality and classroom teaching behaviors. The two areas of implications from this research are subsequent basic research and anticipated policy decision making and program practices in social studies education. (Author/DE)",

The program was designed so that students and faculty would work together in a loosely structured, integrated learning experience, with the usual authority structures absent and all persons participating in decision making. The program contained no exams, no papers, no regular classes, and no teacher authority figures to define expectations and educational attainment. After two years the program failed due to questions over authority, self-government, individualism, and collective purpose of the program. By way of conclusion the author suggests that the implications of the anti-authoritarian structure  should have been worked out explicitly before the program began because the anti-authoritarian attitudes within the program precluded intellectual work and effective discussion of the differences between legitimate authority and illegitimate authority. Further, without a sense of program legitimacy, it was impossible to transcend the attitudes which engendered hostility toward organization, defined structure, leadership, self-discipline, and intellectual work.

Two major questions arise: (1) if a researcher knows the level (e.g., individual, teacher/classroom, school, school district) at which inferences are desired, what complications arise from analyzing data at different levels? and (2) are there general guidelines for determining the appropriate units of analysis in a given research context? Five research contexts in which group observations can be used to estimate relationships among measurement of individuals are examined including contexts with missing observations, fallibly measured variables, the  economy of analysis, anonymously collected information, and ecological inference. In choosing units of analysis, appropriateness is a function of the questions asked and of the sampling and/or experimental unit. The former is reflected in the conceptualization of the research objective while the latter can indicate the presence of statistical constraints on the level of inference. Examples of issues and problems that arise with each concern are provided. (Author/DE)",

Students responded to 12 items designed to sample various levels from the Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Affective Domain. In the last item students ranked all the courses they were taking that semester from most favorite to least favorite. The results indicate no significant differences in affective outcomes.  Combining scores across all items show a very small advantage for the PSI students.

        "description":"This paper advances a conceptualization about the schooling phenomena in order to better understand the schooling process. Schooling is defined as those human interactions occurring in schools in which designated adults are acting to arrange the environment, and mindfully or mindlessly to influence the lives of children in the present and in their becoming adults. To better understand the process, four dilemmas of behavior by a teacher in an English open elementary classroom are analyzed according to G. H. Mead's dialectical social behaviorism theories. This teacher's classroom schooling acts are viewed as manifestations of competing and conflicting ideas in the teacher's mind about the nature of childhood, learning, and social justice. The implication of this theory undermines  the basic assumption of performance-based teacher education which emphasizes that it is possible and desirable to determine sets of behavioral criteria to serve as indices of competence. According to this theory, teacher behavior or schooling acts contain not only technical and pedagogical considerations but also conflicting moral and ethical considerations which make purely technical behavioral criteria impossible.

Students were randomly selected to represent the third-grade population in the state and the three geographical regions: Coastal Plains, Piedmont, and Mountains. An experimental objective-referenced social studies instrument was administered to measure students for mastery of selected social studies learning tasks. In addition, a randomly selected subsample of 450 of these students took a test consisting of two questions, administered orally and requiring oral responses. To assess mastery, eight objectives, drawn from the  Division of Social Studies document &quot;Social Studies Curriculum Guide for North Carolina,&quot; included the following: Information Processing, Physical Environment, Cultural Environment, Cultural Universals, Economic System, Political System, International Relations, and Acting for the General Interest. Results showed that North Carolina's third grade students scored satisfactorily or better on approximately two-thirds of the social studies objectives measured and that regional differences were slight.

Standardized tests evaluating the results of the new social studies courses are open to criticism on the basis of validity, utilization, and restriction of educational change. They culturally discriminate against some individuals, predict imperfectly, and are often rigidly interpreted. The tests may be assumed to measure innate characteristics and thus may influence teacher expectation regarding student potential. They have a harmful effect on the shaping of the student's cognitive style and often are the basis for school organization and curriculum.  Further, standardized tests distort the individual's privacy in later life. Finally the results of standardized tests, regardless of their inherent weaknesses, are used as a basis for allocation of resources. The annotated bibliography lists 11 commercially available standardized tests for skill, discipline, and general social studies testing. (Author/DE)",

The challenge is to include the following elements into every child's basic education: (1) an international dimension and a global perspective; (2) understanding and respect for all peoples, cultures, civilizations, values, and ways of life; (3) awareness of increasing global interdependence between peoples and nations; (4) ability to communicate effectively with others; (5) recognition of the duties incumbent on individuals, social groups, and nations toward each other; (6) appreciation of the necessity of international solidarity and cooperation; and (7) readiness on the part of the individual to participate in solving problems of the local community, the country, and the world at  large. Many university, foundation, and federal programs in international education exist; yet more leadership is needed at the local level. Possible local activities include contacting congressmen for matching funds to local education authorities; designing and initiating new programs at the state level through the state departments of public instruction and individual school districts; urging higher standards in textbook adoption; and encouraging the use of lay teachers, businessmen, students, and foreign visitors who have firsthand knowledge of international affairs.

        "description":"The report centers around the general question of how nonwhite minority groups were treated by those responsible for public education in California between 1849 and 1970. The minorities treated are Indian, Mexican, Negro, and Asian Americans, all of whom were once considered a formidable problem by Californians of the dominant culture. More specifically, the purposes of the descriptive document are twofold: to determine the educational opportunities that were provided for nonwhites and to reveal why and by what process nonwhites were treated as they were. Variables that served to alter the nature of that treatment, positively or negatively, are ascertained. Variables affecting the educational opportunities of the minority groups include political and economic power. The story of  nonwhite education in California involves a virtually unbroken string of discriminatory practices, some sanctioned by law, some only by custom. Any relief provided was usually through the courts or through the disadvantaged group's persistance and power. Through the passing years, a clearly identifiable improvement in the legal and social rights accorded to nonwhite students in California is apparent. However, public education has yet to solve some of the major problems, which still exist from 120 years ago. An extensive bibliography concludes the document. (Author/JR)",

Images of the future are culturally and socially created from past experience and knowledge, present circumstances, and views of future events which are believed to be possible. These future images are an integral part of our network of values and notions about life and reality just as the images of ourselves that we project into the future form a basic component of our present self-image. Since the velocity and impact of change has increased to the point that past-orientation has become inadequate for solving the problems of today, future studies education, with its anticipatory process skills, can help students gain an understanding of the external forces that influence  their lives. Also included are guidelines for the evaluation of future imaging, a sample questionnaire designed to compile data for evaluating future imaging and its effects on learning, and a list of skills developed by future studies education.

Using the materials provided--including photographs, census data, hydrant and fire alarm locations, traffic flow charts, and building locations--students familiarize themselves with the data and set about attacking the problem. The end products of their work are maps which are evaluated by the class to see who will be awarded a further  contract. The final section examines the simulation for its value as a decision-making exercise, its conveyance of the cartographic system, and as a communication exercise in self-expression. (Author/DE)",

A sample of 2,790 students who in 1967 were enrolled as freshmen in seven urban and suburban, public and parochial school systems in southern New York completed a questionnaire during their freshman year, sophomore year, senior year, and one year after graduation. Sub-samples were defined in terms of educational status after completion of high school including four-year college students, two-year college students, terminal high school students, and dropouts. Comparisons between the four sub-samples were made according to status background and intelligence, educational career variables, scholastic attitude variables, and  self-reference variables. The data confirmed that individuals now in four-year colleges scored higher on the selected variables than those in two-year colleges, who in turn scored higher than terminal high school students, who in turn scored higher than dropouts. Such differences in scores existed not only as recently as the senior year of high school but as early as the freshman year. The findings suggest that pre-existing differences influence the length of formal schooling. (Author/DE)",

The principle source of information came from a set of questionnaires sent to the chairmen of 267 geography departments across the country. The results indicated abundant new opportunities for geographers in college teaching, curriculum reform, secondary education, and environmental research. Although production of doctoral, master's, and baccalaureate degrees in geography would double between 1963 and 1975, the number of people who would receive doctoral degrees between 1963 and 1972 would fail to satisfy the estimated demand. Four university departments granted nearly one-third of all doctorates  earned in geography between 1960 and 1965, and more than two-thirds were granted by the 12 largest departments. Economic geography was the most popular professional specialty indicated by resident graduate students. Finances and family obligations were the principle factors which induced students to leave graduate school before completing their dissertations. (Author/DE)",

The statistical information in this report was collected from published sources and a questionnaire sent to geography department chairmen in 1971. The results of the questionnaire indicate a surplus of Ph.D. graduates in geography for the number of jobs available in the field. The number of degrees in geography at the doctoral, master's, and baccalaureate levels is expected to double in the 1970s. College teaching remains the preemptive career choice of geographers, yet the surplus will encourage university administrators to hold down salaries, increase teaching loads, and defer tenure. Geographers formerly dependent upon college teaching jobs must  develop alternative career opportunities. The ten largest geography departments granted over 50 percent of all doctoral degrees. The center of graduate activity is shifting to universities on the west coast. Urban geography, cultural geography, and economic geography are the most popular topical specialities of contemporary graduate students. (Author/DE)",

The field plotter is an easily operated analog computer which employs the electrically conductive sheet analog to simulate a wide range of physical and human-related spatial phenomena. The diffusion patterns of current in the sheet are mapped directly by marking and measuring voltage with a pencil probe. The rsulting map of electrical potential is a direct analog to the spatial distribution of response to a simulated geographic phenomenon. After a brief introduction, chapter two discusses the geographic concepts of location, distribution, and spatial processes and rates the manner in which the field plotter describes these concepts. Chapter three  examines the technical theory behind the field plotter. The fourth chapter presents the operations of the field plotter. Chapter five examines six specific applications of the instrument to geographic problems and models. The sixth chapter describes how field plotter techniques can be applied to wider geographic problems. (Author/DE)",

Yet the core world issue, from which most other problems stem, is the maintenance of an equitable and dynamic equilibrium between world populations and world resources. We are faced with a set of challenges stemming from relatively shrinking resources, growing pressures for redistribution of wealth and income, and the growing likelihood of the use of nuclear weapons to remedy perceived inequalities. The solution to the present disequilibrium requires transformations in individual perceptions, cognitive capabilities, and participative processes. The principal actors in the quest for solution will not be nation-states but groups of nations categorized  according to the amount of world resources to which they have access. Those nations that have some access to resources but not enough to sustain themselves will have the greatest incentives for cooperation and interdependent behavior. As a group they are in the best position to act as intermediaries between the more powerful independent nation-states and the most underdeveloped dependent countries. (Author/DE)",

The workshops introduced teachers to basic demographic concepts and statistical techniques, provided the teachers with a knowledge base as a prerequisite for meaningful discussions of population issues, related problems of urban living to population processes, and developed curriculum materials suitable for teaching population education in grades K through 12. An evaluation of the program showed that teachers' knowledge of selected demographic concepts and facts increased between the pre-workshop period and the post-workshop period. High school teachers showed greater effective change in knowledge than lower grade teachers, although there remained  widespread interest in population education among all teachers. The original program schedule was modified two times during the course of the workshop resulting in fewer formal presentations, more teacher discussions, and greater teacher involvement in the workshop program.

Although the study focuses mainly upon individual trends and schools of thought, some attention is given to the evolution of ideas within the field. Methodologies are considered in the light of their applicability to individual or classroom analysis by students. From the most traditional point of view, music possesses four constituent components: melody, harmony, rhythm, and form. The components are separable for concentrated descriptive and analytical purposes but can also be considered in selected combinations or all together for comprehensive analytical work. Analysis methodologies described include the following: musical forms, schemes, and designs; music appreciation; melodic analysis; rhythmic analysis; harmonic  analysis; Schenker system or tonal analysis; unit theory; style analysis; musical performance analysis; complete composition analysis; phenomenological analysis or the human physical and psychological response to music; music as information communication; computer musical analysis; analysis in the elementary school; and comprehensive music analysis.

The review treats the following variables pertinent to early instruction in singing: task sequence, music stimulus, feedback mode, presentation mode, age at which training is begun, optimum number of repetitions, singing alone vs. singing with stimulus, and physical factors. Although research in music has a long history, the use of scientific experimentation is a recent phenomenon; consequently, little information can be accepted with a substantial degree of confidence. Generally accepted research includes the facts that the natural range of a child's voice is small but will expand up and down with the passage of time; range expansion can be hastened by training; pitch inaccuracy is more  widespread in younger children than older children, although the problem lessens with age and training; no superior voice training method is known, although presentation and feedback modes have proved successful; and children are more likely to sing on pitch if a singing model is presented in their vocal range and they are given visual feedback.

Four musically trained and four non-musically trained adults listened to an audio recording of pitches and judged whether the second pitch was higher or lower than the first. The results indicate that scores earned by non-musicians were quite similar to scores obtained by the persons with musical training. There is no appreciable difference between the non-music and music subjects on either the range of errors or point of subjective equality.

It further examines how the existentialist emphasis on the value of passive and nonintentioned lived-reality can be related to the move to charactetize teaching as the encouragement of genuine engagement of the individual's rational judgment on underlying issues. The notion of rational practicality for both the rationalist and existentialist consists of an interaction, a  dialectic between experience and systematicity, in which the priority of either will depend on the nature of the decision to be made. The very vagueness of the definition emphasizes that the pursuit of knowledge is determined at every stage by unspecifiable powers of thought which are subject to certain limitations and boundary conditions but which are still open to judgement on the basis of immediate sensory experience, structured disciplines, past knowledge, guiding principles, and communal agreements.

This work can be used by students as a text in secondary level social studies programs, or by a teacher as a reference or resource material to supplement other texts. Also, it could be used in bilingual classrooms to present the historical contributions of Spanish-speaking peoples in Texas, or as a conventional Texas history text. Probing into the conflict that arose from the clashes of the different cultures as they mingled in Texas, the book explores the causes for these conflicts, showing them to be multifaceted. The history of Texas is traced from  colonization, through independence, to statehood, up to the 1970s, culminating with the emergence of an ethnic and cultural consciousness in the Mexican Americans.

        "description":"This paper is about myths in general and the &quot;myth&quot; of Democracy in the United States of America in particular. Myths have a number of definitions among which legendary stories containing some elements of fact but wholly untrue can be cited as the basis for the establishment of commonly accepted beliefs. Myths can be functional in the sense that they serve a specific purpose or purposes. Among these, the binding together a political system such as ours may well be a vital function of the Democratic Myth in our society. Democracy, in its classical sense (where majorities rule; each member of the society participates in decisions affecting his life; opportunities for advancement are equally distributed; and so on), appears to be the inner faith to which our society looks inwardly  for solace and comfort. Most of the time, however, the principles of such a system (democratic) are nowhere honored, either because they are impractical or simply impossible. That being the case, one wonders whether the Democratic Myth ought to be exposed for what it is, a Myth, or preserved and reinforced in homage to its utilitarian function. The true democrat must wrestle with the dilemma of either exposing the Myth in the belief that by so doing our society matures, or to the contrary, deny the existence of any myth and go on to play a democratic game in which rules are written but not practiced. To the extent that the Democratic Myth is incongruent with the realities of our democratic system the author suggests that it be discarded as inoperative. (Author)",

        "description":"The role of a state education agency (SEA) in the development of a program for international community education is analyzed. The task of this paper is perceived to be linking the human condition internationally with the concept of community education. Community education, as presented here, engages the public in determining the role that schools play in solving individual and community problems. Roles and functions of the SEA are no longer limited to traditional tasks; rather, national trends point to new responsibilities and directions for the SEA. They are: (1) more comprehensive, coordinated planning; (2) increased evidences of coordination with related agencies; (3) new approaches to research, development, evaluation, and accountability; (4) general shifts in staffing  patterns and agency size; and (5) involvement in conflict resolution. These plus basic principles guiding the SEA indicate its position in an international education program to be leadership. Also identified is an emerging role of staff development for training programs. The SEA is advised not to forget the pivot of its success -- people, whom education is to serve -- as it proceeds in linking community education with international education. (ND)",

After a rationale for teaching the study of the sea, ways in which this topic can be used as content are briefly discussed. For example, units can be developed around the ship building industry, ports, fishing industry, and naval technology. American maritime heritage offers alternatives in instructional strategies whether product or process oriented. Suggestions are given for designing a unit using inquiry strategies, lectures, and current events. The topic also lends itself to an interdisciplinary approach.

        "author":["Williams, David Brian"],
        "description":"Current elementary music education approaches to the distribution and selection of ethnic folk song in music programs are surveyed and each approach is reviewed on the basis of its utility for the Southwest Regional Laboratory Music Program. The first approach, a traditional point of view, is based on the premise that music education has a responsibility to introduce the child to a wide spectrum of music from all cultures. A problem with this approach is that ethnic groups and their music have not received much emphasis--the emphasis, instead, is on White music. Another approach is the non-Western. This music philosophy shifts the emphasis so that children will be exposed to a variegated selection of music of other cultures; however, most classroom teachers are not prepared to  teach non-Western music. In addition, there is a degree of uncertainty that young children can cope with the demands of non-Western music systems and languages. Another point of view is the Ethnic-American in which the emphasis has been on a larger representation of American ethnic music other than traditional Anglo-American repertoire. The last point of view presented is the multi-directional ethnic American that conceptualizes the relationship of a child to his society. This philosophy stresses that the American child should first discover the relevant musical diversity within his own culture before studying music of non-American cultures. A reference section concludes the document. (Author/JR)",

Tracing its history, the author defines values education and its need in the school system. Values and values clarification are examined in the second part of the document, stressing the process of valuing of Raths and Simon. Seven criteria describe the process of valuing, including choosing freely, choosing from alternatives, choosing after thoughtful consideration of consequences, prizing and cherishing, affirming, acting upon choices, and repeating. The role of the school and society and values education is examined in  part three. The school cannot prescribe the values, but it can provide an atmosphere of intellectual freedom and can aid the student in developing his capability for rational analysis.

Education degree programs are remarkably similiar in course requirements and format, emphasizing traditional lecture oriented courses and student teaching. Obstacles prohibiting the reform of education curricula include the ivory tower attitude of teacher educators, the growing distrust of practicing teachers toward teacher educators not involved in the day-to-day operations of the school, the intransigeance of the university to reform itself, and the resistance of youth to new approaches in education designed to change their present outlooks. Possible reforms to the current system include more  direct involvement of education students in the public school system prior to their graduation. This innovation in turn requires greater involvement of teacher educators in the public school system. The teacher educator, committed to developing more innovative teachers, must spend more time in the field developing programs and school milieus conducive to creative teacher training and preparation.

The committee was formed to evaluate the ramifications of the constitutional convention method of initiating amendments to the U. S. Constitution as set down in Article 5. It analyzed and studied all aspects of law concerned with calling a national constitutional convention. Particular attention was given to the question of whether a convention's jurisdiction can be limited to the subject matter giving rise to its call, or whether the convening of a constitution as a matter of constitutional law opens the convention to multiple amendments and the consideration of a new consitution. Article 5, the origins of  the provision, intent of the Framers, and history and workings of the article since 1789, formed background material for the research. The major conclusion reached from the study is that a national constitutional convention can be channeled so as not to be the unleashing of a radical force in the system, but rather an orderly mechanism of effecting constitutional change when circumstances require its use. Appendices illustrate and cross-reference the report. (Author/ND)",

        "description":"Teacher-pupil interaction is an integral part of most classroom instruction. A teacher frequently initiates an interaction by making a statement or by asking a question about the lesson. The statement or question is then typically followed by a student response. Though the value of pupil-teacher interaction has often been extolled, interactions often end after a single interchange between teacher and pupil. There are times, however, when it would be more valuable for a teacher to pursue a line of thought with an individual pupil throughout a series of two or more interchanges. In such instances, the teacher can maintain and direct the interaction by the type of questions he/she asks and the kind of encouragement he/she gives. Two teaching skills, involving the ability to ask  probing questions and offer accepting reactions, are especially helpful in eliciting and encouraging responses from pupils. In addition, these skills can be used by the teacher to test the level or degree of students' comprehension. (This handbook discusses the teaching competencies necessary for effective pupil-teacher communication. Through (a) discussion of classroom interchange techniques, (b) examples of probing questions and accepting responses, (c) examination of appropriate film transcripts, and (d) communication exercises, a greater understanding of these vital teaching skills is attained.)

The study focuses on two points of early career development: career choices during college and the employment of beginning teachers. Characteristics of these respondents are discussed for both topic areas; supportive tables are included throughout the text. The results from this study are compared with studies by Mason (of 1955-56 beginning teachers) and Davis (of 1961 college graduates). The findings of this study indicate that career choice changes during college result in: (a) more men teachers, (b) fewer black men teachers, (c) more black women  teachers, (d) more teachers who are protestants. Recruits to teaching at the end of college were students of higher socioeconomic status who originally had more ambitious career goals. Defection from teaching during college resulted in the loss of black male teachers and of students of relatively high achievement from quality private institutions. The findings of this study concerning recruitment into the first teaching job indicate that the great majority of candidates actively seeking jobs were hired. This group consisted of more men than women, but fewer black men. Those who were hired came from higher socioeconomically placed families than non-hires and had better grades. (JA)",

        "description":"At present, a number of creative approaches are being employed with regard to learning problems. In the past, learning problems were dealt with in segregated classrooms or schools. Although future approaches are still a matter of conjecture, mainstreaming will figure as an important factor in these approaches. Two approaches currently used in integrated activity curricula are described in this paper: (a) the physical activity program that encompasses regular and adapted physical education programs as well as intramurals and interscholastic sports, and (b) the program that diverts physical education students into specialized class settings. Traditional categorical methods of educating children are no longer of much value. Because physical educators have always been faced with a  wide range of individual ability levels, they should be least threatened of all teachers by the introduction of students at different ability levels. The physical education program should be a well balanced one, including motor ability capacities as well as functional fitness and recreational skill development. The Athens Unit of the Georgia Retardation Center represents a position similar to that experienced by a learning development teacher: children identified by the public school or other learning-service agencies as having difficulty in developing their abilities are referred to the Center for short-term diagnostic workup of an educational program that suits the child and can be continued upon return to the community setting.

        "description":"This report presents the results of a longitudinal study of professional socialization. The purpose of the study was to discover and understand the changes which take place in students during training and to draw implications for the improvement of professional education. Questionnaires were administered to 3,146 students who began courses in one of six Australian universities with the intention of qualifying for engineering, law, medicine, or teaching. The data was supplemented with information from 2,500 teacher-trainees at the University of London Institute of Education. Some of the results include the following: (a) in law, medicine, and engineering there was general consensus concerning the role of the professional and the service provided, while in teaching there was not;  (b) compared with those in engineering, law, and medicine, the students in teaching had a much more negative component in reasons for their career decision; (c) students in teaching who had been enrolled in education courses for all four years retained their initial level of commitment to teaching and did develop some professional attitudes, while those who began study in specifically educational subjects only during the last year (the majority) neither retained their initial commitment nor developed professional attitudes; and (d) compared with practicing teachers, student teachers had a more liberal view of the relationship between school and society, and they initially adhered less to the view that the teacher-pupil relationship is necessarily one of dominance-submission.

For such a grafting process to be successful, it must be realistic and we must acknowledge that early perceptions are inclined to become tempered by the length and breadth of exposure. Analysis of both British and American systems of education reveals that neither culture has the &quot;better&quot; system, but that each might benefit from each other's assests. During the author's recent sabbatical, he saw that the British system is marked by (a) the profound dedication of British teachers, most notably on a primary level, (b) a highly discriminating process of admission to universities, (c) infrequent opportunities for teacher professional advancement,  (d) an emphasis on art and music in primary and secondary schools that could well benefit American education, and (e) a tradition of morning assemblies that has an appeal because of the cohesiveness it seems to foster between administration, faculty, and students. American observers have created a false illusion in emphasizing the &quot;informality&quot; of British education. The &quot;new&quot; British primary schools may be physically new, but philosophically they are the result of the almost imperceptible on-going evolution of a one-thousand year tradition. (JS)",

A management system has been defined in terms of the methods by which an institution plans, operates, and controls its activities to meet its objectives by utilizing the resources of people, materials, equipment, information, and money. The evaluation of a system's adequacy involves how closely the output of the system fulfills the purposes for which it exists. Further, the quality of an educational institution can only be assessed after its goals are precisely stated and evaluated. The  systems approach for school administrators must, then, be preceded by an overview regarding systems applications, since many administrators view the systems approach as merely a highly theoretical exercise.

This development carried into the twentieth century, where monographs, yearbooks, textbooks, statistical data, research undertakings, professional conferences, and efforts toward methodology concerning comparative education appeared rapidly. One of the objectives of the Comparative Education Society was to improve the teaching of comparative education in colleges and universities. The Comparative Education Society \"Review\" is also aimed at teachers of comparative education by giving attention to: (a) improving teaching methods, (b) providing bibliographic annotations, and (c) disseminating textbooks and other useful written  material. With regard to methodology, the field has progressed from a process of simply gathering educational data on foreign systems to the study of comparative education as an academic discourse by itself. As far as methodology is concerned, Higson recently suggested a systematic scheme for the classification of known methodological approaches in the field, which rests on eight criteria for categorization, each with a dichotomous category. Of particular concern is that comparative and international studies not be limited to the graduate level, nor to those who make a professional commitment to the field. Comparative and international studies might benefit from being \"popularized\" beyond the purely career-oreinted realm. (PB)",

        "description":"Since circumstances are demanding a comprehensive restructuring of teacher education in this country, and since comparative and international education are inexorably linked to teacher education, this restructuring should be viewed by comparativists as an opportunity to enrich the quality of, and be of service to, teacher education. More specifically, comparative educators can retain a reputation for intellectual respectability and professional indispensability by making their knowledge and skills available to this inevitable restructuring process. It is not enough to advocate that the content of comparative and international education be made more meaningful to the total process of educating teachers, its approach must also be workable. Its methodologies must contribute to the  analytic skills that teachers need in order to analyze their roles and perform their functions in an enriching manner. The impact of restructuring on the future of teacher education nationally will undoubtedly cause numerous difficulties, but an opportunity to demonstrate the power and relevance of foundational studies cannot be missed. Comparative education can make a substantial contribution to the teacher preparation programs. It has the potential to offer: (a) a legitimate body of knowledge derived from intercultural and multicultural experiences that can enrich and enhance teacher education, and (b) appropriate methodologies for inquiries, theory-building, and for drawing and validating generalizations.

The results of this study indicate that teachers have an effect on average class achievement scores, and that this effect can be broken down into a stable component attributed to the teachers' consistency, and an unstable effect which varies from year to year. The stable component can be obtained by measuring (a) consistency teachers have in teaching different skills to the same students, and (b) consistency in teaching the same skill to different students. The data were collected from 89 fifth-grade teachers. Student achievement was tested in October and April in two consecutive years on the Intermediate Battery of the Metropolitan Achievement Test (MAT:1959). Adjusted gain scores were  computed, based on class means, and the gain was used as an index of relative teacher effectiveness. The following three assumptions are implicit in the use of these gains: (a) the MAT is a relevant index of student performance, (b) gain scores measure teachers' deliberate behavior and variables beyond control of the teacher, and (c) students in average or below-average classes may learn considerably during the year, although in comparison to other classes they may have learned less. Results of the study also indicate that teachers are not found to have a consistent effect on the spread of achievement scores in their classes. (Author/JS)",

The third paper, \"Decentralizing Graduate Education: A Case for the Field-Based Professor,\" by William C. Bruce, Ronald L. Hubright, and V. Eugene Yarbrough, looks at the Alma staff  development program, used to revolutionize a rural educational system in Georgia. The fourth paper, \"Community Involvement and Control in Higher Education,\" by V. Eugene Yarbrough, predicts the coming transformation in higher education with increasing use of previously untapped sources in the community. The fifth paper, \"Graduate Curriculum Outcomes in the 1980's: A Design for Producing Practitioners,\" by William C. Bruce, shows how coordination of resources outside the university can reform graduate education. An appendix consisting of an FBTE contract is included.) (JS)",

Part 2 examines the concept of educational research policy by providing an analytical framework and discussing the differences between educational  policy, research policy, and educational research policy. Part 3 looks at the validity of instrumental approaches to policy making. Topics covered in this section are a) criticisms of the instrumental approach, b) redefining the concept of authority, c) role of informative criticism, d) research and development process, and e) power structure. Part 4 focuses on the following conditions and instruments of educational research policy: a) present conditions of educational research and development, b) organizational instruments in educational research policy, c) research recruitment policies, d) resource allocation in educational research policy, and e) international collaboration.

The experiment organized for state school teachers promotes training for new teacher attitudes and brings teams of educators together for retraining. &quot;Experiments in Continuing Teacher Training,&quot; by Gilles Feery, examines several innovative approaches to teacher training in France. Topics include a) diversity of conditions in which the innovations were set up, b) variety of models, and c) disparities in how the models fit into institutional  structures.

In the first investigation, 63 school principals and 45 tutors utilized specially constructed diary sheets to observe and register their own behaviors. In order to analyze the data, it was first reduced to units, and the units were then sorted into newly constructed categorization  patterns. Task assessment was then measured by means of frequency and time consumption analyses. The second investigation attempted to map the problems facing teachers engaged in labor market training (LMT), a type of vocational adult education. The purpose of this investigation was to develop a kind of problem inventory which could form a base for the training of future LMT teachers and further training for those already in service. Data was gathered from 16 LMT teachers using a self-observation diary. After completion of the diary, each participant received a follow-up interview. The diary investigation produced reports on 456 difficult tasks and the follow-up interviews elicited 141 more. (JS)",

Primarily, the Malmo activities focused on solving the essential problem of how to combine individualization of instruction with social education. The development work, carried out in close cooperation with a city-based educational development center and the research department of a school of education, showed the need for increased flexibility in the use of resources as well as in several activities of the school. New categories of personnel were  introduced into the schools, and teachers had to learn to cooperate with them, making plans in teams with other teachers and with pupils. More stress was placed upon the pupils' social and emotional development, as well as upon the handling of new teaching aids. The report bases its analysis of emerging new patterns of teacher tasks upon descriptions of innovative situations and reports on developmental and research projects. (Author/JS)",

Traditional methods, such as a college course for credit, are no longer viable for the problems of today. College courses can still be an effective means for inservice education, but the design and implementation of these courses needs modification. Instead of a \"prepackaged\" block, the course should be designed with attention to unique characteristics of schools/systems. Should the school be concerned with moving to a highly individualized instructional program, a  college course should be composed of elements which would support and guide the particular faculty as they move into this particular curricular change. Flexibility, courses planned cooperatively with the target personnel, classes held in schools rather than on a college campus, and the collaborative efforts of several professors as well as public school personnel should all be components of inservice education.

The program works in the areas of (a) prevention, (b) treatment, (c) first aid, and (d) rehabilitation of athletic injuries sustained during intramural activities. The sports medicine staff consists of three full-time physicians, four full-time trainers, and several student trainers. The program offers the following services: (a) during scheduled events and activities, a full-time professional member of the staff is stationed in the training room, centrally located to all intramural facilities; (b) intramural athletes may receive protective wrapping or taping, if needed, prior to any scheduled intramural activity or contest, as well as any post-game treatment which might be  prescribed by the staff members; (c) athletic trainers also refer injured participants, when necessary, to the sports medicine physicians in the Student Health Service, where they receive the same care as varsity athletics; and (d) rehabilitation of both minor and severe injuries sustained in intramural competition is available, since two athletic trainers hold degrees in physical therapy. In order to ascertain student reaction to the sports medicine program, a telephone survey was conducted. Respondents rated first aid and followup care highly, and comments made about the program were positive. (JS)",

Part 1 presents a historical survey of American education. Part 2 develops a conceptual framework for making useful policy statements. It also considers issues of individual freedom and social order, with emphasis on legal, social, and economic problems. Part 3 deals with legal questions involving school law, the courts, and the contrasting ways student rights and teacher rights have been dealt with traditionally in the past and by present activist courts. Part 4 concentrates on political problems of secondary education reform. Part 5 offers a perspective of views on secondary education, and discusses the following areas related to teacher education and  education generally: (a) alternativeness, (b) individualization and flexibility, (c) broadening the base, and (d) financial support. Part 6 provides a systematic examination of six questions concerning goals, curriculum, and reform. Part 7 focuses on adolescent development and several related issues for reform. Part 8 (a) provides a historical perspective on the development of education from individual instruction to classrooms and schools, (b) describes the emergence of new roles for teachers and schools, and (c) summarizes recent educational media research. Part 9 argues that career education is not an educational concept but a slogan that needs interpreting. Part 10 elicits recommendations from each article and offers suggestions for future action.

        "description":"There have been many theories and hypotheses about play, one of which is the equation of play with \"transcendence.\" Play may have the ingredients to allow us to transcend and, for a moment, remythologize life. There have been recent authors who have given play the status of theology, indicating that play contains elements also found in religion. This then is new play. For Neale, play is peace; there is the connotation of meaningfulness; it involves delight. Miller, in his book \"God and Games,\" views play as a response to the introduction of the sacred into our lives. Jurgen Moltmann calls for transcendence of the win-lose nature of much or our play so that we can just simply be who we are in and through play. For Harvey Cox, festivity is a way that humans keep alive to time by  relating past, present, and future; play has a festive element. The transcendent view of play is \"new\" play in the sense that western culture seems to have forgotten how to play. Both physical education and religion of the West have for centuries been practicing a dualism between mind and body. Physical education can be a catalyst for this new play of transcendence by helping us discover that play is natural to humans and comes in many forms. (JA)",

The process for developing the concept of independence consists of four steps. Step one instructs the participant to create an imaginary situation where she is completely independent. After observing the situation carefully, the participant develops her own list of characteristics of independence. The second step involves the participant's imagining another situation where independence is totally lacking. A list of these situational characteristics is then composed. Step three instructs the participant to read lists included in the workbook and written by other women who were describing what independence  meant to them. The lists are then compared and if there are points not on the participant's list, she adds them. Step four involves reviewing the three previous lists, and writing down any new ideas. The participants then proceed to discuss the concept they have developed. (JS)",

        "description":"The concomitant effects of skill acquisition in hierarchical learning sequences of visual motor programming and the ability to copy designs was compared between five- and ten-year-old children with visual motor disability. Each group of children participated in four types of visual motor training programs, which included 72 responses in each hierarchical learning sequence extended over a six-week period. Programming was implemented through individually prescribed instructional procedures. Pretest and posttest data were acquired on both the Beery Visual Motor Integration Test and placements in the hierarchical learning sequences. The results of the study indicated that the older group of children with visual motor disability learned at significantly greater rates than the younger  group in the motor programming. However, there was a significant difference between groups, and the younger group showed greater ability to copy designs. Procedures for selecting specific motor programs based on individual need, rather than programming all children to the same type of perceptual motor activity, are suggested as a future procedure to enable transfer of the acquisition of visual motor skill to ability to better copy designs.

The model attempts to outline functions of teachers and students as desired outcomes or ideals for which alternative schools should be striving.

The actual decision should be based on the scoring potentials of the two players, from which projected outcome values of various length games are derived. One of the most interesting points from this analysis of tie points in squash is that the better player does not always increase his/her advantage by choosing the longer game. From the projected outcomes, the circumstances under which a player should choose the set and no-set options are determined, providing the optimal strategy for decision points in singles squash. This optimal strategy provides a player with the best possibility of  winning a game. (Author/JS)",

The experimental group trained six days a week, often with more than one workout per day. During this period, the principles of interval training were employed in conjunction with high-intensity swimming. At the completion of training, each subject rode a bicycle ergometer at 60 revolutions per minute, with varying workloads, in order to test maximal aerobic capacity. The maximal oxygen consumption test consisted of three exercise periods, each four minutes long, with a recovery time between exercise periods of ten minutes. On the basis of the data obtained from the investigation, it was concluded that age-group swimmers possess significantly higher aerobic  power than untrained males of the same age. In addition, it is felt that due to chronic heavy physical training, this high level of cardiovascular fitness is maintained throughout the entire training year. (JS)",

        "description":"Following World War I, many Americans plunged into sport, and found the Sabbath a convenient and popular day for engaging in sporting events, especially since Sunday activities had become commonplace during the War and acceptable in many areas. However, when Pennsylvanians turned to sport on the Sabbath, they were confronted by the state's archaic blue law of 1794 which prohibited all sports and diversions on Sundays. In 1926, the Philadelphia Athletics baseball team tested the statute by scheduling a Sunday contest with the Chicago White Sox. The game was played without incident, but Sabbatarians protested and brought this issue before the courts. In 1927 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concurring with Sabbatarian charges, ordered the Athletics not to schedule any more Sunday  games under penalty of forfeiting its charter of incorporation. It was not until 1933, after several battles in the Pennsylvania legislature, that the Sunday lobby generated enough votes to modify the 1794 statute. The new law permitted baseball and football on Sunday afternoons between 2:00 and 5:30 p.m., if the voters of any locality approved. The electorate in Pennsylvania's metropolitan areas voted heavily in favor of Sunday sports at the November 1933 elections. Immediately after the elections, professional football teams began playing on Sundays in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, inaugurating the first legal Sunday sports in Pennsylvania's history.

It is assumed that changes in teacher attitudes affect changes in student attitudes; an inservice program which assists teachers in changing their attitudes toward integration is, therefore, important. Certain hypotheses may be stated concerning the advantages of simulation in inservice programs. The most important is that transfer of learning occurs. Other advantages include (a) the establishment of a \"danger-free environment,\" which allows the teacher to make a mistake without doing irreparable harm to the students' learning; (b) the ability to rerun situations and thus try different solutions to solve the problem under study; (c) emotional involvement of the participant; (d)  the ability to reproduce problems which are not reproducible at will in a real life situation; (e) the ability to design the simulation experience around the problems of most concern to the learner; and (f) the opportunity to deal with problems which may not be faced with any regularity in a real life situation but which do occur. Some available simulations are (a) those developed at the University of Tennessee for Valley Brook Elementary School and Lakemont High School, (b) Cruickshank's Inner-City Simulation Laboratory, and (c) a simulation called \"Confrontation\" developed by the Far West Regional Education Laboratory.

Shifts in schools and education during this period are described including: (a) taking students and education more into the community, (b) a greater attention to career education, (c) the functioning of teaching as a team effort, and (d) the evolution of a school and society that emphasizes competence. The paper presents as one of the most exciting developments of recent years the &quot;Portal School,&quot; which in its advanced form could be transormed into a &quot;Special School for Teacher Education.&quot; Some of the characteristics of this possible new unit in teacher education are listed as follows: (a) its locale is an individual school that is part of a local  school system; (b) its participation as a special teacher education school is voluntary; (c) it is designated a special school for a limited period of time after which the designation will pass onto another school system; (d) the partners of this special school include the school system, the local community, one of more institutions of higher education, members of the profession who are in local, state, and national professional associations, educational R&amp;D institutions, and state and federal government; (e) the trainees in these schools will consist of both &quot;neophyte&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; trainees; (f) the school will be oriented toward problem solving and inquiry and have a strong research and development orientation and capability.

In Chapter 2, the background of PBTE is surveyed and the intellectual, educational and political factors influencing the development of PBTE are identified. The main impetus to the PBTE movement, the 1968 Elementary Teacher Education Models, is examined in Chapter 3 to indicate the main features which are common to PBTE programs and which are specified in some details in the models. Chapter 4 presents the main features of the controversy over PBTE. The development of a list of teacher competencies, together with a means of evaluating the performance of  students in teacher education programs in order to provide continuous feedback to students and administrators, is identified as the central feature of PBTE. The following are noted as factors that have led to the conclusion that PBTE should not be implemented at Claremont Teachers College: (a) the failure to produce either an adequate list of teacher competencies or an adequate means to measure such competencies as are identified, and (b) the lack of a well-developed theory which may give rise to expectations that research may succeed in producing an adequate list of competencies or an adequate evaluative instrument.

Sixteen teachers (three primary, nine intermediate, and four junior/secondary) were provided with a training manual designed to teach the user to discriminate coding categories, to code teacher responses, and to interpret response profiles. Subjects were later asked to videotape and code their classroom interactions. Trained raters provided ratings on eleven sets of pre- and post-tapes for data analysis. Important findings of the study were as follows: (a) scales developed  for the measurement of accurate empathy, warmth, and genuineness have demonstrated high reliability when used in a variety of classroom contexts, (b) structured feedback using videotape has proven to be an effective way to change certain facilitative behaviors of classroom teachers, and (c) the size of the student group does not appear to effect measurement or gain.

A continuous step-increment bicycle ergometer work test was administered with the workload starting at 150 kpm (kilometers per minute) and 50 pedal rpm (revolutions per minute). The workload was increased by 150 kpm each minute for three minutes, then increased to either 75 or 150 kpm until exhaustion, depending on individual response. The following measurements were made during or immediately following maximal work: oxygen consumption, heartrate, blood pressure, minute ventilation, and workload. Oxygen pulse and workload at heartrate 150 were determined from measured values, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all  variables. The effects of age were examined by comparison of the three groups and with results of similar investigations. Decreases in peak oxygen consumption, maximal heartrate, and maximum workload were found to occur as age increased, but slight increases in heartrate 150 and diastolic blood pressure were noted as age increased. No age-related trends were found in systolic blood pressure, maximal ventilation volume, or oxygen pulse. (Authors/JA)",

It explains how the trend toward joint ventures in teacher education began in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and how, since 1968, a variety of arrangements have been developed to accommodate the need to work together. Partnership is defined as regularized collaboration wherein schools and colleges, with related institutions, agencies, and organizations, are professional equals and are jointly responsible and accountable for educating teachers. Eight elements in the rationale for cooperation and partnership are listed and the following five common forms of partnership are described: (a) internship, (b) clinical teaching center, (c) professional development center, (d) regional council,  and (e) state level partnerships.

However, we can no longer afford the belief that it is the sole prerogative of the university to prepare teachers. Both universities and schools must see each other as teacher educators. One approach to assuming this new role and responsibility for the education of teachers will be through the development of a consortium approach. Among the most significant aspects of the philosophical basis for a consortium approach are the following: (a) parity through shared decision making in regard to the development and implementation of teacher education programs; (b) total integration of campus and field  experiences in teacher education; (c) integration of teacher education programs at the preservice and inservice level; and (d) jointly appointed leadership through a coordinator who serves as a catalyst between the partners in the consortium.

Body composition was determined by underwater weighing with an accurate assessment of residual volume. The anthropometric measurements included height, weight, seven skinfolds, waist circumference, and wrist diameter. A step-wise multiple regression analysis of the data indicated that body density and body fat could be predicted from anthropometric measurements. A multiple correlation of .96 was found between body density and the following three independent variables: (a) waist circumference, (b) triceps skinfold, and (c) height.) The team data were divided into five categories by position. When subjected to analysis of variance, significant differences at the .01 level  suggested that at least two separate groups, backs and linemen, be used in future body composition studies of football teams. The estimated optimal playing weights of each player were determined by densitometry, and each player and the coach estimated their optimal weights through personal experience. It was found that the players and the coach estimated the players optimal mean weight to be six and nine pounds heavier, respectively, than the densitometric analysis indicated as optimal.

Forty-eight subjects were divided into four groups representing girls, boys, men, and women. Six possible sequences of dives were counterbalanced so that two subjects from each group were randomly assigned to each sequence. Results showed dramatic increases in stress response for all subjects as the height of the dive attempt increased. The ANOVA test for differences in stress response according to sequence of attempts showed no significant differences. Female subjects showed significantly greater stress  responses for all three measures. Although younger subjects showed longer hesitation latencies, the differences were not significant. High correlations between performance and phenomenological measures bolstered their reliability as measures of stress. Results suggest a reconsideration of coeducational diving instruction for beginners. (Author/JS)",

For many years one of the strongest arguments for the inclusion of athletics in the academic world has been that athletics was an integral part of the physical education instructional program. When education was the major focus of intercollegiate programs, it seemed reasonable that personnel involved in coaching be eligible for tenure. It is however, extremely difficult at present to find an intercollegiate athletic program which can be classified as having educational outcomes as its major focus. Colleges and universities use athletics, instead, to gain publicity and national visibility. This change in the purpose of the athletic program  has caused a change in the conduct of the programs and in the responsibilities of coaches. The athletic program has its own budget and its own facilities. Also, decisions regarding athletics do not go through regular academic channels. Usually, the athletic director reports directly to the president of the university or his designee. The evidence seems clear that intercollegiate athletic programs are now conducted as commercial enterprises with entertainment as the major focus of the program. Since tenure is designed for teaching faculty, it appears that coaches should not be eligible for tenure consideration. (JS)",

The Student Activities Questionnaire (SAQ) was constructed to obtain such information by utilizing the consumers of the educational system--the students themselves. This paper reviews the development and rationale of the instrument and the results obtained to date. Academic climate and the effects on students was measured via a behaviorally focused, multiple-choice questionnaire, administered to 654  experimental and control students in the 5th and 6th grades. Eight measures were developed through item analysis techniques to provide academic climate scores, information on specific classroom activities, and student outcome measures. The experimental group significantly exceeded the control group on 7 comparisons. Individual class averages varied from the 20th to beyond the 80th percentile on the various scores, indicating the instrument measured differences in academic climate and could provide valuable feedback for the educational system.

        "description":"Despite massive inputs of resources during the last 15 years, and despite numerous &quot;adoptions&quot; of educational innovations, very little significant change has occurred at the school level corresponding to the intended consequences of these innovations. The modal process of change has been characterized by a pattern whereby innovations are developed external to schools and then transmitted to them on a relatively universalistic basis. Instead of innovations being viewed as part of a universe of means, schools are viewed as part of a universe of adopters. This paper is based on a large scale research project involving students, parents, and teachers in 46 Ontario elementary and secondary schools. This study was conducted in order to facilitate students, parents, and teacher  understanding of their roles in the educational change process at the school level by gathering, feeding back, and helping to derive action implications of data on the roles and role relationship of these groups and the nature of their involvement in the school.

Designed to tap the adolescent's reasoning processes, the items deal with issues faced by democracies and governments generally, such as limitations on power, on majority rule, and the need for laws and government.

This study investigated the small sample properties of Q and X sub one squared by Monte Carlo methods. The observed distributions were compared for their rates of covergence to the limiting theoretical X sub one squared distribution, and for the degree to which their error rates approximated the nominal error rates. These latter comparisons allowed for idiosyncrasies that exist in the Q test of the correlated proportion hypothesis. Results show that the X sub one squared statistics is more powerful than the Q statistic for testing hypotheses of equivalent correlated proportions. (Author)",

Each of the four generalizability coefficients is shown to be the expected value of a variation on the split-half method for estimating reliability. Finally, the four coefficients are related to estimates of the reliability of class means that have been used previously. (Author)",

Significant main effects for age were found for all the tasks. Few significant sex differences were observed. Scaling analyses of the pass/fail patterns indicated a generally reliable (reproducibility coefficients of .91-.93) order of difficulty. Factor analysis of a subset of the tasks indicated that three principal components were necessary to account for 85 percent of the performance variance. Thus, a nonunitary structure was found for the children's performances across the present task array and age range. In general agreement with the  original contentions of Inhelder and Piaget, it was concluded that the child's understanding of the logic inherent in class inclusion relationships evolves gradually and is contingent upon the previous mastery of certain less complex classificatory skills.

        "description":"Results of nationwide studies show that standardized achievement test scores of public school children have declined since the mid-1960's, after decades of steady improvement. This seems to be true regardless of grade level, subject tested, or geographic area. Comparing Tacoma's performance with that of the nation and school systems like it as a whole gives a general perspective. Sixty-one school systems nationwide were identified as similar to Tacoma in pupil membership (25,000-50,000). From census data, selected demographic characteristics thought to be related to academic performance (such as median family income, education level, etc.) were listed. In response to a request for test information, 22 of the 52 districts provided useable data. These 22 districts were found to be  statistically similar to the other 30 and to Tacoma demographically, and thus constituted the comparison districts in this study. Data provided were not consistent from one district to another, but they did allow comparison of Tacoma with varying numbers of the 22 districts for one to four years, 1970-71 through 1973-74, in reading comprehension and arithmetic computation at Grades 3, 6, and 8. Comparisons of interest were (1) relative score levels, and (2) score trends over time. Specific findings are discussed although they should be interpreted with caution. (Author/DEP)",

Research conducted over a six-year period focused on the occupations of Medical Technician, Cartographic Technician, and Inventory Management Specialist. After careful job analyses, aptitude and ability test batteries were selected, several types of criterion measures were developed, and background data and job activities questionnaires were prepared. Data analysis indicated that tests found to be  valid for one ethnic group were in general valid for the other ethnic groups included in the study, across occupations. Regression equations developed on majority group data appeared to predict almost equally well for minority groups, and some instances predicted higher criterion scores for minorities. The use of supervisors' ratings as a criterion of job performance in validity studies with ethnic sub-groups was called into question by findings of this study, which disclosed interaction effects ascribed to ethnic group membership of rater and ethnic group membership of ratee.

        "description":"An analysis of the student and teacher attitude questionnaires revealed a strong difference between teachers and students in their experiences with Virginia Beach 45-15 program where students attend classes 45 days and break 15 days year round. Teachers were almost in total support of the benefits and advantages of 45-15. Students were more ambivalent. There was disagreement between teachers and students concerning the amount of time teachers had to spend reviewing material after each three week vacation. Teachers thought 45-15 decreased reviewing time but students felt their teachers spent a long time reviewing after each break. There was also disagreement as to whether the frequent vacations increased the students' concentration ability. Students felt the vacations were not  helpful while teachers felt they were. A third disagreement was over the multi-age, multi-grade groupings. The students liked being in classes with students older and younger than themselves, but teachers thought the groupings were less than helpful. Finally, teachers and students disagreed on the successfulness of 45-15 in educating students. Teachers thought 45-15 was highly beneficial as compared to the traditional schedule, but students felt they learned no more under 45-15 than they learned in a nine month school. (Author/BJG)",

Opinions were expressed about the increase and utilization of space, problems of maintaining proportional enrollments, rising time demands, need for more secretarial staff to do record keeping, problems in multi-age grouping, improvement in discipline, attitudes of teachers and students, reactions of the public, the need to keep transient populations informed about the program, and identifying hidden costs. Strong consensus was lacking on many of these issues, as was agreement as to whether the 45-15 plan is a better plan than the traditional school. At this time it is  recommended that the entire school system should not adopt the 45-15 plan. (BJG)",

The purpose of the review is to present background material as a summary report concerning the definition of performance standards. Greatest attention has been paid, of course, to such standards as set for physicians in hospital and/or office practice, but a few references related to nurses have been included as relevant to the problem. With respect to indicators of acceptable performance, the intent of the  review was twofold: to discover (a) specific criteria which have been proposed as performance standards, no matter in what various forms, and (b) procedures which have been employed in determining such criteria. At the same time, it was possible to note certain philosophical viewpoints concerning the whole question, and also to relate measurement techniques to the criteria as outlined. The emphasis, however, was on the criteria and the means used for arriving at them. (Author/DEP)",

These physicians, graduates of foreign medical schools, were identified and subsequently given an opportunity to enroll in a six-month &quot;Curso de Perfeccionamiento&quot; which included supervised clinical practice along with lectures and seminars in the basic and clinical sciences. An important aspect of the Curso program from the beginning was evaluation. Aside from the more usual sorts of program and impact  assessment, it was felt highly desirable to determine in some way the quality of practice engaged in after licensure. If this were done, then not only could the presumed long-range effects of the Curso be investigated, but also the general &quot;quality of medical care&quot; in Puerto Rico could eventually be at least partially assessed. This document reports on the initial steps taken in that direction, namely the establishment of meaningful performance criteria which would define an acceptable level of medical care provided in Puerto Rico and elsewhere.

Following this diagnosis, prescriptions for improvement may be needed. Following this diagnosis, prescriptions for improvement may be developed and applied. This guide is intended as an aid to the proper use of Georgia Statewide Testing Program scores. It provides information about the program and the tests; reading and understanding the various reports; understanding  what the scores mean; and applying test results for the improvement of learning opportunities for Georgia children and youth. Test scores seem often to be misused or not used at all. Perhaps, this is due either to misunderstanding of testing terminology or to a lack of knowledge of what the scores mean. In this guide special attention has been paid to communicating in a simple, straight-forward manner by using words common to most educators and by making liberal use of samples, examples and illustrations.

Concrets, identifiable objects are useful in separating eloquent rhetoric from actual promises. Similarly, an external evaluator should be able to separate proposals with intentional misrepresentation of funding and goals from those which need further organization. Once a project begins, the evaluator should know whether the data being collected and analyzed will be used for internal public consumption, external public relations, or both. This may depend on whether the evaluators' primary allegiance is to the funding agency or to the project. In any evaluation traditional staff roles and lines of authority should be recognized and better communication facilitated. Technical expertise and  the political realities of a system should be reconciled. (BJG)",

The significance of these tests for higher education lies in their extensive use in admission of non-high-school-graduate adults to college. This study has three major objectives: (1) To describe the background and experience of non-high-school-graduates who enroll in college on the basis of their GED scores; (2) To determine the validity of the GED battery for predicting the success of non-high-school graduates at a variety of institutions of higher education; and (3) to identify the advantages and problems created by granting admission to college by means of the GED tests. Results suggest that the  GED tests are useful for the admission and guidance of college candidates who have not completed high school. If the academic achievement of a candidate as reflected by his GED test score is equivalent to that of formal high school graduates, he should be given serious consideration for admission to higher education. High school dropouts who score satisfactorily on the GED examinations are likely to earn college grades comparable to those earned by high school graduates who enroll in college. (Author/RC)",

When teacher educators were asked to rate these competencies major discrepancies became obvious. Teacher educators placed a very important value on competencies which were rated low or as having no value by practicing teachers. Such differences in perception become critical when practicing teachers evaluate the performance of student teachers whose goals are more likely to be those advocated by teacher educators. Further, teachers and teacher educators differed significantly in their estimations of when a competency should be attained. Three conclusions can be drawn from this preliminary research: (1) Teacher educators  appear to attach less importance to classroom discipline and record keeping and more importance to working with students; (2) Teacher educators appear to believe that competencies should be attained earlier in the student's career; and (3) The differences found between teachers and teacher educators indicate that assessment of the competencies themselves is as important a task as assessing student's attainment of the tasks and should be included in any competency based program. The 143 competencies are included in the Appendix. (EH)",

The demographic data indicates that older students tended to be significantly more internal. Internals also expressed a significantly higher desire to attend church services. (Author/DEP)",

The coding scheme facilitates the reduction of qualitative data into categorical data. The heart of the analysis system is the Dominant Instructional Event (DIE) which facilitates the further subdivision of each lesson into subcomponents labeled content, materials, groupings, interaction patterns, student activities, and cognitive taxonomic level.

Three criteria to be considered when an evaluator provides data for a decision maker are: (1) the percentage of the evaluation data that are actually used by the decision maker; (2) the percentage of the decision maker's decisions that are made, in part, with the use of the evaluation data; and (3) the degree to which the data is utilized in the most important decisions, even where all decisions are not made using the evaluation data. These criteria have been named efficiency, completeness, and focus, respectively. Evaluators should avoid errors, and prefer operational to non operational techniques.

This act should insure when properly implemented, that educational programs: (1) lead to the attainment of established educational objectives, (2) provide information for accurate analysis of costs of instructional programs, and (3) provide information for the analysis of the differential effectiveness of instructional programs. Compliance with the MAAP includes the establishment of goals and objectives in, but not limited to, reading, writing, and mathematics at all levels--state, school system, and individual school. The act requires a school by school survey of the current status of  student achievement in relationship to established objectives, the development of programs by each school for meeting its own needs, and the establishment of evaluation procedures for determining the effectiveness of these programs. MAAP stipulates that a yearly report be submitted by the State Superintendent of Schools to the Governor and State legislature. This Handbook was developed to help ensure that MAAP responsibilities at all levels are understood clearly and carried out effectively. (Author/BJG)",

Under this plan, schools remain in session throughout the year and students are assigned to one of four attendance cycles which begin 15 days apart. As a result of the staggered attendance pattern, only three groups (cycles) of students are in attendance at any particular time. The primary purpose of this evaluation was to assess the possible negative side-effects of the new attendance schedule by focusing on student achievement and student attitudes at the end of the first year of year-round education. General conclusions are that students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in pilot schools suffered no adverse effects on achievement in reading or mathematics, nor on attitudes  toward learning or school, as a result of year-round schooling. Specifically, data suggests that sixth grade students improved in reading and mathematics, while their attitudes toward learning and school were more positive. Students with poor attitudes toward learning and towards school and relatively high ability students seemed to benefit from year-round schooling. Findings suggest continuance or expansion of year-round education at Virginia Beach. (Author/BJG)",

Although the original JTPT required the use of actual equipment, the later battery utilized graphic symbolic substitutes. In this effort, a battery of symbolic tests was developed including a companion symbolic test for each of the job activities for which a criterion referenced JTPT had previously been developed. Based on two limited validations, all of the graphic symbolic tests, with the exception of the symbolic test for soldering, indicated sufficient promise to justify further consideration  and refinement. All of these promising symbolic tests should be given more extensive validations using larger numbers of experienced subjects. The validation of any such symbolic test requires the administration of a companion JTPT as a validation criterion. As a result, a validation is an expensive process in terms of equipment and experienced manpower. The troubleshooting symbolic tests require the most extensive refinement. Several suggestions are made for improving their empirical validity. (Author/BJG)",

These programs should systematically and comprehensively identify and solve problems concerning maintenance practice in the field and problems concerning the selection and training of  maintenance personnel. A necessary first effort should be to gather and study hard data on how well maintenance men can perform the key tasks of their jobs.

Although the results were not consistent with Piaget's theory, test development was only partially successful. Specifically, validation of the scales was excellent or poor depending on the perspective. Analysis of the item difficulties within scales was excellent for the exclusion and combination scales and poor for the proportion scale. In fact, the prediction for the exclusion and combination scales was &quot;perfect&quot;. Such results lend support to Piaget's contention of the invariant sequence of logical development for those logical structures tested. An analysis of those subjects' responses and reasoning on the formal items revealed that most had rotely learned  how to solve proportion problems without understanding the underlying structural process. Such evidence would invalidate the contention that the &quot;low&quot; difficulties on the concrete items was due to the &quot;high&quot; readability of the items. Thus, it would seem that from a within scale analysis, the written test was generally successful, the criterion of cognitive level existence is still subject to question, and a different type of formal proportion item must be devised to alleviate the effect of specific past learning without understanding.

Test scales are designed to measure some facet of state quality assessment goals. Along with basic skills, the various instruments examine: (1) social and health habits, (2) feelings toward self and others, (3) value placed on learning and human accomplishment, (4) interest in creative activities, (5) methods of coping with frustration, and (6) attitudes toward work and career planning. Extensive investigation concerning the consistency of student responses within each scale and the stability of student responses to the scales over time has been conducted. Total scales yielded high internal consistency reliability while shorter subscales  were weak. Strong correspondence between ratings made by teachers and student scores was demonstrated for seven of the attitude scales. The unit of analysis of all data received from the EQA was the school. The inventory provided information on: (1) student-body standing on each composite goal test relative to a statewide reference group, (2) student-body standing relative to groups similar in home and school environments, and (3) proportion of student-body who demonstrated minimum positive attitudes.

The last updating was completed in August, 1973. The present report differs from previous editions in that Section 1 contains an expanded discussion of accountability legislation and a general description of the kinds of laws that were enacted from 1963 through 1974. More specifically, this section includes: (1) A table that shows which states have enacted accountability legislation and which ones have not; (2) A table that indicates how many states have enacted legislation in five accountability-related categories or processes; (3) A table that identifies statutes enacted by year and  by state from 1963-1974 and the processes of accountability that are covered by the laws; (4) A graph that depicts the changing rate in the number of accountability laws passed from 1963-1974; (5) A discussion of each law enacted during the 1974 legislative session; and (6) A summary of laws enacted prior to 1974 that were not reported in earlier versions of Legislation by States. Section 2 is similar to preceding editions of Legislation by the States in that all the statutes enacted from 1963 through 1974 are reproduced, with the exception of the 1974 North Carolina budget. Those that have not been reported previously are marked by an asterisk in the Contents. (Author/BJG)",

        "description":"This report describes the third study in a program of research dealing with the relationships between the characteristics of human tasks and the abilities required for task performance. The goal of the program is to generate principles which can be used to identify ability requirements from knowledge of the characteristics of a task and of variations in the conditions of task performance. The study investigated the relationship between variations in a prototypic problem-solving task, concept identification, and consequent changes in the abilities related to problem-solving performance. Characteristics of the problem-solving task were manipulated by varying the formal difficulty and perceptual complexity of the problems. Subjects performed the criterion task under the different  experimental conditions, and then received a battery of reference tests designed to measure abilities which were hypothesized to relate to problem-solving performance. The test battery was factor analyzed to identify a reference ability structure. The loadings of the various criterion task conditions on that structure were then estimated. Results suggested that certain task variations change the nature of the task in such a way that subjects change their approach or strategy for dealing with the task. Such changes may require different ability profiles; thus they may account for changes in abilities related to performance as a function of changes in task characteristics. Further analysis is planned to examine the interactions of task variation, subject strategies, and ability profiles.  (Author/BJG)",

        "description":"Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT) Form M was constructed as a replacement for AFOQT Form L in Fiscal Year 1974. The new form serves the same purposes as its predecessor and possesses basically the same characteristics. It yields Pilot, Navigator-Technical, Officer Quality, Verbal, and Quantitative composite scores. Three sets of conversion tables are provided for examinees at the various educational levels where the test is adminstered. Standardization was accomplished by equipercentile conversion to composites of Project TALENT tests from a previous form which was adminstered to Air Force Academy candidates, and thence to the new form in a stratified sample of basic airmen. This strategy permits the new AFOQT scores to be related to Academy candidates and to 12th grade  males in the original Project TALENT study. Because recent operational data suggest that the AFOQT is becoming too difficult, a correction which was used prior to AFOQT-64 was reinstated. The correction is for the unusually high academic aptitude of the Academy candidate group, especially with respect to the quantitative domain. The correction primarily affects the Navigator-Technical, Officer Quality, and Quantitative composites and should lead to somewhat increased qualification rates without fundamentally changing the AFOQT normative base.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to determine if the attitudes of white adults attending training at the National 4-H Foundation were more negative toward blacks than they were toward whites and to determine if the Situational Attitude Scale (SAS) was a valid and reliable tool for measuring the attitudes of white adults toward blacks. The SAS is a combination of situations with racial overtones and semantic differential scales. The scale presents ten personal and social situations in which race might be a variable in reaction to the situation. For each situation ten bipolar semantic differential scales were written. Two forms of the SAS were developed. The instrument was tested for reliability using factor analysis on the 351 adults reported on in this study. Subjects were  approximately 40 percent male and 60 percent female. The study revealed that in some situations as identified in the SAS there is a significant difference in the attitudes of the white adults involved in this research. These attitudes were generally more negative toward blacks than they were toward whites. Significant factors related to these attitudes included the region of the country and the population density of the area of residence. Sex also may be a factor. Factors found not significant included age and the position in the organization held by the subject. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"Validity and reliability studies of the Bullen Reading Attitude Measure (BRAM) were conducted on 291 white children in twelve classes in two schools, grades one through six, in Fall River, Massachusetts. The instrument's validity was obtained by measuring the correspondence between respondents' answers given on the attitude subtests and their answers given during an interview and corroborated by answers given by parents in a mailed questionnaire. The reliability coefficients, determined by the test-retest method, were unusually high for attitude tests. The Bullen Reading Attitude Measure consists of subtests that measure different components of reading attitudes through the pair comparisons method. The primary pictorial form designed for children in grades one to three, measure  attitudes toward reading at home, reading in school, and desire to receive books as presents. The written form designed for children in grades four through six, measures the same components as the primary form and two additional components--desire to visit the library and to purchase books. A unique feature of the BRAM is that it enables the examiner to know the relative strength of an attitude as well as its magnitude. This information is useful to teachers, clinicians, and researchers because it enables them to identify children who express consistent negative attitudes, or inconsistent positive attitudes, which demand differential treatment.

As part of a ten-year longitudinal study of Vocational Development being conducted in the Department of Vocational Education at The Pennsylvania State University, it was decided to administer the GATB to an entire ninth grade class. Because both wooden and plastic pegboards were being used to assess GATB aptitude M, it was decided to compare the scores obtained on the two different types of boards. Results indicate that those students who were tested using the wooden boards performed significantly better than did the students tested on the plastic boards. Converted score  differences for aptitude M range from 3 to 26 points with an average difference of 11 points. Stimulated by the initial finding of an average difference of 11 points in aptitude M resulting from the use of plastic vs. wooden pegboards with ninth graders, Trimmer and Klein (1974) replicated the above described study using a sample of 238 adult applicants, including 70 Blacks, as part of routine employment testing in Nevada. In this study, an average difference of 10.5 points was observed. These findings raise serious moral, ethical and legal questions, and therefore it appears to be necessary to either establish norms for the plastic equipment or to discontinue its use. (Author/BJG)",

Study results point up important differences between the correlations obtained for the Mexican Americans and the Navajo on both the test scores and the ratings by teachers, parents and subjects. The I.Q. levels on the HNTLA correlated with WISC I.Q.'s significantly better for the Navajo sample than for the Mexican American; the same was true when the HNTLA median Learning Age was compared with the WISC median Test Age.

        "description":"The effects of arousal on verbal learning and memory are presently controversial. Investigators using different definitions of arousal, different tasks, and different methods have (as one would expect) produced different findings in the literature: (a) Arousal during acquisition leads to poor immediate but better delayed recall; (b) Arousal during acquisition sometimes facilitates immediate as well as delayed recall; (c) Arousal may lead to decrease in semantic clustering: (d) Arousal may facilitate recall for material in which \"order\" cues are salient: and (e) Arousal may lead to a convergence in decision criteria while at the same time increasing sensitivity for certain kinds of material. Instead of five separate explanations, the paper proposes to account for these effects by  a single explanatory model based on the effects of arousal on memory organization. A model, based on changes in the way material is organized for retrieval is developed which views arousal as facilitating memory when recall is based on the physical characteristics of stimuli and hindering recall when memory depends on the semantic aspects of the stimuli. The implications of this model for the research findings decribed in the literature are discussed. (Author)",

As in earlier years, percentile charts for male and female entrants as well as for the total tested group, comprising 79 percent of all UW freshmen are included for the use of academic advisors and counselors. The group studied is the first one admitted to UW under new admissions standards requiring the use of an academic aptitude test in determining admissibility. The distribution of the Admission Index (AI) values used in making admissions decisions is reported and the impact of the test requirement on tested aptitude of entrants discussed. It is tentatively  concluded that use of the AI and preferential admission of high aptitude students has led to a relative increase in the tested aptitude of the freshmen class. (Author/BJG)",

        "description":"While much has been written on the topic of criterion-referenced testing and consequently its comparison with norm-referenced testing, measurement specialists have not as readily approached the subject of the implications involved in reporting such test information. The purposes of this paper are to (1) draw distinctions between criterion and norm-referenced assessment; (2) delineate the purposes for which uses of test information are employed; and (3) evaluate the usefulness of criterion and norm-referenced measurement in providing the necessary data for each test information use. The six major uses of test information included in the study are: prognosis, diagnosis of learning difficulty, student growth, student achievement, program evaluation and research. The six uses of test  information outlined above constitute the basic requirement needs of measurement specialists. In an earlier work, Cronbach (1949), classified testing under three main headings: prognosis, diagnosis, and research; three additional uses of test information have been added: growth, achievement and program evaluation. Such an evaluation should hopefully provide school personnel with the understanding of the distinction between the types of information available from both criterion and norm-referenced testing. Such knowledge should help to promote the understanding that certain measurement information is better assessed by one type of assessment tool rather than the other depending upon the decision-making purpose in question.

The technique requires that each participating student respond to one of two questions, without revealing the one to which he/she is responding. The first question is neutral (e.g., Is the last digit of your student ID odd?); the other sensitive (i.g., Have you masturbated within the past two weeks?). The student is asked to choose a two-digit number (00-99) from a table of random numbers. Then, all students with numbers 00-69 are  told to answer the sensitive question, and all with 70 or above answer the neutral question. Thus, only the student knows the question to which she/he is responding. The procedure provides an interesting demonstration of the utility of a statistical procedure applied to a practical, health science problem. (Author/DEP)",

Experience gained over the past two years indicate that it can be used: (1) for screening; (2) for program evaluation; (3) as a guide to the teachers in identifying specific areas of development which may need remediation; (4) to alert teachers to areas of development which they should be aware of; and (5) to assess day care worker's effectiveness. Norms are available for six groups from 36 to 71 months of age (N = 1,040 children). The norms were developed from urban and suburban advantaged and disadvantaged males and females. Based upon the ratings of 125 children by two groups of raters (pairs of raters rated 15-20 children each independently),  the average of interrater correlation coefficient estimates was .74. The usual types of judgmental validity (constructor, user and face) have been obtained. More sophisticated statistical procedures have been used to indicate the predictive and inferential validity. The predictive validity was determined by a discriminant analysis. Inferential validity is indicated by noting that the mean score increases as older age groups are examined. These analyses indicate that the PRS can classify children as typical or non-typical with a high degree of accuracy. (Author)",

        "description":"The known interval scale, referred to as the 7.8 scale, has been criticized as an invalid measuring instrument in the form of an attitude scale. It is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that this scale can produce spuriously inflated correlation coefficients, high reliability, and false significance on statistical tests. The case will be made along two general lines. First, the effects of the scale on reliability, validity, and significance testing will be presented and second the reasoning behind the scale and the method for attaining its values will be discussed. It is concluded that increases in reliability and validity coefficients obtained with the 7.8 scale only confirm that by artificially extending the range of a scale it is possible to increase the correlation  coefficient. The application of the Jones and Thurstone scale to the 7.8 scale, whether transcribed correctly or incorrectly, happens to form a non-monotonic transformation, with resultant r and increased chance for significance, which makes the scale appealing on its surface. Reliability and validity, to be useful concepts, must be the reliability and validity of data gathering instruments rather than the reliability and validity of a particular set of scale values.

In this study, the implications of assuming interval level of measurement using various isomorphic monotonically increasing epistemic alternatives to a commonly used occupational status index was investigated in the following manner. (1) Simulated samples of 100 Duncan's Socio-Economic Index scores were drawn by generating random independent samples from normally distributed populations with different means. (2) The simulated SEI scores were transformed to correspond to six alternate assumptions about the nature of the pattern of intervalization. This resulted in seven isomorphic, monotonically increasing measures of  occupational status differing only in the pattern of intervalization. (3) The degree of divergency among epistemic models was determined by analyzing matrices of coefficients of epistemic error corresponding to the &quot;mean epistemic error&quot; between two given conceptualizations under the assumption that one conceptualization is used and the other conceptualization perfectly describes the theoretical construct. (4) The nature and magnitude of the measurement error introduced into path models by using different assumptions of intervalization was investigated by comparing simulated causal models involving occupational status using the alternative interval conceptualizations as one of the two independent variables.

Determination of how test results will be used should be made prior to test development or selection. Possible questions needing answers may include: Is the purpose of the test to provide justification for a grade? Will the data be useful in diagnosing pupil strengths and weaknesses? How do the results from this test compare with those in other areas? Why do some pupils perform less well in one area than in others? Are these results acceptable or can something be done to improve future performance?  Will the results aid in identifying pupils with special problems? Answers to the above questions may raise additional concerns for the test administrator and he may have to look to other information sources or devise other means to obtain relevant data on student performance. Before any formal testing gets underway, all available information on file should be reviewed to determine if additional data is necessary. To justify the test, it must be ascertained that more precise information is needed and that the data derived from the test will add something of significance to what is already known. (Author/BJG)",

Class means were factor-analyzed and four resultant components of teaching performance were submitted to a 2x2x2x2x3 MANOVA. Discriminant functions of significant main effects and interactions did not sustain popular faculty notions ascribing the highest student evaluations to so-called favorable characteristics. Recommendations were made for controlling bias through norming, revision of the rating instrument, and future areas of study.

The development of the instrument was derived from theoretical views of student-courses which suggested five dimensions. The dimensions included bases of power, positive classroom environment, personal meaningfulness, student self-evaluation and personal responsibility for learning, and commitment or personal involvement. Items were written for each dimension. The 25 item instrument was administered to 321 graduate and undergraduate students. A factor analysis resulted in five factors: 1 - personal meaningfulness; 2 - classroom environment involving interaction of teacher, group and individual; 3 - diffusion of power or influence; 4 - self-evaluation and responsibility  for learning; 5 - coercive power. The results tended to support the original factor structure with personal meaningfulness as the overriding factor. It was concluded that the instrument can be refined to provide a reliable and valid alternative method for teachers with student-centered course objectives. (Author)",

Is the emphasis these tests place on cognitive achievements a serious limitation? Because of the basic and pervasive role of cognition in human affairs, and in the absence of any good alternative, it is not. Should we replace norm-referenced tests with criterion-referenced tests? In certain areas of learning where they are particularly appropriate, yes. In general, no. Are the tests biased against minorities? There seems to be little basis for the belief that they are. Is the I.Q. a myth? The notion of a latent-trait I.Q. that strongly influences rate of learning or amount that can be learned ultimately probably is  a myth. In the absence of strong supporting evidence, it probably should be treated as a myth for the good of education and society. Finally, the competition engendered by testing seems distinctly more helpful than harmful. (Author)",

This position has been based on information about the discrepant meaning of GLEs from test to test and also upon certain technical characteristics of these scores that might make them unsuitable for research and evaluation purposes.

Odegaard, the recent Supreme Court case, and societal demands for increased numbers of minority professionals. These models of selection fairness are considered: Clary's regression model, Darlington's subjective regression model, the equal risk model of Einhorm &amp; Bass, Thorndike's constant ratio model, Cole's conditional probability model, and a new decision-theoretic utility model. Some formulations offer defensible theoretical positions, but all fail to provide a suitable basis for satisfying societal demands. It is concluded that all of these models would function better if the predictor were modified to include nonacademic measures. (Author)",

The purpose of this paper is to describe a process which when applied seems to facilitate the rational decision making processes of an institution's leadership. The process will get data into administrative thinking and decision making discussions. It enables the majority of persons serving in leadership positions to function as leaders. Basically, the process is not simply one of gathering data and reporting it to a body of decision makers. Rather, it involves the decision makers in the process of obtaining and utilizing appropriate information and influences their thinking processes. The process then is  formative as well as summative. The process is called a diagnostic review and self-study. The diagnostic review and self-study was developed expressly to meet the needs of voluntary organizations in periods of special crisis and decision as well as to facilitate a process of ongoing planning and decision making.

        "description":"Reporting the results of statewide assessment looms as a problem as more states pass from the planning to implementation phase in their assessment programs. When energies are focused on the purpose of the assessment, formulating objectives, and instrument construction, reporting takes a back seat because it happens last. There are some general principles to be followed in order to report effectively the results of a large scale assessment program. This paper begins with several recent references on how to report the results of large scale assessment programs. The remainder of this paper is intended to provide specific new thoughts for implementation of old principles. The ultimate success of state assessment programs will depend on how well assessment results are reported to  their various audiences. In this paper, the most compelling recommendations for improving reporting practices are plan ahead, develop different reports for different audiences, and field test report formats to determine the language and content that are most meaningful to respective audiences. Reporting should receive the same careful attention as instrument construction with sufficient opportunity for feedback from intended users. (Author/DEP)",

Norming procedures used in two of American College Test (ACT's) assessment programs for career guidance, the Assessment of Career Development and the Career Planning Program, Grades 8-11, are described for purposes of illustration. Norms for these programs are based on a three-stage nationwide probability sample of  32,000 8th, 9th, and 11th graders in 197 schools.

        "description":"This project determines the extent to which similarity of teacher and student structuring of class materials is related to student performance on tests covering the materials. Information about how student and teacher structure the materials was obtained through a matching test. During the second stage of the project, three alternative procedures were considered. In terms of the amount of information obtained per unit of time spent by subject, the following procedure was adopted. Fifteen statements were selected from each of the four sets of learning materials to be used in the study proper. Subjects were given a 15-page booklet in which a different one of the statements appeared at the top of each page. The remaining 14 statements appeared below, and the subject was asked to  check which of the 14 statements was similar in content to the statement at the top of the page. The results show that the particular teacher does not affect student achievement, that student reading facilitates achievement, as does teacher presentation, and that no teacher presentation is more important if students have had prior exposure to learning materials. Differences in agreement on classification of learning materials has no effect upon student achievement, on the average. However, the correlation between student categorizing of learning materials and teacher classification of learning materials is negative, indicating that student and teacher alike must view learning materials before student achievement is accelerated.

Data were collected on 911 juniors and seniors selected from a sample at 22 secondary schools in the San Antonio metropolitan area. The GT score was found to significantly relate to overall academic performance for 19 out of the 22 samples, with a median rho of 44. Results indicate that the level of relationship was not differentially affected by school-specific ethnic group composition, school expenditures or average teacher/pupil ratio. Neither the samples used nor conclusions presented in this study should be construed as representative of high schools throughout the  country. Since socio-economic levels represented in the various samples go from the highest to the lowest ranges, limited generalizations may be meaningful to other school districts with similar diverse populations. This is an initial report exploring the relationship between student performance on various ASVAB scales and various criteria in the civilian academic sector. Additional studies will further assess relationships across various grade levels, in differing types of training situations, and across different time spans. As such, this first study should be interpreted as a prelude to additional and more comprehensive analyses of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. (Author)",

Since the results of these tests are used to determine the education, economic, and social future of children, a harder look at the minority child's cultural background is essential. The problem of testing cannot be solved by recreating standardized tests for minority children which are based on old conceptions of intelligence and educational achievement. A radical change in the whole approach to testing and the generation of entirely different models of education and of testing is needed. The Program Assessment Pupil Instruction (PAPI) System is one step in an attempt to move in a new direction. The PAPI uses four  Piagetian-based measures: Cartoon Conservation Scales; Water Level Task; Figural Intersections Tests; and Serial Task. This system can be used with any child to produce educational program data, or data for program evaluation. Given the problems associated with testing, the PAPI system suggests one approach to the issue which speaks to the different needs of people within the educational community. (RC)",

Users are cautioned that 1974-75 represents the first time ASVAB percentile scores are to be computed around  empirically developed student norms rather than representative service derived mobilization population samples. As such, the data are not representative of the total available high school population, but do characterize actual test performance of students examined during the preceding year's test cycle. Additionally, where individual test score comparisons from one year to the next may be required, the 1974-75 ASVAB percentile reports will represent different levels of student performance over previous reports (i.e., prior to September 1974).

This report concentrates on tests that are referenced to literary skills important to an adequately functioning adult, such as life skills, coping skills, etc. Because functional literacy has frequently been defined in terms of a grade level equivalent or some other norm, adult reading tests referenced to a norm group are also included. A common set of 40 criteria categorized under four main headings are used: measurement validity, examinee appropriateness, technical excellence, and administrator usability. The report provides teachers and administrators in Right-to-Read and other adult education programs a reference for use in identifying and judging the value of tests available for  assessing adult functional literacy. To increase its utility as a reference, summaries of a number of tests designed for adults are included. The report consists of six major parts: (1) Problems in Defining and Measuring Literacy; (2) Test Identification; (3) Evaluative Criteria; (4) Test Reviews; (5) Test Evaluations; and (6) Summary. Because many tests of functional literacy are newly developed or still being developed, there may be tests which should have been--but could not be--included in this report. No one set of criteria is appropriate for judging all tests. Thus, these test evaluations must be interpreted with respect to the intended use of each test. (Author/RC)",

        "description":"Past research is held to indicate a consistent relationship between participation in interscholastic athletics and educational orientations. This research is said to focus specifically on the &quot;athletic success&quot;. Athletic success should be a stronger facilitator of the mobility attitudes of black youth, it is argued, because sports is fast becoming a viable avenue of mobility for blacks in the U.S. The data for this study come from a statewide probability sample of Louisiana high school seniors, collected in 1970. Variables incorporated in the analysis include socioeconomic status, scholastic performance, significant-other influence, athletic success, and educational aspirations. The results of a partial correlation and regression analysis are said to indicate that athletic  success is significantly related to the educational aspirations for only the black respondents. This finding, along with others, is considered to lead to the conclusion that the student-athlete role provides behaviors that lead to higher-status educational orientations primarily for black youth; white youths' aspirations appear to develop more so in terms of relationships posited in current models of status attainment. Some suggestions are presented which modify achievement models for black athletes, and several alternative research strategies are outlined. (Author/JM)",

        "author":["Banks, James A."],
        "description":"This paper asserts that neither the cultural pluralist nor the assimilationist ideology can adequately guide curriculum reform, and advocates the adoption of a pluralist-assimilationist ideology. The pluralist-assimilationist assumes that while the ethnic group and the ethnic community are very important in the socialization of individuals, individuals are strongly influenced by the common culture during their early socialization, even if they never leave the ethnic community. The primary goal of the curriculum, according to this ideology, should be to help children learn how to function more effectively within their own ethnic culture, within the wider common culture, and within other ethnic communities. The pluralist-assimilationist also assumes that ethnic minorities do have  some unique learning styles, although they share many learning characteristics with other children. It is held that curriculum reform must have several major goals: (1) to help individuals to clarify their ethnic identities and to function effectively within their own ethnic communities; (2) to discourage ethnic ethnocentrism; and (3) to help students to develop the ability to make reflective decisions so that they can resolve personal problems and undertake effective social action. Ethnic studies should be viewed as a process of curriculum reform. (Author/JM)",

Affirmative action is defined here as a comprehensive effort by an employer designed to: employ women and minority persons where they are under-utilized; include minority persons and women in all facets of the company's operations--from management to maintenance; increase company awareness of an interest in the whole of its community; and, insure that company policy toward equal opportunity is not negative, and not neutral--but positive. A model plan is detailed. It is asserted that the manual should be used by a company in developing its own affirmative action policy; that it incorporates quite specific and comprehensive policies and procedures, which, if  adopted and followed, should help a company move toward the goal of equal employment opportunity. Testing and other employee selection criteria are discussed. Several lists of Kentucky-based organizations which may be able to assist a company to recruit and hire minority and female persons are given, including: National Association for Advancement of Colored People; Urban Leagues; Official Human Rights Agencies, Unofficial Human Rights Agencies, Women's Groups, Community Action Commissions, Black Communication Media, State and Local Agencies, Schools, and Area Development Districts.

In 1968, the Act was amended to prohibit housing discrimination. In 1972, the coverage of the Act was extended to prohibit employment discrimination because of sex, and age between 40 and 65. The amendments of 1972 also removed exemptions in the earlier Act in the areas of public accomodations and housing and thereby provided even greater protection for the rights of citizens of the Commonwealth. The Kentucky Civil Rights Act is stated to contain several significant features. Some are similar to those found in other states' laws, or suggested by various authorities; some are new in civil rights  legislation. Features which are asserted to make the Act as strong as possible include the following: (1) the employment section applies to the State; (2) discriminatory advertising is prohibited in connection with employment, public accommodations, and real estate transactions; (3) the Commission can require the posting of notices by employers, employment agencies, labor unions, licensing agencies, public accomodations, and all real estate operations and apartments subject to the Act; and (4) commission members can initiate complaints. Nine other such features are also specified. (Author/JM)",

The Espanola Reading Centers is an exemplary remedial reading program, it is stated here. The  Student Tutors for Individualized Instruction project is located at Floyd Elementary School. The Educational Services Center was designed to provide poor rural school districts with needed services. The Cooperative Guidance Program serves all students and parents. The Parent-Kindergarten Liaison Program was begun in the Pecos Independent Schools during the 1972-73 school year. The Roswell Independent Schools Study focuses on the feasibility of extended school year plans. The Special Education Instructional Materials centers are located in four communities. (Author/JM)",

Four principal sources of information were available for this study: the literature on educational and psychological research, annual state level reports of Elementary Secondary Education Act Title 1 programs, scores from the annual California state testing program, and observations of operating projects. The findings of this report include the following: The present Federal strategy, it is held, is built on the expectation that treatment in preschool and primary grades makes unnecessary  special attention in later years. However, this is not the case. For a variety of reasons, many youngsters either do not attend or do not benefit from early programs. Even those who do well in early programs frequently regress to previous levels by the time they enter junior high school. Moreover adolescents--and in particular the disadvantaged--have special learning needs that cannot be met by early interventions. A new strategy, it is argued, is clearly required which will give greater attention to providing age-appropriate education throughout the school career of the disadvantaged students. (Author/JM)",

It is held that emphasis on inherited intelligence suggests such intervention strategies as grouping students by IQ and tailoring instruction to individual students. The \"culture of poverty\" approach stresses changing the sub-culture. It is asserted that school critics would argue for a strategy that would: (1) radically revise the instructional and administrative operation of the school; (2) eliminate compensatory type programs as mere \"add to\"  methods; (3) decentralize school systems; (4) require teacher sensitivity training programs; (5) develop \"schools without walls\"; and, (6) have local black school Boards hire teachers. Intervention strategies are discussed which would emphasize the need for: (1) increasing economic and social opportunities; (2) reforming institutional arrangements; and, (3) using black ghetto populations in self-help efforts.

It is noted that the intent of the legislation was to develop strategies for change at the local level by involving local populations in the planning and implementation of programs tailored to meet their social, economic, and educational needs. In Part One of this seven-part paper, the Philosophy of the Program, it is asserted that the anti-poverty program emerged out of a genuine commitment to a philosophy of man that is integral to a democratic society. Programs such as Community Action, Job Corps, Upward Bound, and Head Start are considered to have grown out of the Anti-Poverty Program and were manifestations of a democratic value system that esteems the individual and his potential  for contributing to the common good. These programs were directed at aiding the victims of poverty to gain basic mastery of needed skills in order to become economically self sufficient, achieve a sense of self-identity, and to grow in consciousness of social responsibilities. Subsequent parts of the paper focus on social orientation, components of the program, analysis of the methodology used to implement the program, analysis of strengths and weaknesses of the program, suggestions for improvement, and theoretical analysis of the program components.

        "description":"A two-year evaluation of William Glasser's Schools Without Failure (SWF) program was carried out in the New Castle School District in Pennsylvania. In the first year, ten elementary schools were paired on the basis of size, socioeconomic status, and past achievement of pupils. One school of each pair was randomly assigned to begin teacher-training and implementation of the SWF program; the other school of each pair became a control school, continuing to operate as it had in the past. In the second year of the study, both groups of schools received training in SWF methods and implemented the program. Data were collected and analyses performed to determine whether the effects of two years of the program were greater than the effects of one year, whether the second year of training  or the first year produced stronger changes, and how the effects of two years of the program differed from those which would have taken place in schools using a traditional program. Testing and observations were carried out at the beginning and the end of the first year of the study and at the end of the second year in both groups of schools. Measurements were taken of: pupil achievement; pupil, teacher, and parent attitudes; disciplinary referrals to principals; and interactions occurring in classrooms. (Author/JM)",

A survey was made of the 53 Ohio colleges of education through a questionnaire. Responses were received from 40 teacher training institutions in the State. The first question dealt with the specific training of the instructional staff in urban studies. Responses are interpreted as indicating the need for special studies and first-hand experiences in working with minorities and the disadvantaged. The number of years of teaching experience the faculty has had in urban schools with minority students was sought in the second question. Experiences of faculty beyond that of formal education  was sought in the third question. The fourth question inquired into the areas of study concerning urban education required of educational students. The focus of the fifth question was on the specific training in urban education required of all prospective teachers, while the sixth question focused on the courses pertaining to minorities required of all students. The use of outside resources on urban and minority education was covered in question seven. Seven other questions were included in the questionnaire. (Author/JM)",

Perspectives of accomodation and assimilation, minorities, cultural contact, social problems, conflict, and power can be used, it is asserted, to represent and explain various aspects of the social realities of history. Ethnicity is defined, here, as: (1) involving a past-oriented group identification emphasizing origins; (2) involving some conception of cultural and social distinctiveness; and, (3) relating to a component unit in a broader system of social relations. The latter includes internal relationships within nation-states, international relations, and interregional  organizations extending beyond the limits of nation-states; this may involve some nation states acting in some capacity beyond their own borders. It is proposed that ethnic and racial groups exist and change because certain individuals and groups have decided that something can be achieved by way of having them exist or change in particular ways. It is held that the relative advantages of scale, inequality, and equality provide incentives, as does accurate comprehension of social realities. (Author/JM)",

This plan was, it is reported, unanimously endorsed on November 7, 1973, by the Education Committee of the Detroit Education Task Force. There are, it is stated, three general goals to be fulfilled by LinC. The first of these is to increase the opportunities for high school aged youth to be involved in the solution of real problems in the real world as a recognized part of their education. The second goal is to modify the regular high school curricula to include options for field experience education in  community development. The third goal is to link high schools with their respective attendance area communities in the type of creative interface which results in educational excellence and community development. LinC is said to be a program of single semester full time, fully credited intensive involvement in out-of-the-classroom guided learning experiences focused on those needs and problems of the community which touch youth. All LinC activities are said to be carried out in teams or groups. (Author/JM)",

The findings of this research are summarized as follows: the informants, whether patients or normal members of the community, differ very little in their conception of mental illness; they distinguish two broad categories of mental illness &quot;craziness&quot;, similar to psychotic behavior, and &quot;nervousness&quot; or &quot;bad nerves&quot;, which could be categorized as psychosomatic or neurotic conditions; for both types of conditions there is believed to be a range of causative factors, supernatural or  natural: among the natural causes there are three major types - bilogical (e.g. alcohol, drug abuse, sexual excess, and malnutrition); psychological (e.g. excessive emotional suffering and excessive physical punishment in childhood); and social (e.g. working too hard and poverty); spiritualism, witchcraft and fate are believed to be the most important supernatural causes of mental illness; and, the latter become most clearly apparent as factors of importance when informants are asked about them in such a way that they are not obliged to speak directly about their own personal beliefs.

It is the fifth of a series of seven reports to be issued by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights describing the structure, mechanisms, and procedures used by the federal departments and agencies in their efforts to end discrimination against this nation's minority and female citizens. Among the general findings and conclusions of the report are the following. It is held that the federal effort to end employment discrimination has not been equal to the task; that there is no one person, agency, or institution which can speak for the federal government in this important area; existing civil rights laws were weakened as a  result of political compromises and do not provide an adequate framework within which federal agencies can operate; that the diffusion of authority for enforcement of equal employment mandates is one of the key reasons for failure of the government to mount a coherent attack on employment discrimination; and that efforts to coordinate the overall federal effort have been most discouraging. Specific findings are detailed in a section categorized according to department. An addendum to the main report focuses on the response of the Department of Labor to the contents of the report and the comments of the Commission on Civil Rights to that response. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Communications research and social science analysis are considered to have revealed several essential features in the communications environment of American citizens. The purpose of this article is to consider the way these features affect low-income members of society, particularly minorities living in urban areas. Communications networks in the U.S. are stated to be increasingly shaped by large-scale, highly organized systems in industry, government, education, and other social services. Within the networks, information is shared, problems are confronted, and policies are adopted which affect the lives of all citizens. Individuals and groups which do not have influence within the organizational communications networks will inevitably have unsatisfactory decisions imposed upon  them. Since the poor are considered to be effectively excluded from centers of power and control, they do not participate in the communications networks. The poor are also said to be isolated from the important communications networks by a language barrier. It is held that researchers have found that the poor lack meaningful information and knowledge. Although the operation of communication networks attached to educational and social service organizations in low-income communities is considered open to question, it is asserted that opportunities for improving communications networks are many.

        "description":"This paper asserts that most of the urban and suburban schools are racially and ethnically isolated. Consequently, what are needed are curricula suited to a culturally diverse population which does not attend culturally and ethnically diverse schools. Thus, one issue requiring examination, it is stated, is the extent to which curricula are similar or different for culturally diverse student populations in contrast to culturally homogeneous groups. A definition of cultural pluralism proposed by the National Coalition for Cultural Pluralism suggests curricular strands that deal with (1) ethnic and cultural awareness of one's own identity, (2) understanding of other cultures, and, (3) awareness of the nature of racism and sexism as these affect individual and group behavior. It is a  definition which has implications for both cognitive and affective development of the individual. While it is held that schools must certainly do a far more effective job in the basic skills areas, an education for a culturally pluralistic society must have a broader focus which deals with affective and cognitive development, with personal and interpersonal skills, and with an understanding by the individual of who he is and how he relates to others. Changes are considered to be needed in content, strategies, resources-but most of all in the people who create the conditions for curriculum and instruction. (Author/JM)",

        "description":"Using either an individuals' socioeconomic or ethnic status to predict his prospects for academic achievement or future employment is considered likely to be inaccurate and perhaps even immoral. The action implications of present socioeconomic and ethnic patterns of goal attainment are said to be in dispute. In order to contemplate the value of different actions, it is held necessary to get past the labels \"middle class\" and \"lower class\", \"black,\"\"white,\"\"nonwhite,\" and so on, to specific causal processes; it must first be recognized how labeling is itself one of the crucial processes involved in the relationship of social class and ethnicity to goal attainment. Several themes of current research are said to suggest the value of going beyond labels. For instance, a child born  into a family without the characteristics associated with its socioeconomic or ethnic category has a different prospect for goal attainment from that of the typical child of that category, provided that child has not been categorized in a way that blocks this prospect. The processes associated with lower status groups are not considered necessarily of an inferior type. It is asserted that, given that social processes reinforce on another, only the most fundamental social intervention could be expected to alter seriously the life prospects of the typical individual of a given group in American society today.

In no other area than that of suspensions has it been considered so easy for principals and teachers to take advantage of ambiguity in school rules and discriminate against minority children. Data from a Children's Defense Fund survey are said to show that, at the high school level, black students are suspended three times as often as white students, and Puerto Rican students, twice as often. Indefinite suspension, it is stated, is not the only way of forcing blacks out of the  regular school system. An equally effective tactic is to place a suspended student in a \"special\" school within the system. Many school systems group students on the basis of standardized tests (often given during early elementary school) or teacher evaluations of academic performance, thus separating black and white students. It is noted that unofficial exclusion is the process by which school officials manage to keep non-white students out of \"white\" activities. For school officials anxious to combat this situation, any number of practical measures are held to be available. (Author/JM)",

Data show that after-tax earnings for the 30 million persons surveyed rose in 1973 by 5.8 percent but fell 0.4 percent after adjustment for consumer price increases (real after-tax earnings). Variations depended on sex and type of family head. Real after-tax earnings for husbands heading four-person families rose 1.6 percent, but for women who headed families real after-tax earnings dropped nearly 4 percent. Tables display (1) gross median earnings, 1963, 1972 and 1973, (2) after-tax median earnings, 1963, 1972, and 1973, (3) real after-tax median earnings, 1963, 1972, and 1973, (4) gross median earnings, 1963-1973, (5)  after-tax median earnings, 1963-1973, and (6) real after-tax median earnings, 1963-1973 (1967 dollars). All tables refer to household heads who are nonsupervisory production workers (clerical, sales, blue-collar, and service excluding private household work) and to family type and size. (MDW)",

The project directed its focus on three particular areas: in-service training of teachers and administrators; public awareness and involvement; and teacher/student participation in the infusion of career education activities. The report concludes that the major accomplishment thus far has been the actual implementation of a career education program and its acceptance by students, teachers, parents, and other community members; this acceptance is deemed crucial to the successful establishment of such a program. The report includes 208 pages of appended materials, including: a bibliography; relevant  forms, tests, questionnaires, and correspondence; career education newsletters; information on teacher/administrator workshops and conferences; resource materials and activities (36 pages); suggested scope and sequence; a sample of part of the English curriculum (41 pages); and a third-party evaluator's report (64 pages). The report of the evaluator (Educational Planning and Evaluation Services of Magnolia, Arkansas) includes statistical information on the students and personnel and on the results of both student and teacher tests; it also presents a specific summary of its findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

Background information on the project and a description of its progress, including the need for consultants, tools, and aides, are presented. Highlights of the project were performances for guests. The Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) and the Hospital Adjustment Scale (HAS), though somewhat unsuitable for the project, were chosen as measurement instruments to be administered to determine quantitative improvement. Results of the HAS ranking indicate the music activities did not influence scores in communications and relations with others,  nor in care of self and social responsibility. Improvements were noted in work activities and recreation and overall hospital adjustment scores. The WRAT results indicated no difference in treatment groups in reading, spelling, and arithmetic. Summary statements by program personnel describe the music activities and their beneficial aspects for the Home's residents. Nearly three-quarters of the document consists of appendixes providing a pictorial review and detailed progress reports submitted weekly by the two teachers from September, 1971, to June, 1973.

Your action and direction bridge the gap between the government and the individual and hence your role has a wide scope and your functions are not easily defined. Similarly, your actions, more so than those of any other groups in the country, build, or at times unfortunately destroy, a basic trust in our system of law and government. Stressing the wider aspect of the law enforcement profession, however, does not mean to ignore the pressing nature of your central duties to prevent crime by emphasizing the swiftness and certainty of punishment. It is important for the Department of Justice,  with your assistance, to establish a tone of fairness in law enforcement, so that many Americans will no longer believe that the law is being enforced for the sake of the people who created it rather than for the sake of the social good. By your conduct and skill--and hopefully in part by virtue of what you have learned at the FBI academy--I am sure you will show the people of America that they may trust in the law and in you.

        "description":"The May, 1974, bulletin issued by the Civil Service Commission deals with job restructuring, the process of realigning job duties to develop technician-type or \"bridge\" jobs in Federal agencies, as a means to provide upward mobility for employees. Besides being highly beneficial to employees in dead end jobs at low grade levels, job restructuring planning can tie in with broader organizational concerns and become a continuous process built into the personnel system. Job restructuring consists of six elements: (1) task statements of work, (2) job descriptions of bridge positions, (3) qualification requirements, (4) selection methods, (5) training plan, and (6) training agreement with the Civil Service Commission. Some obstacles to job restructuring for upward mobility are related  to a lack of full management commitment, management practices incompatible with upward mobility goals, attitudes toward minorities and women, misconceptions of job restructuring and upward mobility, and credentialism and professionalism unrelated to job duties.

        "description":"Thinking of technology and media in relation to a concept of lifelong learning requires a shift in perceptions of learning systems in the direction of increased innovation. Two limitations in current definitions of technology and media which must be overcome in future definitions are: (1) seeing them as contemporary phenomena which sprang from nowhere, and (2) seeing them merely as mechanical devices without regard to the process of interaction which their use imposes on the learner. The application of technology and media to lifelong learning requires a rationale on the part of both teachers and learners to enable them to understand the effects created by media and technology over their lives. The United Kingdom's Open University has developed a rationale based on human concerns  which coordinates the efforts of teachers and BBC production personnel in reaching a large audience of working adults, but the learner needs to develop a rationale for using technology in self-determined learning projects. ERIC relates directly to the relationship between media and lifelong learning because it provides the kind of interaction between the learner and the computer which encourages systematic and logical thinking, and which permits the learner to become increasingly independent and sophisticated in the pursuit of lifelong learning.

The problem of fluidity is inseparably linked with the problem of adaptation to the work organization. The occupational stability of workers is affected by the type and conditions of their work, which are determined by a complex of objective and subjective factors and their interaction. Objective factors include: type of scientific institution and rank in the profession, length of service, and age. A combined analysis of these factors reveals that the highest stability index is in the 40-45 age group and the lowest in the 25-30 age group. Subjective factors influencing worker stability include wishing to realize career plans by transferring to another institution, questions of promotion and  pay, and working conditions. Men's and women's motives for transfer are identical, although their coincidence of motives varies. Correlation analysis shows that stability depends most on age, nature of work with respect to ability, and the prospect of promotion. In sum, efforts should be made to eliminate excessive occupational mobility among scientists in the interest of increasing scientific efficiency. (JR)",

The assessment center, the central feature of the classification model, is designed to be conducted at that time just prior to most inmates being assigned to training programs, and is thus labeled a \"Mid-Sentence Career  Development Center.\" Offenders would be placed in a variety of behavioral simulations to reveal a profile of strengths and weaknesses to a staff composed of professionals and prison officials. Prior to release, inmates would be scheduled for a \"Pre-Release Career Development Center,\" designed to provide inmates with critical job seeking skills and to continue the life work planning program begun earlier. An evaluation design is included. A site visit protocol form, descriptive data from an inmate survey, information on the assessment center, life planning activities, and a discussion of work samples are appended. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"The Federally-sponsored research and development project centered on the current state of participatory management programs in correctional institutions. Questionnaires were mailed to all adult institutions known to have some form of council or committee structure. On-site visits conducted at several institutions included: large and small; male, female, and coed; those having councils and those having committees; and those representing various geographical regions of the United States. Interviews were held with administrators, staff, and inmates where possible. Council members were interviewed and, when allowed, council meetings were observed. There is confusion and misconception about participatory management and no differentiation in the literature based upon typological  categories. The prevailing assumption in penological circles that &quot;inmate government&quot; is a corrupting, dysfunctional modality for prison management is based almost entirely upon examples which are not participatory management as discussed in this project. Inmate councils have come into existence mainly in response to a crisis rather than as a treatment program of self-responsibility. Although there is some evidence to indicate measurable, positive effects of shared decision-making, there is no evidence of research or evaluation to assess the effects of participatory management on either the institutions or the participants.

A variety of suggestions for orientation, career exploration, and implementation of the occupational model plan are presented in the teacher's handbook. Using instruction packets (kits comprising materials collected from actual businesses) the teacher, in the role of office supervisor, conducts simulations which can substitute for or enrich the cooperative office experience. Thus, teachers wishing to implement a program of occupational  models must develop packets relevant to businesses in their own areas. Using the occupational model, office education classes may be organized under the individualized instruction plan, the rotation plan, the battery plan, the supplementary plan (with cooperative work experience), and the full-scale simulated office plan. Tips for various types of organization are offered, and directions are provided for setting up a full-scale simulation.

A teacher's manual giving tips on implementing the program was also developed. The models were designed to provide high school students with a realistic introduction to a variety of office work and were based on the work experiences of 86 employees in 69 North Dakota offices. The models were field-tested statewide on 325 students (of whom 282 responded to an evaluative questionnaire at the conclusion of the project). The project found that the models can be used in vocational office education programs of any size, can supplement previous education and occupational guidance, can supplement or substitute for cooperative work  experience, are useful for the student of less-than-average ability, and can be used regardless of available facilities and equipment. Appendixes detail the mechanics of data gathering, the writing and development of the models, and the field testing and evaluation of the project. There is a brief description of each model, including its degree of difficulty for the student and recommended equipment for its use. Relevant correspondence, questionnaires, and evaluation forms are included. (PR)",

Teachers were asked to indicate the degree of competence, on a scale of zero through seven, which they felt an ABE teacher should have, compared to what they did have, on a list of 170 competencies in the Inventory. Results of the survey, related to the competency ratings and to local problems, are tabulated and discussed. Recommendations directed to planners of staff development activities in the Virgin Islands are made in the four general categories of pre-service training, teacher  preparation; in-service training; teacher certification in adult basic education; and ongoing and periodic assessment of training needs.

The purpose of this study is to determine the most effective data collection method by examining the rate and nature of responses and the cost of three methods--personal interview, mailed questionnaire, and telephone survey. The study disagrees with previous research indicating that the mailed questionnaire is the most appropriate method. A comparative analysis of the three methods of conducting a follow-up study of former high school students at the Skyline Career Development Center (CDC) was designed to compile and design survey instruments, to incorporate and document the appropriate  methodologies, and to obtain meaningful information on graduates and dropouts to provide a basis for program alteration. From the evaluation of cost, data analysis, findings, and interpretation, it was found that telephone surveys combined with mailed questionnaires elicited a higher and more critical response rate at less cost for both small and large districts. For best results, recommended basic procedures are: accurate identification of the student population, careful use of clerical personnel, and goal-oriented instrumentation. (JB)",

Analysis of the job histories of workers at two plants found advancement opportunities to be limited and inequitable because narrow departmental units were used as the basis for defining eligibility for promotions. Through the use of task analysis a Career Progression System was designed to redefine the eligibility pools for promotional decisions in accord with common skill requirements. Efforts to implement the CPS were only partially successful due to collective bargaining agreement constraints coupled with the economic downturn. General conclusions were: (1) Collective bargaining agreements are a major instrument for structuring the internal labor markets of  large unionized firms and interventions must be designed to confront this reality. (2) Employees in large industrial firms often lack adequate information about promotional opportunities outside their particular department. (3) Implementation of Career Progression systems can be hampered by the employer's desire to utilize only those programmatic elements which affect productivity. (4) Government sponsored intervention should have well-defined objectives beside improved productivity and should avoid partial implementations which do not further these goals. (Author/BP)",

It considers the broad alternative systems of conscription and voluntarism and develops models of demand and supply for military labor to show how these are affected by the choice of procurement system. Empirical applications are made using evidence from Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and the United States. Evaluation of the alternative systems in the peacetime context is made in terms of allocative efficiency, distributional effects, adjustment flexibility, and issues of social control. Although the budget cost of a volunteer force is usually greater than that of a drafted one, it was found that a peacetime draft of a professional standing military would impose real economic costs not present in the volunteer  system. The volunteer force would better serve the distributional criterion of equity and could be supplemented by a draft for reserves, possibly lottery, and a stand-by draft for major expansion. In general, findings favored an all-volunteer recruitment for active duty in peacetime. Appendixes tabulate and identify data. (Author/MDW)",

This contradiction is the persistent tendency of the estimated effect of unemployment on labor force participation--and hence estimates of \"hidden unemployment\"--to be greater when cross section data based on Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA) aggregates are used than when economy-wide time series data are used. The hypotheses put forward to explain this contradiction are: (1) that the cross section estimates are biased as the result of labor force heterogeneity across SMSA's; and (2) that the problem of mutual determination of labor force participation and unemployment is a  much more likely cause of spurious correlation between these two variables in the cross section than in the time series data.

        "description":"Findings of a three-year project carried out by the Ohio Cooperative Extension Service of Ohio State University indicated that area agent staffing in Extension may result in professional workers being more satisfied with their jobs and feeling more meaningfully involved in the organizational hierarchy. The role conflict that might be expected when a new role is introduced may not occur. Of the two major area staffing patterns in use in the United States, the better rated was the pattern that included three separate levels of workers--county, area, and State. The lower rated pattern involved workers at two levels only--multi-county and State. The county-only pattern was not rated poorly. In several ways it was rated by clientele as better than either area staffing pattern.  County-only staffing pattern clientele were more satisfied with programing processes, with speed of response to requests for information, and with the helpfulness of the information they received from Extension. Statistical data are analyzed in tabular form and in the text. (Author/MDW)",

And there is scattered but compelling evidence that, under certain conditions, the technique can lead simultaneously to both improved productivity and an increase in the quality of employee work experiences. Yet observations of on-going job enrichment projects in a number of organizations suggest that the approach is failing in practice at least as often as it is succeeding--and that its future as a strategy for personal and organizational change may be bleak. The report (1) explores a number of frequently-observed errors in implementing job enrichment that can lead to \"failures\" of the technique, and (2) identifies a number of ingredients found to be common to  most of the \"successful\" job enrichment projects that were observed.

The evaluation process requires five steps. First, the project is described with respect to statements about the original problem situation and demographic conditions of the community prior to the project. Second, the Fields (the project actors) are identified and described. Third, Critical Incidents (events judged as essential to the continuation of the project) are identified and described. Fourth, the Fields are asked to identify and describe Critical Incidents according to a six-category Phase designation (pre-identification of needs, need identification, objective setting, planning,  action, and assessment and monitoring of effects). Fifth, the data collected are plotted on descriptive matrices in which the three variables (Fields, Critical Incidents, and Phases) illustrate patterns of Field participation, patterns of shared change, and patterns of individual Field change; data may also be arranged in a time-line display of Critical Incidents. An appended case study describes a field test of SHAPES in a community development program in Williams, Arizona, and provides visual demonstrations of the matrices and time-line display of step five.

To secure information, a descriptive survey was conducted in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. A welder and welding supervisor in each of 58 responding industries filled out an in-depth questionnaire; the respondents represent both large and small industries hiring from 4 to 600 welders. Questionnaires filled out by 12 American Welding Society regional presidents assured the study greater validity. The questionnaire consisted of 36 questions divided into five sub-divisions: general information, basic education, welding-related knowledge requirements, welder-related skills and functions, and the manipulative skills required for a production  welder. The analysis of the questionnaire is provided question-by-question within each section of the study, with the necessary data tabulation provided and referenced. Eleven recommendations for curriculum development emphasize the need for area surveys of needs, school-industry cooperation, development of an occupational ladder, more cooperative work-experience programs, and instruction of experienced welders to enable them to become on-the-job trainers of new welders. Extensive appendixes include copies of the questionnaires, information about and remarks made by the respondents, and a list of industrial concerns. (AJ)",

Using sequential sampling procedures, copies of 531 items typed by 100 beginning office workers were compared with 943 production problems in two high school typing textbooks. Industry tasks contained more rough draft typing, self-composition problems, correspondence requiring judgment placement and formating, and more extensive use of carbon paper than textbook typing assignments. Industry letters were also shorter and contained more subject and attention lines. Errors were nearly always corrected, most often by use of  correction paper. The readability levels of the textbook problems were significantly different from each other and from industry typing. (Author)",

Since an examination of teaching effectiveness should be considered in the teacher certification process, the study focused on determining the effects of trade experience, teaching experience, and formal professional education on the classroom teaching performance of vocational industrial education instructors. The ratings from five sources are simultaneously analyzed. Four hundred fifty-three trade and industrial education instructors were identified from the records of full-time trade teachers in Virginia. Using a stratified random sampling technique, 72 instructors were selected and  evaluated by one school administrator, one school division supervisor, two teacher-peers, one self-rating, and one class of students taught by the instructor. Of the 432 rating packets mailed, 406 (94 percent) were returned. The results are presented in tabular form. The analysis of the data indicates that years of teaching experience were not emphasized by any group of raters, while trade experience was emphasized by administrators and teachers themselves. Trade experience and professional education did not contribute to teaching effectiveness from the point of view of students, teacher-peers, nor when all five rating groups were combined. (JB)",

Participants from a seven-State area also represented the four areas. Symposium proceedings consisted of seven presentations and the moderators' reports of panel discussions. Presentations were: &quot;Career Education--More Than Just Educators&quot; (U. S. Office of Education senior program officer); &quot;The Role of the Chamber of Commerce in Career Education&quot; (Chamber of Commerce of the U. S. executive); &quot;Program Articulation and the Career Lattice Concept&quot; (community college president); &quot;Competency Based Education and Criterion Referenced Measures&quot;  (vocational-technical school associate director); &quot;Labor's Manpower Arm&quot; (AFL-CIO Human Resources Development Institute area representative); &quot;Cooperative Education and the World of Work&quot; (cooperative education coordinator); and &quot;Careers in Environmental Protection (U.

Delivery systems which might replace traditional approaches, sometimes at no greater cost, are: (1) educational voucher systems--prisoners fulfilling certain requirements would be guaranteed bona fide educational opportunities, outside the constraints of the prison environment, (2) prison as a specialized learning center--each prison would specialize in a single  occupational cluster, with prisoners assigned by education and training requirements, (3) educational technology centers in prisons--offering a wider course range and permitting greater flexibility in scheduling, (4) establishment of correctional school districts--making available budget, staff, and materials normally provided to an operating school district, (5) educational diagnostic and referral centers--residential correctional facilities in which security is not the first priority, and (6) use of community colleges--facilitators in the delivery of services necessary to divert the first offender from commitment to a correctional institution.

The system's purpose is to improve career choices and training opportunities. CIS enhances the efforts of agencies and schools by synthesizing labor market and educational information; developing and managing delivery systems; and consulting on the use of career information in counseling and instructional programs. CIS operates as a cooperative, controlled and supported by the agencies it serves. Essentially, the report is an effort to aid others who  may attempt such statewide efforts. The response of students and clients and the results of pilot tests indicate the system's effectiveness with diverse populations. The seven chapters discuss the research, the CIS system, information development in detail, the necessary features of a career information delivery system, analyzed through a review of the literature, several types of services, the impact on users, and financial considerations. Appended materials include: the constitution, user service agreement, standards, organizational sources, a library classification system, forms, and a glossary. (JB)",

Unfortunately, traditional methods and procedures may not permit teacher educators to attain the level of effectiveness to which they aspire. One of the alternatives to traditional practices is competency-based teacher education (CBTE). The five elements that appear to distinguish CBTE from other programs relate to: student competencies; criteria for assessing competencies; assessment of the student's competency; the student's rate of progress; and the intention of the instructional program. CBTE appears to be under strong consideration by a number of States and their respective colleges and universities; however, vocational teacher educators are somewhat slower than other  groups with regard to setting up CBTE programs. Current indications are that a number of vocational teacher education institutions are designing and implementing CBTE programs. In plotting the future prospects for CBTE, the following areas seem to surface as being of primary import: idealistic versus realistic goals, certification, program, and long range impact. (Author)",

One is the content, the information intended. This is the area of competence in communication. The other involves the attitude of the supervisor toward the person to whom the information is directed. This aspect is always communicated--intentionally or unintentionally, knowingly or unknowingly. The highly competent supervisor can be almost a total failure for lack of compassionate communication. We are more generally aware of how to develop competence in people than we are of how to develop compassion in people. There are skills of compassion which can be taught and learned, just as there are skills of  competence. Among these skills are: being open to one's own feelings; being constructively honest with other people, as well as to yourself, about what your feelings are; being open to and communicating positive feelings of love, appreciation, respect, and warmth; and being able to manage one's own thoughts and feelings so as to truly listen to another person. Competence and compassion together produce the greatest satisfaction for all concerned. (Author)",

Prevalent career education program dimensions include: self, occupational information, psychology of work, organizational, social contribution, planfulness, work ethics, school-work relationship, occupational preparation, and work adjustment. Central to the implementation of the career education concept are the roles of teachers,  counselors, and vocational educators, with business and industry personnel and parents also playing vital roles. In the area of evaluation, currently accepted guidelines involve: goals, criteria, participants, feedback and follow-through, and planned continuous process. Various evaluation models are described--cost-effectiveness approach, outcome approaches, and local assessment techniques. Recommendations for Mississippi include provision for: adequate funding of education, pre-service and in-service training of educators, adequate counselors, continued expansion of comprehensive educational programs, and local system support in a statewide commitment.

The first section introduces the problem, summarizes factors affecting labor mobility, and discusses implications for manpower and educational planners. It emphasizes that criteria must be established so that the most efficient means of allocating resources and effort are used in manpower planning and in developing educational and training programs. Several criteria are discussed: market, social demand, rate of return, and manpower requirements. Also described are labor mobility and its impact on manpower and  occupational education planning in the United States, as well as various approaches to planning (employer surveys, extrapolations of trends, econometric techniques, and the job vacancy-occupational outlook). The following section focuses on the central issue of geographic labor mobility and its determinants. The mobility of Negroes and agricultural workers is also examined. The conclusions stress the strengthening of the planner's role in developing training and educational programs, providing job opportunities, and other relevant services.

[Vocational evaluation has been defined as the process of assessing an individual's physical, mental, and emotional abilities, limitations, and tolerances in order to predict his current and future employment potential and adjustment. It is interdisciplinary and involves data from within and outside the total rehabilitation team.] A project overview introduces the articles. Four articles examine the role of the vocational evaluator: ideology and self-concept, task analyses, definitions of knowledge and skills, and training. Examining the evaluator's tools, five  articles explore two evaluation methods: work samples and situational assessment. Also discussed are the evaluator as synthesizor and building new self-concepts in the client. Four articles on human dynamics concentrate on the relationships of the evaluator with the client, the counselor, other professionals, and the facility staff. Four articles focus on the delivery system: referral decisions, vocational evaluation in various milieus, active client involvement in rehabilitation, and the controversy over the validity and use of vocational evaluation.

        "description":"The report presents the results of the third phase of a research program to develop a behavioral taxonomy of undergraduate pilot training (UPT) tasks and skills. The third phase effort consisted of surface analyses of 50 UPT flying training tasks to generate basic task descriptions. The surface analysis subdivided and defined task elements into a series of cue, mental action, and motor action sequences. A set of classification rules was developed to categorize the skills needed to perform the tasks identified by the surface analysis information. The classification rules were used to classify all the surface analyses. The skills required to accomplish the tasks were determined and organized into a matrix system of skill data. The matrix system selected provided the means for  simple data retrieval operations. The result was to develop the surface analysis method in order to analyze future UPT objectives in terms of present and future flying training requirements and to develop four applications of the taxonomic data system to flying training research problems. The illustrative examples dealt with skill comparisons among different tasks, the determination of skill difficulty within and between tasks, developing standard training tasks and generating new training tasks to teach specific flying skills.

For the administrator and coordinator, the manual outlines the key steps for the utilization of community resources: gaining top administrative support, designation of coordinator of school-community relations, internal planning, development of a resource directory, gaining support of building principals and teachers, creation of general advisory committees, and the formation of an industry-education alliance.  For the teacher, there are guidelines for the effective use of community resource volunteers in the planning, contacting, preparing, and evaluating steps. Suggestions for class discussion, checklists for career field visits and field trips, and ideas for follow-up experiences are presented. Sample forms for collection, preparation, and evaluation of resources and a bibliography complete the manual. (JB)",

A set of seven recursive equations links the UI policy variables to the variables which represent supply and demand in the labor market, with special attention being given to the specification of the pivotal equations for insured unemployment and UI exhaustions. An analysis of these equations indicates that  the chances of a worker finding a job diminish rapidly the longer the worker has been unemployed, and that UI leads to a small increase in the average duration of unemployment, but that the increase has only a small effect on the aggregate unemployment rate. Five alternative UI systems are simulated, each created by revising one of the key provisions of the existing law. The simulations are related to the determination of optimal UI policies.

        "description":"The Vermont study details employer responses to a two-phase survey designed to gauge employer receptivity to the use of wage subsidies in the private sector. The &quot;mail survey&quot; obtained from a sample of 1,084 employers (of whom 71% responded) elicited responses to a limited number of questions, while the &quot;face-to-face survey&quot; asked a much greater number of more in-depth questions of a sample of 269 employers (of whose responses 249 were useable). The study details conditions under which employers would be willing to participate in a wage subsidy program (worker characteristics, job characteristics, subsidy characteristics, post-subsidy commitments, administrative considerations, training concerns, and supportive service concerns), characteristics of firms willing to participate  (types, sizes, and occupational makeup), and judgmental aspects of wage subsidy programs (bidding process effectiveness, internal labor market considerations, competitive advantage, and net increase in jobs). Survey data are displayed in 36 tables and the survey instruments are appended. (Author/JR)",

The study attempted to contact and interview the 609 participants who had completed or terminated Special Work Training prior to June, 1973, in order to determine their employment status and public aid recipient status at 9, 12. 18, 24, and 30 months subsequent to SWP. At each follow-through contact, completers were significantly more likely to be employed than were terminators (69% of completers versus 44 percent of terminators). Among all 486 trainees located and interviewed, there was a  significant decrease in persons receiving public assistance, from 58 percent to 32 percent, between the time of entry into SWP training and the follow-through contact nine months subsequent to training. The study also describes hourly wage experience over time, types of employment, characteristics of trainees, and trainees' perception of project value. Twenty-two detailed tables are included, and additional project data is appended. (Author/JR)",

The study evaluates vocational programs in office occupations and distributive, agricultural, trade and industrial, and home economics occupations education in 18 schools in 13 county and one city school system in Tennessee. On-site evaluation data were converted to numerical ratings according to the 60 elements of the Ray instrument by a panel of experts and were statistically compared, element by element, to numerical ratings on the Ray instrument completed by the local school professionals. Since the professionals and the  panel of experts agreed on only 3 of the 60 elements, the study concludes (among other things) that information obtained from currently used instruments for on-site evaluations by visiting teams was not adequate to determine relative quality of vocational-technical programs. Several recommendations for improving the Ray instrument as a profitable evaluation device are included. Ten pages of appendixes include Ray's components for quality vocational-technical programs, the Ray Self-Checklist, and a Tennessee map of school systems involved in the study. (JR)",

        "description":"In order to ensure that man keeps step with the changes in the world it is necessary to continue the learning process throughout adulthood. Although many authorities see obsolescence as the only alternative to continuing education, some authorities and professions are beginning to speak of mandatory adult education. Since adult education is based on the precept of the adult learner as a volunteer, the basic philosophy of adult education is attacked when it becomes compulsory. Furthermore, regulation raises questions of who will regulate and what criteria will they use. Whether compulsory or not, however, there is a need for the revitalization of adult education, a process which will have to originate in the education profession. To this end the North Central Association's  standards for adult high schools provide a step in the right direction. Now, when elementary and secondary school enrollments are dropping, it might be opportune to deflect some educational resources into adult continuing education rather than have the funds eliminated from educational budgets. Although the task of continuing education for adults may forever remain unfulfilled, all educators must do everything in their power to help adults meet their educational needs now and in the future.

In most cases the guidance counselor contacted the graduates, their parents, or reliable relatives or friends and completed the survey instrument. In all, 834 (96.98 percent) of the graduates responded; of these, 50.1 percent were employed, 48.6 percent were continuing their education in a postsecondary institution, 4.5 percent were in the armed forces, 4 percent were homemakers, and 6.3 percent were unemployed or seeking employment. A higher percentage of the males than the females were employed; a higher percentage of the females than the males were continuing  their education. Most employed graduates indicated they were trained on the job; only 16 percent stated that their high school trained them for their employment. Of the 108 respondents who had registered with their school placement service, only 7.9 percent indicated that it (or their guidance counselor) helped them find employment (53.3 percent stated they had not been helped to find employment).

Data for the study were obtained by means of two mailed instruments: one administered to 1,032 cooperative program graduates in May 1974, and the other to 677 employers in June 1973. The respective returns were 59.1% and 75.9%. Graduate information was calculated and tabulated with respect to employment status, mobility and migration, employment profile, wages, preparation for employment, most beneficial contribution of the program, teacher coordinator characteristics, and recommendability of the program to others for the program areas of agribusiness, office, distribution, health, home economics, trade and industry, and interdisciplinary. Employer  information was likewise calculated and tabulated with respect to employment setting, assessment of student trainee, preparedness of student trainee, cooperative education processes, employer's views of coordinator's expertise, and employer's assessment of programs. The data emphasize the important role of the coordinator in the cooperative program and the exceptionally high level of acceptance of the cooperative education method. (JR)",

The first section contains the introduction to the problem, summary of factors affecting labor force participation, and implications for manpower and occupational education planners. In the second section, the authors outline two alternative models of labor market functioning and present an historical accounting of manpower and educational planning. Some manpower forecasting methods are reviewed as attempts to understand labor force behavior over time. The third section reviews the literature with particular reference to factors influencing the work  decisions of: (1) women (marital status, earnings, education, presence of children, school attendance, training, education, and labor demand), (2) whites and minority groups (Negro and Spanish American), (3) older persons, and (4) people of varying educational attainment. Labor force turnover is examined briefly and conclusions are drawn concerning those variables most influential in the decision to participate in the work force. Policy implications of changes in labor market behavior are explored in the context of manpower and educational planning. A bibliography and technical appendix complete the report. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"The study of problems in State planning for vocational education surveyed the vocational education directors in the various States and the District of Columbia to determine what were their major planning problems. The survey instrument consisted of three sections: time spent on planning (both in general and on the State Plan for vocational education), problems in vocational education planning, and identification of critical planning problems. It was administered to State directors in January 1973, and 33 useable questionnaires were completed. From the survey of time allocated to planning, the data indicate that overall State planning constitutes on the average about 20% of the total man-months available for all purposes, while State Plan developing takes only about five percent  of available time. In addition, two distinct measures indicate that the most pressing problem facing State directors was the uncertainty of the availability of future fiscal resources. Clustering the States according to similarity of responses suggests that, holding percentage of total time spent on planning constant, those States which devote the least of their planning time to the State Plan and more time to State planning in general have the least severe planning problems. The 10-page survey instrument comprises an appendix. (Author/JR)",

Today's agriculture is a challenge as much to the intellect as to physical effort; consequently, education is germane to its progress. Drawing on experiences, particularly in India, the author discusses desirable principles in the methodology of educating adult farmers: (1) problem identification, (2) co-relation, (3) participational demonstration, (4) up-to-dateness, (5) equality in communication, and (6) continuing self-study. Individual chapters  are devoted to topics of functional literacy, mass media, trainers' programs, women farmers and young farmers, a world university for farmers, research and universities, and voluntary organizations. The author stresses the need for mass media and literacy to function together and the need for functional literacy programs to be linked with forward-looking economic activity programs. Moreover, agricultural development calls for systems analysis, an analysis of interrelationships affecting agricultural development in a specific area. The concluding chapter focuses on unique trends and stages of rural development in India. (EA)",

        "description":"The objective of the project was to investigate the utility of using an A/F37A-T4G T-37 flight simulator within the context of Air Force undergraduate pilot training. Twenty-one subjects, selected from three undergraduate pilot training classes, were given contact flight training in a TP4G/EPT simulator before going to T-37 aircraft for further training. Fourteen of these subjects were also given instrument training in the T-4G/EPT before completing such training in the aircraft. The remaining seven subjects received instrument training in the UPT T-4 instrument and procedures trainer. A specially designed syllabus was used which incorporated batch training, proficiency advancement, and other revised instructional strategies. Check pilot scores for each of the instructional  phases were used in comparing performances of the experimental subjects with those of the conventionally trained students. Results indicate devices having the capabilities of the T-4G could be used to achieve an average saving per student of three aircraft hours in contact flight training and ten hours in instrument training. Results also indicate a savings of eight aircraft hours could be achieved in instrument training by using the specially devised syllabus of instruction with existing T-4 instrument trainers.

The major purpose of this study was to develop guidelines for teacher recruitment programs for use by university and State Departments of Agricultural Education throughout the country. The scope of the study examined methods of recruitment, their influence on students, student and educator opinions, and sources from which to recruit. Mail questionnaires were developed to collect data from head State supervisors of agricultural education, teacher educators of agricultural education, and students enrolled in agricultural education. Fifty State supervisor returns from the 50  States, 78 returns (95.1 percent) from teacher education departments, and 373 returns from students were received. The findings are summarized. Conclusions emphasized the teacher shortage and the importance of adequate vocational counseling and information in high school and college. Guidelines stressed the development and coordination of a recruiting program to assess all sources of recruitment. Recommendations called for studies to determine the most effective recruitment practices. (Author/JB)",

A summary reviews the preceding sections. The conclusions stress the need for: reliable evaluation instruments, further development of the comprehensive test battery incorporating interest tests and sophistication assessment, and improving the rating scale for predicting vocational potential.

The mobile center visits each high school in the county; the sophomore year is selected as the target grade for the career exploration activities, which are limited in size to groups of 12. A variety of media formats geared to a wide range of academic capabilities (sound filmstrips, taped interviews, microfilm, books, and pamphlet files) are available to students in separate learning stations. The program consists of six components: (1) interest identification (Kuder E General Interest Survey), (2) exploration activities  (exploration of 15-20 occupations), (3) self-appraisel activity, (4) decision-making activities (identification of the career that is of most interest to the individual), (5) career planning (in the PACE center or in small groups), and (6) career guidance (continuing contact between student and counselor). The report also discusses administrational details of the program such as scheduling, staff, budget, and physical facilities. More than two-thirds of the document consists of supplementary exhibits within the appendixes--information and worksheets, PACE questionnaire, facility layouts, equipment, and instructional materials.

The wisest recruitment policy would recruit volunteers having the skills, talents, and interests needed in a particular school. The formulation of a job description listing duties and time commitments is important. Volunteer placement should be flexible. Volunteer program administrators and staffs should conduct orientation programs which will explain the school setting, general activities, and staff's appreciation of the volunteers' efforts. Preservice instruction on the ways children learn would also be  helpful. Probably the most important aspect of the preservice training program, however, is the development among volunteers of a feeling of belonging. Volunteer evaluation should be subjective and based on students', teachers', and the volunteers' own estimation of their work. The range of possible jobs which volunteers can perform extends virtually as far as the imagination is able and the regular staff is willing to go. (Author/JR)",

The Mott Institute at Michigan State University focused its first efforts on developing a specialized preparation program for teachers of the disadvantaged. These efforts led to the development of a reading management program, Personalized Approach to Teaching Reading (PATTR), whose emphasis was on differentiated staffing, on enlisting the help of paraprofessionals and volunteers to assist the teacher at the kindergarten level. Further refinements generated the Responsive Autonomy in Cooperative  Teaching (REACT) Program, whose purpose was to de-emphasize the somewhat rigid hierarchical roles usually associated with differentiated staffing. Having successfully progressed into the developmental work of these projects, the Institute's staff realized that one primary role had not yet been assumed by the Institute--dissemination. Consequently, the Institute's attention shifted from invention to innovation, from developing programs to implementing programs in real school settings. Future papers will describe these efforts.

As a consequence, the task force was proposed to identify program failure factors and to suggest ways of retaining Indian families through to successful completion in the program. The major problems contributing to premature departures were identified as: alcohol; marital conflict; reservation life and majority institutional structures; isolation, worry, rigidity, self-rejection, and interpersonal isolation; extended family influences; input motivation and expectations; and conflict and aggression. The problems are explored in depth emphasizing the  psychological, sociological, and cultural aspects forming the major underlying causes. Some major conclusions were that (1) cultural dissonance resulted in a difficult adjustment to the majority culture's world, (2) the Mountain-Plains program can only be a valuable experience for a narrow spectrum of the Indian population, (3) male heads of households are successful in mastering the vocational and educational requirements, and (4) the program is most successful with Indian families who are partially immune to culture shock. An indepth followup analysis substantiated the task force findings. A six-item bibliography is appended. (BP)",

The intermediate level (5-6) stresses exploration with tools, examining construction in the fifth grade and transportation in the sixth grade. The early secondary level (7-8) examines the utilization of materials and forces with grade seven covering ceramics, woods, drawing, and plastics and grade eight covering metals, graphic arts, electricity, and  power mechanics. The secondary level, focusing on experiences in industrial technology, is divided into two series of electives: the basic series for the majority of students and the technology series for the more able students.

A recent study by the National Planning Association points up the need to project future manpower demands in energy and energy-related industries so that the country's educational and training institutions can provide the mix of graduates to match future needs. Educators also share the awesome responsibility for an advocacy role to maintain the culture. What appears to be needed in schools and colleges, at this moment in history, is a bold new approach for meeting the energy problem head-on. If the two-year postsecondary institutions, both public and private, are to make their greatest contribution during this period of limited energy  resources, they must not only help prepare the thousands of technicians and skilled persons for the energy fields, but they must assist in the process of changing attitudes. Colleges must tune in to the shifting job opportunities evolving as a direct result of the changing focus in the energy fields. Only an informed network of postsecondary schools and colleges can be expected to provide a graduate mix that will match the real needs of future energy and energy-related industries. (Author/PR)",

        "description":"Many implications exist for postsecondary educational institutions in the challenge of arriving at a responsible solution to the energy problem. The intent of the Energy Materials Conservation Education Act of 1975 is to call for a commitment by educators (community colleges, technical institutes, and trade and technical schools) to: (1) help prepare technicians and skilled persons for the energy fields, and (2) assist students in the process of changing attitudes. Recent changes in the field of education requiring adaptation are the surpluses/shortages in some occupational categories, equal employment opportunities, the community college movement, and growth of occupational education. Two-year postsecondary institutions will have important and unfolding roles in the energy  crisis. The achievement of national energy self-sufficiency will increase the demand for scientists, engineers, technicians, craftsmen, construction workers, and machine and vehicle operators. Nuclear plants and petroleum refineries will require electricians, welders, and steam and pipe fitters. Employment levels by 1990 for crude petroleum and natural gas exploration may increase by 100,000 persons over 1970 levels. New energy technologies must be developed--synthetic fuels made from coal and oil shale, advanced fission reactors, fusion, and solar and geothermal sources. Likewise, there will be emphasis on finding ways to conserve energy. (EA)",

A surface analysis format based on cues, mental actions, and motor actions was developed which described flying tasks in terms of the sequential elements within each task. A set of classification rules was developed which utilized the descriptive analytical information generated by the surface analysis to identify the skills needed to execute the flying tasks described. A coding and matrix system was devised which made the classification system easy to use. The resulting taxonomic data system was applied to the solution of several representative flying training research problems. (Author)",

Evidence in support of positive transfer was obtained by comparing students trained in the formation simulator with students who were essentially untrained and with students trained in the aircraft. This design provided data for a direct comparison of five simulator sorties with two aircraft sorties in an effort to quickly establish a training cost/transfer comparison. The results indicate that the simulator has at least the training effectiveness of two aircraft sorties. (Author/JB)",

The first objective was to identify and classify the characteristics of conceptual design trade studies that have high potential impact on human resource requirements of Air Force weapon systems. The approach used was a case history review and analysis of 129 F-15 aircraft design trade studies. The analysis indicated that the avionics system demonstrated the greatest potential impact on human resources. It was also found that trade studies dealing with design alternatives that encompass widely different technologies have substantial impact on human resources. The types of human resources data (HRD) most influenced by alternative design options were maintenance task times and personnel costs. The second study objective was to determine the  accuracy of using subjective estimates as a technique for deriving the HRD impact of trade study options. Using only engineering information for six avionics subsystems, from the conceptual design phase, Air Force maintenance technicians made subjective estimates of the impact of the designs on selected HRD items. It was found that technicians can make accurate estimates of the amount of time, the Air Force occupational specialty, the level of technical skill, and the number of personnel needed to perform field maintenance tasks.

Chapter 1 examines the university graduate's need for continuing education, new conceptions of continuing education for the university graduate, and the attitudes of and motivations for university graduates vis-a-vis professional continuing education. There is a brief mention of continuing education in areas not related to the university graduate's education or profession. Chapter 2 discusses the agents and their role in continuing education and the need for coordination among these institutions, groups, and persons. Agents described are: the university, professional  associations, government, employers, and industry and commerce. Chapter 3 focuses on the elaboration and administration of activities in professional continuing education through the identification of needs, the establishment of objectives and content, resource persons, choice of method, financial policy, and evaluation. Chapter 4 overviews problems relating to the organization of continuing education. The three most important measures for ameliorating organizational problems involve focusing on: the attitudes and motivations of individuals, coordinating the agents, and educational activities. Recommendations concentrate on other organizational aspects. The conclusion summarizes the text. A 67-item bibliography and appendixes are included. (JB)",

To build positively demands that we be willing to look realistically at both promises and problems in three categories: conceptual assumptions of career education; process assumptions of career development; and programmmatic assumptions of career education. Two basic conceptual assumptions of career education which constitute serious operational challenges when we seek to meet the needs of minority and low-income students are that career education is for all persons and that career education is humanistically oriented. As a process, career education follows the model of career development. The model envisions a progressive sequence involving: career  awareness, career exploration, career motivation, career decision-making, career preparation, career entry, and career maintenance and progression. Special problems exist for minority and low-income persons in each stage of this process. Three programmatic assumptions of career education which are currently acting as operational deterrents to effective career education for minority and low-income persons are that: career education is a collaborative effort; the classroom teacher is key to the success of career education; and career education is inexpensive.

        "description":"As technology continues to increase the complexity of our occupational society and relationships between education and work become closer and closer, it becomes necessary to create for youth a world in which educational institutions and the business/industrial community collaborate to provide an environment, a set of learning experiences, and a set of opportunities for helping all persons in our society. The career education movement represents this kind of environment. Career education's primary focus is on increasing the ability of individuals to recognize and capitalize on relationships between education and work in our society. It places equal emphasis on society's need for work and the individual's need to find meaning and meaningfulness in his work. There are several areas  of societal and individual need to consider within the framework of career development: the current rapidity of occupational change demands that both youth and adults be equipped with adaptability skills (basic academic skills and good work habits); each student needs one or more sets of specific vocational skills that can be used to gain entry into today's labor market; and career decision-making skills are absolutely essential in a society that worships freedom of choice for each individual.

The four original models for career education (one for designing and developing curriculum materials, and the experienced-based, the home-based, and the residential models) developed by the National Institute of Education (NIE) also deserve praise. In the future four broad challenges face the center: stressing the mutual dependence of career and vocational education; continuing  its efforts in both basic and applied research in career guidance and counseling; emphasizing the importance of career education, teacher education, and evaluation; and broadly disseminating career education materials. NIE faces four additional challenges: emphasizing the teaching-learning process in the career education concept; emphasizing the collaborative relationship between the business-labor-industry-professional-government community and the formal educational system; involving the home and family in career education; and reducing the influence of race and sex stereotyping in occupational choice and opportunity.

The need to clarify and emphasize relationships between education and work for all persons and the need to make work a more meaningful part of the total lifestyle of all persons lie behind the career education movement. Career education itself can be defined as all the activities implied in the two words through which one learns about and prepares oneself for work, the conscious effort aimed at producing benefits for oneself and/or career education. Infusion signifies attempts within the educational system itself to make education  a preparation for work. Collaboration designates the cooperative effort between the educational system, the business-labor-industry-professional-government community, and the home and family structure. Problems of cost and obstacles to success, if approached with flexibility and optimism, can be favorably resolved. (Author/JR)",

Among such problems, one of the most obvious is the relative slowness with which career education is being implemented at the senior high school level. Vocational educators, from every area of vocational education, must assume responsibility for making career education work in the senior high school. Career education calls for several changes in the teaching-learning process. The business and office occupations and distributive education fields can serve as models that have been built in ways that are already consistent with these kinds of changes. These fields have bridged the gap between those who regard themselves as academic educators and those who call  themselves vocational educators. There are a number of ways in which today's business and office occupations and distributive education teachers could move to convert both academic teachers and vocational educators into career educators.

Four major attitudinal problems currently face career education. The problem of costs arises from those who think anything inexpensive is not worthwhile and from those who expect major educational change to be accompanied by massive Federal support. The problem of control is brought on because various labor, business, and educational organizations want a say in determining the materials and methods of career education. A third problem involves various educational factions feeling that something will be taken away from them by career education, that a collaborative  effort will nullify their special skills.

The study found that: there is need for a public relations program; such a program needs to be direct, must have a consistent focus, and must emphasize professionalism; home economics must establish an identity and build an image; many potential employers are unclear about the home economists' skills but would like to learn more; and the AHEA is the appropriate organization through which to present a public relations program. The more detailed findings of the study are presented as eight  hypotheses with a discussion of each and a representative sampling of interview responses.

Between and among the national organizations we can demonstrate our willingness to share our accumulated knowledge of problem-solving methods applied to personal and community needs both here and abroad. Relatively recent trends (modern psychology, the pill, increased education for women) have altered the lives of women and, therefore, of men and of nations. When we turn to women workers who are professionals in adult and continuing education, several specifics are apparent: a few women have always been in the field; women's activities have expanded into other fields; there has been a rapid growth in participation by women adult educators in the specific field of women's  rights, and in other new fields such as black studies and adult basic education. The issues of employment are complicated by a number of trends now emerging that are potentially in direct conflict with traditional procedures and standards. Many women are using the legal approach to correcting inequity. My own preference is also to seek alternative means. Both men and women will benefit if we approach the future experimentally.

In all, 4,632 participating and 4,403 nonparticipating students in grades 6, 9, and 12 and 1,433 teachers and 229 counselors were surveyed. Regarding the conformity of student outcomes attributable to project activities, it was found that the greatest impact of Part D programs was at the elementary level, and that, on a project-by-project basis, the program's impact on students was small. Regarding the relationship of cost to student outcomes, it was found that projects had the most positive effects on  students where relatively more project funds were expended on relatively fewer students. The study concludes that the failure of student level outcomes of the programs to meet the level planned most likely occurred because of the general lack of clearly defined objectives, definitions, and managerial requirements and procedures at both the project level and the Federal level. The study contains 82 tables and two appendixes (Part D Legislation and a USOE policy statement. (Author/JR)",

The study found that most of the respondents believe that education will enable them to achieve their aspirations. Although most respondents' fathers held white collar jobs (mostly as proprietors), the sons do not appear to be following their fathers' footsteps. More than 95 percent of the respondents attended college. The respondents' attachment to Judaism appears to be neither consistent nor clear-cut as measured in terms of intermarriage and involvement in Jewish organizations. Of the 40 percent of the respondents who  reported they had received vocational counseling since high school, only half said that the counseling influenced their occupational choice. The study concludes that it is vitally important to provide adequate educational and vocational counseling for Jewish youth, and recommends 10 guideposts for action as seen by the B'nai B'rith Career and Counseling Services to accomplish this goal.

The four-part document focuses on personal variables that would foster an understanding of adult success phenomena. Following an introduction to the counseling program, part 2 traces the history of the Mountain-Plains Counseling Program, a program begun with no specificity of program content, delivery system, or staffing qualifications. Part 3 reviews the development guidelines formulated from interview data, past errors, and theoretical models.  Several key experiential and theoretical considerations were: dependency, staffing, approach, gain versus maintenance, development versus crisis response, coaching, self-direction, relationships, environmental control, and responsibility. Part 4 compares the old program (phase 3) with that now operating (phase 4), highlighting major changes. The redevelopment program was added to the other three parts of the counseling program: orientation, personal and family counseling, and community development.

        "description":"The paper describes and analyzes the changes in the University of British Columbia extension program in the 60's resulting from action by the university administration. The history of the program is surveyed through an examination of its three directors and their accomplishments and policies. The role of the department was to promote and foster adult education in British Columbia. The program has expanded into areas of professional continuing education and has created closer ties with other faculties within the university. The early 60's experienced growth, development, and increased emphasis on programs for professional people. Much of the data are drawn from department reports and reviews. The late 60's experienced budget cuts and new directions in which nondegree work was  visualized as lower in priority than graduate programs. However, the emphasis moved toward upgrading the intellectual content of the program as well as establishing new programs designed for Indians and women. Priorities under a new director were aimed at cooperation in policy decisions, broadening part-time study, developing professional continuing education, easing budget cuts in nondegree courses, and furthering cooperation with other faculties. Recommendations for the 70's include changing the term &quot;extension education&quot; to &quot;continuing education&quot; and stress continued response to public interests. (Author/JB)",

        "description":"The report describes a project designed to facilitate the transfer and utilization of training technology by developing a model for evaluating training approaches or innovtions in relation to the requirements, resources, and constraints of specific training settings. The model consists of two parallel sets of open-ended questions--one set concerning the characteristics of the training approach under consideration, and one set concerning the requirements, resources, and constraints in the specific training setting. When these questions have been answered, the information needed to evaluate how well the training approach fits the training setting is available and arrayed in a convenient format. The model can be used: when the training setting is given and the problem is to select  training approaches; to analyze and describe training approaches in terms relevant to the concerns of the training designer and developer; and to make an inventory of the characteristics of a training setting, without any particular training approach in mind. The report also includes chapters on: background; description of the model (including its development and initial testing); field evaluation and revisions; discussion of the model; applications; and conclusions and implications. An appendix presents an application of the model to a peer instruction training approach. (Author/PR)",

The guide provides specific advice and recommendations on: staff selection, workshops, student recruitment, class organization and instruction, inservice training, advisory committees, materials, instructional design, recordkeeping, and evaluation. Conclusions drawn from the demonstration projects include: homebound basic instruction is valuable for educationally disadvantaged adults unable to attend classes; incorporating teaching reflective materials in the humanities with teaching ordinary adult basic education skills is worthwhile for  some ABE students; educationally disadvantaged parents can be taught ABE skills in their own homes, and these parents can be taught simultaneously how and what to teach their preschool children; student recruitment and retention must be given first priority in any ABE program; emphasis in all ABE instruction must be placed on communication and computation skills; regular inservice training conducted by qualified instructors should replace protracted preservice training; and employment of mature, trained paraprofessionals, under the close supervision of certified teachers, is a practical method of ABE instruction. Appendixes provide sample forms, and statistical tables on dropouts, accomplishments, and demographic information. (Author/PR)",

Three standardized testing instruments indicated that during the year the students progressed more rapidly in reading, arithmetic, and language skills, understanding basic economic concepts, and the affective dimension of learning than they would have in public school. The employer systems instructional activities (career explorations, career specializations, and world of work seminars) merited positive evaluations except for the world of work seminars. The  instructional systems component (individualized learning center, electives, and physical education) merited a mixed evaluation. In the student personnel systems component (life skills, exploration, and specialization), the student records system was found unsatisfactory, the counseling system satisfactory. In the management systems component, facilities were judged inadequate, administrative systems adequate. The evaluation concludes that employers in the Philadelphia area are willing and able to successfully provide the learning activities which have been termed career exploration and specialization. It ends with various recommendations for improving the project. (JR)",

Section 2 describes the EBCE summative evaluation which included planning, developing the instrument, implementing revised plans, and establishing timelines so that valid and reliable evidence on the effectiveness of the products and resources required by the AEL/EBCE program  could be gathered. Program components are assessed in section 3 regarding their functionablity both in isolation and in interaction with other components. Also described is the EBCE formative evaluation which included collcting and analyzing preliminary data, establishing evaluation controls, planning for data analysis, instrument development, administration of instruments, and data analysis and reporting. Section 4 provides summary and recommendations. Seven appendixes (1973 EBCE graduate questionnaire, student and parent opinion surveys, participating employer and student information questionnaires, formative evaluation instrument package, and problem solving procedures) comprise one-half of the document.

More specifically, the study attempted to evaluate EBCE along the guidelines proposed as objectives by the EBCE User Conferences. Those objectives were to provide public exposure of the EBCE concept to concerned education officials within the Appalachian region, to develop insights into the specific needs and preferences according to geographic areas of interest which might facilitate or suppress the implementation of an EBCE program, and to provide professional feedback to EBCE staff concerning the adequacy of  their program. These objectives have been evaluated by two means. The first was subjective, based on observer notes recorded at each conference. The second was more objective, based on conference attendants' responses to questionnaires The questionnaire indicated that the greatest areas of concern were, i descending order of importance: consulting assistance, additional staff, financial issues, additional physical facilities, and loss of control for teachers and administrators. Relevant forms, a sample questionnaire, and a list of 40 facts about EBCE are appended. (Author/PR)",

        "description":"The National Petroleum Council has projected a 1980 bituminous coal production of 910 million tons. On that basis, the study estimates the manpower which will be required to produce that volume of coal. On the assumption of a productivity increase of two percent per year from 1974 onwards, the 1980 coal output will require a work force of approximately 200,000, or about 45,000 above the 1973 employment figure. Additional workers needed to replace those who die or retire raise new manpower requirements to about 15,000 per year for the remainder of the decade. Because of the increasing mechanization of coal production, the most critical requirement will be for highly skilled workers. There will also be an urgent need for training programs, both in work safety and in mining skills,  for young miners. The study supports its conclusions with numerous statistical tables and interpretations of their data. (Author/PR)",

Cramer, in the second part of the monograph, documents five of Hoyt's points: (1) education has failed to keep pace with post-industrial occupation changes, thus contributing to increased worker alienation; (2) career options for women have not been reflected in the educational system; (3) continuing adult education needs have not been met; (4) there is a need for more public participation in educational policy formation; and (5) insufficient emphasis is placed on sub-baccalaureate degree level programs.

The purpose of the paper is to make educators more aware of the realities of the labor market. The first part of the paper introduces the concept of underemployment (the under-utilization of such human resources as talent, education, and training) and traces its effects on the society, the individual, the economy, and the institution of education. A rapid increase in the educational attainments of the work force and a marked change in work values among young people are then contrasted to a rather static occupational structure, one with only slowly expanding opportunities for good jobs. It is  this particular combination of trends that leads to some of the worst problems associated with underemployment. In the final part of the paper, alternative policies for meeting the problems of underemployment are reviewed, with special emphasis given to life-long learning, especially work-based life-long learning.

The perspective discrepancy assessment methodology of the evaluation team was the outgrowth of ABE national field studies and surveys. The strategy analyzes: (1) discrepancies between the expectations of those involved in the program and current practice, and (2) discrepancies between the expectations of those most directly involved in policy formulation and program implementation. Iowa's 400 ABE teachers were randomly divided, half receiving a questionnaire on expectations and half a questionnaire on current practice; a different  questionnaire was administered to a random group of students. Teacher return was 71 percent and 82 percent, and student return was 728 questionnaires out of 1,000. Other questionnaires were distributed to adult education directors, learning center coordinators, co-sponsors, and Department of Public Instruction representatives. Discussions of results and interpretive summaries are presented: (1) covering expectations and current practice in six key areas of decision making and program development: goal setting, instruction, recruitment, staffing, staff development, and collaboration and (2) providing extended analyses of characteristics and perspectives of students, teachers, and learning center coordinators.

        "description":"This report describes the opiate maintenance clinic established in Shreveport, Louisiana (1919-1923), whose short existence has recently been questioned by researchers. The authors of this manuscript visited with the original director of the clinic and were given permission to use the medical records of patients of the old clinic and numerous letters and reports which helped describe the clinic operations. The report consists of an in-depth analysis of the 762 patients, and deals with the specific methods and procedures of both the clinic and detoxification hospital. For nearly 40 years, the narcotics policies of the United States, supervised by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, have grossly exaggerated the effects of opiates, and have denied the value of any kind of drug  maintenance. The Shreveport experience well illustrates these wronghanded policies. The city was told to tackle its drug problem; it did it well, and then was told it was breaking the law and could not continue. The history of the Shreveport clinic explains a great deal about the nature and early treatment of opiate addiction. The addicts were found to respond well to morphine treatment when regarded as responsible human beings, rather than irresponsible, disturbed criminals as they often are today. In a brief summary, the authors relate their findings to important contemporary issues, namely, the feasibility of drug maintenance. (PC)",

These hypotheses are: (1) equalitarian ideologies superimposed by the state may increase the range of women's educational and occupational options but may have little effect on sex role socialization and the degree of sex stereotyping; (2) same-sex play groups that provide girls with competitive experiences as well as acceptance and prestige for winning and/or mixed-sex friendship groups that replace dating, singly or in combination, can  enable girls to develop intellectually and to achieve highly without fear of loss of femininity and popularity; (3) in societies in which there are formalized institutionalized patterns of sex role socialization and sex discrimination, there is no need for informal indirect, and disguised sex discrimination.

        "description":"This paper reports on the results of an ongoing large-scale nationally representative sample of college students, which provides time series data on attitudes for a broad array of issues. A representative sample of between 250,000 and 350,000 freshmen, entering more than 300 institutions throughout the nation, was surveyed each fall (1967-1974) by UCLA and the American Council on Education as part of the ongoing Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP). The characterizations of students of the mid-1970's as growing more apathetic and as being more conservative than their predecessors of the 1960's gained little support from a comparative analysis over time. With respect to student's political self-identification, while there is a shift away from the liberal end of the  spectrum, there is a parallel trend away from the conservative end as well over the six years, 1969 to 1974. The relatively high level of awareness and concern over current societal and collegiate issues among the most recent college entrants indicates that continuing strong support for reform is likely to emanate from the college community. In general, today's student body might be characterized as a more viable and effective locus for potential mobilization of social criticism and dissent possibly of more positive and constructive tone than that of the 1960's--than at any earlier time in history.

The results supported five general conclusions: (1) high agreement exists among educators concerning the attributes of mature males, females and adults; (2) educators' concepts of health, maturity, and social competence differ for men and women; (3) these differences parallel common sex-role stereotypes which assign less social value to the feminine role; (4) educators are  less likely to attribute characteristics of mature adults to a woman than they are to a man; and (5) female educators see women as coming significantly closer to the adult standard than do male educators.

A second motivation was the need for \"hands on\" materials and strategies that teachers and counselors could use with students--in this case primarily at the junior and senior high school levels. The first four chapters are more general and theoretical and might be used as part of a course, consultation program, or an inservice program on applied group dynamics. Chapters Five through Nine can be used independently of the theoretical chapters and might be used as the basis for instructional packages by teachers and counselors. (Author)",

The report begins with consideration of the question, &quot;What are interests and why do we measure them?&quot; It concludes with a discussion of the ways information about group differences in educational and vocational behavior can be used to help individuals make satisfying and rewarding career choices. The results of extensive item analyses indicated that the scales of the ACT Interest Inventory measure six basic dimensions of interest with sufficient consistency and accuracy for individual counseling with  students. Group differences in item responses suggested that separate scaling and norming procedures were needed for men and women, but that whites and non whites did not require separate norms. Validity evidence supporting the descriptive use of the ACT Interest Inventory included correlational information showing that the six scales are relatively independent, are interrelated in the expected circular fashion, are highly related to Strong Vocational Interest Blank scales measuring the same dimensions, and are unrelated to ACT ability measures.

Although not totally without magic, the teaching of the self-control approach seems to be the more likely choice.

It contends that career education and development are processes, not products, and that the student must be allowed time for exploration. The program is designed to respond to these problems. The first paper deals with the different university departments involved in the program, while the second describes a one-credit hour course called, \"Practical Decision Making.\"  The third presentation presents an overview of the decision making process and the fourth offers an evaluation of new career development programs. The fifth article deals with the use of self-instructional aids in career counseling while the final presentation describes a unique approach by Brigham Young University intended to make students more aware of its services.

To provide many perspectives in viewing the issues, the task force was chosen from a broad cross section of leadership throughout the nation. Specifically, the task force determined: (1) alcoholism has a direct relationship to daily living experiences; (2) efforts to establish an effective mechanism to prevent alcohol-related problems have fallen short because the focus of the efforts has been too narrow; (3) the ability of citizens to make  responsible decisions regarding use of alcohol relates directly to the individual's general decision-making competence; (4) human service programs generally suffer from the lack of an effective delivery service; (5) no clear assessment of how genetic, physiological, psychological, and societal factors influence the problem has been determined; and (6) present prevention services have limited effectiveness.

After nearly a year of study, discussion, and consultation with experts in various fields, funds were committed for programs directed toward the solution of problems of sex-based inequality. This paper describes the main lines of foundation activity within the following areas of concern: (1) legal rights and  equal opportunity; (2) educational needs; (3) women in the work force; (4) women in the professions; (5) research on women in society; and (6) overseas activities related to women.

These indicators are written primarily for school age children to adults, and they cover the areas of socio-emotional growth. In this collection, goals are divided into their component areas or subparts. Each of the component areas has at least one separate page devoted to itemizing possible indicators, or ways that growth in that particular area might be visualized. This format allows users to select goals and component areas based on their own criteria. Approximately 21 different goals and component areas make up this collection. The author also discusses putting the indicators into practice by planning to  meet goals in each of four areas: structural, organizational, activity, and responsive. (Author/PC)",

The author discusses three models of student development but concludes that none should serve as the only model for student development specialists. There is profound and important difference between student services and student development that must be recognized if the movement is to have any credibility. Offering student services that are useful and desired is not the same as offering programs deliberately designed to help students know who they are and what they wish to be and to do in this life. The author stresses that if the profession is to make substantial progress and to gain the respect of students and  academic colleagues, it will have to begin to educate a new generation of student development specialists. They will need to be able to contribute to the scholarship and research, theory and practice of human development from birth through death. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"The 120 resolutions of the 1970 national convention platform of the National Organization for Women were paraphrased to form items for the nine subscales of the Attitudes Toward Feminist Issues Scale. Subjects were 61 introductory women's studies students and 44 introductory psychology students. The attitudes Toward Feminist Issues Scale was given to both groups on the first day of class and at the end of the course three months later. For the precourse administration of the Attitudes Toward Feminist Issues Scale women's studies students responded with a more liberal feminist position than introductory psychology students and women students responded with a more liberal feminist position than men. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were computed to determine the  test-retest reliability of subscale scores and total score from the precourse and postcourse administrations of the scale to the introductory psychology students. The observed correlation coefficients for all subscale scores and the total score were significantly different than zero. The students' subscale scores and total score on the Attitudes Toward Feminist Issues Scale were submitted to a three-factor analysis of variance. The two independent groups factors were student sex and course type. The repeated measure factor was precourse-postcourse administration of the scale. (Author)",

        "description":"The Career Planning Seminar was developed by a committee of Schoolcraft Community College counselors for the purpose of facilitating career decision-making in groups. This group structure was adapted from the Systematic Career Counseling Process (used for individual counseling). The program is primarily a guide for counselors and suggests a format and group activities that can be used with career counseling groups of 10 to 12 participants. The process has a positive approach and focuses on the key issues that go into making career decisions. The program is intended to be used with any person who wishes to clarify his/her career future. This group process is being used with community college students who are concerned mainly with choosing an occupation or a college major. It is  also being used with adults who want to clarify their lifework objectives and perhaps make mid-life career changes. The Career Planning Seminar is designed to be used in 12 two-hour sessions. It is suggested that the groups meet over a period of 12 weeks; however, other designs such as weekend workshops are feasible. Session topics include: Introduction, Vocational History and Development, Personal Career Needs, Career Information, Self Concept, Value Clarification for Career Choice, Work Value Auction, Level of Functioning (Reality Factors), Strength Acknowledgement and Career Choices, Summary of Career Information, and Career Planning.

The therapist and client typically work through these steps together near the beginning of treatment, but only after the client has had the opportunity to ventilate the nature of his concern and to become aware of the therapist's involvement with him. The therapist introduces the task by explaining its nature and indicating that clients are often aided by the very act of expressing their concerns with a view toward specific behavioral change goals. Steps in the therapeutic process include setting of: (1) general goal; (2) behavior goal; (3) observable behavioral goal; (4) specific  observable behavioral goal (limiting the scope of the behavior and designating the time, place, person, or context); (5) base rate; (6) criteria of failure; (7) reality check; (8) importance check; (9) contract; and (10) criteria for evaluation and renegotiation. Although the procedure was developed for individual behavior change, the same steps can be used effectively in group therapy. (Author/PC)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken in an attempt to determine if the traits of flexibility, openness, and sensitivity found in high school teachers would be associated with higher levels of satisfaction among students in general and among minority students in particular. Thirty-nine teachers and 953 students served as subjects in the study. Three measures were administered to teachers: (1) the Parsons-Kreuter Ressentiment Index; (2) the This I Believe test; and (3) the Cross Cultural Sensitivity test. These scales were related to a measure of student satisfaction with the teacher and school environment obtained via the Friedenberg-Nordstrom Ressentiment Index. Support was found for the hypothesis that the openness, flexibility, and sensitivity of a teacher's cognitive style and perceptual  systems can have positive effects on the satisfaction and adjustment of students. Unusual or exceptional patterns of relating to others did not seem to be required for successful communication with minority students. However, without the sensitivity to understand another and to resist the inclination to make strong and negative attributions based on unusual behavior, the &quot;concerned&quot; teacher may be seen as paternalistic and unresponsive.

Biofeedback training with such instruments results in the ability to voluntarily regulate physiological functions formerly believed involuntary. These physiological functions are correlates of psychological states and processes. Hence, psychological self-regulation, self-awareness, and enhancement (psychological health) are outcomes of biofeedback training for voluntary self-regulation of physiological functions. This paper presents a brief introduction to biofeedback instruments most frequently used in counseling; to counseling applications, outcomes, and cautions; and presents a rationale for counseling  via biofeedback training.
