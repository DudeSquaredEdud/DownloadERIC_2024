        "title":"Tensions in Learner Support and Tutor Support in Tertiary Web-based English Language Education in China",
        "author":["Wang, Tong"],
        "description":"Based on the findings of a national survey conducted in 2004 designed to examine the support systems for both learners and tutors engaged in tertiary-level Web-based English education in mainland China, this paper reports the findings of secondary analysis by identifying the tensions in the current learner and tutor support systems. For &quot;learner support&quot;, four tensions were analyzed: (1) vigorous institutional learner support efforts versus learner utilization of the provisions; (2) learner qualities development versus academic support; (3) learner technical competence versus learner participation in online services; and (4) the relationship of face-to-face components and online components in learner support system design. For &quot;tutor support&quot;, four tensions were identified: (1) institutional conceptual understanding versus the actual practices; (2) tutor' enthusiasm versus tutor's perception of online education; (3) tutor responsibilities versus tutor commitment, and (4) current tutor support service repertoire versus tutor improvement areas. The paper analyzes possible causes for the tensions and proposes some solutions to address these tensions. (Contains 18 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "author":["Jeong, Allan C."],
        "description":"This study tested the effects of linguistic qualifiers and intensifiers on the number and types of replies elicited per argument and per challenge posted in online debates. To facilitate collaborative argumentation, thirty-two students (22 females, 10 males) enrolled in a graduate-level online course classified and labeled their messages as arguments, challenges, supporting evidence, or explanations prior to posting each message. The findings showed that qualified arguments elicited 41 percent fewer replies (effect size = -0.64), and the reduction in replies was greatest when qualified arguments were presented by females than males. Challenges without qualifiers, however, did not elicit more replies than challenges with qualifiers. These findings suggest that qualifiers were used to hedge arguments, and such behaviors should be discouraged during initial stages of identifying arguments (more so in all-female than in all-male groups) in order to elicit more diverse and more opposing viewpoints needed to thoroughly and critically analyze arguments.

        "description":"This research study focused on the special nature (i.e. different from mainstream education) of special education and the experiences of teachers with regard to the challenges they face in teaching the mentally handicapped child. Special schoolteachers have the responsibility to offer not only good, but also highly individualized and goal-directed instruction. The aim with the research was to investigate the following research questions: What are the experiences of teachers regarding the major challenges they face in the education of the mentally handicapped child? What guidelines can be provided to these teachers? A qualitative study,   with a descriptive, explorative, subjective and contextual research design was chosen, using a phenomenological approach to data collection. This inductive approach was considered to be appropriate for the investigation, because it would enable an in-depth investigation into the matter. The research was open and not directed by a conceptual framework or   hypothesis. The research was undertaken in two phases: Phase one entailed an exploration and description of the experiences of teachers with regard to the challenges they face in teaching the mentally handicapped child. This was accomplished by conducting in-depth, personal phenomenological interviews at a specific special education school in Port   Elizabeth. The research population was selected purposively in order to obtain rich information and participants were met in their own context. In Phase two, guidelines were derived from the results of Phase one, to assist teachers in teaching the mentally handicapped child, and to approach the challenges they experience more confidently and competently. Throughout the research, steps were taken to ensure the trustworthiness of the   proceedings, inter alia by using Guba's model of data verification. Ethical principles were also upheld throughout the study. The transcripts were analyzed by using the descriptive analysis method of Tesc (Creswell, 1994:155), as well as a re-coding procedure by an independent coder. Significant results were obtained and these serve as the basis for the guidelines that can be suggested.",

Despite the fact that teachers generally follow the rules suggested by the literature that lead to inclusion it seems that something is still missing. In my opinion it is that teachers and schools fail to spot and pay attention to certain details and that this has a major effect on their efforts to provide equal participation in teaching and learning for all students. My argument in this paper is that if we pay attention to and consider those particular details it may help us to provide more inclusive practice.",

The purpose of this single case study was to record and understand the effect of autism on a mother's life retrospectively, to identify and analyse issues and themes that have shaped her life, to understand the stages and characteristics of a parent adaptation to a child with autism, and to form implications that could be learned from the participant's experiences. It is written as a narrative which is a form of meaning making that organizes human experiences into temporally meaningful episodes. By using the narrative approach, the authors were able to authentically document the steps of accepting a child's handicapping condition, which is an extremely difficult and often a heart-breaking process. Data was collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Eleven consistent themes emerged from the interview data. One new theme; \"falling apart\" which was coined by the authors, and two coping strategies; \"advocating\" and \"setting limits\", surfaced which were not represented previously in the literature. These new discoveries, the participant's successful instrumental and palliative coping strategies and the implications of having a child with autism on her life are discussed. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Conjoint behavioural consultation (CBC) is an indirect form of service delivery in which parents and teachers are joined together in a collaborative effort to meet the academic, social, and behavioral needs of children. The purpose of this study was to illustrate the utility of CBC as a method of supporting the inclusion of 2 students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) in mainstream classrooms. A case study design with replication across participants and a follow-up phase was employed to assess the effectiveness of an evidence-based intervention (self-management) delivered in the context of the CBC model. Results indicated a significant increase in teacher ratings of behavioural control (on-task and compliant behavior) from baseline to treatment. Positive treatment effects were maintained at a 4-week follow-up. Norm referenced measures produced statistically reliable and clinically meaningful changes in teachers' perceptions of disruptive behavior following treatment. Parents and teachers indicated satisfaction with consultation services and viewed CBC as an acceptable and effective model of home-school collaboration and shared problem-solving. The findings are discussed in relation to the limitations of the study, and to future research directions and implications for practice. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)",

Direct and indirect data were gathered and examined regarding themes that centered around QOL dimensions and exemplary indicators derived from the body of literature regarding QOL measurement for persons with disabilities. Positive results included participant satisfaction with physical safety, teacher acceptance, and access to needed materials. Other findings indicated the need for social skills instruction and individualized instruction in non-applied abstract learning activities.

Questions about story grammar that are asked after reading help readers organize and summarize the text. Therefore, it has been found worth to explore the impacts of text related questions following reading on story grammar acquisition of three Turkish youths with hearing loss attending a Vocational College in Turkey. The data of this action research effort have been compiled based on the cyclical actions through compiling a research journal, students' products, archival information, interviews, and videotaped data. The pre-and-post test results, the student portfolios and the actual post questioning activity derived from the videotaped data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results indicated that verbal and nonverbal strategies the teacher applied and the unique contributions of each student during the post reading activity enhanced each student's story comprehension. However, in order for the students to acquire story grammar , they still needed more and various experiences.",

        "description":"Determining the most appropriate intervention to address student problem behavior may be a difficult dilemma encountered by school psychologists during consultation activities with special education teachers. IDEA (1997) promotes the least restrictive environment and the least intrusive interventions that can be effective. The intrusiveness of assessment and interventions applied to a problem behavior should involve a positive correlation with the severity of problem behavior with more severe problems warranting more intrusive interventions. This matching of more intrusive interventions to more severe problem behaviors may not be representative of actual practice in education. This type of relationship also infers that more intrusive interventions warrant more extensive assessment procedures although conceptually, more extensive assessments should lead to less intrusive interventions. The ethical issues associated with the intrusiveness of assessment and intervention procedures are discussed within the context of ensuring the least intrusive intervention. Some issues of intrusive interventions to be discussed are the nature and occurrence of the problem behavior, previous interventions attempted, justification of proposed treatments, implementation of proposed treatments, and methods of monitoring and assessing intrusive interventions.",

Not only is a large proportion of these books of high printing and binding quality, but, at a quick glance, among them is also a pleasant diversity of genre, format, targeted age level, topic, and style. In this article, the author discusses juvenile books about China and ethnic Chinese and describes an event in modern history--the Sino-Japanese War (1937-45)--and its representation in American youth literature. The author focuses on American juvenile fiction with the Sino-Japanese War as its main setting or subject. With its focus on works of fiction, this article is part of a larger project to study American youth literature about the portion of World War II fought in China. By combing through multiple bibliographies and searching in library catalogs, the author located 28 fiction titles specifically written for a young audience and published in the U.S. (including titles published previously or simultaneously in other countries) from 1937 through 2007 about World War II in China. The author has also included in her study three adult titles which are suggested by the bibliographies she consulted as suitable reading for older young adults. The author discusses the general patterns of these books within the context of social, political, and cultural dynamics in America. (Contains 1 table and 6 notes.)",

DPT maintains that culturally inclusive teachers (a) observe children's cultural behavioral patterns to identify individual and group cultural competencies and skills; and (b) use this knowledge to guide their teaching decisions. In this article, the author introduces Diversity Pedagogy Theory, describes the structural aspects of DPT, and examines the relationship among culture, cognition, teaching, and learning. The author also provides classroom vignettes explicating the theory in practice and provides suggestions for classroom applications.

As participants in the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh teacher preparation program, Stacie and Nancy have enjoyed great academic success, drawing from their own lives and extensive experiences working with immigrant children and families. Each student has had to face a final barrier to teacher licensure--the Praxis II exam. In spite of their many skills, their academic achievement, and their strong relationships with schools, Nancy and Stacie cannot be licensed to teach unless they pass this exam.

In order to keep any society going, either at the national or global level, the importance of having visions for the improvement of that society cannot be overemphasized. It is in the light of this dream of making Botswana an enviable nation that the &quot;Vision 2016&quot; was published in 1997. A pillar of the &quot;Vision&quot; focuses on the development of a moral and tolerant nation. This article presents a brief literature review that focuses on the &quot;moral and tolerant&quot; aspects as aspirations of a nation. These two concepts are values which have implications for classroom pedagogy. This article reports an investigation of 64 teachers at the junior secondary school level and the challenges faced by them when teaching topics related to these values with their attendant remedies. The identified challenges included the difficulty of the use of critical and ethical reasoning methods in classes, a lack of community support, inadequate teachers' qualifications and experience, needed teaching resources, and the heterogeneity of the students, among others. The teachers provide some remedies to these challenges, while the investigator advocates for further research on the appropriate methods for teaching values in schools. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine suburban high school teachers' beliefs about non-European ancestry immigrant students; more specifically, suburban teachers' beliefs regarding the impact of students' cultural backgrounds on academic performance were examined. Non-European ancestry immigrant students are those students whose ancestral background is other than European such as, African, Asian, Mexican, Pacific Islanders, Arabic, and Central and South American. These include recent immigrants and first and second generation immigrants who are the children of immigrants and were born in the U.S. The research question guiding this study was: What are suburban high school teachers' personal and professional beliefs about immigrant students of non-European ancestry? The study took place in a school district located in a suburb of a southeast Texas metropolitan area. &quot;Beliefs of General Education Suburban Teachers Towards non-European Ancestry Immigrant Students&quot; (B-GEST), a five point Likert-type scale survey, was used and distributed to 350 general education teachers at two high school campuses. Responses were received from 183 participants for a 52% return rate. The results of the B-GEST indicate that teachers believe in the need to be aware of immigrant students and the challenges of being an immigrant. They also believe in integrated classrooms for racially isolated students and in teaching according to the needs of immigrant students irrespective of the subject they teach. The authors discuss the (1) demographic background; (2) results from the Likert Scale items about the personal beliefs of teachers and the open-ended comments related to those beliefs; and (3) professional beliefs of teachers and the open-ended comments related to those beliefs.

        "author":["LaDuke, Aja E."],
        "description":"Although many programs ascribe to promoting and celebrating diversity, traditional teacher preparation rarely centralizes multicultural education courses. Instead, these courses are often \"added on\" to or disconnected from the rest of the program. Multicultural education courses and other courses that address diversity often ask the preservice teachers enrolled to reflect critically on their own identities through the lenses of power and privilege. Given the peripheral positioning of courses of this nature in their preparation, one could expect preservice teachers to be unfamiliar and uncomfortable with this process, resulting in cognitive dissonance as well as a certain level of resistance. This article critically examines the interactions between members of a college classroom community, consisting of 26 predominantly White female students and their instructor, a man of color, in a graduate multicultural education course. Data collection and analysis were guided by the following research question: How do White preservice teachers' interact with and react to the content of a multicultural education course, particularly in regards to issues of race? Since, the notion of resistance was a prominent theme throughout the data sources, the author describes the various ways in which preservice teachers enacted resistant stances. First, the author describes how preservice teachers performed resistance through acts of silence. Then, she explores the ways in which preservice teachers vocally resisted the content and requirements of the multicultural education course. Next, she discusses preservice teacher resistance to buying into or accepting roles as vehicles for educational change. In addition to examining resistance, the author explores significant moments in which students engaged in the complex process of ideological renegotiation. Finally, the author discusses the implications for the preparation of teachers to work with students of diverse backgrounds.",

        "author":["Smith, Earl Bradford"],
        "description":"With the increase in ethnic diversity in the United States, many educators have recognized the need to expand their knowledge of multicultural education in the public schools. The success or failure of multicultural education depends upon the effective preparation of teachers and administrators. These teachers must be competent in the courses they teach if their students are to be academically successful. However, teachers face multiple and complex issues that challenge many of their traditional educational practices and assumptions. As the percentage of diverse students grows, it becomes increasingly important to sensitize teachers to the importance of culture and how it impacts the teaching and learning process. Effective teachers in a diverse world need an education that enables them to attain new knowledge, paradigms, and perspectives on the United States and the world, and to deal effectively with both the challenges and opportunities of diversity. It is also significant to construct a curriculum that supports student teachers with full acknowledgement of differences in race, culture, and gender to interrogate their experiences, understand schools as sites for struggles over power, and become better prepared to teach in an increasingly multiracial and multicultural society. In this article, the author aims to demonstrate how implementing a multicultural education philosophy supported by immersion experience models can help classroom teachers promote educational equity and social justice while helping all students reach their academic and social potential. The author focuses on published data-based research studies that examine the preparation of teachers for schools that serve historically underserved, multicultural student populations. In conclusion, the author asserts that a multicultural approach to training educators and practitioners is essential in an increasingly diverse society.",

        "description":"This article describes a metaphorical imaging activity used in World Educational Links (WEL), a graduate teacher certification program, to help future social justice educators explore their relationship with society and their sense of interconnectedness and empowerment to effect change. The author investigates possibilities inherent in the activity for helping to assess individual transformation, as future teachers come to view their mission in terms not of \"just one child,\" not even \"one child at a time,\" but of engaging as teacher-activists in a collective movement for social change. The activity was adapted in order to study the development of social consciousness among young people. This activity, which entails drawing a metaphorical image, is effective for initiating thought and conversation regarding how one views one's own place in, and relationship with, the wider society. In the WEL program, it is found that the metaphorical drawing activity appears to be a fruitful way to access some highly abstract but very crucial components in a transformative process that members of the dominant group must undergo in order to enable them to participate in meaningful social-economic change.(Contains 8 figures and 3 notes.)",

        "description":"One of the greatest challenges of any K-12 teacher education program is providing pre-service teachers opportunities to work with students who are culturally and linguistically different from themselves. Despite best efforts of selecting texts and facilitating discussions, new teachers recently interviewed report that coursework just did not help them to prepare for the diversity in their classrooms. The new teachers call for changes in their training and help in finding ways to work with diverse students. Preparing future teachers for diverse classrooms is compounded when there is locally a lack of racial and economic diversity among all of the students, both pre-service teachers and K-12 students. However, this is not an impossible situation to surmount. With creative and purposeful partnerships, future teachers can receive more than a textbook introduction to diversity. In this article, the authors describe the practices of two departments within the same college of education, one focused on preparing elementary teachers (K-8), and one focused on secondary teachers (5-12). The authors share two ways their departments, and in particular their literacy courses, have purposely partnered with schools whose demographics differ significantly from that of their students.

In Zambia, the current educational environment seems to indicate that the creation and continued development of ECCE programming may be premature and potentially damaging to an already tenuous primary school education system. This article aims to interrogate the call for ECCE programs in Zambia, using evidence from the existing situation in primary schools in the country as the basis, drawing on qualitative interviews conducted with 48 primary school teachers and headmasters. The authors, considering the implications of the current educational situation, question the unrestrained promotion of ECCE in Zambia, which has the potential to siphon funds from glaring needs already in existence within the educational system.",

UNESCO's Division of Basic Education Early Childhood promotes an integrated approach to Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) policy development and review. The study examines how this is implemented in three West African countries, with similar cultural groups in their diverse populations: The Gambia, Mali and Senegal. In The Gambia there is thus far a proposal on how indigenous knowledge should be included in early childhood programs. The clos d'enfants [children's groups], in Mali demonstrates similar ideas through an international partnership with a local initiative program, developed in Bamako using mothers, local materials and toys made by the participants. Senegal's program combining local traditions and European pedagogical philosophies, the case des tout-petits [children's huts], came from the President. Analysis of these three cases suggests that these programs and proposals may be a springboard for   UNESCO and partners to further develop ECCE with indigenous knowledge and practice in Africa.",

The fact that an indefinite number of institutions exist on the borders of the educational system, the lack of systematic supervision, and incomplete official statistics are only a few of the challenges. The Millennium Fund for Early Childhood Education has been developed to directly improve the quality of educators who work with Brazil's most socially vulnerable students. An innovative model of joint responsibility utilizing public and the private sectors in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, has resulted in the implementation of a social technology called Educational Board. This experimental model has been carried out in municipalities of four southern states of Brazil for the past five years. This article addresses the approach developed at the Educational Boards (which focused on in-service professional development and network capacity building), the program's impact on improving Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) in Brazil, as well as the lessons learned so far.

Interference was found when semantically related word primes were presented, but no effect was obtained using picture primes (Experiment 1). In Experiments 2a, 2b and 3, we introduced a new technique: Double-priming. The technique requires naming a picture target after presentation of two stimuli: a preprime stimulus and a picture prime. The results showed that the presentation of a semantically related preprime word slowed picture naming (Experiments 2a and 3). The interference was not due to the single effect of the preprime nor to the prime's lexical processing since related primes by themselves (Experiment 1), and primes preceded by unrelated word preprimes (Experiment 2b and 3) did not produce the effect. This pattern of results suggests that lexical access in picture naming involves two types of processes. The first is excitatory and semantic in nature; the second involves competitive lexical selection. (Contains 5 tables, 1 figure and 3 footnotes.)",

(2) To determine the colourimetric characteristics compatible with each Spanish colour basic category. To get these goals the full set of tiles included in the NCS (Natural Colour System) was used in a monolexemic naming task. Results showed that the use of chromatic categories was not only influenced by chromatic angle (Hu'v') but also by saturation (Su'v') and lightness (L*). This last parameter had a decisive influence on the responses to half of the chromatic circle (from G50Y to R50B, in terms of NCS nomenclature). Specifically, frequent B-B type categorical effects appeared: stimuli with the same chromatic angle, but different lightness being named differently. (Contains 3 figures, 2 footnotes and 4 tables.)",

        "description":"In four conditioned taste aversion experiments with rats as subjects, the effects of extinguished or pre-exposed flavors on retardation and summation tests was compared. Experiment 1 showed that when steps were taken to ensure similar exposure to the target flavor in all conditions, acquisition after pre-exposure and reacquisition after extinction proceeded at a similar rate and was slower than acquisition in a new stimulus control condition. In Experiment 2, reacquisition occurring 2 days after extinction was again slower than acquisition to a new stimulus, but this retardation disappeared when extinction and reacquisition were separated by a 21 days interval. Experiment 3 showed that both an extinguished and a pre-exposed flavor produced a similar summation effect, attenuating the aversion to a previously conditioned flavor. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that this attenuation was also produced by a new flavor. These results suggest, first, that retarded acquisition after extinction of a conditioned taste aversion might be the result of latent inhibition produced by extended experience with the flavor during extinction and, second, that attenuation of aversion to a test excitor on a summation test might not reflect any specific learning process but be simply due to stimulus generalization decrement.

        "description":"The frequency of judgment effect is a special case of Response Mode effect in human covariation and causal learning. Judgment adjustment -to [Delta]P-, depends on the trial type preceding that judgment, but that effect is restricted to situations in which participants are asked to make their judgments with a high frequency. Two experiments further demonstrated the reliability and the generality of this effect in positive and negative causal learning tasks. Experiment 1 yielded similar judgment frequency effects with a higher positive contingency ([Delta]P= 0.71) and a larger block size (n=16) than in previous studies. Experiment 2 showed that judgment frequency also modulates the detection of negative contingency ([Delta]P= -0.5), as far as judgment accuracy was shown to be a function of the type of trial just preceding that judgment in the high frequency group. Associative and statistical models of covariation learning cannot easily explain these results without incorporating relevant post-hoc assumptions. These findings add new-evidence to the growing body of data showing that human causal learning depends on the action of several mechanisms, as proposed by the Belief Revision Model.

        "description":"It is well known that the two-sample Student t test fails to maintain its significance level when the variances of treatment groups are unequal, and, at the same time, sample sizes are unequal. However, introductory textbooks in psychology and education often maintain that the test is robust to variance heterogeneity when sample sizes are equal. The present study discloses that, for a wide variety of non-normal distributions, especially skewed   distributions, the Type I error probabilities of both the t test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test are substantially inflated by heterogeneous variances, even when sample sizes are equal. The Type I error rate of the t test performed on ranks replacing the scores (rank-transformed data) is inflated in the same way and always corresponds closely to that of the   Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. For many probability densities, the distortion of the significance level is far greater after transformation to ranks and, contrary to known asymptotic properties, the magnitude of the inflation is an increasing function of sample size. Although nonparametric tests of location also can be sensitive to differences in the shape of distributions apart from location, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test and rank-transformation tests apparently are influenced mainly by skewness that is accompanied by specious differences in the means of ranks.

In Experiment 2, we reversed the source language and translators were instructed to read and repeat English sentences or to read and translate them into Spanish. Compared to normal reading, in both experiments, online comprehension was slower under reading for translation, showing that sentence comprehension varies depending on the goal of the reading. Pragmatic cues facilitated on-line comprehension only when Spanish was used as input, indicating an asymmetrical use of pragmatic information induced by the source language.

A tone was used as the pre-exposed and conditioned stimulus (CS), and a foot-shock of either a low (0.3 mA) or high (0.7 mA) intensity was used as the US. A 2 x 2 factorial design was employed. The first factor was the pre-exposure condition (72 pre-exposures or non-pre-exposure) and the second was foot-shock intensity (low or high). A more durable LI effect was observed in the low-intensity condition than in the high-intensity condition during conditioning trials. The authors discuss the possibility that US intensity modulates either a process of restoring attention to the CS during conditioning or a contextual change, responsible for attenuating the LI effect in the high-intensity condition with respect to the low-intensity condition.

Some cases from motor experiments are also presented, such as express saccades, the manual gap paradigm and ocular smooth pursuit movements.

        "description":"In this article, the author reflects on the historical work and scholarly contributions of Professor William E. Warner, an intellectual genius whose personal and professional energies were devoted to the development and cultivation of industrial arts education. Jerry Striechler challenged the author to \"get into Warner's head\" and speculate how Warner, who contributed so much to the conceptualization of technology education, would view the profession's recent accomplishments and what the future holds for it. To expand on his analysis, the author solicited feedback from two groups: one comprised of associates who worked or studied with Dr. Warner and the second composed of teacher educators or leaders who were aware of Warner's work and have leadership responsibilities in technology education today including participation in ITEA, Epsilon Pi Tau (EPT), CTTE, AERA, or related organizations. Respondents were asked to be frank and were assured that no one would be identified to ensure anonymity. The author's role was to provide a composite analysis and synthesis of their responses. He also reflected at length on his knowledge of Warner and built that into his analysis. As part of this process, the author reviewed a historical collection of Dr. Warner's personal correspondence given to him by Mrs. Ellen Warner after her husband's death, watched a video interview of Warner conducted by Dr. David Mohan, and read numerous publications written by or about W. E. Warner including Latimer's doctoral dissertation on Warner completed at North Carolina State University in 1972 under the direction of Delmar Olson, another one of Warner's doctoral advisees. To help quantify and analyze the results, the author combined the 12 statements into five groups. The author presents a brief synthesis of the results for each group. (Contains 1 table.)",

A preliminary study suggests that students majoring in industrial technology degree programs may not have adequate opportunity to formally study and engage in ethical aspects of technology vis-a-vis the practices of the profession. It is reasonable to assume that the ethical dilemmas faced by an industrial technologist would parallel those of engineers and managers. To address this issue, this paper identifies a domain of knowledge that would constitute a necessary background in ethics for industrial technologists, examines various resources for teaching, and makes recommendations from a pedagogical point of view.

        "description":"Over the past twenty years American education has seen many changes, and most notable have been those related to accountability and assessment. One aspect of these changes has been the movement toward more specified student learning outcomes. In discipline after discipline content standards have been developed outlining that which students should achieve as a result of their schooling. The field of technology education has been no exception. Early in the game, in the 1980's, standards for technology education programs (although not for student achievement, per se) were developed. Then in the fall of 1994, the International Technology Education Association (ITEA) initiated the Technology for All Americans Project. This project received grant support from both the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). To this point the Technology for All Americans Project has included three phases. Cumulatively the following have been developed: (1) a rationale and structure for technology education; (2) content standards elaborating what K-12 students should know and be able to do with respect to technology; and (3) standards for technology education programs, professional development, and assessment of student achievement. As such, these efforts over the past decade have constituted an important movement for the promotion of technological literacy both within technology education and in related circles. Although the development of the various standards has been an important task, implementation becomes the critical next step if the standards are to ever reach fruition. The most well-conceived, quality-crafted standards do little good if they sit on the shelf unused. This article examines the evidence related to awareness, adoption, and implementation of ITEA's \"Standards for Technological Literacy: Content for the Study of Technology.\" The information presented is in part related to the data generated through the external evaluation of the Technology for All Americans Project. The methodology is described briefly and findings are reviewed. Conclusions as to progress are then presented. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "author":["Volk, Kenneth S."],
        "description":"The Gary plan of &quot;work-study-play&quot; was the brainchild of William Wirt (1874-1938), though largely influenced by the philosophy of John Dewey (1859-1952). Introduced in 1907 to the schools of Gary, Indiana, by Superintendent of Schools Wirt, the Gary plan had organizational and curriculum features that fostered hands-on activities relating to occupations and daily life. It was considered progressive in nature, with an articulated and broad program being offered from primary through secondary grades. The increased notoriety of the plan's social and financial benefits led New York City to invite Wirt as a consultant to transform its overstretched schools. What followed were several acrimonious years of position papers, posturing, and propaganda by all sides, culminating in a swift end to the plan. The demise of the Gary plan in New York and then slowly in other locales throughout the nation that introduced it raises questions as to what might have been, especially as it accentuated manual arts and training, forerunners to today's technology education programs. This article first presents the issues, actors, and events surrounding the Gary plan and associated reform efforts in New York City. The inclusion of manual arts and vocational education as a fundamental feature of the plan also described. On a macro level, the politics of American education is examined as to how other reform efforts have been influenced by various factions. Finally, efforts to improve and change technology education through the recent &quot;Standards for Technological Literacy&quot; (International Technology Education Association [ITEA], 2000) are examined as to their potential for success, based on the outcomes and lessons learned from the past.

        "description":"One of the requirements of the Epsilon Pi Tau (EPT) initiation is the apprentice has to physically be at the initiation (EPT, 2004). Since the majority of nontraditional students and working professionals are physically removed from an initiation site, they have missed the opportunity to join EPT. On 8 April, 2005, the Beta Mu Chapter of The International Honor Society for Professions in Technology at East Carolina University (ECU) performed the first virtual initiation for the honorary in technology. Members of the ECU initiation team performed a face-to-face initiation for eight new apprentices while simultaneously initiating twenty more apprentices through the Internet using streaming video and an Internet relay chat client (mIRC). When the apprentices were required to respond to questions during the ceremony, the face-to-face group did so verbally while the students watching and listening on the Internet responded with a real-time, typed and transmitted text message. This paper shows the benefits that schools and EPT Chapters can realize using a common and affordable Internet technology application to increase student participation and achievement, and provide EPT membership to deserving individuals who are geographically separated from traditional initiation sites.",

        "description":"If the current trend continues, the use of computer technologies and the Internet will increase for teaching and education. It is urgent that researchers study computer and Internet deviance. The purpose of this study was to explore middle and high school students' perceptions of deviant behavior when using computers and the Internet. The target population for this study was middle and high school students. The accessible population included all students who attended a middle or high school in the East Baton Rouge Parish School, which has computers that are capable of accessing the Internet (1,150 students--575 middle school students and 575 high school students). Professor San-Yi Li of Taiwan designed the instrument used in this study. This instrument contained 66 questions and a scantron was used to record participants' responses. From the instrument, variables were selected from five sections--1) students demographic characteristics 2) computer-related activities 3) students perceptions of deviant behavior when using computers and the Internet 4) students perception of their peers deviant behavior when using computers and the Internet 5) students ability to use computers and the Internet. Results showed that the majority of students indicated they perceive their behavior as being not deviant when using computers and the Internet. Contrarily, the students indicated they perceive the behavior of their peers to be more deviant when using computers and the Internet. When the means of the Students Behavior Score and the Peers Behavior Score were compared, there was a significant different between the two scores. The Peers Behavior Score for deviance was much higher than the Students Behavior Score. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"The Black scientist in America is historically an anomaly and currently a statistical rarity. In 1984 Blacks accounted for only 2.3%, or 90,500, of the 3,995,000 employed scientists and engineers (Kusmer, 1991) Even now, in the 21st century, Blacks were 11.3% of the labor force, but only 4.2% of natural scientists, 7.6% of math and computer scientists, and 4.6% of engineers. In very simple terms, the source of the problem is obvious: There are few Black scientists because there are few Blacks in graduate science programs; there are few Blacks in graduate programs because there are few Blacks who are encouraged to take the undergraduate sources required for successful scientific careers; there are few Black undergraduates who are prepared by their high schools or grade schools to choose such courses. This article focuses on the contributions of African Americans to scientific and technological innovations. It was written not to disprove or discredit nonminorities who were given full credit for an invention or contribution to technological society but to recognize the contributions of Africans and African Americans who significantly helped mold and direct the evolution of technology. This article is also intended for technology education teachers to use as a tool to encourage African American youth to realize that they have a very brilliant heritage and wealthy history. This paper attempts to reveal a legacy of intelligence, and it serves to inspire future African Americans to keep the torch of technological innovation and invention aflame.",

        "description":"Implementing information systems (IS) is expensive and sometimes unsuccessful due to low levels of system user acceptance (Legris, Ingham, & Collerette, 2003). For this reason, IS research has focused, in part, on variables contributing to system user acceptance of technology. As a part of this effort, Davis (1989) theorized and tested the technology acceptance model (TAM) to describe how system user characteristics influence patterns in technology use. Pan et al. (2003) successfully replicated the TAM by identifying a causal relationship existing among students' perceived ease of use of WebCT, perceived usefulness of WebCT, their attitude toward WebCT, and their actual use of the course management system. They also succeeded in expanding the original TAM by adding subjective norms in addition to computer self-efficacy. These studies were conducted using students in a course on psychology. One of the two primary purposes of this study was to not only replicate this study with students in another psychology course, but to also contrast the TAM model results with results obtained from students in an engineering course. The second purpose of this study was to determine whether this model is as applicable to psychology students as to engineering students. The research question answered in this study was: Is the covariance structure of the academic TAM invariant (the same) across the psychology and engineering student data? This study included 460 students in both psychology (n = 230) and engineering (n = 230) classes using WebCT for a Web-enhanced course. The results suggest that the academic TAM is as applicable to engineering students as it is to psychology students with respect to WebCT as a course management system, although perceptions of peer pressure and professor expectations play a more prominent role for engineering students and perceptions of WebCT ease of use has a greater impact on psychology students. If it is the goal of an institution to build student acceptance of a course management system, if for no other reason than to secure student satisfaction, then these results suggest that interventions should vary by the course sequence students are designated to take (Contains 4 figures, 6 tables, and 1 footnote.)",

A total of 68 courses over two semesters were included in the study. Surveys of students and teachers suggested that the quality of learning and teaching were improved. Over 80% of the students had used Web-based teaching and satisfied with its results and a majority of them would continue to use WebCT in the future. It was found that students developed a more favourable attitude toward the subjects and the teachers in the process. Teachers were delighted with the results and appreciated the support made available to them through the project team. Some even volunteered to be &quot;mentors&quot; for future novice teachers in this endeavour. Reservation and resistance offered by a few university administrators were noted and their concern would provide future challenges and targets for improvement.

        "description":"This paper describes a pilot project that explored teacher candidates' opinions of the use of desktop videoconference technologies to provide teaching experiences that mimic the real-world practicum. Opinions were gleaned from questionnaires and reflective papers. Videoconference software was said to mimic certain aspects of the practicum such as: direct instruction, questioning, tutoring, and one-on-one scenarios that rely to a large extent on audio communication. The candidates also reported that limitations of the technology (e.g., slow frame rates, inability to capture students' facial expressions, and inability to simultaneously capture images of students' and written work as it is created) constrain its ability to mimic the practicum. The limitations lead candidates to suggest that videoconference sessions might be used by a Faculty of Education to augment but not replace the real-world practicum experience. (Contains 1 table.)",

This study investigates parents' perceptions of the benefits of music to children. Aims: To investigate why many parents in Hong Kong encourage their children to take extra music lessons beyond normal school hours, and to examine their perceptions of the benefits of music education. Sample: Questionnaires were sent to 97 parents of children attending weekend classes in 10 music centres. Method: Surveys were conducted. The questionnaire consisting of 16 items was designed to elicit parents' perceptions about music education. The parents responded to each item on a 6-point scale. Results: Music education was perceived by the parents to be advantageous for promoting their children's music-specific interest, and in their mental, motor and academic development but their ratings for interest in music and cognitive and affective development were the highest among the variables. Conclusion: The findings suggested that formal and informal music education programs should provide appropriate curriculum contents to maintain children's interest for lifelong engagement in musical activities.

        "author":["Tak, Lam Chi"],
        "description":"Background: Beginning Teachers are confronted with numerous challenges especially in their first year of teaching. Without ample induction support, the beginning teachers could merely develop their capacity on their own. Therefore, some nations implement the policy of internship so as to increase effectiveness of the beginning teachers. In Hong Kong, the Advisory Committee on Teacher Education and Qualifications (ACTEQ) introduced the proposal of internship and registration for beginning teachers in 2003; however, the proposal is still not carried out. Focus of discussion: This paper attempts to examine the proposal in an international perspective. In order to understand the direction and design of the proposal in Hong Kong, it is going to identify the proposal through text analysis. In addition, the controversies of the issue will be presented and defended. Arguments: The paper mainly explores the controversies of the internship from four sections, they include, nature of mentoring relationship, workload of mentoring, evaluation of mentoring and prospect of teaching profession. In order to deal with the challenges of induction year, whole-school approach to mentoring is suggested. It is argued that the internship of beginning teachers should be introduced as a way of improving teacher development of Hong Kong at both individual and school levels. Conclusion: By exploring related research, implementation of internship through mentoring for beginning teachers is beneficial to develop teacher effectiveness and school effectiveness. Nevertheless, the proposal should be improved before it is carried out in near future. (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "author":["Woo, Huay Lit",
          "Wang, Qiyun"],
        "description":"Background: Many of the agent-based products available to education today have been largely confined to games and instructional media that are often produced commercially by non-instructional professionals. Most of them lack customizability and are difficult to integrate into individual subject curriculum. With more agent authoring tools available and the proliferation of client-end computing, classroom teachers can now author their own agents pedagogically to produce learning environments that meet their predetermined objectives. Aims: To experiment the use of agent technology with a class of pre-service teachers (aka trainee teachers). It hopes to achieve two objectives: (1) to understand how well the agent technology is accepted by the trainee teachers, and (2) to reveal any difficulty in designing the agent-based learning environment. Sample: 16 pre-service teachers took part in this study. All of them were trainees from an educational technology module that had a main component in designing learning environment. They were second year students doing a Diploma-in-Education course in their own field of specialization. Method: Pre-service teachers were to design agent-based learning environments on their own. A questionnaire was used to obtain summative assessment from the participants at the end of the course. The score from the questionnaire was used to gauge the trainee teachers' acceptance for their learning experience. Trainee teachers' weekly self-reporting Weblog was used as a formative assessment on their learning processes and difficulties. Results: This study found that agent technology was well received by the trainee teachers albeit concerns for support by schools and the need to learn programming skills. Generally, trainee teachers were enthused by the use of scenes to support their lessons. They regarded their learning experience as positive and meaningful. They also believed that such technology would be helpful in promoting interest in their classroom teaching. Conclusion/Recommendations: Based on the results, agent-based technology is recognized as a useful tool to support classroom learning. This study recommends two measures: (1) to build a repertoire of customizable scene templates focusing on very small and specific content areas, (2) to organize optional basic agent scripting training program prior to the commencement of the course for those who are weak at programming skills.

        "description":"Background: Critical thinking disposition is an area that has been overlooked in various academic fields until recent years. Critical thinking occurs only when individuals possess thinking dispositions. This study explores the possibility of using directed viewing-thinking activity (DVTA) to cultivate the critical thinking dispositions of students. Aim: To investigate if critical thinking dispositions can be cultivated using DVTA. Sample: Students participating in this study were Secondary 3 Higher Chinese students from one of the researchers' class in a traditional English school. All 18 students were present throughout the six lessons. These students were all females between 14 to 15 years of age. Method: Pre and post argumentative essay tests were administered to the whole class before and after the students had attended the DVTA lessons. The essays were coded in terms of the indicators of the various thinking dispositions that could be spotted in them. A Wilcoxon Matched-Ranks test was used to analyze the four thinking dispositions: systematicity, open-mindedness, analyticity and truth-seeking. Results: Based on the given conditions, the study suggests that DVTA has the potential for cultivating critical thinking dispositions. Conclusion: The findings revealed that it was worthwhile to conduct the study. (Contains 2 tables and 2 footnotes.)",

Such reform is driven by a desire to have a better understanding of student achievement and clearer pathways into further education and employment. Aims: This paper examines trends since the reform of the New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC) initiated by the State Government White Paper &quot;Securing Their Future&quot; (Aquilina, 1997). Sample: The paper reports data from the total population of candidates for the HSC from 2001-2004. Results: The results show that a previous trend in New South Wales schools towards &quot;dumbing down&quot; has been reversed and meaningful vocational education and training (VET) subjects have been incorporated successfully as a major pathway in student choice. Conclusion: Reducing the number of curriculum offerings has not had an adverse effect on participation and reporting results according to a marks model of standards-referencing has made the content of achievement clear and has led to better understanding of the standards required for improvement in performance. These trends are of interest to systems planning reform. (Contains 8 tables.)",

        "description":"Background: The article provides a broad, concise overview with the intent to provoke scholarly argument and debate on an illusive, yet majestic, theme. Purpose: In this article, the authors make the case for educational leaders who are spiritual. Argument: The contemporary postmodern world society is very cosmopolitan and pluralistic. The complexities and confusion that result call for individuals in educational leadership roles, at all levels, to truly know themselves and to act out of sound beliefs and values. In human affairs, leadership need be moral, meditative, and enlightened with a clear vision of \"the big picture\" and the future. At one time relegated to lower levels of importance, a spiritual approach through service, tolerance, empathy, and empowering those being led has now gained top prominence in theory and practice and will surely continue to do so. Spirituality is deep, internal, and loving. And people of all specific religious persuasions are included, hopefully embracing common values as reflected in doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. A multidimensional, perhaps sometimes misdirected, world seemingly focused on materialism, characterized by the likes of stem call research, \"intelligent design,\" environmental concern, and quantum understanding creates a tall order for educational leaders. The article's ideas are presented in narrative which is well known for being an effective means of expressing spiritual material. As all persons are searching and no one is always right, differing interpretations of terms and expressions and language looseness are expected. Although those who are enlightened have taken a leap of faith, spirituality for many calls for broaching it in incremental stages, all the while living with inconsecutiveness and contradiction. Conclusion: Among those who truly appreciate these things and still have the courage to embrace and explore, it is known that ultimately it is only through a larger meaning of the spiritual way that effective leadership can be effected. This article emphasizes mindfulness meditation (within) and compassion for others (without) to achieve educational leadership in the spiritual way--casting things in a proper perspective of time, history, and what is known to be good and worthwhile.",

Results suggest that these tools can improve students' higher order reasoning abilities and critical thinking skills relative to academic enhancement, civic engagement, and personal growth, and as a result, can improve the overall quality of their thinking and learning. However, this assessment has also surfaced the need for further improvement, particularly with respect to academic learning outcomes. (Contains 8 tables.)",

In the present study, 481 alumni of a religious-affiliated liberal arts college participated in a phone survey that examined their present and past behaviors related to service and their current service-related attitudes. Results showed that participation in both general community service and service-learning as undergraduates was positively associated with alumni attitudes toward social and personal responsibility as well as alumni involvement in post-college community service and service-related careers. Service-learning participation exerted an effect over and above that accounted for by community service participation. Positive relationships of service-learning with outcomes generally were limited to courses that provided high-quality experiences (more hours of service, more reflection activity, and more integration of service into the course).

        "description":"Articles on service-learning champion its potential to create a win-win-win situation for the university, students, and community; however, substantial scholarly attention to pedagogical benefits for students and universities contrasts with limited research assessing community partner perspectives. This study presents findings on nonprofit organizations participating in service-learning projects as part of a graduate nonprofit management course during 2000-2003. Data indicate resource constraints of community nonprofits lead them to place a high premium on opportunity costs of staff time devoted to service-learning. Because transactional relationships are perceived as having potentially low economic risk (opportunity cost of staff time) and yielding high benefits, they are nonprofits' preferred type of relationship with universities. For universities to engage in more complex relationships, nonprofits' resource constraints must be overcome. (Contains 4 figures and 2 notes.)",

After substantiating mathematics as a gatekeeper, the author proceeds to provide a definition of empowering mathematics within a Freirian frame, and describes three theoretical perspectives of mathematics education that aim toward empowering all children with a key to the gate: the situated perspective, the culturally relevant perspective, and the critical perspective. Last, within a Foucauldian frame, the author concludes the article by asking the reader to think differently. (Contains 7 endnotes.)",

However, the source of this growth, the creativity of the mathematician, is a relatively unexplored area in mathematics and mathematics education. In order to investigate how mathematicians create mathematics, a qualitative study involving five creative mathematicians was conducted. The mathematicians in this study verbally reflected on the thought processes involved in creating mathematics. Analytic induction was used to analyze the qualitative data in the interview transcripts and to verify the theory driven hypotheses. The results indicate that, in general, the mathematicians' creative processes followed the four-stage Gestalt model of preparation-incubation-illumination-verification. It was found that social interaction, imagery, heuristics, intuition, and proof were the common characteristics of mathematical creativity. Additionally, contemporary models of creativity from psychology were reviewed and used to interpret the characteristics of mathematical creativity.",

Why do Singapore's children do so well in mathematics? The reasons are undoubtedly complex and involve social aspects. However, the mathematics texts used in Singapore present some interesting, accessible problem- solving methods, which help children solve problems in ways that are sensible and intuitive. Could the texts used in Singapore be a significant factor in children's mathematics achievement? There are some reasons to believe so. In this article, I give reasons for studying the way mathematics is presented in the elementary mathematics texts used in Singapore; show some of the mathematics problems presented in these texts and the simple diagrams that accompany these problems as sense-making aids; and present data from TIMSS indicating that children in Singapore are proficient problem solvers who far outperform U.S. children in problem-solving.

        "description":"Implementation of a problem-based mathematics curriculum, the &quot;Interactive Mathematics Program&quot; (IMP), at three high schools in California has been associated with more than just differences in student achievement. The outcomes that distinguished students who participated in the IMP program from students who followed a conventional algebra/geometry syllabus were the students' perceptions of the discipline of mathematics, of mathematical activity and the origins of mathematical ideas, of the mathematical nature of everyday activities, and of school mathematics and themselves as mathematicians. A coherent and consistent picture has emerged of the set of beliefs, perceptions and performances arising from such a program. Students who have participated in the IMP program appear to be more confident than their peers in conventional classes; to subscribe to a view of mathematics as having arisen to meet the needs of society, rather than as a set of arbitrary rules; to value communication in mathematics learning more highly than students in conventional classes; and to be more likely than their conventionally-taught peers to see a mathematical element in everyday activity. These outcomes occurred while the IMP students maintained performance levels on the mathematics portion of the SAT at or above those of their peers in conventional classes. If student achievement outcomes are comparable, the mathematics education community must decide whether it values these consequences of a problem-based curriculum. (Contains 1 figure and 8 tables.)",

Fourth-grade students' scores on the non-personalized and personalized problems were compared to investigate potential achievement differences. The scores were then disaggregated to examine the impact of reading ability and problem type on the treatment outcomes. The results showed no significant increase in student achievement when the personalization treatment was used regardless of student reading ability or word problem type (t = -0.10, p = 0.46).

        "description":"A study was conducted at Merrimack College in Massachusetts to compare the grades of students who took the recommended course as determined by their mathematics placement exam score and those who did not follow this recommendation. The goal was to decide whether the mathematics placement exam used at Merrimack College was effective in placing students in the appropriate mathematics class. During five years, first-year students who took a mathematics course in the fall semester were categorized into four groups: those who took the recommended course, those who took an easier course than recommended, those who took a course more difficult than recommended, and those who did not take the placement test. Chi-square tests showed a statistically significant relationship between course grade (getting a C- or higher grade) and placement advice. The results indicate that students who take the recommended course or an easier one do much better than those who take a higher-level course or do not take the placement exam. With achievement in coursework as the measure of success, we concluded that the placement test is an effective tool for making recommendations to students about which courses they should take.

        "author":["Julie, Cyril"],
        "description":"As is the case in any country there is a constant search to improve the mathematics offerings presented to school-goers in South Africa. The activity surrounding this search was intensified after the attainment of democracy. The primary aim of this search was to establish a mathematics curriculum that would result in productive learning and the mastery of the goals set for the curriculum. Explicitly it is stated that school education should be a mechanism to contribute towards the development of &quot;a participating citizen in a developing democracy [who has] a critical stance with regard to mathematical arguments presented in the media and other platforms&quot; (South African Department of Education, 2003, p. 9). This goal was already proffered during the struggle for liberation against apartheid and encapsulated in the alternative school mathematics program during the latter periods of that struggle. The alternative mathematics curricular movement found expression in People's Mathematics (PM). People's Mathematics was an independent development in South Africa during a particular historical moment but shared commonalities with the varieties of Critical Mathematics Education. The broad umbrella goals of People's Mathematics were &quot;political, intellectual and mathematical empowerment.&quot; It is with these goals in mind that Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) was found to be a viable approach to school mathematics with which the People's Mathematics movement could &quot;live.&quot; One of the features that stands out in the modern school mathematics curricula in terms of the goals that are offered is the development of democratic competence. This competence is an individual's (and a collective's) ability to make sound judgments about issues that structure and steer the affairs and practices of humankind. A question that can be asked is whether the goal of the development of democratic competence can be realized within the Realistic Mathematics Education framework. In this article, the author contends that RME falls short as a paradigm in this regard and offers suggestions on how RME can contribute more to the goal of development of democratic competence.

However, few empirical investigations exist that address this issue. This paper (1) examines previous research on the relationship between student achievement and technology use, (2) discusses the methodological and psychometric issues that arise when investigating such issues, and (3) presents a multilevel regression analysis of the relationship between a variety of student and teacher technology uses and fourth grade test scores on the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) English/Language Arts test. In total, 986 fourth grade students from 55 intact classrooms in nine school districts in Massachusetts were included in this study. This study found that, while controlling for both prior achievement and socioeconomic status, students who reported greater frequency of technology use at school to edit papers were likely to have higher total English/language arts test scores and higher writing scores. Use of technology at school to prepare presentations was associated with lower English/language arts outcome measures. Teachers' use of technology for a variety of purposes were not significant predictors of student achievement, and students' recreational use of technology at home was negatively associated with the learning outcomes.

        "description":"To examine the impact of transitioning 4th grade reading comprehension assessments to the computer, 219 fourth graders were randomly assigned to take a one-hour reading comprehension assessment on paper, on a computer using scrolling text to navigate through passages, or on a computer using paging text to navigate through passages. This study examined whether presentation form affected student test scores. Students also completed a computer skills performance assessment, a paper based computer literacy assessment, and a computer use survey. Results from the reading comprehension assessment and the three computer instruments were used to examine differences in students test scores while taking into account their computer skills. ANOVA and regression analyses provide evidence of the following findings: 1. There were no significant differences in reading comprehension scores across testing modes. On average, students in the paper group (n=75) answered 58.1% of the items correctly, students in the scrolling group (n=70) answered 52.2% of the items correctly, and students in the whole page group (n=74) answered 56.9% of the items correctly. Te almost a 6% point difference in scores between the paper and scrolling groups was not significant at the p less than 0.05 or p less than 0.1 level. Although the results suggest that, across all students, the modal effect is not statistically significant, this finding may be due in part to the unusually high computer access and higher socio-economic status of the sample. 2. There were no statistically significant differences in reading comprehension scores based on computer fluidity and computer literacy, but a pattern in performance suggests that students are disadvantaged by the scrolling text mode, particularly students with lower computer skills. 3. The majority of students who took the reading test on a computer indicated that they would prefer to take the test on computer. Although this sample did not include many students who had limited prior computer experience, the survey responses, completion rates, and student observations provide evidence that computer anxiety generally did not interfere with students' ability to take the assessment. 4. Providing highlighters and review markers is useful for some students. The results of this study suggest that further research is warranted to understand differences in scores when reading comprehension assessments are administered via computer to a larger and more diverse group of students.

        "description":"Since 2002, Project WHIRL (Wireless Handhelds In Reflection on Learning) has investigated potential uses of handheld computers in K-12 science classrooms using a teacher-involved process of software development and field trials. Te project is a three-year research and development grant from the National Science Foundation, and it is a partnership between SRI International and a medium-sized district in South Carolina, Beaufort County School District. In contrast to many recent handheld development projects aimed at developing curricular materials, Project WHIRL focused on the development of assessment materials. In Project WHIRL, teachers were asked to apply their own curricular materials, content understanding, and pedagogical content knowledge to the project. Teachers and SRI researchers, software developers, and assessment specialists worked together to design software and activities that could be used across a variety of topic areas and science and in multiple phases of instruction to improve classroom assessment. This design process revealed to the research team teachers' beliefs and assumptions about assessment as well as a wide range of practices they used to find out what their students know and can do, both informal and formal. In this paper, we focus on how teachers' initial teaching and assessment practices influenced the design of handheld software and the ways in which these designs have been used across a variety of teachers' classrooms. In addition, this paper provides some preliminary answers to two of the key research questions we outlined at the outset of our project: (1) What kinds of software designs can be feasibly implemented in classrooms that support effective assessment practice? (2) What are the conditions under which teachers can adopt handheld tools to support classroom assessment? (Contains 18 figures and 2 tables.)",

Descriptively there was very little difference in performance between the CBT and P&amp;P scores obtained (less than 1 percentage point). Results make very clear that there existed no meaningful statistical differences in the composite test scores attained by the same students on a computerized fixed form assessment and an equated form of that assessment when taken in a traditional paper and pencil format.

The accuracy of current large-scale assessments is undermined by construct-irrelevant factors including access barriers, a particular problem for students with disabilities. Testing accommodations such as the read-aloud have led to improvement, but research findings suggest the need for a more flexible, individualized approach to accommodations. The current pilot study applies principles of Universal Design for Learning to the creation of a prototype computer-based test delivery tool that provides students with a flexible, customizable testing environment with the option for read-aloud of test content. Two contrasting methods were used to deliver two equivalent forms of a National Assessment of Educational Progress United States history and civics test to ten high school students with learning disabilities. In a counterbalanced design, students were administered one form via traditional paper-and-pencil (PPT) and the other via a computer-based system with optional text-to-speech (CBT-TTS). Test scores were calculated, and student surveys, structured interviews, field observations, and usage tracking were conducted to derive information about student preferences and patterns of use. Results indicate a significant increase in scores on the CBT-TTS versus PPT administration for questions with reading passages greater than 100 words in length. Qualitative findings also support the effectiveness of CBT-TTS, which students generally preferred over PPT. The results of this pilot study provide preliminary support for the potential benefits and usability of digital technologies in creating universally designed assessments that more fairly and accurately test students with disabilities.

The results revealed no detriment to students' perceptions of tests or performances on tests when comparing online to paper-pencil summative assessments. In fact, students taking tests online reported lower levels of perceived test threat. Regarding formative assessment, findings indicate a small benefit for using online practice tests prior to graded course exams. This effect appears to be in part due to the reduction of the deleterious effects of negative test perceptions afforded in conditions where practice tests were available. The results support the integration of online practice tests to help students prepare for course exams and also reveal that secure web-based testing can aid undergraduate instruction through improved student confidence and increased instructional time.

Computer-based testing provides an optimal format for creating individually-tailored tests. However, although a theoretical basis for universal design is well established, little practical information is available to assist test developers in creating and implementing universally designed tests. This article discusses the application of universal design to assessment and describes how these principles are applied to a test of 3rd grade mathematics ability. I present the steps involved in conceptualizing, constructing, and implementing a universally designed test in anticipation that test developers, state department assessment coordinators, and other researchers will benefit from this application.

Data from the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show improvement in eighth grade scores in recent years for virtually all groups, but significant problems remain. The data also show continuing gaps in achievement between racial and ethnic groups in reading and math. These data suggest that the core of what students do every day in school--what they learn, how they learn, and how they demonstrate what they have learned--remains much the same as it was a decade ago and decades before that. While the heart of middle grades education may not have drastically changed in the past decades, the world has. The forces of globalization have and will continue to create a vastly different set of challenges and opportunities for today's middle grades students compared to previous generations. In 2008, Asia Society, a non-partisan, non-profit education organization, published a report entitled &quot;Going Global: Preparing Our Students for An Interconnected World&quot; (Asia Society, 2008). This author co-authored the report, with his colleagues Shari Albright, Vivien Stewart, and Heather Singmaster. Like &quot;Turning Points 2000&quot; nearly a decade ago, &quot;Going Global&quot; provides a guide for the education of adolescents that draws on research and best practices from exemplary schools. Much of what is discussed in this paper draws heavily on &quot;Going Global,&quot; which responds precisely to the questions that frame this special edition of &quot;Middle School Journal&quot;: Now and in the future, what do adolescents need to know and be able to do, and how can middle grades schools help students develop these capacities?",

The middle school movement has been a prime target for those forces that do not share the belief middle level advocates hold about the importance of a democratic, student-centered education. The future success of the middle school movement has implications that go far beyond the fate of just those middle level grades, for the success of other theoretically sound reform efforts is closely tied to the middle school movement. The author returns to the Eight-Year Study (Aikin, 1942) conducted in the late 1930s to find a perspective that fits what everyone should be about in the days ahead. The 30 experimental schools in this study were free to establish their programs without concern for the college prep curriculum that hog-tied the secondary schools of that day. The work of these pioneer educators was guided by two major principles. The first was &quot;The general life of the school and methods of teaching should conform to what is now known about the ways in which human beings learn and grow.&quot; The second was &quot;That the high school in the United States should re-discover its chief reason for existence.&quot; The middle school concept and those who seek to bring it to full life hold to these two principles and envision just such a school.",

In the current paper, the findings from a research agenda that has clear and widespread implications for educational practice are summarized. This exciting research initiative consists of studies in which both simple and relatively complex forms of derived relational responding have been targeted for assessment and remediation using interventions driven by Relational Frame Theory. A key theme running throughout the diverse content covered in this research program is the role of a basic understanding of relational responding in the teaching of critical cognitive or verbal repertoires in children. The article argues that identifying the core relational units involved in these cognitive skills, and targeting their fluid and flexible development with appropriate training, will lead to significant improvements in the methods used in many educational settings.",

        "description":"Over the last thirty years, children's behavioral health services in the school have witnessed drastic progress. Over this time, medications for mental health problems have improved. In addition, empirically validated treatments, most of which have come from behavioral psychology, have made their way into Best Practice guidelines for the treatment of children with emotional and behavioral disorders. In 1999, the U.S. Surgeon General reported on many of these practices and suggested their use to enhance treatment outcomes for children. The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) suggested the need for evidence-based practices to become a regular part of behavioral health care practice and suggested setting up and evaluating the effectiveness of such practices in demonstration projects. In addition, in the 2003-year school year, Children Crisis Treatment Center participated in a new school based program, which focused on the treatment of children with emotional and behavioral disorders in the school. Twenty-four children entered into the program over the course of the first year. Each child received a functional behavioral assessment and an individualized behavioral intervention plan. The treatments in these plans represented evidence based, best practices such as contingency management procedures like token systems with response cost, behavioral skills training, and problem solving training. The system functioned as a revolving entry program providing behavioral consultation to teachers, behavior therapy to children and direct care support to implement non-technical behavioral interventions. Of the eleven staff in the program, three had a masters' degree in counseling or a related field, who served as both behavior therapists and behavioral consultants to the teachers. Seven staff had bachelors degree in psychology related fields and one-year experience. Bachelor level staff provided direct care to the children on a rotating basis across the children's school day. The program never had more than twenty-two children at any one time. The pre-post scores represent the scores at the child's entrance and exits from the program, or entrance to the end of the school year. The average length of time represented in these scores for a child in the program was approximately 6 months. Of the original group, 18 received pre-post scores on the Achenbach: Teacher Report Form. One child's pre-post scoring pattern was in the normal range for both instruments, so we excluded his scores from the analysis. This paper represents an outcome analysis of the effectiveness of this program. Using the Jacobson and Truax's (1997) reliable change index score, we rated large behavioral response classes (or what some would refer to as psychiatric symptoms) to determine if clinically significant improvement resulted from the program. Using these measures, enhanced functioning occurred for twelve out of seventeen scores or 70% of the children. In addition, five out of the 17 or approximately 30% showed enough improvement to score as partially recovered. (Contains 1 table.)",

Thus, preschool teachers must be prepared to manage the increasing disruptive behaviors exhibited in their classrooms. Because positive behavioral management strategies are accepted by teachers and have been proven effective, token economies may be promising interventions to manage disruptive behavior in the classroom. However, little research has been conducted in this area.

This paper seeks to point out the need for greater research and development in the area of listener responding, including when the listener vocalizes and take the current analysis of verbal behavior beyond the broad category of \"receptive\" behavior to a place where we can scientifically separate the many non-vocative and vocative responses of the listener allowing behavior analysts to have a greater ability to accurately analyze the total verbal discourse.

The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for assessment, treatment and prevention of feeding difficulties in children. Identification and treatment of any factors actively interfering with feeding success is a critical cornerstone for effective behavioral interventions for feeding. Using variables that comprise the structure of a meal, this paper discusses how these variables might be manipulated in behavioral interventions for feeding problems. Recommendations for prevention of feeding problems are also presented. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Both applied and conceptual experiments based on Skinner's theory of verbal behavior have led to significant benefits for: (a) persons with language disorders and delays, (b) students who need to bridge the achievement gap, (c) professionals who work with students, and (d) individuals who wish to design functional curricula and pedagogy to meet international educational standards. In our efforts to develop schools that provided an evidence-based education that was comprehensive in scope, we needed to address complex curricular goals that could be addressed scientifically only by drawing on Skinner's theory. This need then led to the conduct of over 40 experiments on Skinner's theory leading to procedures that filled many of the gaps needed to provide a total educational experience based entirely on scientifically derived procedures and curricula. We discuss the individual and cumulative findings of this research program (from dissertations, published papers, and papers in the publication process) including procedures for individuals for whom existing procedures were not effective. Procedures were identified for: (a) inducing speech and communicative \"functions\" for persons with autism and developmental disabilities, (b) replacing faulty speech with effective communication, (c) teaching self-editing and self-management repertoires for functionally effective writing, and (d) teaching complex problem solving repertoires to professionals such that stronger treatment and educational outcomes resulted for a variety of learners. Finally, we describe how these findings and recent research in multiple exemplar instructional histories suggest procedures for teaching generative forms and functions of verbal behavior building on Skinner's work and the role of multiple exemplar instructional histories.

The results of the study were promising at the time of the publication. The second paper was a group of 10 adolescent males at the same residential treatment center. There was one therapist who was involved in treatment in both studies, the first author of this paper. The second paper used mode deactivation therapy (MDT) (Apsche, Ward, & Evile 2001; Apsche & Ward 2002). Although both papers produced promising results, the potential usefulness of the comparison in the current paper is to examine what intervention might hold more promise for this typology of adolescents.",

        "description":"This case study presents a theoretical analysis of implementing mode deactivation therapy (MDT) (Apsche & Ward Bailey, 2003) family therapy with a 13 year old Caucasian male. MDT is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that combines the balance of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) (Linehan, 1993), the importance of perception from functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP) (Kohlenberg & Tsai, 1993), and A.T. Beck's (1996) mode theory with a methodology to address the adolescents' belief system. MDT has been shown to be effective in a descriptive study with CBT (Apsche & Ward, 2002). The analysis of this case will illustrate the effectiveness of MDT as applied in family therapy. The individual in this case, David, was a troubled youngster. Although he denied ever experiencing physical and/or emotional abuse, his family of origin demonstrated extremely poor physical and emotional boundaries. David did report that he had been sexually victimized by a boy. He did not disclose the name of the boy because his parents were friends with the boy's family and the lack of appropriate boundaries in his family created an unstable atmosphere, causing David to feel compelled to follow his parent's wishes to refrain from disclosing the name. David was learning disabled. In order to make sense of and compensate for his unstable home life, David developed a complex system of personality disorder beliefs. Along with providing David with a way to cope with his unpredictable world, they also led him to commit numerous sexual offenses. David had previous unsuccessful treatment and basic cognitive therapy techniques were ineffective. Mode deactivation therapy was found to be more effective, due to its ability to address the personality disorder beliefs without challenging David to engage in dialectical debates. It was essential to incorporate David's family in his therapy since they were so involved in his life and treatment. Unexpectedly, his family made progress along with him, gaining insight into his beliefs as well as their own beliefs. David and his family learned how to balance their beliefs and modify their behavior. The family's progress inspired the application of MDT in family therapy. This theoretical case study represents mode deactivation therapy, applying theory to clinical practice within family therapy.",

Questions remain if such systems can be enhanced by the functional assessment process. This case study looks at a nine-year-old child with oppositional behavior who was on a contingency management program. After a thorough functional assessment the author determined that poor sleep patterns contributed to poor performance on the token system the following morning. This post-hoc analysis of the data conformed to a reversal design. The program showed a functional relationship between neutralizing sleep difficulty and increasing of point earned and the decreasing of episodes of response cost.

        "author":["Greer, R. Douglas"],
        "description":"The author argues that the field of behavior intervention has two subject matters that are distinct in several ways. Each is derived from, and contributes to, the foundation science and epistemology associated with behavior selection. The differences that the author wants to describe occurred to him as he sought to identify which of two Spanish phrases best represented the science--\"Analisis de el Comportamiento\" or \"Analisis de La Conducta.\" The author found the distinction between the meaning of the two compelling because they clarified issues that he and his colleagues had faced in the more than 20 years of building schools that educated the \"whole child\" based entirely on scientific procedures (Greer, 2002). To him, \"Analisis de el comportamiento\" appeared to concern behavior broadly construed as in the the behavior of matter or species and it's origins, whereas \"analisis de la conducta\" was about \"behaving well.\" \"Analisis de la conducta\" identifies the variables associated with: behaving fluently, the molecular and molar contingencies associated with existing operants, or conducting one's self consistent with the best interests of the individual and culture. \"Analisis de el comportamiento\" appeared to concern how behavior \"functions\" originate, operants or higher order operants, and how they can be induced when they are missing. It seems to the author that when operants are already in the individual's repertoire the fundamental concern is to identify the contingencies that evoke the behaviors--the existing controlling variables for behavior whether people call the behavior \"appropriate or bad.\" They are the preverbial \"performance behaviors.\" On the other hand it seemed to him that when the objective of scientific inquiry or application is to create or induce new operants or higher order operants different tactics and strategies are needed. Thus, when individuals seek to teach children to use language functionally, solve problems, enlarge their community of reinforcers, or acquire academic literacy, to name a few examples, they are engaged in \"teaching\" new operants or higher order operants. When individuals seek to identify and form new repertoires the verb \"teach\" seems eminently suitable, while the verb \"train\" is suitable for arranging controls for existing repertoires.",

        "description":"Since inception of the Ontario college system in 1967, the quality of a diploma or certificate in comparison to a university degree has been perceived as an inferior rather than alternative academic credential. As public institutions, community colleges are mandated to respond to regional labour force needs, and to provide graduates who will contribute to the social, cultural and economic strength of Ontario. In 2005, the publicly perceived value of college education continues to suffer in comparison to university education, in part due to weak marketing and brand positioning by colleges individually and collectively. Colleges must market themselves as a different rather than inferior postsecondary educational choice, a choice that leads to great jobs and successful careers. Ontario colleges have been able to distinguish themselves locally and globally. Over the past few years, as the concept of offering programs in every field within a defined catchment area has been replaced by product differentiation identifying niche strengths, colleges have become renowned &quot;on the street&quot; for unique programs. The advantage of such programs is the &quot;halo&quot; effect that leverages reputation for one program to a field of endeavour. The complete branding of the Ontario college system remains an elusive objective, with distinct individual college positioning only now emerging in print and electronic advertising and publications. Public and community stereotyping of college students as inferior academically remains at the core of the branding challenge. The image of applied learning as somehow involving dirty hands remains a predominant image, whether linked to automotive, aerospace or culinary careers. Students working with machines, blowing glass, preparing menus, or keyboarding accounts payable appear to &quot;dumb down&quot; the academic knowledge and skills imparted within college curriculum. The challenge, the author contends, is to lift college graduate career opportunities to a new level of understanding and appreciation through visual and linguistic representations designed to persuade and encourage.",

        "description":"No doubt there are detractors who cringe at the prospect of connecting the term customer service with an institution of higher education. Some may consider the term demeaning. However, given the college funding crisis and current economic climate, a quality customer service strategy is a prudent adjunct to any marketing activity undertaken. It is not the actual term &quot;customer service&quot; that is important as a function of college business, but rather embracing the quality customer service (QCS) ideal, and implementation of such strategies that are in the best interests of a college to help increase enrolment, aid retention, and build a service excellence reputation. The creation of a customer service college culture has far-ranging benefits. It builds a reputation of service excellence that permeates the larger community. A great image as an institution that cares about its student customers attracts student prospects and contributes to a positive experience, from first contact through to graduation and beyond. The bottom line is, in the best sense of the metaphor, that colleges must seize every opportunity to value their customers, potential customers, and others by developing quality customer service college cultures that embrace the ideals of empathy and other-centeredness. It is a noble pursuit for the colleges, a wholesome endeavour for college representatives, and an essential strategy for attracting and retaining college customers.",

        "description":"Both parts of the author's past--a concern with terrorism and with the education of future agents of the state who will be expected to curb, if not to eliminate, it--contribute to what he wants to say in this essay. He seeks to make six points: (1) Racial profiling is not a discrete issue but an instance of a more pervasive racism that is evident in the overzealousness of law enforcement, the discrimination inherent in the criminal justice system and the stratagems of the so-called &quot;war on terror&quot;; (2) The issue of racism is also connected to historical, legal and political events which cannot easily be isolated and which confound efforts to make it into an issue of clear ideological distinctions between right-wing and left-wing politics; (3) Much of the debate over racial profiling is compromised because it takes place within an ideological context of hegemonic liberalism which begets false and futile attempts to balance civil liberties with security; (4) To overcome this bogus debate, it is necessary to gain perspective by examining the situation from a different perspective and, since Marxism is at least temporarily disreputable, individuals must look elsewhere; (5) Above all, individuals must recognize the ubiquity of technology, not as a set of instruments or, worse, devices that are intended to achieve conscious human purposes, but as determinants of what those purposes are; and (6) At a time when Marxian social theories are in at least in temporary eclipse, there is much to be gained by paying provisional attention to the preoccupations of traditional conservatism as a means to begin the critical interrogation of the modern project and its implications for thought about technology and human rights.

The five demographic variables studied were family income, maternal education, family size, mothers' employment status, and sex of the child. Three forms of parental cognition were also studied: mothers' aspirations for their children, parenting self-efficacy, and perceptions of the school. Survey data were obtained from 97 Japanese mothers with a second-grade child. Multiple regression analyses indicated that mothers' aspirations concerning their children's occupational future were associated with monitoring homework and communicating with the teacher, as well as with financial investment in supplementary lessons. Parenting self-efficacy was negatively related to investment in supplementary lessons but positively related to engaging in cognitive stimulation at home. Mothers who perceived the school as supportive and open to communication were more likely to engage in all three forms of parental involvement. More highly educated and wealthier mothers with fewer children reported investing to a greater extent in supplementary lessons. Mothers' work status was not associated with any of the outcomes, nor was sex of the child. Survey findings were further illuminated with excerpts from in-depth interviews. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Education programs have fostered advanced levels of graphic representation ability in young children but have not detailed the specific mechanisms responsible for the accelerated growth. Research suggests that between 6 and 8 years of age children begin to observe more carefully before drawing and that observation prompts aid children's development of graphic representations. This study experimentally investigated the effects of observation coaching on the graphic representations that children produce when looking at models of animate and inanimate objects. Drawings were collected from 22 kindergartners once a week for a month. Half of the children received observation coaching that instructed them to look at objects from multiple angles before, during, and after drawing an object; the remaining half of the children did not receive observation coaching. Both casual inspection and statistical analyses of data from the videotaped sessions revealed that the coaching was effective at encouraging children to look at objects more frequently during the drawing process. Additionally, each child's drawings were evaluated using a detailed scoring system. This rating system revealed that children receiving observation coaching had significantly greater improvements in drawing scores than children who did not receive coaching. All children receiving coaching had improvements in their drawing scores, with advances primarily involving enhanced detail and conceptual accuracy. (Contains 8 figures and 1 table.)",

The children's attitudes throughout the year were measured through student surveys, parent surveys, student reflections, teacher reflective journal entries, and informal reading inventories. Even though the experimental group's perceptions of helping, closeness, collaboration, and student influence decreased after their involvement in the intervention, these perceptions were still higher than those measured at the beginning of the year. These students' attitudes pertaining to positive interpersonal relationships never lessened but grew steadily stronger throughout the year. The results also indicated that the experimental group perceived itself more as a community of learners at the end of the year than did the control group. Involvement in making decisions with classmates, collaborating in learning with peers, and engaging in multi-age activities prompted feelings of community among the children. Authentic opportunities for student-driven learning, decision making, boosting self-confidence, and collaborating emerged. Notable gains in the experimental group's reading achievement were observed. The conclusions paralleled the transactive model of teaching and supported the belief that encouraging students to socially and physically create their learning environment promotes learning while building a sense of community. Limitations of the study, such as student test anxiety, were addressed. Concluding thoughts highlighted insights into how to allow the construction process to flow more smoothly and be more effective for all involved. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)",

The inclination not to include parental views in evaluation is mainly a result of the problem of positive response bias. Researchers who study client satisfaction with educational or child care programs find that parental satisfaction ratings are mostly positive. This study helps address the problem by considering the influence of parental involvement and underscores the importance of considering parental satisfaction ratings in program evaluation. Purposive sampling was used. Parents of children in a child development program were given questionnaires assessing parental satisfaction with the program and their perceived involvement in the program. Regression analysis revealed that parental involvement positively predicted a parent's level of satisfaction with the program. To explore the specific areas of satisfaction in greater depth, cluster analysis was used to identify two distinct groups of parents based on their involvement. The differences and similarities between clusters are discussed. Results have implications for researchers, practitioners, administrators, and policy makers. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)",

As a result, QRS stakeholders lack a clear understanding of the assistance that coaches might need, as well as the additional programmatic interventions that could augment coaches' work. This article reports on a study focusing on the QRS consulting process, as well as some of the factors that present challenges to that process. The article concludes with recommendations for addressing these issues and in turn enhancing the QRS coaching process. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Early childhood contexts often enact \"common-sense identities\" that create and sustain the notion that teachers of young children are expressly female and heterosexual. It has also been argued that touch is a key difference between men and women in early childhood classrooms. This exploratory study examined 10 early childhood textbooks to determine whether images depicting touch enacted these common-sense notions. To investigate whether implicit gendered messages existed within the texts, images displaying touch between teachers and children were grouped according to three main recurrent themes: teacher touching child, child touching teacher, and mutually negotiated contact. Findings indicated that, although the images of male teachers were positive, troubling patterns did emerge concerning the type and nature of men's contact with children. These patterns worked to reaffirm larger patriarchal structures at play in schools and society while simultaneously painting women as more suitable to nurture young children. Furthermore, the texts provided clear messages to beginning teachers that acceptable types of touch were delineated by gender. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for early childhood preservice teacher education. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)",

The SIPPY is a tool designed to assess teachers' judgments of the acceptability and feasibility, as well as their current use, of literature-supported strategies for promoting the development of young children's social competence in early childhood classrooms. The questionnaire was administered to 57 female preschool teachers, the majority of whom held either a national or Florida Child Development Associate (CDA) Credential, but very few of whom held a bachelor's degree or beyond. Participants had an average of 5 years' experience as teachers of young children. Results support the internal consistency of the tool and suggest that it is a useful assessment tool for research on teachers' knowledge and beliefs about supporting social competence, as well as a tool for creation of individually appropriate professional development activities for teachers. Analyses suggest that, in general, teachers in this sample viewed literature-supported strategies as acceptable and feasible. They were more likely, however, to judge strategies as acceptable and feasible than was reflected in their current use of those strategies. These teachers also viewed more intensive strategies as less acceptable and less feasible than environmental and natural activity strategies. Suggestions are made for further research to replicate and explain these findings. (Contains 2 tables.)",

To explore this issue, a study was conducted to look at the relationship between self-reported parenting stress and actions taken to promote health and to prevent injury in preschool-age children. The study was conducted in collaboration with 15 Head Start programs in northeast Ohio. Five hundred thirty-one parents or guardians of children in the program completed a 10-minute survey on health and injury prevention administered through a &quot;talking&quot; laptop computer. This study presents new data linking parenting stress to the decreased likelihood of preventive measures being in place to reduce injury and illness risk in preschool children. Parents under stress may need social support and ways to develop a working support network to help prevent injury to young children and ensure the delivery of appropriate medical care. Early childhood caregivers and educators may have useful roles to play in such support networks. (Contains 3 tables.)",

The study was done within the framework of narrative inquiry and ethnographic impressionism. Through personal interviews and questionnaire completion, 125 parents of children ages 3 to 5 answered questions about ways in which their cultures influenced their decisions concerning taking their preschool children to dentists for professional dental checkups and how often their children saw dentists. Results of the study showed low patronage by the immigrants at dental clinics. In particular, some of the preschoolers were denied professional dental health care (by their parents) because of the parents' beliefs about dental health (such as there being no need for children to see a dentist because the children's baby teeth would be replaced by permanent adult teeth). The article recommends the education of immigrant families on the need to seek professional assistance with dental health. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Approximately 1,200 institutions of higher education in the United States offer a degree in early childhood education, but recent research questions the strength of the relationship between teachers having a degree and benefits to child development and learning. However, there has been little empirical focus on the \"quality\" of degree programs. This exploratory study examined faculty perspectives on program priorities and factors that may facilitate or impede program quality-improvement efforts. Data were obtained from an online survey of early childhood education program administrators and faculty (N = 231); additional telephone interview data were obtained from 20 survey participants. Faculty reported relying on national and state standards for guidance in designing and implementing their programs. Results indicated inadequate knowledge of current early childhood research and theory on the part of some faculty. Faculty-reported priorities to enhance program quality included strengthening student competencies (the highest priority being implementing curriculum effectively), building faculty capacity, and accreditation. When describing their program's organizational climate, most faculty reported being in implementation or maintenance mode, building mode, and change mode. Those who described themselves as being in survival mode were more likely to report low philosophical and financial support from their institutions. To improve program quality, faculty cited the following needs: more faculty, more time, institutional recognition of their program's value, financial support, professional development opportunities, and institutional understanding of the larger context of early childhood education. The paper concludes with recommendations for research, policy, and technical assistance and support for teacher preparation programs in the United States. (Contains 3 tables and 5 notes.)",

As investments in early care and education programs in the United States continue to rise, the issue of quality becomes increasingly critical. This article addresses the need for adequate infrastructure to support high-quality early care and education--a need that was brought to the forefront by James Gallagher and Richard Clifford in their 2000 article in &quot;Early Childhood Research &amp; Practice&quot; (http://ecrp.uiuc.edu/v2n1/gallagher.html). The present article provides an update and emphasizes the critical roles of infrastructure in establishing and enforcing standards, supporting quality, and ensuring quality and accountability. Progress in developing the mechanisms and systems to support and ensure quality in several states is assessed, and the perils of expanding early childhood programs in the absence of such systems are examined. Also discussed are strategies for building capacity and strengthening the various functions of infrastructure in order to successfully support the expansion of universal prekindergarten and other early care and education initiatives. The article emphasizes the importance of being able to demonstrate that these initiatives truly benefit the children who participate in them.",

Interview questions focused on teachers' perceptions of the impact of implementing the Project Approach on their ability to meet the learning needs of diverse learners. Teachers' perceptions of factors that facilitated implementation of the Project Approach were studied. Themes related to four factors emerged from the teachers' comments: (1) Participation and learning of diverse learners was facilitated. (2) Positive effects were noted for children's social and academic learning, which teachers attributed to improved motivation. (3) The availability of &quot;real objects&quot; and materials in the classroom was beneficial. (4) Positive effects resulted from including children in planning. These findings support research addressing the benefits of including children with a range of abilities in school settings and the benefits of child-initiated learning for all children. Optimal strategies for the provision of professional development in the Project Approach are explored, and recommendations for further research are suggested. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Sixteen children (8 male, 8 female) ages 5-6 years were observed. The data consisted of classroom observations by the researcher, open-ended interviews with teachers, artifacts collected from the classroom, and specific work artifacts of the children. Results showed that a total of 9 children exhibited stress behaviors at some point during the observations. Questions raised by this research include what types of classroom environments and teacher characteristics ease or contribute to stress experienced in kindergarten and whether children in developmentally appropriate settings are less likely to exhibit stress behaviors than those in setting where developmentally inappropriate practices are predominant.",

Few writers have considered how changes in the location of research and citation instruction have had an impact on these statistics. The lack of such instruction in first-year writing courses, spurred by changes in pedagogical theory on the teaching of composition, has been a powerful but subtle influence on how (or even if) research process is truly \"taught\" to undergraduates. Further, as librarians have adopted and deployed information literacy initiatives in their institutions, their responsibilities related to the ethical and effective use of sources have grown. Considering options for instructing students \"how\" and \"why\" they will want to use sources will help teaching librarians achieve their information literacy initiatives and prepare for the new and changing roles they will accept in their institution's educational mission.

Two recent studies investigating the preparation of entry level library media specialists and the frequency they perform original cataloging led to a larger examination of the topic in the context of academic libraries. One factor has been the steady decline in required cataloging courses in ALA-accredited library schools for the past two decades. A second factor is the relative supply of catalogers and how they have been reallocated within the academic library. A third factor is the increasing practice of cataloging outsourcing. Implications of high levels of cataloging by librarians lacking preparation are analyzed. The potential for flawed electronic records being shared and viewed over the Internet has implications for all levels. (Contains 4 figures.)",

        "description":"The U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has measured various types of high school graduation, completion, and dropout rates for decades. In 2006, NCES was directed by senior managers in the Education Department to reduce use of its standard graduation and completion rate measures and instead promote the previously obscure \"averaged freshman graduation rate\" (AFGR). The AFGR is an \"on time\" completion measure. In this article, the author discusses the origins of the current preference for an \"on-time\" graduation rate and the widespread acceptance of the AFGR by policymakers despite its abundant flaws which raises some troubling questions. For example, does exaggerating a problem through semantic distortion help to solve the problem, or does it misdirect attention, misplace priorities, and obfuscate public policy? Further, should education policies be based on the work of those who attract the most publicity or those with the greatest expertise? The author argues two most critical threats to the quality of education in the United States that stand out for their neglect from the press and policymakers. First, much high-quality information and expertise on education policy topics are never seen or heard by policymakers, while too much poor-quality and biased misinformation is. Second, American students arguably do not have to work as hard as students in many other countries, and current public policies in effect support that lack of effort.

        "description":"One of the main professional-development challenges social studies teachers face involves adjusting content and instruction to accommodate the surging population of English Language Learners (ELLs). Between the 1993-1994 and 2004-2005 school years, ELL school populations increased 68 percent to more than 5.1 million, compared to a 7.8 percent increase among non-ELL students (NCELA 2008). Because most ELLs are \"mainstreamed\" into content-area classrooms, the burgeoning population of non-native speakers makes instructional adaptation legally and morally imperative to provide all students with meaningful learning experiences. Providing such learning experiences is still very much an issue, even when an English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program is available to students. A short taxonomy can articulate what social studies teachers actually need to accomplish--some precise guidance on what they should be doing for ELLs, easily juxtaposed with content standards, instructional strategies, key skill domains, and dispositional objectives when crafting unit and lesson plans. This article focuses on a particular example of reconceptualizing social studies curricula through reverse-chronological history instruction, an exercise applicable to secondary ELL pull out classes and mainstream social studies classrooms alike.

        "description":"Achievement gaps concern educators at all levels today. Educators recognize the threats these gaps pose to education quality and equity, and they are working hard to close them--but an equally threatening gap in education with consequences just as serious is largely ignored. It influences every educational-improvement effort and seriously jeopardizes the chances of success. That gap is the one between the educators' beliefs about the characteristics of effective professional development and the evidence they have to validate those beliefs. Having acknowledged the gap between beliefs about effective professional development and the scientifically valid evidence that supports these beliefs, what can educators do to reduce that gap? In this article, the author discusses ways on how to close the knowledge gap on effective professional development. The first requirement is honesty about what trustworthy research on professional development has actually revealed. Second, educators must begin demanding better evidence from consultants who claim their ideas, strategies, and practices are \"research-based.\" Third, they need to get serious about evaluating all forms of professional development. Fourth, they need to press researchers to study professional development more rigorously. Finally, they need to be honest about the real world of schools and the powerful influence of context.",

As part of that research project, the authors developed a report card for &quot;Community Educational Capacity.&quot; Several indicators in the data would allow communities to set target goals that impact public school success, including but not limited to academic achievement. This report card does not indict public schools but proposes selected key variables of academic achievement to measure a region's capacity to support public education. By gathering and analyzing regional data outside the no Child Left Behind Act's mandates of adequate yearly progress, this report card could facilitate increased support for public education.

Prior to the gambling sessions, half of the participants consumed alcohol while the other half consumed a placebo beverage. They then played the slot-machine simulation three times, with the percentage of programmed \"near misses\" varying across sessions. They also played video poker three times, with the control the players had over holding and discarding cards varying across sessions. Results showed that AI participants played significantly fewer poker hands than did non-AIs and that participants played most when they had the least control over what cards were played. No significant effect of alcohol consumption was observed. Likewise, results failed to show a significant effect of the percentage of near misses when participants played the slot-machine simulation. The present results lend support for the idea that the differences in gambling problems between AI and non-AI reported in the literature are not a function of ethnicity \"per se.\" They may also suggest that providing video poker players with accurate information may have the unintended effect of increasing the rate at which they gamble.

RtI is designed to bring together information about the child's strengths and needs with evidence-based instructional approaches that support the child's success. Key components of RtI include: (1) a tiered approach to supports and services; (2) early intervention prior to formal identification; (3) screening, assessments, and progress monitoring (dynamic assessments to determine the child's needs and to plan instruction); (4) the use of standard protocol interventions; and (5) collaborative problem-solving and planning for the child with the parents.

        "description":"Because implementation of Response to Intervention (RtI) in the framework of special education's identification process still is relatively new, many districts are only now determining the implications at the school or system level. The concept of also identifying students who show promise in a nurturing framework, as opposed to a preventative framework, is even newer still. However, many of the school-level issues are similar. Teachers need to know (a) how to identify students for whom the standard curriculum is not appropriate for reasonable achievement growth, (b) how to find resources and provide differentiated activities, (c) what other alternatives are available if longer term issues are involved, (d) how to use data to make instructional decisions, and (e) how to collaborate effectively with other members of the educational community to meet the varied needs of students. These issues are the same whether the child is initially below the standard, grade-level curriculum or above it. The most critical difference between the RtI framework for special education identification purposes and for gifted education purposes is that the goal of remediation is to make children more similar to other children, whereas the goal of nurturing strengths is to make children more different. There will be \"closing of the gap\" in a remedial-based RtI Model if student strengths are ignored and the top is left to remain static while the lower achieving student grow and develop. However, in an RtI model, where there also is a strength-based emphasis, the gap between the lowest students and the highest students should expand if no cap is placed on student achievement. All students should have opportunities to make continual growth. At this time in educational history, RtI provides a means of making that happen. As education shifts in a way to allow struggling students to grow and develop, so must gifted students be allowed to develop and learn as well. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Many books and articles have been written about a Response to Intervention (RtI) model of service delivery for students who are struggling learners. However, little has been written about this model's usefulness as a means of addressing the needs of advanced learners or twice-exceptional learners whose needs may be both remedial and advanced. The National Association of State Directors of Special Education (NASDSE) define Response to Intervention as the &quot;practice of providing high-quality instruction and interventions matched to student need, monitoring progress frequently to make decisions about changes in instruction or goals and applying child response data to important educational decisions&quot;. In this article, the authors discuss why they feel that the RtI model that includes a problem-solving/consultation process is a promising fit for the twice-exceptional student. They describe the theoretical and practical implications for these special students and then take the reader through each element of the problem-solving/consultation process by discussing a case study of a gifted student who has both learning and behavioral challenges.

        "description":"As a field, gifted education does not endorse any one approach to serving students because of the range of student abilities and resulting concomitant diverse needs. Therefore, service delivery in gifted education is still heavily teacher dependent. Yet, many of the components of Response to Intervention (RtI) are employed in gifted education, albeit inconsistently, such as preassessment. Although some of the current gifted curricular and instructional models embed key components of RtI within them, they are not implemented in a coherent or strategic fashion and educational policies undergirding both RtI and effective practices in gifted education are scant. Unless RtI has leadership support and district and/or state policies, it will not be implemented with fidelity and will lose its potential as a framework for overall student achievement. Leadership and policies become the infrastructure for RtI to not only become operational but systemic. Therefore, a need exists to create state and local policies that allow for the congruence of RtI and gifted education. In the absence of federal laws or mandates governing gifted education, state and local policy are the cornerstone driving gifted education programming in school systems across the United States. The need for coherent policies in gifted education that address the components of RtI is an opportunity to bring a comprehensive perspective--one from special education, gifted education, and general education--to the table to create policies that address differentiation, tiered services, and teacher education from a common framework. As the use of state standards and accountability measures intensify, the gifted field will find it necessary to use policies as the base for creating an infrastructure to support student growth. The way people approach the practice of education is experiencing tidal waves. There are competing demands for limited resources. People can ill afford to operate on separate agendas if they want to address the need for developing optimal opportunities for their best learners. The essential question is how to embrace the betterment of all learners, including the gifted. As a result, considering a model such as RtI affords the field an opportunity to partner with regular education and special education in developing policies undergirded by research that are more dynamic and comprehensive in nature by merging and integrating the best of each field. Gifted learners and indeed all learners' educational futures depend upon it. (Contains 1 table.)",

This is in large part due to students' poor performance in core academic areas such as reading, math, and writing. Differentiating instruction in early grades could assist in closing the writing performance gap between African American and majority students, with the intended outcome of increasing the likelihood of students achieving their academic potential. Research-based strategies that improve fluency and vocabulary--potentially improving writing quality--include students counting the total number of words they have written and self-monitoring their progress. We examined the effects of self-counting (which included viewing graphs of the word counts students had written) and student use of synonym lists (which provided alternative words for students to use in their writing) on the length and quality of writing of 5 high-achieving urban African American first graders whose instruction took place in a first/second-grade split classroom. All 5 students demonstrated improved writing outcomes. The results of this study support the use of differentiated interventions for high-achieving students in order to better increase the likelihood that they will achieve in written expression at a level commensurate with their abilities.

However, much less is known about which personal, family, and school factors are correlated with student acceleration. Which children are grade accelerated in K-7 education? Have factors associated with grade acceleration changed over time? We analyze data from the NELS (students from 1988-1992) and the ELS (students from 2002-2004) nationally representative and longitudinal databases to answer these questions. Other things being equal, females, Asian Americans, and students living on the U.S. east or west coast were more likely to be grade accelerated. For example, females had odds of being accelerated that were 1.3 times higher than the odds of males being accelerated. Students from the northeastern region of the U.S. had odds of acceleration that were nearly twice (1.9 times) as high as Midwest students' odds of acceleration. When accelerated students were compared to older classmates of similar achievement who were not accelerated, the accelerated students showed greater gains in achievement than nonaccelerated classmates in and throughout high school. In other words, accelerated students do not just keep up with their older classmates, they actually perform better. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "description":"Many high-achieving students do not question their academic success. They do well and are content with the study skills they have developed to ensure that they achieve their goals. However, these students, whose high schools considered them achievers, experience difficulties and sometimes failure in situations where they had previously experienced success. Using a sample of college freshmen who had earned academic warnings or had been placed on academic probation, this research examined each individual and his or her causes of underachievement. Participants attributed their high school successes to minor efforts. Not needing to do much to earn the success they wanted, these students were never taught, nor ever taught themselves, how to work through challenging issues. When these participants encountered challenging coursework in college, they were unprepared to deal with it. Additionally, several other aspects of participants' experiences contributed to their college underachievement: inadequate study skills, poor time management, and internal versus external motivation. Participants felt that the intervention that would best reverse college underachievement was improving their own attitudes and behaviors. Through counseling and other means, gifted students need to learn how to motivate themselves to work when grades do not come easily. Colleges should be aware that even their high-achieving applicants may lack the skills necessary to succeed. In addition to offering study skills courses to underachieving students, colleges should include preemptive strategies for all incoming  freshmen, including motivational and time management strategies.

However, efforts aimed at nurturing creativity and academic learning sometimes are represented as two related but separate paths; this separation is unnecessary and can undermine the development of creative and academic potential. The idea that programs of advanced academics have \"two paths\" (one for creativity and one for academic learning) needs to be replaced with a new metaphor, and appropriate pedagogical strategies need to be developed to support that new metaphor. In order to facilitate this process, educators will need to broaden their traditional conceptions of learning and creativity to include interpretive perspectives on learning and creativity. A new metaphor, \"intellectual estuary,\" illustrates the notion that streams of creative and academic interpretations can converge and thrive when educators in programs of advanced academic simultaneously support learning and creativity. Possible pedagogical strategies that utilize intellectual estuaries include exploratory talk and Socratic seminars.",

        "description":"Academic delay of gratification is a significant and positive predictor of students' final course grades, even after controlling for the effect of their rating of the course, expected grade, and degree of interest, importance, and utility of the academic task. Students' expected course grades are by far the strongest predictor of their final course grades. This suggests a student's expected grade in a course is associated with academic achievement in that course. Because expectation of grades alone should not be the focus of students' motivation, students need to learn how to use other factors to motivate themselves and to develop learning strategies that support mastery and a mastery orientation. Students' ratings of a course are not a significant predictor of their final course grades, which suggests that students' perception of the course are not directly associated with the grades they obtained in the course. This suggests that academic delay of gratification helps students to orchestrate their academic progress, enactment of goals, task completion, and eventual academic achievement. Judging by its role in predicting students' final course grades, academic delay of gratification explains a statistically significant amount of variance in students' academic achievement.

The concepts presented have applicability that is not exclusively rural, but they derive from studies done with rural students and take rural culture, history, and circumstances into account. Understanding the context of gifted rural students is essential if educators are to identify and teach them effectively. The author notes that doing so is critical for the sustainability of rural communities. These communities need gifted and talented students who understand and love them to invest their own lives in caring for such places. The author groups the studies reviewed into sections about rural values and culture, being gifted, identifying gifted rural students, options for educating gifted rural students, and teaching teachers to teach gifted rural children.

The district developed new policy; disseminated the policy with lists of characteristics of HUGS; provided a workshop for first-grade teachers to encourage early referrals; and provided alternative tests to students who were referred for evaluation and who scored at least one standard deviation above the mean on an individually administered comprehensive intelligence test, but who did not score high enough to qualify for placement according to state regulations. Of the historically underrepresented children referred for testing, 29% qualified for placement in the gifted program. The county's efforts appeared to increase placement of HUGS; however, the new policy excluded some HUGS who would have been identified under the old policy. Consequently, the county made a decision to combine elements of the new and old policies. (Contains 2 tables.)",

It argues that rural schooling shares the miseducative purposes common to American schooling in general (i.e., purposes associated with sustaining American global economic dominion). It frames rurally appropriate education as an on-the-ground pursuit of rural alternatives in American life, alternatives explained as the engagement of rural ways of being, living, and knowing--alternatives that only a small minority of rural schools currently embraces. The essay applies the insights it develops about intellectual engagement in rural life to school provisions for academically able rural students. Because gifted students demonstrate a high degree of academic aptitude, the recommendations concern engagement with formal literatures about rural ways of being, living, and knowing.

        "description":"In the past two decades, the role of language in the science curriculum has become prominent in science education literature. From a constructivist perspective, language mediates social interaction and meaning is constructed as learners interpret and reinterpret events through the lens of prior knowledge. This perspective applied to the science classroom results in the view that scientific knowledge is socially constructed, negotiated, validated, and communicated in the context of the specific discourse practices of science. The rhetorical goal of scientific discourse is consensus based on evidence rather than compromise or conciliation achieved through democratic processes. As scientists attempt to reach consensus, they engage in a process known as \"argumentation\" whereby they attempt to persuade others of the validity of their claims. In fact, argumentation has been called the \"language of science.\" Argumentation has also been identified as a possible mechanism for conceptual growth and change. In this article, the author begins by briefly discussing forms of argument and describing two frameworks that may be used to analyze arguments. Next, the author reviews the science argumentation literature, highlights themes, and examines research trends. Finally, the author poses questions that could be addressed by future research and reflects upon two pedagogical implications that arise in the science argumentation literature.

Local, current, and personally relevant issues provided the context and organizational scheme for the STS section. The two approaches were evaluated using six different domains: (1) Concept, (2) Process, (3) Application, (4) Creativity, (5) Attitude, and (6) Worldview. The results indicate no difference in results at any grade level in the Concept domain. However, significant differences in terms of learning with large effect sizes were found in the other five domains. STS provided an impressive teaching approach utilizing the features of the National Science Teachers Association's (NSTA) (2006) position paper regarding STS in all assessment domains.

        "author":["Howes, Elaine V.",

        "description":"Role-playing can be an engaging and creative strategy to use in the college classroom. Using official accounts, personal narratives, and diaries to recreate a particular time period, event, or personality, the instructional strategy alternately referred to as role-playing, dramatic improvisation, or first-person characterization can be an effective way to have students discover and share multiple perspectives. Preservice science teacher education would seem to be a natural \"fit\" with role-playing pedagogy. While little has been written in this regard, Metz (2005) describes an innovative approach used with prospective science teachers where each student was assigned a role that correlated with a museum exhibit. This exercise served as a mechanism for science teaching and resulted in a more authentic learning experience because students experienced real-life activities in historical context. Nearly 40 years ago, Hughes (1971) noted that prospective science teachers' common vision of a scientist was \"a \"brain\" that engages in dull, monotonous, time-consuming work and has no time for ... a family or other earthly pleasures.\" Unfortunately, visions of scientists among children and preservice teachers have changed little in the ensuing years. Representing scientists as exceptionally intelligent, antisocial, White men working in laboratories, these persistent stereotypes alienate many students and serve to mask the genuine diversity of historical and contemporary scientists. Thus, the authors believe that learning how to teach science involves critiquing these stereotypes and developing realistic visions of actual scientists. This article discusses a strategy created to address the ongoing educational concern of students' stereotypical visions of scientists. It provides a description of a role-playing project designed to inspire education students to rethink their stereotypes of scientists and replace them with real-life examples to carry into their science teaching.

        "description":"Despite its central role in science, creativity is a characteristic consistently ignored in popular representations of scientists and their work, especially as they are presented in science classrooms. Ignoring creativity and other qualities that are important to the practice of science not only leaves students with a misunderstanding of science, it also limits the qualities and characteristics with which they can identify in the science classroom, which will potentially alienate them from further study. This is of particular concern in students making their first decisions about what science is and whether they see themselves pursuing science in the future. Researchers, such as Koehler, Park, and Kaplan (1999), have argued that the key to bringing new students towards scientific careers and improving their scientific literacy is engaging them during their elementary years. To address this concern, this study explores three creative activities designed to teach students about Earth and space science and to allow them to explore and express their understanding in imaginative and subjective ways. The goal of these activities was to show students that creativity is an important quality in science with the hope that this would broaden their perceptions of the practice and learning of science and allow a wider variety of students to build a science identity.

The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction instrument was administered to students at the end of every course at a major Canadian university over a three-year period. Using a two-step analytic procedure, a latent variable path model was created. The model showed a moderate fit to the data (Comparative Fit Index = 0.88), converged in 10 iterations, with a standardized residual mean error of .03, X[superscript 2] (149) = 1988.59, p less than 0.05. The model indicated that course characteristics such as status and description are not directly related to student ratings. Rather, they are mediated by student engagement, which is measured by student attendance and expected grade. It was concluded that, although the model is statistically adequate, many other factors determine how students rate their instructors. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have resulted in the increased scrutiny of both immigrants and non-immigrants entering the United States. The latter group includes students who enter the country on temporary visas to complete programs of higher education. Depending on the source, the number of foreign students in the United States has remained constant or fallen since 2001, and there has been a large decline among students from predominantly Muslim countries. Canada, by contrast, has relaxed its entry requirements for some foreign students and there has been a concerted effort among Canadian universities to increase foreign student enrolment. We find that the number of foreign students in Canada did increase following 9/11, especially those from predominantly Muslim countries. We discuss some of the implications of this increase in foreign students for Canadian universities and the Canadian labour market. Although these results support the hypothesis that changes in U.S. immigration policy are responsible, causality cannot be inferred from our data. This underlines the need for better data to adequately address the post-secondary education choices of international students. (Contains 4 tables, 4 figures and 22 notes.)",

        "description":"In response to the growing number of sustainability policies being enacted at higher education institutions, this article examines the relationship between policy and pedagogy, asking how policy texts can both enable and impede the implementation of sustainability pedagogy in higher education. To explore this question, we have undertaken a case study at the University of British Columbia, analyzing two campus-wide visionary policies that call for sustainability education: &quot;Trek 2010: A Global Journey and Inspirations and Aspirations: The Sustainability Strategy&quot;. We analyze these documents to show how the goals and strategies within them have the potential to affect the teaching and learning of sustainability across the university, directly and indirectly. Our analysis is coupled with a series of suggestions on how the policy process might be better executed in the future for more pedagogically effective sustainability policy.

The current study examines how different types of in-class behaviour are related to teaching anxiety and personality. Higher neuroticism and lower extraversion are related to higher levels of teaching anxiety. Professors with high neuroticism employ in-class strategies such as student-to-student discussion and group work, which may help to diminish the levels of anxiety by diverting attention away from the instructor. Personality is an important factor to consider when examining the relationship between teaching anxiety and specific strategies used within the classroom. In particular, understanding the role of personality characteristics would allow the professor to adjust coping strategies that may be important to circumventing or minimizing anxiety-provoking situations that may arise.

In many ways this struggle may be characterized as a negotiation between two distinct policy goals: providing revenue to adequately finance higher education and ensuring student accessibility to higher education. The Government of Ontario has wrestled with these competing questions, resulting in major changes to tuition policy over the last 10 years.

        "author":["Nathan, Linda"],
        "description":"Schools that encourage teachers to do excellent work, as Boston Arts Academy (BAA) does, are &quot;professional learning communities.&quot; A professional learning community exists when the entire faculty and staff, including the administration, work together towards a shared set of standards and assessments that are known to everyone, including the students. Such a school is a learning environment not only for the students, but for all the adults, who never feel that they have &quot;got it right,&quot; that no more learning as an educator is necessary. Standards and assessments are continually retooled as teachers and students become more proficient. A school that is also a professional learning community recognizes that work with students and adults is on-going and embodies the values of continual growth, risk-taking and trust. Certainly, teachers have opportunities to learn content, but the ways and conditions that teachers learn both individually and together, share their practices, and even disagree are the characteristics that constitute a vibrant learning community. In this article, the author describes the development of the professional learning community at BAA. She contends that friendships and emotional connections arising among teachers are important, but they do not substitute for necessary professional support and growth. Teachers must have structured time to share, write, and talk about their teaching and their students. Otherwise, teaching is a solitary activity, all too often leading to unsatisfactory results for both teachers and students. A school with a healthy professional learning community will maintain a razor-sharp focus on student achievement; its faculty will feel a common ownership and responsibility for that achievement; and its students will achieve success.",

        "description":"Teaching is a messy profession, the details of teachers' work are tightly woven into the myriad ways of humans. Even with uncertainty, teachers do improve their practice. In this article, the author describes how she moved her thinking forward over 35 years as an increasingly experienced teacher. Like many CES teachers, the ways that she has increased her knowledge, or learned new things, have come through a wide array of sources, some of which have been book- or research-based, and some of which have been through formal professional development. At the same time, a lot of her growth, especially once she settled in at Fenway High School, came through conversations with others, watching their head of school or another teacher taking risks and analyzing with them afterward. All of them trying to make really good, informed guesses. They are watching for good results, and then figuring out and sharing with others through talk why their efforts did or didn't work. The author contends that good teaching is a conversation; it is always at least a duet. With students, the conversation works or doesn't work depending on the myriad and mysterious ways that teachers build trust across age, gender, ethnicity and personality. With colleagues, knowledge that influences practice grows as teachers share it and &quot;work it&quot; with each other. Good talk is difficult but it makes teachers' work more powerful, satisfying, fun, and beautiful.",

        "author":["Morey, Natalie"],
        "description":"At Maryknoll School in Honolulu, Hawaii, a Coalition of Essential Schools affiliate since 1995, teachers and administrators are continually working on the issue of building capacity for leadership. This has led to implementation of an alternative to the traditional salary scale. The Compensation Committee, made up of teachers, administrators, and school board members, is charged with all matters pertaining to compensation, and has diligently worked for some time now to design a vehicle that is heavily weighted toward the development of teacher leaders and professional growth. Today, as a result of this vehicle, more teachers are reflecting, self-evaluating, and taking responsibility for their own professional growth and learning. More than ten years ago, the school began an investigation into both evaluation practices and a more equitable means of compensating teachers. The school wanted to clarify expectations and further define what a Maryknoll teacher should know and be, in accordance with best practices and the Common Principles. Although most teachers were aware of the direction the committee and school board were headed, at that time, no one on the committee wanted to use the words &quot;merit pay,&quot; which evoked a sense of compensation plans used more often in the corporate world. In the educational arena, &quot;merit pay&quot; is sometimes viewed as divisive. As well, at that time, Maryknoll was already undergoing significant change as the result of the decision to affiliate with the Coalition, so serious contemplation of the idea was postponed. In this article, the author describes the plan which was devised after an exhaustive examination of the pros and cons a decade later and implemented in the 2006-2007 school year to compensate teachers differently.",

Parker Charter Essential School, and its partner, the Theodore R. Sizer Teachers Center, in Devens, Massachusetts. Now in its sixth year, NTC is designed to bring to adult learners the 10 Common Principles that members of the Coalition of Essential Schools feel so compelled to offer their younger students. Throughout their one-year apprenticeship, interns (called &quot;Collaborating Teachers&quot;) learn to teach by teaching, with the coaching of exemplary mentor teachers and the support of a year-long seminar. The year culminates in their presentation of a portfolio in which participants reflect on their experience and document their attainment of the professional standards for teachers. This commitment to teacher training was integral to Parker's design and charter from the start. Theodore and Nancy Sizer, key founding trustees, saw the new school as an opportunity to create a school-based teacher preparation program.

The global perspective relates to the Eagle Rock School and Professional Development Center's mission of engaging educators in forging renewal and reform initiatives in schools across the country. Molding tomorrow's educational leaders begins with core training during which Fellows are oriented and begin the community-building process. Throughout the year, Fellows gather together as a cohort once a week for learning seminars facilitated by skilled professionals in the field.

          "Mantil, Ann"],
        "description":"Capital City Public Charter School was founded in 2000 with a vision of an academic program built on progressive principles and research on educational best practices. An Expeditionary Learning school and CES affiliate, Capital City was not standard fare for graduates of the average teacher training program. From the beginning, it was clear that a critical challenge would be the recruitment and retention of teachers who were committed to experiential education and skilled in active pedagogies. In this article, the authors describe the Teaching Fellows program which the Capital City founders created in response to this challenge. The Teaching Fellows program has evolved over eight years but remains a core element of the school's approach to professional development and teacher recruitment. Each classroom in the school, which includes 240 pre-kindergarteners through eighth graders, is staffed by two full-time teaching professionals: (1) a highly qualified lead teacher, who typically has at least two years of teaching experience prior to assuming this role; and (2) a Teaching Fellow, who is usually a classroom novice. These two individuals embark upon a one- or two-year journey together during which they collaborate to plan engaging and standards-based &quot;learning expeditions,&quot; meet the academic and social needs of the 25 students in their class, and challenge themselves to develop as educators and leaders. While the Teaching Fellows model requires a significant financial commitment, investing heavily in the teachers is critical for student success. Having two dedicated and talented educators in each classroom means a greatly reduced student/teacher ratio and more capacity for providing differentiated instruction. Moreover, the Teaching Fellows program gives Capital City a pipeline of highly trained lead teachers with experience using active pedagogies and fluency in their understanding of child development. These new lead teachers, in turn, become mentors of a successive cohort of Teaching Fellows--a cycle of professional growth that provides continuity in the classrooms and steady improvement in the quality of instruction the students receive.",

        "description":"It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them. Educators are very serious about education in CES schools. However, in their earnest attempts to engage students in meaningful and thought-provoking work or dialogue, is it possible that they are missing out on the crucial downtime of childhood: play? Most people who know about children agree that play is essential to their growth and health. Play comes in a variety of forms, and can be defined as self-managed, creative, light-hearted, and spontaneous, involving rule making and breaking. Early childhood researchers have done much to forward the cause of play as a vital part of the development of young children, and have documented benefits of imaginative, social or \"free play.\" A 2006 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics said free and unstructured play \"is healthy and, in fact, essential for helping children reach important social, emotional, and cognitive developmental milestones as well as helping them manage stress and become resilient.\" However, playtime is in direct opposition to many school districts' emphasis on standardized tests scores, since as the fiscal and public pressures to perform well on tests increase, the number of gym, art, music or drama classes tends to decline, as does time for recess. In this article, the author shares some thoughts on play and learning in schools and offers a few suggestions for ways to make physical activity in schools more like play.",

        "description":"Wellness is written into the very bones of The Native American Community Academy (NACA). The school's triumvirate mission includes integrated curriculum, cultural/language context, and a wellness philosophy. This philosophy encompasses a holistic approach to each student and considers his or her intellectual, physical, social, emotional, and community relationship wellness. The wellness philosophy was developed using the medicine wheel, the values of which are present in many indigenous communities. Though the medicine wheel has different significance to different tribes, the common idea is the wellness of the individual considers the intellectual, emotional, spiritual, and social health of individuals and their relationship to all of life. From this medicine wheel, NACA developed a wellness wheel with similar values, and an approach to the development of wellness. There is a baseline holistic understanding that all components of the wellness wheel are connected and interreliant. In this article, the authors give an overview of what this wellness wheel and philosophy look like at NACA.",

        "description":"Classroom management. Two words that can make or break a teacher, a student, or a school. The management of behavior and logistics in a classroom is, for many, the cornerstone of instruction. Veteran teachers can recall classroom management strategies that drew on rewards, punishments, combinations of the two, and a good healthy dose of fear from time to time. At Westminster Center School (WCS) in Westminster, Vermont, classroom management is about building a tone of decency and respect in order to create collaborative communities in which students feel safe and supported. At WCS, teachers face the universal challenges of teaching in the twenty-first century--increasing poverty, intense family dynamics, and an increasingly isolated social culture all of which can lead students to act out in the classroom. For them, the solution lies in the idea of presence. Being present is simply to have awareness in the moment of what is unfolding both within and around a person so that he or she can connect with it. Others say that &quot;being present&quot; is about focusing a person's attention on one thing at a time, and focusing fully on the person or task before a person rather than multitasking, doing many things with partial, fractured attention and intention. For WCS teachers and students, being present is the cornerstone of their learning experience, and there are several routes to that presence. In this article, the author discusses how mindfulness and yoga practices can be a route to &quot;being present.&quot; (Contains 12 resources.)",

        "description":"Schools face a relentless torrent of demands without receiving the kinds of support they need and deserve. So it is not easy to expect that they would voluntarily add to their ever-growing lists of responsibilities. Essential schools have the responsibility of educating not only their own school communities, but also the larger community about the value, relevance, and requirements of a student-centered education. Academics and activists can write and speak about schools that are engaging and intellectually challenging, but their words do not match visiting such schools. Experiential learning matters just as much for adults as it does for students. It falls to Essential schools to provide opinion and policy makers with the images and experiences of what works, what is possible, and what it takes. The harmful consequences of not engaging the larger community are evident to people every day. Educators have largely ceded the public debate about education to others. It is certainly true that everyone from parents to policymakers has much to contribute to creating good schools. Yet having attended school, or having children that attend school, does not, as many seem to think, make one an expert. In this article, the author discusses how essential schools can be agents of change and influence in educating the world.",

        "description":"When one listens to Southside Family Charter School kids articulate the lessons they've learned from the school's civil rights curriculum, it's clear that demographic descriptors often lead to low expectations. These kids are articulate, knowledgeable, and deeply engaged in their study of the civil rights movement. They bring the same competence and ability to their study of Native American history, treaty rights, and current challenges. Ditto their knowledge about environmental racism and their activism on behalf of a better urban and global environment. And they are eager to talk about the political implications of redistricting, their community garden and the importance of composting, and legal challenges facing youth. But at Family School, social justice means more than youth engagement and a basic commitment to equity issues. It means that children themselves learn by doing social justice work, and do so well in their academics because they have learned that education is about them, about the roots of racism and its local legacy, about the reasons nearly half the houses in their neighborhoods are foreclosed, about the systemic reasons their mothers are poor and about why asthma rates are so high in big cities. They also know what needs to be done to change the picture; action is central to the curriculum. It is the dynamic interplay between learning and doing that makes the Family School pedagogy so compelling. (Contains 2 resources and 3 online resources.)",

What haunts the author most about No Child Left Behind's (NCLB's) sound and fury is that this legislation--far from signifying nothing--has helped lock in place the very structures of schooling that most need change. For decades, schools have relied on test scores as outcomes, increased graduation requirements, and tried to teacher-proof their classrooms. None of these steps have helped engender the school renewal people seek. The Forum for Education and Democracy was founded to try and turn around this misguided agenda for schools. At the Forum, they are committed to taking seriously the mission of the public school system--the development in all of the children the tools necessary for lifelong learning and engaged citizenship. The author calls on everyone to help the next administration craft policies that help ensure all young people acquire the skills and self-confidence they need to be seen and heard--both in their schools and throughout the democratic society--in meaningful, responsible ways.",

        "description":"Rhetoric is a discipline with a long and storied past with its roots in the seminal moments of democracy. In the incipient democratic societies of ancient Greece, rhetoric grew out of the new need to persuade large groups of people to come to a consensus. Public speaking, though featured prominently in many states' standards, is rarely a required part of any high schools' curriculum. Standards include it as part of Language Arts, but the art goes largely ignored to allow for more time to prepare for AP or standardized tests. Teaching rhetoric consumes precious time. Most schools have found ways to include the standard in small ways into every class. Rhetoric is everywhere and, therefore, nowhere. Secondary schools followed the lead of major universities, where, around the turn of the 20th century, rhetoric was absorbed into departments of English. English became literature, and literature, preoccupied as it is by the written word, leaves out the art of the spoken word. In other schools, public speaking has become a specialized sport in the form of Speech and Debate teams. These teams prepare a select few but neglect the masses. In this article, the author describes how he purges any hesitation students in his class might have about speaking publicly by having students give impromptu speeches. The author contends that rhetoric should be seen as an essential teaching tool to motivate and empower students.",

The visitors read a story which makes sense to them and builds on what they already know and interests them. Increasingly, robotics models are being used in natural history museums, science centers, and zoos to attract visitors and tell some kind of story. What do the visitors actually talk about when looking at such robotic animals? The visitors reported on in this paper were primary school groups and families. Do they talk about similar things at the same exhibits, even though the schools visit for educational purposes and the families of their free choice in their leisure time? Furthermore, within school groups, do different subgroups respond in a different way, gauged by the content of their conversations, to similar robotics? This paper studies the conversational content of primary school and family groups at two different robotics dinosaur exhibits in the Natural History Museum, London. One of the exhibits is no longer on display. These verbal responses were analyzed through using a systemic network. Results indicate that visitors commented on a very simple story told through the design of the exhibit and the movements of the specimens. Visitors also noticed the salient features of the animatronics models as reptiles. (Contains 4 figures, 4 tables, and 1 endnote.)",

The My Class Inventory (MCI) was used with 588 3rd- to 5th-grade students in Texas in evaluating the effectiveness of instruction using a textbook, science kits, or a combination of both. Various analyses attested to the factorial validity and reliability of the MCI and suggested that using science kits was associated with a more positive learning environment in terms of student satisfaction and cohesiveness. Higher student satisfaction was found in classrooms with greater cohesiveness and less friction and competition. Qualitative data generally supported the findings from surveys.

Classroom observations, Constructivist Learning Environment Surveys (CLES), and interviews were conducted to assess their use of constructivist practices. Data suggest that teachers' use of constructivist practices increased following completion of the GK-12 program. Scores in each of the five CLES categories were significantly higher two years post program involvement than at the end of the program (p less than 0.05).

        "description":"Media--text, images, audio, and video--underwent a transformation from analog to digital formats during the transition from the 20th to the 21st century. Digital media can easily be replicated, downloaded, revised, edited, and reposted, and the implications of this are affecting education, government, entertainment, culture, and society. The transition from atoms (analog media) to bits (digital media) is the first half of a digital revolution. The second half involves the round trip back from bits to atoms to enable the creation of tangible materials based on digital designs. With support from the National Science Foundation  (NSF), the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms has developed digital fabrication laboratories, or \"Fab Labs,\" that allow individuals to create almost anything. Fab Labs include devices such as computer-controlled laser cutters and milling machines for assembling 3D structures from 2D parts. Today, computer-controlled fabrication systems that are the microcomputer equivalent of MIT's Fab Labs are emerging. A personal computer-controlled diecutting machine that shapes paper, cardboard, and vinyl can be purchased for less than $500. The advent of personal fabrication systems makes it possible for schools to begin exploring the educational implications of the digital fabrication revolution today. This article discusses the many educational opportunities this technology provides for addressing subject matter content across almost every subject and grade level. Fabrication technologies provide  exposure to many mathematical and engineering concepts. Scaffolded practice for students in upper elementary grades and above provides the opportunity to see abstract visualizations--including students' own drawings and sketches on the computer--translated into physical objects, offering an opportunity to explore these ideas at an early age in a  very concrete way.

This way of thinking is the quantum perspective. Our second purpose is to illustrate how the metaphors of this emergent perspective can add to understandings about leadership, in particular when fostering commitment and dealing with conflict. To these ends, we first describe selected differences between the entrenched perspective on organizations and administration--the newtonian perspective--and the new quantum perspective. In this section we give particular attention to the quantum notion of a pervasive energy field that drives change as well as recent discoveries about the ways humans think. Next we contrast the values ascribed to an individual's public and private selves in newtonian and quantum organizations. Finally we consider how the newtonian and the quantum orientations in leadership are likely to affect the commitment of an organization's members. And we relate this to findings from research on the management of conflict. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The study is framed by the author's personal inquiry into how psycho-social factors at the classroom, school and school division level influence science program delivery. In line with case study methodology, the inquiry uses a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods and data sources to identify the contributors at the classroom, school and divisional level to science delivery. A validated science program delivery evaluation tool, the Science Curriculum Implementation Questionnaire (SCIQ), is used as the foundation for the quantitative data collection and ensuing teacher, administration and science education community discussions. Bronfenbrenner's bio-ecological model and Rutter's views on resiliency are used as a framework for interpreting the data collected and understanding the factors supporting successful science delivery. Participants identify a variety of personal attribute and environmental factors and the interplay between these factors as supportive factors contributing to effective science delivery at the classroom, school and divisional level. Implications of this inquiry are discussed, especially within the context of the role of the superintendent in influencing curriculum delivery. (Contains 2 tables and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"Economic growth in New Brunswick is increasingly dependent on the improvement of our educational system. Current initiatives to reform education and improve student performance are based on transforming the province's schools into professional learning communities (PLCs). A key factor that will determine this reform's success is the capacity of principals to adopt a collaborative leadership style. This paper examines a study of principal decision-making and the forces both for and against the adoption of the collaborative leadership style required to implement the current school reform. While the majority of principals studied, exhibit the capacity to lead using a collaborative decision-making style, the bureaucratic system in which they work may be preventing them from doing so.

        "description":"Over the past four decades, the concept of leadership has become increasingly more complex and elaborate. Considerable debate has emerged over the most suitable model for educational leadership. Dominating the literature are two conceptual models: instructional leadership and transformational leadership. This paper will review the conceptual and empirical development of transformational leadership as it evolved through the work of James MacGregor Burns, Bernard M. Bass, Bruce J. Avolio, and Kenneth Leithwood. Moreover, the paper will discuss some of the conflicting opinions and diverging perspectives from many of the critics of transformational leadership. The author argues that transformational leadership will continue to evolve in order to adequately respond to the changing needs of schools in the context of educational accountability and school reform.",

Using a bottom-up approach to policy implementation in the literature and the author's six years teaching experience in Nunavut, the paper argues that the compulsory school attendance policy may not achieve its objectives unless the District Education Authority (DEA) of each community is allowed the flexibility to adapt the policy to its local context. Because each community in the territory has a different micro-implementation environment, the DEA in consultation with principals, teachers, parents, and other community members would be able to construct effective implementation plans based on the latitude that the policy allows them.",

It is clear that public policy issues for cyber-bullying involve tensions between the values of freedom of speech, the best interests of the child, and parental and school protective authority over the child. Given the complexity of the problem, as well as conflicting values, the development of effective policy requires a collaborative effort involving all stakeholders--policymakers, school officials, parents and youth. It is important to emphasize literature that delineates the differences between conventional bullying and cyber-bullying because the two are very different and must be treated and analyzed separately. Thus, the following sections set out the definitions and mechanisms of cyber-bullying for policymakers contemplating new and/or modified policies, review the characteristics of the problem and the psychology of Internet abuse, explain the physical and mental consequences of it, and outline the results of recent surveys on cyber-bullying. Finally, the article concludes with recommendations on implementing acceptable use policies at the School Board and individual school levels, as well as family contracts for home use.

This paper contributes to this growing area of research with a design-based research project that used a comparative case study design. Specifically, we compared case discussions from two different sections of the same educational psychology course for student teachers, each taught by one of the authors. Case discussions in one section were characterized by broad participation but  little grounding in psychological theory while those in the other section were characterized by strong use of psychological theory, but much narrower participation. We then used a set of principles for facilitating productive disciplinary engagement to help explain these differences, further testing and developing them. Each  instructor's way of using cases had both positive and negative effects on the embodiment of  the principles and thus on the nature of the student teachers' resulting engagement in discussions about  them. We close by discussing the implications of the study for future research, theory development and the use of case discussions, especially in relation to how  they can be reconfigured to better balance student authority with disciplinary accountability.

This article summarizes the results of a study comparing the effectiveness of two types of vignettes (evaluation and synthesis) as instructional tools and assessment tasks in five sections of an educational psychology course. Study results suggest that the positive effects of vignette instructional and assessment tasks on student mastery of subject matter are additive, regardless of the type of vignette. Mean quiz, assignment, and posttest scores in the two sections that received vignette instruction were significantly higher than those in sections that did not receive vignette instruction and differed only in terms of assessment style (forced-choice, summarization, and vignette). Scaffolding vignette instruction not only enhanced vignette assessment performance as a measure of transfer of course content, but also enhanced recognition and recall of course content.

This paper proposes a way that the network perspective can illuminate difference in how textbooks are perceived and used, by analyzing book purchases related to purchases of textbooks. Using information available from the Amazon.com website as a starting point, the author suggests how patterns of correlated purchases (i.e. books also bought with a target book) suggest a strategy for understanding the character of particular texts about educational psychology, as well as the role of the text in teaching educational psychology.

Comparisons will be developed  from textual evidence gleaned from a close reading of the two assessment chapters in each  text that cover classroom and standardized assessment. Interpretive content analysis inevitably reflects the researcher's ideas about what preservice teachers need to know about assessment; however, this analysis provides a fine-grained comparative critique that encourages educational psychology instructors to re-look at the importance of theoretical  frameworks, links between theory and practice, multicultural consciousness and cited research in choosing an educational psychology textbook for their classes.

Thirteen Turkish mothers who had at least one child with MR were the participants of the study. A qualitative interpretive framework was used for collecting and analyzing the data. The data were gathered through semi-structured interviews. Mothers' beliefs on the nature, causation, and treatment of the disability of their children were the main focus of the interviews. Some parents did not believe their children had a disability or misunderstood the nature of disability. Although most were aware of their children's developmental limitations, they, at the same time, perceived the condition of the disability as temporary. Both traditional and modern (bio-medical) beliefs were held by most of the mothers on the causation of the disability. Mothers identified traditional beliefs, especially the religious ones, as the most popular causal agents. Most mothers sought help from both modern and traditional agents. Mothers, who held strong traditional beliefs regarding the causation of the disability of their children, held strong traditional treatment beliefs and valued more traditional treatment practices rather than bio-medical ones. Among the traditional treatment practices, most mothers required help from religious agents. Regarding future expectations of mothers on the situation of their children, mothers wanted their children to be less independent, and for this reason, they sought a more individualized education for their children. Implications, limitations and directions for future studies are also discussed.",

This study gathered data specifically from children/young people with autistic spectrum disorders and their parents (contrasting this with the views of professionals), adopting a more intensive case study methodology. A large number of transition support arrangements were identified. In 4/5 cases the arrangements were delayed and/or incomplete, with a number of specific problems. Despite the size and complexity of their new school, the children/young people were positive about transition, but wanted real inclusion in  school activities. Parental evaluations of transition arrangements were considerably lower than those of professionals. Stakeholder perceptions of what worked and did not work were contrasted. Commonalities and differences in the relevant development needs of school staff were identified. Implications for future research, policy and practice are explored. (Contains 7 tables.)",

This paper reports the perceptions of   pre-service teachers prior to their involvement in units of work focusing specifically on inclusive education in universities located in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Results indicate significant differences exist between the students in the eastern countries of Singapore and Hong Kong, and those in the western countries of Canada and Australia. Participants in the Western countries tended to have more positive sentiments and attitudes towards students with disabilities, and more concerns than their Eastern counterparts. The study also suggests that in most instances pre-service teachers have more positive attitudes towards people with disabilities and inclusion, and more confidence in implementing inclusive practice when they have had additional training and/or experience with people with disabilities.

        "author":["King-Sears, Margaret E."],
        "description":"Researcher-teacher collaboration occurred during the design and implementation of  self-management instruction for two middle school students with different disabilities and for two different target behaviors. One student with physical disabilities was taught to increase safe hall travel during school transitions, and the other student with learning disabilities was taught to increase on-task behaviors. After each student had been trained to use self-  management, their teachers were not able to follow-up with them immediately. Contrary  to their teacher's anticipated impact of self-management, neither student's behaviors reached satisfactory levels until their teachers followed-up with them. Implications include the necessity for adults to follow-up with students after teaching self-management to ensure the intervention is progressing as planned and that the desired impact on students' behaviors occurs.

The views expressed are the author's and do not necessarily represent the policy of that agency, and no endorsement by the federal government should be inferred.

Thirteen general education elementary teachers in a suburban city in southern Ontario were interviewed about their referral criteria for special education services. The results of this study indicated a combination of student characteristics that teachers observed (inattention, lack of comprehension, inability to complete tasks in the allotted time, and poor test performance) and what teachers inferred (e.g., about the way a student looks).

Group allocation was determined by parent and teacher reports on the CBCL and the Conners' Rating Scales. Participants imagined themselves in six scenarios (two unfair, two fair and two neutral) where they were either punished or not punished and then rated different emotions from 1 to 7. Emotions varied significantly by group depending on the type of scenario presented. The unfair scenario with a positive outcome for the participant produced the greatest group differences with the behavioural group reporting emotions consistent with antisocial theory such as less guilt, anger and fear, and more pride and happiness than the controls.

        "description":"Alchemy is an ancient philosophy on which the two modern day sciences of chemistry and analytical psychology are grounded. In education in New South Wales (NSW) at the present time, the behaviour of boys is of increasing concern to schools, to teachers, to parents and to society at large as evidenced by the over-representation of boys in school suspension figures, detention and intensive learning classes, remedial reading and behaviour units, special programs and special schools. This paper outlines an action research study of the aberrant behaviour of seven boys from Sydney schools who were all clinically diagnosed as   emotionally, conduct or behaviourally disordered. Jung's alchemic process was employed to assist each boy to understand his inner conflict and how it contributed to his behaviour. This approach was able to successfully bring about positive change in the unacceptable, challenging, aberrant behaviour of each of the boys. One boy's process is outlined in more detail.

Their attitudes and knowledge about inclusive education are important as these are indicators of such willingness. The purpose of this study was to examine teachers' attitudes and their perceived knowledge towards inclusive education in Malaysia. The respondents (n = 235) were the mainstream and special education teachers in the public primary and secondary schools. They were given a set of questionnaires which sought their responses regarding their attitudes and knowledge towards inclusive education. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics such as frequency and percentages. The main finding shows that, in general, teachers have positive attitudes towards inclusive education. They agreed that inclusive education enhances social interaction and inclusion among the students and thus, it minimizes negative stereotypes on special needs students. The findings also show that collaboration between the mainstream and the special education teachers is important and that there should be a clear guideline on the implementation of inclusive education. The findings of the study have significant implications to the school administrators, teachers, and other stakeholders who directly and indirectly involved in implementing inclusive education.

        "author":["Mundia, Lawrence"],
        "description":"Swaziland is planning to introduce inclusive education as part of education for all. The innovation may benefit learners with emotional and behavioural disorders (EBD). A purposive teacher sample (N = 47) was used to generate and identify behavioural problems that are prevalent in Swazi schools. Aggression was one of the many conduct disorders cited. Using a purposive sample of 300 students, the study found aggression to be indeed a  problem among upper primary and junior high school students. The type of school attended was found to be correlated with aggression. Students with moderate to severe aggressive behaviours were found on all categories of learners used in the study. However a significant difference in the number of aggressive students was obtained on only two variables, the type of school students attended and the kind of guardians students lived with at home. There were more students with aggressive tendencies in government schools than other types of schools. Furthermore, aggressive students lived mainly with both biological parents. Teachers rely mainly on punishment to deal with aggressive students. The findings have   implications for the ongoing educational reforms concerning inclusive education in Swaziland.  Three major recommendations were made to address them. Teacher skills in handling aggressive cases need to be enhanced by both preservice and inservice courses. School counselors need to be appointed to provide suitable psychological intervention.   Finally, a more detailed investigation using qualitative procedures was recommended to gain in-depth insights into the problem and its solutions. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "description":"The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the reading comprehension of hearing impaired 8th graders who are being trained through an auditory-oral approach. The evaluation is conducted through miscue analysis using complex stories. To realize this aim, the following research questions are formulated. (1) To what extent do hearing impaired K-8   students use the language cue systems (i.e. syntax, semantics and graphophonics) during reading. (2) What is their reading comprehension level? (3) Is there a consistency between the mistakes they make and their reading comprehension levels? Ten severe to profoundly hearing impaired secondary students who are at the Research and Education Center for Children with Hearing Impairment (i.e. ICEM) at Anadolu University participated in the current descriptive study. Since there is not any ready reading inventory in Turkey, stories   with different levels along with retelling, question-answer and fill-in-the-blanks forms regarding those stories were prepared. Results suggest that when hearing impaired students read a story at their instructional level, they do use their knowledge of syntax, semantics and graphophnonics, they understand what they read and there is a consistency between the mistakes they make and their reading comprehension.

        "description":"A remedial spelling training approach is presented which systematically combines certain visualizing and verbalizing methods to foster dyslexic students' orthographic knowledge and strategy use. It essentially depends upon an integrative application of algorithmic graphs and   verbal self-instructions: Visualization and verbalization are intended to focus the students' attention, cognitions, and behaviors on the algorithmic rule components for enhancing their task orientation and self-regulation skills. To that degree, the intervention must provide an   intensive and consistent cognitive modeling phase as well as a broad range of special training materials which, in particular, are comprised of various algorithmic and self-instructional task formats. In the present replication study the temporal training effects on the spelling test performance of 9 students with severe spelling difficulties were evaluated. Achievement-related pre-test and follow-up data were analyzed after a treatment time of 40 hours. Empirical results could demonstrate individually and statistically significant gains in students' general and error-specific spelling test performance--both systematically trained   and, to a somewhat lower degree, only incidentally considered spelling skill areas.

Analysis of data from questionnaires showed that special education teachers had a positive attitude towards utilizing and providing individualized instruction, but also had concerns. Analysis of data from parents' questionnaires showed that parents needed to learn to advocate for their children, wanted improved parent-teacher communication, but also had concerns. This study revealed potential barriers for implementing individualized instruction in China. American and Western educational programs and services may benefit the development of special education in China, but they need to be culturally sensitive and appropriate for the economic, social, and cultural realities and individualized and localized to China and its education system. Challenges and difficulties in the process of implementing specific  imported educational programs should   be addressed.

However, concerns about whether inclusion for children with ASD is synonymous with their right to appropriate education have been raised amongst researchers. The current study aimed to ascertain the views of both professionals, and parents of children with ASD, regarding inclusion of children with ASD into mainstream  schools by using a series of focus groups. A content analysis was used, and the results showed that parents and professionals agreed that school factors, such as school commitment; and LEA factors, such as funding, were fundamental to the success of inclusion. Professionals felt that child factors such as behavioural problems, and learning difficulties, were the primary reason for exclusion from mainstream. Significantly, both groups agreed that in order to improve successful inclusion, there needed to be more openness to alternatives to mainstream for children with ASD. (Contains 11 tables.)",

        "description":"The diagnosis of high functioning autism (HFA) is not the end of comprehensive assessments. Since the 1970s, although a great deal of research has focused on developing effective educational approaches and interventions for children with autism, there is an increasing need to develop differentially effective educational approaches or interventions that are specifically for children with HFA. This paper reviews several effective, evidence based interventions that are widely used by special educators and professionals as best practices in the United States, including structured teaching approaches,  peer-medicated interventions, self-monitoring or self-management strategies, video modeling, and social stories, with a hope that people in other places of the world can also find these interventions beneficial in teaching children with HFA.",

This study used an extended version of the Barnes-Holmes protocol developed in a series of studies by McHugh, Barnes-Holmes, and Barnes-Holmes (2004) to teach typically developing children between the ages of 6-11 perspective-taking skills. The present demonstrational study used a multiple probe design to evaluate the participants' abilities to demonstrate a number of simple and complex relations, and examined both relation type and relational complexity. We also tested for generalization of perspective taking to new stimuli and real-world conversational topics. Results demonstrate that the capacity to alter perspectives can be established by means of a history of reinforced relational responding. (Contains 4 tables and 4 figures.)",

In the first experiment, two children who emitted autoclitic mands in instructional settings, but not in non-instructional settings, participated in 60-minute speaker immersion sessions for three days. Results showed that speaker immersion was effective in increasing the number of independently emitted autoclitic mands in a non-instructional setting for both participants. In the second experiment, two children with independent mands, tacts, and autoclitics in instructional settings, but not in non-instructional settings, received daily, 10-minute speaker immersion sessions. Results showed that speaker immersion also resulted in increased mands, tacts, and autoclitics for these participants. Outcomes are discussed in terms of establishing operations and the utility of speaker immersion as an instructional tactic. (Contains 2 figures.)",

        "description":"We report an experiment investigating the effects of conditioning books as reinforcers for observing responses on the learning of textual responses by pre-school children. The independent variable was the acquisition of conditioned reinforcement of observing responses and choice of book stimuli in free play settings where children could choose to play with toys or look at books. Prior to the conditioning procedures, the children played with toys and did not look at books in free time in 4 preconditioning 5-minute free-play sessions. During the treatment we conducted simultaneous stimulus conditioning procedures until looking at books became the preferred free-play activity. The dependent variable consisted of the numbers of learn-units-to mastery of textual responses before and after conditioning books as reinforcers for observing responses. Three boys and one girl (ages 2 years and 9 months to 4 years) participated in the experiment in a pre and post learn-units-to-criterion and simultaneous matched-pairs design with a time-lagged component. Prior to reinforcement conditioning, we matched children in pairs based on learn units they required to master a sets of 5 counterbalanced word sets. One child in each of 2 pairs received book conditioning initially, and another child received an equal number of conditioning trials with toys, as a control conditions, and then book conditioning. The results showed that (1) all four children required fewer learn-units-to-criterion on textual responses after books were conditioned as reinforcers for choice and observing and those who received the book conditioning first performed best. (2) Three of the four children maintained preference for books at 33%, 83%, and 100% of time in free play probes at 1 month. (3) There were no maintenance effects on accuracy of textual responding.

Eco-behavioral assessments (EBAs) are one solution to past intervention research challenges. EBAs record the effects of ecological variables in students' behavior and daily interactions. The utility of EBAs in second-generation research has increased substantially. Numerous EBAs now exist for use with all ages of learners and provide a valid, reliable, and cost effective method for intervention research. This paper examines 18 EBAs as well as software systems designed to support and enhance the use of EBAs. The examination serves as a comprehensive resource to better understand how EBAs can be used in answering complex questions about students' learning and for advancing second-generation research.

Qualitatively obtained results from a previous study indicated that, following symbolic play training, children with autism increased their symbolic play behaviors and play complexity to levels similar to that of typically developing children of similar language ages (Stahmer, 1995). To evaluate the social importance of these results, naive judges rated the play of these same children before and after PRT. The judges rated the play of the children with autism as significantly better after training than before. The ratings indicated that the typically developing children exhibited qualitatively better play skills than the children with autism at both time periods. These findings demonstrate that improvements in symbolic play and play complexity after PRT are meaningful to people in the environment. In addition, they indicate continued qualitative symbolic play deficits for the children with autism that were not apparent in the objective measures. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

In particular, the environment is thought to elicit internal autonomic instability and to evoke external maladaptive pain behavior. While medical interventions often provide an appropriate first line treatment, behavioral interventions can provide an important adjunct to medical intervention and in some cases provide valuable alternative sources of relief. This article reviews the prevalence, types, and functional impairments associated with recurrent pediatric headaches and the behavioral concepts that help explain their etiology. The article also reviews the substantial empirical research that supports the efficacy of behavioral interventions. These include teaching children to control autonomic reactivity through relaxation or biofeedback and then arranging for an environment that reinforces use of these tools. The article concludes with a discussion of future directions for research in biofeedback, including the application of behavioral concepts and interventions to other chronic health related problems in children.",

        "description":"The current project evaluated the use of behavior management techniques utilized in Parent- Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) in head start classrooms. The sample included seven Head Start classrooms; four classrooms receiving treatment and three classrooms receiving no treatment. Evaluation of the progress included observation of teacher and student behavior and teacher report of class manageability and number of time-outs. Results indicated that child behavior improved throughout the study for both groups. Both groups of teachers also gave fewer timeouts, criticized the children less often, and rated their classes as more manageable from pre- to post-treatment. Teachers receiving training gave more labeled praise following treatment. These findings provide initial support for improving teacher behavior modification skills through the use of PCIT skills modified for Head Start classrooms. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "author":["Reitman, David"],
        "description":"In recent years, several papers have considered phenomena putatively relevant to rule-governed behavior (RGB). The author has condensed a few of his concerns about the practice of drawing casual connections between noncompliance, failure to complete assigned tasks, etc., and basic research on RGB. Some of the most important papers involving conceptual analyses of rules and RGB have been authored by Schlinger and colleagues. Another resource that might be consulted (in addition to excellent papers on rules as contingency-specifying stimuli by Schlinger) is an edited text by Hayes (1989) \"Rule Governed Behavior: Contingencies and Instructional Control.\" The author should be commended for beginning the difficult journey towards a better understanding of RGB, self-control, and ADHD.  However, as readers of this commentary might conclude, the author has little affinity for the kind of theorizing described in this paper. While he certainly does not wish to \"shoot the messenger\", he remains skeptical that the kind of model development described here will lead to better interventions for children diagnosed with ADHD, and he is unaware of any data suggesting that treatment outcomes for ADHD-diagnosed children have improved since such theorizing began. Indeed, although this review makes a number of references to \"advances\" and \"benefits\" stemming from the development of new conceptual models, one wonders, who is benefiting? Individuals should be cautious in asserting the value of theory, and advances should not be assumed. \"New\" does not necessarily equate with \"improved\". A behavior analytic model demands demonstrable improvements in client outcomes before individuals declare, \"mission accomplished.\"",

        "description":"The authors appreciate the opportunity to respond to the issues raised in a review of the manuscript, \"Rule-Governed Behavior and Self-Control in Children with ADHD: A Theoretical Interpretation\" submitted by Leasha M. Barry and Melissa A. Kelly. Many of the points brought to light in the review are indeed useful for discussion and provide additional research directions for further model development and testing. Solely Leasha M. Barry authored portions of this response and this will be indicated as such by the use of the pronoun \"I\". Alternately, the final paragraph in this response was a joint effort and reflects the thoughts of both Leasha M. Barry and Melissa A. Kelly and is indicated as such by the use of the pronoun \"we.\" Barry addresses the reviewer's comments in roughly the same order as they were raised for simplicity. The authors understand a reluctance to jump on the bandwagon for anything touted as a revolutionary, research-based panacea. However, condemning or minimizing the value of theory for improving practice suggests that practice continually improves itself in spite of theory development and hypothesis testing. When evidence is found that a theory needs to be revised or discarded altogether, the development and application of the theory does not imply failure. If learning and refinement occurs, there is value for practice, because it puts us a little closer to understanding the phenomenon they are trying to describe. If they focus only on outcomes and not on process, they may have a view of theory that is somewhat shortsighted. By grounding practice in current thinking (i.e., theory), they can achieve a greater understanding of factors that influence and improve practice, and they position themselves to refine thinking and follow a path of continuous improvement. They do not disagree that the path from theory to utility is often disjointed or even nonexistent, but it is certainly worthwhile to attempt it.",

This work is critical if urban students are to succeed in post-secondary education and in the world of work. In response to this increasing need, this paper will explore (1) how one university is actively recruiting and preparing urban teacher candidates through the Paterson Teachers for Tomorrow Program (PT4T) and (2)   urban teacher candidate perspectives on their preparation experience as it relates to school leadership. Data analysis revealed several themes regarding their perceptions of support, leadership, and school change.",

The article provides a discussion of the main national guidelines on English Language teaching in the primary and early secondary years, as well as some observations on the place of knowledge about language in the Standard Grade qualification. While inspectors' reports suggests that there is much good practice in relation to knowledge about language in individual classrooms, there is evidence to suggest that, as far as national educational policy is concerned, knowledge about language is marginalised, and aspects of the guidelines are patchy in coverage and somewhat confusing. The national curricular review of educational provision from ages 3 to 18, ongoing in Scotland, is also discussed. The article concludes with a suggestion that knowledge about language be explicitly assessed as part of the national qualifications in Scotland, so that children can get credit for displaying their understanding of what is already expected of them.

        "author":["van Gelderen, Amos"],
        "description":"The teaching of grammar is discussed from an instrumental point of view: what beneficial effects does such teaching have for students' language abilities (especially writing)? Two ways of approaching grammar teaching are confronted with each other: the learning of explicit rules and meta-linguistic knowledge about language on one hand and learning without awareness of linguistic structure (implicit learning) on the other hand. The article shows that implicit learning is more important than is often realised for acquisition and for accurate and fluent mastery of linguistic structures. In addition, research evidence both in mother tongue and second/foreign language contexts shows that explicit learning of structures is not very effective. For the improvement of writing abilities, other forms of teaching are far more effective than explicit grammar teaching. Conceptual processes in writing presumably have a greater impact on text quality than students' explicit knowledge of linguistic structure. Although the explicit learning of linguistic structures is not very effective, there are many other topics for linguistic reflection in the classroom that may have more beneficial effects on students' language use. Some examples of these topics are given, together with theoretical reasons for their instrumental validity in elementary and secondary education. (Contains 1 table and 1 footnote.)",

        "author":["Unsworth, Len"],
        "description":"The increasingly integrative use of images with language in many different types of texts in electronic and paper media has created an urgent need to go beyond logocentric accounts of literacy and literacy pedagogy. Correspondingly there is a need to augment the genre, grammar and discourse descriptions of verbal text as resources for literacy pedagogy to include descriptions of the meaning-making resources of images. Some augmentation along these lines has involved the articulation of Hallidayan systemic functional descriptions of language, mainly focussed on verbal grammar, with the social semiotic descriptions of the meaning-making resources of images described in a grammar of visual design proposed by Kress and van Leeuwen. However, current research indicates that articulating discrete visual and verbal grammars is not sufficient to account for meanings made at the intersection of language and image. This paper adopts a systemic functional semiotic perspective in outlining a range of different types of such meanings in different kinds of texts, suggesting the significance of such meanings in comprehending and composing contemporary multimodal texts, and the importance of developing an appropriate metalanguage to enable explicit discussion of these meaning-making resources by teachers and students.

        "description":"This article investigates the potential of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) for exploring students' achievements in writing, thus moving beyond &quot;deficit models&quot; of grammar in school English. It considers the semantic features of successful interpretations of examination narratives, using what I call the &quot;symbolic reading&quot;. Halliday has suggested that we need to distinguish between grammar and grammatics, with the grammatics viewed as independent from but sensitive to language in use. In this article, I apply his notion of grammatics to analyze the linguistic basis of students' interpretive achievements. The article investigates three aspects of A-range interpretations of different narratives. These symbolic readings indicate a preference for relational transitivity of a synoptic kind, an ability to reformulate story significance through elaboration and rhetorical &quot;spans&quot; between material semiosis (in Theme) and abstract significance (in New). The analysis brings to light what often appears entirely intuitive on the part of successful English students but is nevertheless crucial to their success in examination English. The final section of the article considers some implications of the grammatics for teachers who want to prepare their students to read unfamiliar narratives symbolically.

The less cohesive, more fragmented quality of e-literature creates a subjunctive space for creation where writers can consider interesting pathways and diversions since the digital form supports multidirectional structures. Using data from a digital literacy study with an eleventh grade English class as well as her own writing of fiction and poetry, the author suggests that the fragmented nature of e-literature offers benefits for learning in school that complement rather than replace more traditional forms of literature.",

        "author":["Morgan, Wendy"],
        "description":"This paper examines the processes of creative writing, exploring in particular how intuition and analysis, unconscious and conscious, work together, and how the social and the personal are involved in these processes. The author discusses her experience of writing a sustained narrative poem with lyrical elements, and then as a teacher-educator discusses the implications for our understanding of the creative processes and classroom practice. Following the work of Csikszentmihalyi and colleagues (1994, 1996), the paper traces how not only personal but also social, cultural and disciplinary factors are at play in the development of the work. The first of these is the domain of knowledge and practice that has preceded the creative writer and must be mastered before s/he is in a position to innovate on the established norms. Next comes the \"problematic\" or dissonance, which arouses the psychic energy that engages both the conscious, analytical activities of the mind and its intuitive, even unconscious sphere. (Intuition is taken to refer to those more diffuse mental activities that are a-logical, non-analytical, associative, aesthetic and metaphoric.) As the work develops, the various processes are described and shown to be recursive: incubation (during which ideas churn around below the threshold of consciousness), insight (the \"eureka\" moment, when the pieces of the puzzle fall together), followed by evaluation of the idea (for its appropriateness and elegance, given the problematics) and the elaboration of the idea into a more fully worked out poem. After drafting, the field of experts is engaged--those who act as gatekeepers to determine whether the creative idea, product or process will be accepted into the domain. The paper concludes by arguing for the value of creative writing in English classrooms. (Contains 4 footnotes.)",

Ross (2002) rightly observes that conventional theories of reading fail to get at the process involved in achieving successful \"apprenticeship\" with Munro's short fiction. This paper explores the intricacies of Munro's creative craft as exemplified in \"The love of a good woman\" and proposes an approach to facilitating students' engagement with complex narratives. Through creative writing in a computer-based \"wiki\" environment, it is argued, we encourage students to undertake the project of \"layering\" narrative and of establishing and interrogating complex narrative relations. This creative exercise, in turn, may facilitate their understanding of short fiction such as Munro's. (Contains 2 figures and 2 footnotes.)",

When teachers foster creativity in the literacy classroom, they provide open-ended lessons, encourage variety and innovation, and allow time to play with ideas. Engaging students in writing their own metaphorical texts is one way in which students can generate novel responses and multiple interpretations as outlined in this paper. The students' texts reveal unique voices that range from the playful to the dramatic in their creative exploration of what it means to be human. The potential of such writing for engaging students is discussed alongside the value of metaphorical writing for encouraging emotional exploration, imagination and sheer enjoyment.",

        "description":"This article demonstrates how literacy practices in an 11th grade, urban, English classroom in the United States worked to delineate and patrol gender borders between acceptable masculine and feminine social practices. Drawing upon Blackburn's (2005) and Thorne's (1993) studies of the gendered boundaries that are created and questioned in literacy events and classrooms, this ethnographic study explores how the students and teacher of the class actively constructed parameters of acceptable feminine and masculine social practices and policed each others' performances and representations of these practices through the classroom discourse surrounding literacy activities. I argue that heterosexuality was a primary characteristic of acceptable forms of masculinity in the class and that laughter was a primary discursive mechanism through which students marked gendered border crossings, particularly when boys' behaviour was interpreted as feminine. I also examine the social and literacy practices of those students who were successful at challenging and crossing the gendered borders that were constructed during classroom discourse.

The central goal of this research was to understand how adolescents practise literacy within the context of a peer reading group, and how gender impacts these practices. Transcripts of student-led discussions were analyzed to determine how gender positioning impacted the group dynamics in literature circles; how students utilized literary theories, particularly gender theories, when in literature circles; and how the meanings constructed in literature circles challenged or reinforced traditional discourses of gender. Findings from two diverse focal groups suggested that there was a congruence between how the students discussed and what they discussed. While the dialogic structure opened space for critical readings of the text-worlds in certain instances, there was also evidence of asymmetrical power relations within groups, and corresponding resistance by some of the boys to more critical conversations, particularly about femininity.

The Reader's Diary is a subgenre of autobiography, memoir and poetic prose essay, a flexible, hybrid form of inquiry. The author uses collagist techniques of intergeneric writings, moving back and forth between fragments of memory and more recent reflections, visual images, poems, theoretical considerations of teaching literary studies and teacher education, as well as focusing on the effect of reading on the shaping of schooled, gendered and cultural identity. Through these forms, the author draws on poststructural strategies to inform her work and to demonstrate an advocacy of experimental writing methodologies to create an \"open text,\" which uses inter or cross-generic forms including collage and fictocritical writing (writing that combines \"creative\" and \"fictional/poetic\" modes with those of criticism and commentary). Imaginative, innovative practical and philosophical approaches to the teaching of English are considered. (Contains 21 figures.)",

Today many teachers avoid teaching poetry for several reasons, one of these being the nature of the assessment of the subject, English, by the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) set up by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA). The outcome has been the setting up of a cycle of disadvantage whereby many students may never have the opportunity to study or write a poem in school. Such students leave school without having encountered literary study at its most intense and refined, which employs the most concentrated use of language and gives valuable access to the imaginative dimension of language. These students will, in their turn, as educators of the next generation, fail to transmit these qualities to others. (Contains 1 table and 24 footnotes.)",

        "description":"The nature of engagement between American campuses and communities is contested. This article is an invitation to reconsider why community-campus partnerships often look so different and have diverse and sometimes negative outcomes. Using a cultural theory approach (Thompson, Ellis, & Wildavsky, 1990) to elucidate the four main cultural frames that inform human behavior--hierarchist, individualistic, fatalistic, and egalitarian--this treatment maps these frames onto the broad terrain of community-campus partnerships. This exploration enables service-learning and other partnership building practitioners to more clearly recognize and understand the preconceptions that influence partners' approaches. Because service-learning rhetoric is heavily biased toward egalitarian (reciprocal, mutual) relationship building, it does not necessarily ensure that all entities on and off campus understand or accept this approach. This application suggests several areas for future research as service-learning practitioners \"unlearn a belief system\" and work to build a new system in its place.

Staff supervisors and community partner organizations are motivated to give time, training, and a laboratory to enhance student learning. In return, community partners expect and generally receive valuable service from the students. The results suggest that the service-learning relationship be viewed as reciprocal in nature, as with other donor-recipient situations. (Contains 4 tables and 1 note.)",

This neglect needs to end. Recent research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience reveals emotion's central role throughout the thinking and learning process. We explore how inattention to emotion has molded service-learning research and practice, and then suggest ways to re-orient an approach to reflection to acknowledge the continuous interplay between the intellectual and the emotional throughout the reflective learning process.

        "description":"Research on college students found limited support for Morton's (1995) hypothesis that students have a preference for one distinct type of service orientation (i.e., charity, project, social change). The findings did replicate previous findings that college students prefer the charity paradigm. A measure of integrity was developed and two dimensions were identified that possessed distinct correlates. As Morton predicted, as the degree of integrity increased the preference for a distinct type of service became blurred, suggesting that developing integrity should be an intentional educational goal and it might be aided by exposing students to all three approaches to community service. Implications for service-learning educators are discussed. (Contains 5 tables.)",

The improved writing of first-year students in the Chicago Civic Leadership Certificate Program (CCLCP), we argue, results from the deeply situated learning that took place in the context of reciprocal, community-based relationships. We also argue that research on the impact of community-based learning should take into account the contemporary university's emerging paradigm of engaged learning and research, which calls for a redefinition of partnership and reciprocity.

The analysis affirms the characteristics of effective partnerships of multiple well-established models of effective partnerships developed by higher education, but reveal that community partners have a specific sense of prioritization among partnership factors. In addition, partners revealed a surprising depth of understanding and commitment to student learning, the &quot;common ground&quot; of the service-learning experience.

The second, larger evaluation compares the IntelliMetric system ratings to those of human raters using approximately 500 responses to each of 101 prompts. Results from both evaluations suggest the IntelliMetric system is a consistent, reliable system for scoring AWA essays with a perfect + adjacent agreement on 96% to 98% and 92% to 100% of instances in evaluations 1 and 2, respectively.

        "description":"The transition from paper-based to computer-based assessment raises a number of important issues about how mode might affect children's performance and question answering strategies. In this project 104 eleven-year-olds were given two sets of matched mathematics questions, one set on-line and  the other on paper. Facility values were analyzed to explore the impact of the mode on performance. Errors were coded and this allowed further investigation of the differences between questions in the different modes. The study also investigated children's affective responses to working on computer, attempting to gain an insight into the effect of motivational factors. Tis was made possible by observing and interviewing a sub-sample of children. Findings suggested that although there were no statistically significant differences between overall performances on paper and computer, there were enough differences at the individual question-level to warrant further investigation. Close analysis of the data suggests that it is possible that the question type, the way it is asked, and the numbers involved, might interact with mode to affect students' willingness to show working methods. The findings also suggest that certain types of questions in certain domains might have different impacts according to mode. The study concludes that there is scope for more research to probe further any links that may exist between children's thinking, behavior and assessment mode in order to satisfy concerns about the relative reliability and validity of computer-based and paper-based testing.

        "description":"Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is defined as the computer technology that evaluates and   scores the written prose (Shermis & Barrera, 2002; Shermis & Burstein, 2003; Shermis,   Raymat, & Barrera, 2003). AES systems are mainly used to overcome time, cost, reliability,   and generalizability issues in writing assessment (Bereiter, 2003; Burstein, 2003; Chung   & O'Neil, 1997; Hamp-Lyons, 2001; Myers, 2003; Page, 2003; Rudner & Gagne, 2001;   Rudner & Liang, 2002; Sireci & Rizavi, 1999). AES continues attracting the attention of public schools, universities, testing companies, researchers and educators (Burstein, Kukich, Wolf, Lu, & Chodorow, 1998; Shermis & Burstein, 2003; Sireci & Rizavi, 1999). The main purpose of this article is to provide an overview of current approaches to AES. The article will describe the most widely used AES systems including Project Essay Grader[TM] (PEG), Intelligent Essay Assessor[TM] (IEA), E-rater[R] and Criterion[SM], IntelliMetric[TM] and MY Access![R], and Bayesian Essay Test Scoring System[TM] (BETSY). It will also discuss the main characteristics of these systems and current issues regarding the use of them both in low-stakes assessment (in classrooms) and high-stakes assessment (as standardized tests).

        "description":"This paper reviews a series of formative assessment studies that were conducted to inform  and evaluate a large-scale instructional software development project at the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR). The three-year project, entitled &quot;Taking the Next Step in Engineering Education: Integrating Educational Software and Active Learning,&quot; was funded by the U.S. Department of Education Fund for the Improvement of Post Secondary Education (FIPSE). The assessment was carried out under the auspices of UMR's Laboratory for Information Technology Evaluation (LITE) and guided by the LITE model for evaluation of learning technologies. The fundamental premise of the model is that evaluation should consist of the triangulation of multiple research methodologies and measurement tools. Five representative evaluation studies, consisting of eight experiments, are presented here. The studies range from basic experimentation and usability testing to applied research conducted within the classroom as well as a multi-national cross-cultural applied dissemination survey conducted during the last semester of the project. This paper demonstrates that the LITE model can be an effective tool for guiding a comprehensive evaluation program. In addition, the research findings provide evidence that the instructional multimedia developed in this project can have a substantial positive impact in enhancing fundamental engineering classes.

        "description":"Technology today offers many new opportunities for innovation in educational assessment  through rich new assessment tasks and potentially powerful scoring, reporting and real-time feedback mechanisms. One potential  limitation for realizing the benefits of computer-based assessment in both instructional assessment and large scale testing comes in designing questions and tasks with which computers can effectively interface (i.e., for scoring and score reporting purposes) while still gathering meaningful measurement evidence. This paper introduces a taxonomy or categorization of 28 innovative item types that may be useful in computer-based assessment. Organized along the degree of constraint on the respondent's options for answering or interacting with the assessment item or task, the proposed taxonomy describes a set of iconic item types termed &quot;intermediate constraint&quot; items. These item types have responses that fall somewhere between fully &quot;constrained&quot; responses (i.e.,  the conventional multiple-choice question), which can be far too limiting to tap much of the potential of new information technologies, and fully &quot;constructed&quot; responses (i.e. the traditional essay), which can be a challenge for computers to meaningfully analyze even with today's sophisticated tools. The 28 example types discussed in this paper are based on 7 categories of ordering involving successively decreasing response constraints from fully selected to fully constructed. Each category of constraint includes four iconic examples. The intended purpose  of the proposed taxonomy is to provide a practical resource for assessment developers as well as a useful framework for the discussion of innovative assessment formats and uses in computer-based settings.

Two essay prompts were given on paper to a nationally representative sample as part of the 2002 main NAEP writing assessment. The same two essay prompts were subsequently administered on computer to a second sample also selected to be nationally representative. Analyses looked at overall differences in performance between the delivery modes, interactions of delivery mode with group membership, differences in performance between those taking the computer test on different types of equipment (i.e., school machines vs. NAEP-supplied  laptops), and whether computer familiarity was associated with online writing test performance. Results generally showed no significant mean score differences between paper and computer delivery. However, computer familiarity significantly predicted online writing test performance after controlling for paper writing skill. These results suggest that, for any given individual, a computer-based writing assessment may produce different results than a paper one, depending upon that individual's level of computer familiarity. Further, for purposes of estimating population performance, as long as substantial numbers of students write better on computer than on paper (or better on paper than on computer), conducting a writing assessment in either mode alone may underestimate the performance that would have resulted if students had been tested using the mode in which they wrote best.

        "description":"The primary questions addressed in this paper are the following: what are the factors that affect students' adoption of an e-learning system and what are the relationships among these factors? This paper investigates and identifies some of the major factors affecting students' adoption of an e-learning system in a university in Jordan. E-learning adoption is approached from the information systems acceptance point of view. This suggests that a prior condition for learning effectively using e-learning systems is that students must actually use them. Thus, a greater knowledge of the factors that affect IT adoption and their interrelationships is a pre-cursor to a better understanding of student acceptance of e-learning systems. In turn, this will help and guide those who develop, implement, and deliver e-learning systems. In this study, an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was developed to investigate the underlying factors that influence students' decisions to use an e-learning system. The TAM was populated using data gathered from a survey of 486 undergraduate students using the Moodle based e-learning system at the Arab Open University. The model was estimated using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). A path model was developed to analyze the relationships between the factors to explain students' adoption of the e-learning system. Whilst findings support existing literature about prior experience affecting perceptions, they also point to surprising group effects, which may merit future exploration.

We asked what the policy activity for teacher evaluation is in state statutes and department of education regulations, how these changes in statutes and regulations might affect the practice of teacher evaluation, and what were the implications for instructional supervision from these policy actions. Teacher evaluation statutes and department of education regulations provided the data for this study, using archival records from each state's legislature and education departments that were placed into a comparison matrix based on criteria developed from the National Governors Association (NGA) goals for school reform (Goldrick, 2002). Data were analyzed deductively in terms of these criteria for underlying theories of action (Malen, 2005), trends, and likely effects on teacher evaluation and implications for supervision. The majority of states adopted many of the NGA strategies, asserted oversight and involvement in local teacher evaluation practices, decreased the frequency of veteran teacher evaluation, and increased the types of data used in evaluation. Whether or not the changes in teacher evaluation will improve student learning in the long run remains to be seen. (Contains 4 tables and 1 footnote.)",

Launched in the 2000-2001 academic year and still applied by Anadolu University, the Pre-School Teacher Training Program is one of those programs offered by distance education. This study aims to evaluate Anadolu University's Preschool Teacher Training Program in Turkey by obtaining student opinions. A total of 1,026 senior students enrolled in the Preschool Education major at the Open Education Faculty of Anadolu University participated in the survey. A questionnaire to determine the opinions of students on the program was used as a means of data collection. Means (X) and standard deviations (SD) were employed to analyze the survey data. The results showed that although the teacher candidates study at a good level, they do not have a good record of watching the television programs. The results also revealed that the opinions of teacher candidates about the textbooks, television programs, teaching practices, and academic assistance services are positive.

Using the literature on external support, instructional capacity, and policy strength, the study gathered data from interviews, observations, document review, and surveys. The findings suggest that the model of assistance employed in both Chicago and California was inadequate to the task. While the policies examined demonstrate recognition that low-performing schools need additional capacity if they are to substantially improve student outcomes, external support providers used limited and haphazard approaches, and as a result, the support component had little influence on teaching and learning. In addition, because the external supports relied on a market-like support structure with few other mechanisms to ensure quality, and because there was limited quantity (intensity) of support, the benefit that external assistance might otherwise have provided was limited. This was particularly problematic for the lowest capacity schools, many of which experienced limited change despite increased educator effort and involvement of external providers. In essence, external assistance through these school accountability policies did little to improve educator and organizational performance. (Contains 12 footnotes.)",

        "description":"This article applies to class size research Grant and Graue's (1999) position that reviews of research represent conversations in the academic community. By extending our understanding of the class size reduction conversation beyond published literature to the perspectives of researchers who have studied the topic, we create a review that includes political histories of, contextual details about, and assumptions undergirding the conversation. We find divergent (and sometimes competing) perspectives on identifying beneficiaries of class size reduction (or CSR) and the correct context in which to view CSR research. By contrasting the logic and assumptions embedded in pupil-teacher ratio (PTR), class size (CS), and class size reduction studies, we conclude that sometimes research conflates these constructs and their associated theories of action, and such distortion poorly serves the needs of policymakers and stakeholders in education. We recommend that future inquiry focus on mechanisms of change, particularly instruction--both in terms of instructional strategies that capitalize on the resource of a smaller group and the types of support needed for teacher and administrator professional development.

Furthermore, no correlation was found between female participation and the state of gender equity in the country, and only 1% of the questions made any reference to country-specific, local, or religious aspects. One may conclude that science interests are gender- and age-dependent but culturally-independent in this asynchronous, open and distant science learning environment.

Using the Schools and Staffing Survey and the Teacher Follow-up Survey, one can estimate the relationship between workgroup racial diversity and the turnover of White teachers. This approach finds that young White teachers are more likely to stay in their original schools when the proportion of minority teachers is smaller. However, the opposite pattern emerges for older teachers. This poses a policy dilemma for recruiting and retaining teachers on the one hand and diversifying teaching staff on the other hand.

        "description":"Research studies conducted in the area of e-learning and blended learning lead to the emergence of new concepts, which directly influence quality. Among these concepts, the ones taken into consideration for this research study are as follows: communication and collaboration, satisfaction, equity, and autonomy. The perceptions of students taking blended ICT courses in a private university in Turkey were gathered through an Online Learning Environment Survey (OLES). Additionally, the suggestions of instructors for improving the quality of blended learning were obtained through a focus group interview. The findings of this study show that the perceived communication, collaboration, and satisfaction levels of students vary according to their levels of computer and Internet literacy. Also, there are differences in the students' satisfaction levels based on gender. The majority of students revealed that they considered themselves to be autonomous and equal in the blended learning environment. The findings of this research study, together with our review of recent literature, lead us to conclude that there are four major areas (containing several factors) that must be considered when developing a high-quality blended learning environment. These four areas are as follows: technology, instructors, students, and pedagogy. Based on the findings, some practical suggestions for transforming traditional courses into blended ones are also offered at the end of the research study. Finally, suggestions for the future are provided. (Contains 11 figures and 10 tables.)",

        "description":"The main purpose of the study is to investigate Turkish undergraduate students' perceptions of the Web as a learning tool and to analyze whether their perceptions differ significantly based on gender, socio-economic background, and Web experience. Data obtained from 722 undergraduate students (331 males and 391 females) were used in the analyses. The findings indicated significant differences based on gender, socio-economic background, and Web experience. The students from higher socio-economic backgrounds indicated significantly higher attitude scores on the self-efficacy subscale of the Web attitude scale. Similarly, the male students indicated significantly higher scores on the self-efficacy subscale than the females. Also, the students with higher Web experience in terms of usage frequency indicated higher scores on all subscales (i.e., self-efficacy, affective, usefulness, Web-based learning). Moreover, the two-way ANOVA results indicated that the student's PC ownership has significant main effects on their Web attitudes and on the usefulness, self-efficacy, and affective subscales.

The goal is to build bridges among secular and religious Arabs and Jews in Israel based on small multicultural groups and collaborative learning through effective use of the Internet and other cutting-edge information technologies. The model expands the contact hypothesis (which holds that under the right conditions contact could reduce bias between groups) to a model for online collaboration. It adds the gradual development of contact between the groups by progressing from individual asynchronous textual communication to individual synchronous audio communication combined with collaborative asynchronous communication to collaborative synchronous communication and finally to face-to-face communication.

        "description":"Based on recent research reports, the blended learning model, which combines face-to-face and online learning, is now the preferred model for online course design. Its superiority over online learning, which lacks face-to-face interaction, is evident from studies that examined both student achievement and satisfaction. Nevertheless, there is ambiguity in the literature and in the field regarding the proper implementation of blended learning and the optimal proportions between online and F2F components in various learning scenarios. The range of contradictory reports in recent literature on the potential of different blended learning models shows the need for more research on specific blended learning courses in order to establish proper standards for effective course design and implementation. The present evaluation study focuses on students' perceptions of pedagogical and design issues related to a new model for blended learning that was used in a graduate-level course at the Open University of Israel. Fifty-eight of the course's 91 students participated in the study and completed a questionnaire regarding three major aspects of the course design: (1) pedagogy, (2) textbook format (print vs. digital), and (3) learning environment usability. The results illustrate the importance of completing the pedagogical and visual design of online learning in advance. Also, the course model suggests ways to bridge the gaps between students and instructors and students and their peers, which are typical of online learning in general and open universities in particular.

Data were collected through in-depth interviews with 133 individuals, including young adults with disabilities, high school teachers and other school staff, parents, VR counselors, and employers. Four primary recommendations were identified for students with disabilities who are preparing for the transition from school to work: (a) increase self knowledge and self awareness, (b) display motivation and persistence, (c) participate in career exploration and multiple work experiences during high school, and (d) utilize transition services and post school supports. Recommendations for special education teachers or other school staff included: (a) listen carefully to students' interests, hopes, and dreams, (b) provide extensive opportunities for career exploration and community based experiences, (c) promote student self direction and independent decision making, and (d) connect students with appropriate services and supports available through school or community agencies.

        "description":"At 15 to 19 years old, National Longitudinal Study-2 (NLTS2) youth are on the threshold of adulthood. As they look toward their future adult roles, what are their academic, occupational, and independence expectations? Multiple factors have been found to be associated with aspirations and expectations, including individual abilities and social context. For example, teachers' supportive behaviors--emotional warmth and academic validation--have been found to be related to students' educational aspirations, and occupational aspirations have been found to be more closely associated with youth's perceived efficacy than with their actual academic achievement. Youth's future aspirations are positively related both to their high school outcomes and their adult achievements. Having more positive expectations for the future is associated with being academically successful and engaged in high school. Higher expectations of academic and career success is related to higher high school completion rates, thereby avoiding the negative impact on employment and postsecondary education attainment associated with dropping out. In addition, higher educational aspirations are associated with higher postsecondary school attendance rates. NLTS2 asked youth with disabilities to envision their futures and articulate their expectations for the period following high school. This chapter presents findings regarding expectations related to educational and independence achievements for youth with disabilities as a whole and for those who differ in their primary disability category.

Since 1976, the percentage of female undergraduate enrollments has surpassed that of male undergraduate enrollments. In 2004, the enrollment gender gap was largest for Black undergraduates. Trends in graduate enrollments were similar to those for undergraduate enrollments, with the percentage of enrolled graduate students who were minorities increasing 14 percentage points from 1976 to 2004. As with undergraduate enrollments, female graduate enrollments surpassed male graduate enrollments during this period. Looking at the participation rates of 18- to 24-year-olds in colleges and universities, participation rates of Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics increased between 1980 and 2004 and Black, Hispanic, and White females had higher enrollment rates than their male counterparts in 2004.

The education and training systems operating within most prisons are a key component of the rehabilitation mission of prisons. Previous studies have shown a relationship between participation in educational programs and recidivism rates, with inmates who attend education programs less likely to be reincarcerated after their release. There are many reasons why prison inmates may be motivated to participate in education and training programs. Among these may be a realization that they do not have skills that will lead to employment upon their release from prison. This chapter describes the relationships among literacy, education, and vocational training in prison. The analyses in the chapter discuss both the prevalence of inmate participation in education and training programs and the relationship between literacy levels and program participation.

This study used a pre-/post-test measure to assess changes in multicultural competence for a statewide group of education and rehabilitation staff following a one-time-only training. Findings produced mixed but limited results as to the efficacy of such training in multicultural competence. This suggests that short-term training may not produce powerful enough effects to impart long term changes; however, the results also imply that merely surveying staff about attitudes and practices may act to raise awareness and increase competence. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. (Contains 7 tables.)",

While many educators see CTE as a logical placement for students who are otherwise academically unsuccessful, the CTE teacher is too often unprepared for serving this population. Alternative routes of CTE teacher licensure often leave these teachers feeling unsure and ineffective. This article discusses concerns about this issue and includes an easy, four-step model CTE teachers serving students with disabilities can use to be more effective overall: (1) Orient staff who refer students to CTE programs and assist them in placement decisions; (2) Obtain assistance in implementing Individual Education Plan (IEP) accommodations; (3) Assess the appropriateness of the accommodations, record and make recommendations to the IEP team; and (4) Act as an advocate for the student in counseling and IEP development procedures.",

Many youth with diagnosed mental health needs experience poor transition outcomes and are among this country's least understood and most vulnerable youth. This report presents the findings from case studies of five promising program sites and identifies program design features that appear to improve transition outcomes, incorporate a holistic approach to meeting youth needs, and incorporate strong career preparation and employment components. Additionally, the report presents systems-level factors that affect success at the service delivery and individual outcome levels. This case study research demonstrates that no one government agency, state entity, local organization, program or project, or individual can do this hard work alone. Families, programs, and governmental entities must all work together, across silos and boundaries, if there is any hope of improving the outcomes of youth with mental health needs. Policymakers at all levels of government must tap the expertise of youth with mental health needs, programs and service providers, researchers, and practitioners to improve the likelihood of successful transition outcomes. Youth service professionals who work with youth with mental health needs across systems will be more successful if apprised of the policy directions, promising practices, and the views of youth and families. Successful programs must actively seek out partnerships with service agencies and organizations in their community to provide the comprehensive array of services needed by youth and young adults with mental health needs.",

Using this identity framework several ways that student identities--relative to mathematics learning--can be developed, supported, and maintained by teachers are provided.

The goal of the lesson was threefold: (a) to help the participants consider a nonstandard real-world contextual problem as mathematical activity, (b) to create an opportunity for participants to mathematize (Freudenthal, 1968), and (c) to unpack mathematical big ideas related to measurement and similarity. Participants' strategies were analyzed, prompting conversations about these big ideas, as well as an unanticipated one. (Contains 6 figures and 1 footnote.)",

In the author's experience, other aspects of the model development process often cause problems rather than the use of mathematics. Since these other aspects involve students in learning about and understanding complex problem situations the author conjectures that problems arise because insufficient time within mathematical modeling modules is spent reflecting on student work and enabling \"learning to learn\" about problem situations. Some suggestions for the content and delivery of mathematical modeling modules are given. (Contains 3 figures, 1 table, and 1 footnote.)",

The problem-posing model calls for the application of the following fundamental mathematical processes: proving, reversing, specializing, generalizing, and extending. The given problem turned out to be a rich source of interesting, worthwhile mathematical problems appropriate for secondary mathematics teachers and high school students. (Contains 14 figures.)",

Relationships between those attitudes and conceptions, as well as their relationships to achievement in statistics, were also studied. Significant correlations were found between student attitudes and achievement, both at the beginning and end of the course. A low, but significant, correlation was found between positive attitudes toward statistics and accurate conceptions about statistics in the posttest but not in the pretest. Although it was found that there was no change in student attitudes and conceptions over the course of the semester, students did have more positive attitudes and correct conceptions than expected. Additionally, instructor interviews revealed that the most common technique employed to improve student attitudes and conceptions was the use of real-world applications.

Using data from 6th grade mathematics teachers' use of curriculum materials, this study presents a discipline-specific model of experienced mathematics teachers' planning. The proposed model provides a lens for understanding the nature of teachers' planning decisions, and the conditions under which such decisions change over time. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)",

According to communication theory, individuals have different premises about the act of communicating, and these thoughts, called message design logics, guide the process of reasoning from goals or intentions to actual messages (O'Keefe, 1988, 1990). Three distinct message design logics have been identified by communication theorists: expressive, conventional, and rhetorical. Depending upon which logic an individual employs, a very different message is said and heard. This theory was used to investigate the message design logics of 15 secondary mathematics teachers. It was found that teachers have varying logics in their message production and, depending upon the logic used, distinct characteristics correspond to different teacher premises for classroom communication. The logic employed also results in different ways teachers encourage mathematical learning and evaluate classroom interactions. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)",

Practitioners, advocates, and policy makers in the field of education in emergencies must recognize that in order for quality education to be provided equitably, curricular decisions must not only be fully part of the remit for those organisations, agencies, or governments providing education in emergencies, but the decision-making processes must be transparent, inclusive, and participatory. The INEE Minimum Standards as they continue to be promoted, contextualised, and institutionalised, could play a crucial role in this process. (Contains 4 notes.)",

        "author":["Ginsburg, Mark"],
        "description":"This author feels that how one views NGOs (non-government organizations) depends on one's perspective, and thus his reflections in this article focus more on extending his earlier analysis, rather than revising it. The author does this by considering three relatively recent developments, which in different ways have provoked him to keep wrestling with the question posed in his 1998 article: &quot;What's in an acronym?&quot; The first development connects to his activity as a journal editor and a scholar. In working with David Suarez on his manuscript that was eventually published in &quot;Comparative Education Review,&quot; the author came to appreciate how intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) can serve as &quot;receptor sites for transnational ideas... promot[ing] and diffus[ing]... global models at the national level&quot;. The second development has been associated with changes in the institutional location of his professional work. Between 1976, when the author received his doctorate, and 2004, when he began working on the Education Reform Program in Egypt, the author based his professional life in universities. Most recently, in September 2006, he took up a position at the headquarters of the Academy for Educational Development (AED), a &quot;nonprofit organization working globally to improve education, health, civil society and economic development... collaborat[ing] with local and national partners... [and] serving people in all 50 U.S. states and more than 150 [other] countries&quot; (AED, 2007). Given its core values (passion, respect, results, integrity, innovation, diversity, and excellence) and its mission (&quot;to make a positive difference in peoples' lives by working in partnership to create and implement innovative solutions to critical social and economic problems&quot;) (AED, 2007), it seems appropriate to view this NGO as an example of a &quot;new great organization.&quot; The third development has perhaps had the biggest impact on his thinking, if not as much yet on his actions. This deals with the revelations of the role of Blackwater Worldwide and other NGOs, which have been the recipients of U.S. contracts for security work in Iraq. (Contains 5 notes.)",

        "description":"Sustainability strategies are closely tied to the logic of the donor in every institution. Philanthropies that are set up with a limited time-span tend to scale up their impact differently. The educational programs of the Open Society Institute, for example, prioritize institutionalization over any other sustainability strategy. This is how it works: a national foundation incubates an innovative practice in an area that is neglected by the government in the hope that the complementary project will, as soon as possible, become incorporated in state institutions and inscribed in educational policy. In practice this means that the national foundation initiates, designs, and monitors a project that, upon successful completion of the pilot stage, is to be implemented on a large scale. Preferably, it will be funded by the government or, if this is not possible, by other donors. Naturally, tensions do emerge with other international organizations, especially larger ones that also attempt to exert influence on national policy-making. How donor logic impacts the cooperation of donor organizations with governments as well as with other international organizations is a topic that deserves much more scrutiny. In this article, the author explores the characteristics of the &quot;new philanthropies.&quot; (Contains 2 notes.)",

        "description":"\"Can NGOs provide alternative development in a market-based system of global economics?\" Today, a full ten years after the author first asked this question, individuals still have only partial answers. There is no doubt that NGOs are playing in a more significant role in global ODA (overseas development assistance). While the reasons for supply of aid are varied, certainly furthering the institutional or national strength of the donor is a primary consideration. While NGOs may not entirely voice this agenda, NGOs are increasingly linked to the economic and political motives behind such aid. Additionally, NGOs' position between governments and economies means that they face controls that government recipients of international aid funds do not often face. This positions the NGOs in a constrained environment. In this context, NGOs sometimes act as agents of state or global economic forces. This article addresses these four points as a means of addressing the author's original question. (Contains 3 tables and 2 notes.)",

        "author":["Silova, Iveta"],
        "description":"The NGO boom of the 1990s was matched by mounting literature on the influence of NGOs on world politics. The 1998 inaugural issue of \"Current Issues in Comparative Education\" (\"CICE\")--\"Are NGOs Overrated?\"--brought these debates into the very center of international and comparative education. The journal issue inspired a fascinating conversation about the powers and limits of NGOs in the area of education by highlighting the variety of types, qualities, and functions of NGOs, as well as discussing various NGO roles vis-a-vis the state. Some articles emphasized the virtues of NGOs in promoting educational change, while others criticized NGOs for imposing a neoliberal agenda and maintaining systemic inequity. A decade after the initial debate, the reality is that there is still no clear answer to the question \"CICE\" editors originally posed. What a decade of intellectual debate and research has brought, however, is a realization that NGOs are obscure organizations, whose impact is often impossible to predict. NGOs forge contested alliances with governments, international organizations, and local communities (often contested from within and without); and, notwithstanding their success or failure in reaching their officially proclaimed goals, NGOs are capable of altering larger political, economic, and social processes in unpredictable ways. The status of NGOs as obscure organizations is most evident in the context of authoritarian or centralist states. This article argues that people should look beyond the officially proclaimed goals of NGOs in assessing their impact. Instead, they should examine the political contexts within which NGOs forge contested alliances with international organizations, authoritarian regimes, and local actors to better understand the hidden agendas inherent in the very nature of these organizations and the inadvertent consequences resulting from these complex interactions.

Today the language has changed--and so too, in some ways, has practice. In this article, the author looks at the new turn to &quot;civil society&quot; in development discourse. In particular, she answers the question: What does civil society have to do with the achievement of education for all--particularly in poor countries where universal access to basic education has not been achieved? First, she looks at how civil society engagement is being constructed in the official policy discourse of development aid organizations, raising questions about the narrowness and limitations of this conceptualization. She then argues for using a &quot;social citizenship&quot; lens when thinking about civil society and its role in the achievement of education for all. Throughout, she introduces examples from a recent study of civil society organizations (CSOs) and their interactions with internationally funded sector programs in education in four African countries: (1) Burkina Faso; (2) Mali; (3) Kenya; and (4) Tanzania.

Principles driving design and implementation of a two-course sequence in professional transportation studies are presented. Asian students were cast as teachers who made regular presentations and understood they had valuable contributions to make, not traditional passive roles to play. The students showed an ability to undertake interdisciplinary analysis; to question assumptions of existing practice; and to seek solutions for local needs that often departed from those suggested by commonly-taught Western-based theory. The students gained notably in presentation skills and self-confidence. These are important attributes for attaining change in developing countries. Inferences from the results of the study are limited by the sample of highly-talented graduate students.

        "description":"Science educators have generally agreed that understanding the atom concept is the basis of science education. However, the numerous research studies have shown that many students at all educational levels have difficulties understanding this concept. This study was developed under three headings. The first was to identify misconceptions that prospective teachers (PTs) had about atomic structure in the context of electrification by friction (ASCEF). The second was to study the effectiveness of the branch differences (basic sciences, social sciences, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics) on the levels of their misconceptions. The third, based on students' misconceptions, was to examine the effectiveness of the activity &quot;Modelling of the Atomic Structure&quot; (MAS). The study was divided into two stages. First, in order to identify the PTs' misconceptions, an Understanding the Nature of Electrification by Friction Test (UNEFT) which could be summarised by the question &quot;is electrification by friction due to the electron transfer?&quot; was applied to the PTs who attended the Primary School Teacher Education Pedagogical Formation Certificate Program (PSTEPFCP) at a large public university for a five weeks science teaching course followed by an examination after the static electricity topic had been presented. It was found that the PTs from all branches of science held the misconception that electrification by friction was due to the transfer of protons. At the same time the effects of the branch differences on the levels of the PTs' misconceptions was studied and was not significant in groups other than the basic scientists-social scientists pairing. In the second stage, using the students' misconceptions, the effectiveness of the MAS activity was examined in the experimental and control groups and was found to be significant at all levels. From this result, it was found that the models were quite useful in teaching science and that the construction of knowledge would be possible if students played an active role in the learning environment.

This curriculum development was carried out in the &quot;Kiriwong Community&quot; in Nakornsrithammarat Province, Southern Thailand. The ethnobotany curriculum was developed after conducting ethnographic research to better understand how villagers might learn to gain the benefits from plants and what knowledge and skills were required to prepare their student to live well in their community. Data were collected through participant observation and in-depth interview. Developing the ethnobotany curriculum, I incorporated the basic information gained from studying the Kiriwong villagers' needs and (a) their usage of plants into the study of ethnobotany, (b) sustainable natural resource management principles, (c) rural philosophy for education, and (d) constructivist theory to obtain an ethnobotany curriculum. It is my belief that by creating science curricula the take advantage of these local resources it will be possible to assist students to both develop understandings about content and about the nature of science that are in the government's science standards and to learn sciences in their own context. They can apply such knowledge and skills in their current and future situations and lifestyles. (Contains 2 figures.)",

In total, 250 secondary school teachers undertaking part-time bachelor of education program in the University of Benin, formed the sample of this study. Simple percentage, summation and qualitative methods were the statistical tools adopted to analyse the data. A very startling and frightening revelation is that no teacher in the sample taught national consciousness and values through exercises in the affective and psychomotor domains. It is also shown that the greatest problem teachers encounter in the teaching of citizenship education is students' nonchalant attitudes to the subject. It is therefore recommended that government and multinational companies need to sponsor workshops, conferences and seminars on the use of exercises in the affective and psychomotor domains to teach citizenship education.

        "description":"The teaching profession is no longer a concern of academicians but the public in general who yearn for positive results. Internationally, the profession is continuously beset by several serious problems. One of the most serious problems in the teaching profession is teacher turnover. Governments are finding it difficult to retain teachers in schools. In Malawi, this problem is profound and overwhelming, even by Sub-Saharan standards. The paper heavily relies on secondary data derived from general trends and observations of several research findings as well as government publications, newspapers and several academic papers. The paper argues that main cause of this problem in Malawi can be attributed to general poor working conditions. The paper further argues that retention measures derived by the Malawi government may take time to bear fruits and it is unlikely that they can seriously affect teachers positively because they do not address the basic immediate needs of the teachers.

The purpose of the research was to establish the existence of the Sara Communication Initiative (SCI), a girls' intervention program, which had been introduced to selected rural schools. During the preliminary visits, I interviewed head teachers, teachers, pupils and parents. The major issues identified were: that girls were overworked at home compared to boys; that girls were sometimes denied parental care and protection after puberty; that girls in most rural schools lacked female role models; that some girls failed to continue schooling due to poverty; and that some girls failed to enrol in school due to long distances. The situation suggests that more needs to be done for the advancement of the education of rural girls.",

This study examined faculty explanations for international graduate students' isolation because faculty are in a unique position to observe and interact with both international and host national students as they spend time learning and working together within their academic department. Faculty believed that international students' strong ties with co-nationals, their weak English language skills, and their lack of time to invest in friendships all played a role in their isolation. They also identified host national students' friendship preferences and structural barriers as contributing factors. Faculty observations generally supported previous findings, however, one important difference is discussed in light of differing cultural norms regarding friendships.",

The results show that although parental willingness to be involved in pupils' homework is high, this involvement is hampered by many socio-economic factors, including illiteracy and low income. On many occasions, homework is not only incomplete, but also not done, and the pupils are consequently punished for this. In the absence of clear, written policy on homework, there is a poor fit of inclusion of homework as the unwritten part of the curriculum. (Contains 3 footnotes.)",

In this paper, I will explain the possibilities of tools from practice in creating and engaging in learning and knowledge production in developmental psychology. Based on the notions of my teaching philosophy, social constructionism and a family systems perspective, I applied the principles of the multigenerational genogram, life-story remembering and reflective journal writing as strategies for choreographing the stage on which reflective learning and the co-construction of knowledge took place. In a reflection on practice I contend that these strategies, when combined in a learning context for lifespan developmental psychology, provide useful tools for gaining access to the kinship network and balance the teaching enterprise with a process of everyday living so that learning becomes both pictorial and practical.

The exploration was made against a decision taken by the Ministry of Education to end the partnership venture established in the 1980s between itself and the local communities in the running of the junior secondary school. The paper was informed by views of a group of Heads of junior secondary schools who only a few years ago co-managed these schools with the Board of Governors. Relevant literature aided and backed the argumentation of the paper. The paper began by an examination of the concept of a community. This was followed by a background, to illuminate the discussion of the paper, detailing the evolution of community schools in Botswana. The paper concluded that the decision taken by the Government to terminate its partnership with communities had the potential to de-motive community participation in education at both the local and national levels.

The article compares the Hong Kong's response to the threat of globalisation with that of the other places and concludes that the nature of competitiveness is being particularly highlighted in its internationalisation of higher education. Its response is in resonance to the city's culture, which stresses market competition and survival of the fittest, and can be seen as being manipulated by the government and business sector in maintaining their dominance and power.",

The service quality measurements have been employed to investigate its applicability in the education environment. Most of previous studies employ the regression-based analysis to test the effectiveness of course evaluations and teaching. In econometric term, the use of regression-based analysis contains some bias. This is because it does not capture the complex and interaction terms of the variables under study. In this article, the authors try to compare the use of a loglinear model versus the widely used normal-regression analyses to evaluate the students' course evaluations of Spanish classes at Universiti Utara Malaysia. SERVQUAL model has been employed in order to examine the usefulness of the model under study. The findings from the study shows that the loglinear model provides a better analytical procedure for students' course evaluation as it is able to explain more variation in the model under study.

        "description":"This study is an investigation of the ability of self-regulated learning (SRL) as measured by the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MSLQ) to predict academic achievement among undergraduates in Malaysia. A total of 460 second-year engineering undergraduates from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia participated in the study. Academic achievement was measured by the students' grade point average. The results show that the MSLQ is a reliable tool and SRL is a significant predictor of Malaysian undergraduates' academic achievement. Significant relationships between SRL and academic achievement were found, nevertheless differences in the composition of significant predictor sub-scales are also found between achievement groups.

In-country intensive immersion experiences were considered beneficial for language teacher professional development. This project examined the Australian teachers' perceptions of their teaching and home-stay experiences during a three week short-term international teaching and homestay experience in South Korea. Findings suggested that teacher language awareness was indeed heightened through the extra metalinguistic awareness gained through systematic reflection on teaching and learning events.

Drawing on ethnographic methods it explores students' own views on the role of ethnic background in shaping who they are friends with, and how these relate to their observed behaviour. It shows that several major peer groups in the school divide on broadly ethnic lines, but that shared orientation toward language and cultural maintenance, rather than common ethnic background are the glue that holds these groups together. The study also finds that relations between ethnic groups at this school are remarkably cordial and closes by reflecting on the possible reasons for this, and the steps schools can take to mitigate inter-ethnic hostility and promote a climate of tolerance and inclusion.

As a result of the analyses, six factors took place in the 41-item scale. In general, the ETSS (at the international level) reveals the general situation of the education given about educational technologies in the education faculties of universities in Turkey. In particular, the scale (at the national level) helps universities in Turkey evaluate themselves for their education about educational technologies.

To measure attitudes toward technology, it is important to have valid and reliable instruments. In this study, the authors used confirmatory factor analysis to verify construct validity for the Teachers' Attitudes Toward Computers (TAC) Questionnaire, an instrument created from 32 well-validated scales, as a more parsimonious questionnaire covering areas assessed by previously existing instruments in the field. Since its creation as 284 items in 1997, this Likert- and Semantic Differential-based instrument has undergone two major refinements, each of which was designed to reduce the number of items while retaining subscale internal consistency reliabilities in the range of 0.8-0.9. The 51-item version of the TAC (v. 6.1) produced acceptable goodness-of-fit indices for its nine subscale constructs, based on analysis of 1,179 teacher responses from 2003. High internal consistency reliabilities were also verified for additional sets of 2006 teacher data and 2008 preservice teacher preparation data. This led the authors to conclude that the TAC is a well-validated, reliable instrument for teacher' self-appraisal of their attitudes toward computers, worthy of continued use in multiple language and cultural environments.

Research indicates that the vast majority of teachers in Turkey believe the use of computers in education is important, but have limited knowledge  and experience on how to use technology in their instruction. This paper describes the T-Math project (http://www.t-math.org), which adapted the InterMath (http://intermath.coe.uga.edu) knowledge base for mathematics teachers in the United States and developed relevant resources for professional development of Turkish mathematics teachers to guide them in constructing useful strategies for their students while developing as expert mathematics teachers. Examples of mathematical investigations adopted and developed in the T-Math project are presented as well as the anticipated challenges and subsequent strategies for integration.

Building on a sociocultural perspective that incorporates mental objects, learning is described as a mutually dependent process involving personal sense making and the public negotiation of meaning. Analysis of student problem solving is focused on the development of taken-as-  shared meaning through an individual and collaborative analysis of the properties of various conceptual entities. The results suggest that functional properties inherent in linear relationships were more supportive in eliciting meaning making exchanges than were algebraic properties associated with generalized arithmetic, although the contextual nature of the linear tasks may have also supported the meaning making activity.

Structural  equation modeling was carried out on data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study:  1988 database. The two variables were placed in a model together with the mediating variables of parental involvement, educational aspirations of peers, student's educational  aspirations, and mathematics self-concept. A nonsignificant direct effect of SES on course  taking suggests the lack of an \"automatic\" privilege of high-SES students in terms of course  placements. The significant indirect effect of previous mathematics achievement tells that it  needs to be translated into high educational aspirations and a strong mathematics self-concept to eventually lead to advanced course taking.

The study was inspired by criticisms that college lecturers' assessments were not producing valid critiques of ISTs' mathematical and pedagogical competencies to implement strategies  they learned in their coursework. Case studies of two pairs of ISTs, one pair at a state high  school and the other at a private high school, provided data for this study. During their coursework, ISTs learned new pedagogical skills and upgraded their content knowledge. Findings indicate that lecturer and peer assessment of the same lesson taught by an IST resulted in different but complementary critiques. The lecturer's critique highlighted both strengths and weaknesses of a lesson while the peer's critique refrained from pointing out weaknesses of a lesson. An important implication for the findings, in Zimbabwe, is that the deployment of ISTs in pairs for teaching practice may be beneficial to their professional development.

This study examines the demographic nature and experiences of K-12 online teachers. Findings show that online teachers are experienced in the traditional classroom, as indicated by their years of experience and the level of their advanced degrees. These teachers seek a better means to engage with students, a greater sense of community, and the ability to teach without the constraints of traditional teachings, such as a bell schedule or issues of classroom management. Data also suggest that aspects of teaching online, such as the number of classes/students, student motivation, and lack of support, can be overwhelming at times. Through this study, we are able to gain a better understanding of the educators themselves, including specific advantages and challenges of teaching in an online environment.

We offer TPACK-based \"activity types,\" rooted in previous research about content-specific activity structures, as an alternative to existing professional development approaches and explain how this new way of thinking may authentically and successfully assist teachers' and teacher educators' technology integration efforts.

The integrated mixed-methods results provide evidence for the following: (a) teachers use technology most frequently for preparation, management, and administrative purposes; (b) teachers' use of technology to support student-centered practice is rare even among those who work at  technology-rich schools and hold student-centered beliefs; (c) teachers in technology-rich schools continue to use technology in ways that support their already existing teacher-centered instructional practices. We conclude that future technology professional development efforts need to focus on integration of technology into curriculum via student-centered pedagogy while attending to multiple contextual conditions under which teacher practice takes place. Future technology research must use mixed methods and consider teachers' beliefs if change in practice is the desired outcome. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Another was a self-paced condition, in which none of the supports were available. The other two conditions provided intermediate levels of support. All conditions showed significant impact on teachers' mathematical understanding, pedagogical beliefs, and instructional practices. Surprisingly, the positive outcomes were comparable across all four conditions.

This study was designed to increase the efficiency of program status reporting by direct care residential staff in a large residential setting serving an average daily census of 95 youth residing in four distinct residential programs: including programs for sexually abusive adolescents, sexually reactive adolescents, adolescents with anger management problems, and a latency age children's program. Staff were trained to implement a 13 item checklist specifying key information such as the number of critical incidents, physical holds, family contacts, completion of scheduled unit activities and completion of required documentation at the end of each residential shift. Direct care staff  were trained to implement the status report protocol using a staff management package including antecedent procedures consisting of instructions, role-playing and feedback on the use of the reporting protocol and consequent procedures comprised of written and verbal feedback provided by a supervisor to staff on a weekly basis. The feedback given to direct care staff consisted of the percentage of items they reported correctly from the 13-item status reporting protocol. The staff management intervention package was assessed employing a multiple baseline design across the four programs. Reliability data were collected on an average of 58% of the reports given by staff during baseline and intervention. The data indicated that the staff management package was successful in increasing the efficiency of program status reporting by direct care staff. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Temperament-influenced behavior patterns evident in infancy have also been found to predict behavioral tendencies in adulthood. Such observations suggest that neurophysiological structures and physiological events associated with temperament concepts exert a mediating or moderating influence between current environmental events and behavior.

It is maintained that technical differences between the two approaches are overshadowed by ones of conceptualization. Comprehensive distancing emerged from efforts to extend Skinner's work on verbal behavior and rule-governance to clinical phenomena, while relational frame theory as a post-Skinnerian account of human language has served as the conceptual foundation for ACT. Possible research strategies to further clarify conceptual differences between the two approaches are discussed.",

        "description":"Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) is a scientifically-supported program for family members who are desperate to get a treatment-refusing substance abuser to enter treatment (Meyers & Wolfe, 2004; Sisson & Azrin, 1986; Smith & Meyers, 2004). CRAFT teaches these family members how to apply behavioral principles at home so that clean and sober behavior is reinforced and substance use is discouraged. CRAFT-trained family members consistently are able to engage their substance-abusing loved one into treatment in nearly seven out of 10 cases. Notably, the program is effective with ethnically diverse populations, across various types of relationships (spouses, parent-adult child), and without regard for the particular drug of abuse (alcohol, cocaine). This paper provides a rationale for working with family members when a resistant individual refuses treatment, and supplies an overview of both the CRAFT program components and the research findings.",

The youngster was hospitalized four times for suicide attempts, three previous placements in residential treatment centers.  MDT is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that combines the balance of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) (Linehan, 1993), the importance of perception from functional analytic psychotherapy (FAP) (Kohlenberg & Tsai, 1993), and A.T. Beck' 1996) mode theory with a methodology to address the adolescents' belief system. MDT has   been shown to be effective in a descriptive study with CBT (Apsche & Ward, 2002).

A multiple baseline design across three teachers and six students was used to measure the effectiveness of the   instructional procedures. The results indicated that the teachers' students achieved significantly more learning objectives when they used a verbally governed algorithm to solve instructional problems.

This model is based on a modern behavior analytic account of language and cognition known as relational frame theory (RFT; see Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, & Roche, 2001 or Blackledge, 2003) and the treatment approach is called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (or ACT as one word).

It is based on the counter-intuitive finding that often highly diverging treatments do not differ much in effectiveness. There is evidence that much of the common effect of different treatments can be related to unspecific factors as opposed to treatment-specific techniques. The present paper offers a short behavior analytic reflection on contemporary directions concerning effective therapeutic relationships. It suggests that the idiographic vision inherent in functional analysis may point at an alternative avenue for psychotherapy outcome research that is entirely different from those on empirically supported treatments and empirically supported relationships, and that this third direction may shed more light on the question as to what determines therapeutic change.",

Eighty-two parents completed measures related to familism, child behavior problems, parenting stress, and acceptance of corporal and non-corporal punishment techniques before rating the acceptability of six child management techniques. Results indicate that higher levels of familism, especially perceived family support, are associated with higher treatment acceptability.

Advances in the research have led to numerous applications of behavior analysis methodologies, and the creation of the Behavior Analyst Certification Board in 2000. Yet, despite certification setting a standard for competence in the practice of Applied Behavior Analysis, there are no established standards in the U.S. for organizations or agencies that provide ABA as a primary treatment approach.

        "description":"When navigating by path integration, knowledge of one's position becomes increasingly uncertain as one walks from a known location. This uncertainty decreases if one perceives a known landmark location nearby. We hypothesized that remembering landmarks might serve a similar purpose for path integration as directly perceiving them. If this is true, walking near a remembered landmark location should enhance response consistency in path integration tasks. To test this, we asked participants to view a target and then attempt to walk to it without vision. Some participants saw the target plus a landmark during the preview. Compared with no-landmark trials, response consistency nearly doubled when participants passed near the remembered landmark location. Similar results were obtained when participants could audibly perceive the landmark while walking. A control experiment ruled out perceptual context effects during the preview. We conclude that remembered landmarks can enhance path integration even though they are not directly perceived. (Contains 4 tables, 2 figures and 1 footnote.)",

Three experiments investigated whether advanced cuing of the imagination direction improves performance in an imagined self-rotation task. RT performance did not improve when extended time was given to complete the imagination process, or after participants reported the completion of the imagination. Moreover, when pointing to multiple targets after a single imagination, later responses did not show improvement. These results cast doubt on the traditional imagination hypothesis and suggest re-interpretation of the angular disparity effects in perspective changes tasks. (Contains 4 figures and 3 footnotes.)",

Locating a visual target with the intention of reaching it requires that the relevant spatial information is considered in relation with the body-part that will be used to perform the task. This entails the selection of body-scaled visual information in regard to an action-dependent system of reference. In this regard, experimental data are presented which suggest that (1) what is visually perceived as reachable depends on anthropometrical and motor factors. (2) The location of what is visually reachable is defined according to body limbs, which serve as system of reference in the specification of the spatial dimensions that characterise the reachable object. (3) The system of reference is specified from a combination of visual and somatic information, what is accounted for by the notion of \"allelocentric\" system of reference. (4) The specification of the independent spatial dimensions determining the location of a visual object, i.e. distance and direction, is based on visual signals of different nature.

        "description":"Many studies have analysed how goal directed movements are corrected in response to changes in the properties of the target. However, only simple movements to single targets have been used in those studies, so little is known about movement corrections under more complex situations. Evidence from studies that ask for movements to several targets in sequence suggests that whole sequences of movements are planned together. Planning related segments of a movement together makes it possible to optimise the whole sequence, but it means that some parts are planned quite long in advance, so that it is likely that they will have to be modified. In the present study we examined how people respond to changes that occur while they are moving to the first target of a sequence. Subjects moved a stylus across a digitising tablet. They moved from a specified starting point to two targets in succession. The first of these targets was always at the same position but it could have one of two sizes. The second target could be in one of two different positions and its size was different in each case. On some trials the first target changed size, and on some others the second target changed size and position, as soon as the subject started to move. When the size of the first target changed the subjects slowed down the first segment of their movements. Even the peak velocity, which was only about 150 ms after the change in size, was lower. Beside this fast response to the change itself, the dwell time at the first target was also affected: its duration increased after the change. Changing the size and position of the second target did not influence the first segment of the movement, but also increased the dwell time. The dwell time was much longer for a small target, irrespective of its initial size. If subjects knew in advance which target could change, they moved faster than if they did not know which could change. Taken together, these results suggest that the whole sequence is treated as one action, which can be corrected if the properties of any of the targets change. The precise nature and timing of the correction depends on how the change influences the task. (Contains 1 table and 7 figures.)",

        "description":"We investigated how size and depth are perceived in a plane or convex mirror. In Experiment 1, using a plane or convex mirror, 20 observers viewed a separation between two objects that were presented at a constant distance and reproduced it by a separation between other two objects in a natural viewing situation. The mean matches generally approximated the real size of the standard and did not equal either virtual size or visual angle of the standard. In addition, the mean matches obtained with convex mirrors were reduced by about 7% in comparison with those obtained with the plane mirror. In Experiment 2, we examined whether the perceived depth in a convex mirror is comparable to that in a plane mirror. We presented isosceles triangles on a table and required 12 observers to observe them with a plane or convex mirror. With the method of limits, we determined the triangle that was perceived as an equilateral triangle. When the apexes of isosceles triangles were directed to the observer or to depth, the ratio of height to base was larger in convex mirrors than in the plane mirror, whereas when the apexes were directed to left or to right, the ratio of height to base was smaller in the convex mirrors than in the plane mirror. The contraction of perceived depth amounted to about 6% in convex mirrors. The results of both experiments suggest that although separation and depth in convex mirrors appear to reduce, there is a strong tendency that visual system recovers the optical distortions by convex mirrors.

Results indicated visual angle as a determinant factor for perceived relative distance as observed in the absence of perceptual errors to distances with visual angle equal or larger than 70 degrees that could be attributed to a combination of sources of visual information.

        "description":"Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) can be measured from two types of equivalently considered movement referred to as drifting-motion and displacement-motion. Displacement motion can be best described as the horizontal displacement of a stimulus, thus implying pursuit eye movements, and involves moving the stimulus from the fixation point of gaze towards the periphery. The drifting motion of a Gabor patch, for example, avoids pursuit eye movements, since the gaze is fixed in a point of the patch. Our data shows that in both types of movement visual acuity (VA), expressed in terms of spatial frequency, diminished as the velocity of the target increased. However, the slope of the regression equation indicated that this impairment is more than two-fold in the case of drifting-motion when compared to displacement motion. As the greater impairment took place when pursuit eye movements did not exist, our data suggests that these two types of motions correct differently for retinal slip. Retinal slip appears to be less efficiently compensated for in the case of drifting motion having adverse consequences on VA, while retinal slip has a higher tolerance in the case of displacement motion exhibited by the performance in VA.

Often these patterns have been regarded as implying different channels for each type of radial direction (outward versus inwards) operating at a higher level of visual motion processing. In two experiments (detection and discrimination tasks) we report reaction time asymmetries between expansion and contraction. Power functions were fitted to the data. While an exponent of 0.5 accounted for the expansion data better, a value of unity yielded the best fit for the contraction data. Instead of interpreting these differences as corresponding to different higher order motion detectors, we regard these findings as reflecting the fact that expansion and contraction tap two distinct psychophysical input channels underlying the processing of fast and slow velocities respectively.

The participants performed a visual search task with four stimuli (the target and three distractors) presented always around the fixation point, inside an outlined frame not related to the search task. A cue informed the subject only about the possible size and shape of the frame, not about the target. The results of the first experiment showed faster target detection in the valid cue trials, suggesting that attention was captured automatically by the cue shape. In the second experiment, we introduced a flanker stimulus (compatible or incompatible with the target) in order to determine if attentional resources spread homogenously inside and outside the frame. The results showed that performance depended both on cue validity and frame orientation. The flanker effect was dependent on compatibility and flanker position (vertical or horizontal meridian). The results of both experiments suggest that the form of an irrelevant object can capture attention despite participants' intention and the results of the second experiment suggest that the attentional resources are more concentrated along the horizontal meridian.

Haptic picture naming accuracy is dependent upon familiarity and access to semantic memory, just as in visual recognition. Performance is high when haptic picture recognition tasks do not depend upon semantic memory. Viewpoint matters for the ease or difficulty of interpreting haptic pictures of solid objects. Top views were easiest for sighted and blind persons when geometrical solids had constant cross-sections in the vertical axis. The presence or absence of viewpoint effects depends upon the nature of the solids that are represented. Congenitally blind people do not spontaneously produce perspective drawings, but recent data suggests that depictions including linear perspective can be understood after minimal experience.

Many studies have tried to understand if the two processes share the same mechanisms or if they are independent, using different neural substrates. Most research has been directed towards the need of activation of primary visual areas during imagery. Here we review some of the works providing evidence for both claims. It seems that studying visual imagery in blind subjects can be used as a way of answering some of those questions, namely if it is possible to have visual imagery without visual perception. We present results from the work of our group using visual activation in dreams and its relation with EEG's spectral components, showing that congenitally blind have visual contents in their dreams and are able to draw them; furthermore their Visual Activation Index is negatively correlated with EEG alpha power. This study supports the hypothesis that it is possible to have visual imagery without visual experience. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Forward displacement of moving targets was less (a) when launchers appeared than when launchers vanished, and (b) when targets moved in the direction of implied impetus than when targets moved in a direction orthogonal to implied impetus. Whether launchers appeared or vanished did not influence displacement of targets that remained stationary. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that forward displacement of the target decreased when observers attributed target motion to an impetus resulting from gamma movement of the launcher that was imparted to the target.

The aim of the experiment reported here was to demonstrate unblocking using a similar procedure as in the previous work. Three groups of rats were initially trained to find an invisible platform in the presence of three landmarks: ABC for the Blocking and Unblocking groups and LMN for the Control group. Then, all animals were trained to find the platform in the presence of four landmarks, ABCX. In this second training, unlike animals in the Blocking group to which only a new landmark (X) was added in comparison to the first training, the animals in the Unblocking group also had a change in the platform position. In the Control group, both the four landmarks and the platform position were totally new at the beginning of this second training. As in Rodrigo et al. (1997) a blocking effect was found: rats in the Blocking group learned less with respect to the added landmark (X) than did animals in the Control group. However, rats in the Unblocking group learned about the added landmark (X) as well as did animals in the Control group. The results are interpreted as an unblocking effect due to a change in the platform position between the two phases of training, similarly to what is normal in classical conditioning experiments, in which a change in the conditions of reinforcement between the two training phases of a blocking design produce an attenuation or elimination of this effect. These results are explained within an error-correcting connectionist account of spatial navigation (McLaren, 2002). (Contains 2 figures.)",

In Experiment 2, this congruency effect was obtained with primes that were pseudo-words that had been previously associated with symbolic positive or negative outcomes (medicinal plants or poisons). However, the effect was only obtained on trials with positive targets. In Experiment 3, the primes were positive, negative and neutral pseudo-words that had acquired valence through association with positive, negative or neutral outcomes, respectively. In this case, the congruency effect was obtained with both positive and negative targets. Evaluative responses to the targets were significantly slower on incongruent than on congruent trials. However, reaction times on trials with neutral primes did not differ significantly from reaction times on trials with either positive or negative primes. These results suggest that associative learning procedures where a neutral cue is paired with a symbolic valenced outcome confer this cue an affective valence or condition an evaluative response to it. This associatively acquired valence then affects evaluative processing of a target when the learned signal is used as a prime. However, our results do not allow a conclusion as to whether this effect is due to the facilitatory effects of congruence, the inhibitory effects of incongruency or both. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Although this view is consistent with evidence in the verbal learning tradition (Underwood, 1966) and, more recently, in predictive learning with humans (Pineno & Matute, 2000), little research has been conducted to ascertain whether the occurrence of this effect critically depends on the target and interfering associations sharing an identical outcome. The present experiment examined, in predictive learning with humans, retroactive interference between cues trained apart as a function of the similarity of the outcome paired with the cues. Interference was found to be stronger when the cues were paired with the same outcome than when they were paired with either similar or different outcomes.

        "description":"In the predictive learning and causal reasoning literature it has been suggested that the processing of events is under the control of a competitive mechanism. However, little is known about whether the competitive mechanism operates at the encoding or near the response stages. The present work suggests that measures based on the recall of frequencies of the cells in the contingency table could help us in the placement of the competition principle within the processing stages. As the contingency judgment about a constant symptom-illness relation changed according to the validity of a second different symptom, we concluded in favour of a competition mechanism. However, estimated frequencies did not change as a result of such manipulation. This dissociation suggests that the competitive mechanism operates near the response stage rather than at the stimulus encoding period. (Contains 2 tables, 2 figures and 1 footnote.)",

The predictions of the theory agree quite acceptably in one and two dimensions (CTVA-2D) with the experimental results (reaction times and accuracy of response). The difference between reaction-times for the compatible and incompatible responses, known as the response-compatibility effect, is also acceptably predicted, except at small distances and high number of distractors. Further results using the same paradigm at even smaller distances have been now obtained, showing greater discrepancies. Then, we have introduced a method to evaluate the strength of sensory evidence (eta parameter), which takes grouping by similarity into account and minimizes these discrepancies.

While national and international information has been available on homicides of people in general, little attention has been given to homicides of PWDD specifically. This paper provides a preliminary description of homicides as they affect PWDD. Through content analysis, 1128 media cases of homicides of PWDD involving 1967 deaths were examined. Seven groups implicated in these deaths were identified: acquaintances, caregivers, family members, government representatives, roommates, strangers, and those who could not be identified given the information provided. For those PWDD who could be identified by age and gender, the majority killed were male and four years of age or younger. Individuals responsible for the deaths of PWDD were predominantly male, with the exception of the Family group. The deaths of PWDD primarily resulted from neglect, burns, beatings, shootings, and asphyxia. Discussion examines media presentation of homicides, research on homicide, models of violence and aggression, and prevention. (Contains 4 tables.)",

Canadian NewsDisc, an online biographic database service, was used to examine the use of stigmatizing language such as afflicted by, afflicted with, suffered from, suffers from, or suffering from within the context of cerebral palsy. Between January 1994 and December 2000, 3939 media stories indexed included the term cerebral palsy. Stigmatizing language was significantly more frequently used within the context of homicide and cerebral palsy. In 94.74% of media stories, the terms mercy killing or euthanasia were used within the context of Tracy Latimer's homicide. While the Latimer case provided an extreme example of the media associating stigmatizing terms with the killing of PWCP, the same association was made in other cases. Results from this study are discussed in terms of self-categorization theory, media effect, and factors associated with discrimination against PWCP. (Contains 4 tables.)",

All contests were held in 2003 and included a mix of urban, suburban, and rural schools. Among the contest programs analyzed, 81 concert bands from 72 schools performed a total of 243 compositions. Results indicated 1) 46.1% of the selections were composed by just 9.9% of the total number of composers/arrangers represented, 2) nearly 9.9% of the pieces were composed or arranged by just one person, 3) 29.2% of the literature was less than three years old, and 4) 27.6% of the music was published by a single company. Furthermore, 5) transcriptions and arrangements of historical masterworks accounted for 7.8% of the repertoire, 6) 1.6% of pieces represented music of a non-European culture, and 7) 48.1% of concert selections were included in at least one of the music lists examined. Implications of these findings in relation to national and state learning standards and recommendations for broadening the repertoire programmed for middle school band contests are discussed.

Testing of pitch accuracy was analyzed using the Sona-Speech Model 3600 software program. Inaccurate singers (N=168) from a population of 320 fourth, fifth, and sixth grade students, were divided into three subgroups and a random sample of subjects was selected to be in a treatment group (N=30) and a control group (N=30). The Yuba Method, which is meant to target training of the cricothyroid muscle utilizing a series of vocal exercises intended to facilitate maneuverability over the vocal register break, was administered to treatment subjects (N=30) in a single 45-minute session. The effect of treatment was highly significant at the p less than 0.001 significance level. Significant differences were also found among singing ability subgroups (before training) at the p = 0.002 significance level. Among inaccurate singers, the least accurate subgroup benefited the most and the most accurate singers benefited the least. Based on the results, the treatment was highly successful in correcting inaccurate elementary school singers in this study. (Contains 13 tables and 3 figures.)",

The purpose of this study was to ascertain, through participant self-report data, the activities and accomplishments of Massachusetts all-state musicians in four areas of student endeavor: music, academics, leadership, and extracurricular activities. Massachusetts all-state participants are high achievers not only in music but also in academics, honors, student government, leadership, athletics, service, and extracurricular activities. Suggestions for further research include broadening similar studies to other states and other disciplines to attempt to isolate characteristics of all-state students. (Contains 2 tables.)",

One hundred-sixty high school students participating in either extracurricular athletic or musical activities served as subjects. Extracurricular activities were defined as un-graded activities offered beyond the regular school day. An open-ended, free response questionnaire was used to determine what personal factors students felt contributed most to their reasons for choosing to participate in extracurricular activities. Questionnaires were analyzed for similarities and differences and responses were coded and categorized. Four distinct categories of subject responses emerged from the analyses: &quot;Social/Integrative,&quot; &quot;Kinesthetic,&quot; &quot;Self-Esteem,&quot; and &quot;Self-Efficacy.&quot; Athlete and musician participants shared similar reasons for participating in extracurricular activities. Both groups articulated satisfaction in sharing their athletic or musical activity with others; a need for physical expression/release through musical or athletic movement; positive feelings of self-worth as a result of participation; and a sense of self-confidence in their ability to participate successfully in athletic and musical endeavors. Conclusions and implications for future study are discussed.",

The Standards spelled out the services considered essential for ensuring equal access to education for students with disabilities. In addition, the Standards were intended to establish the parameters of what practitioners do as well as assert the credibility and uniqueness of the Office For Students With Disabilities (Jarrow, 1997). The Standard's utility diminished due to a number of factors, but especially the changing nature of disability services. Thus, a survey consisting of 30 service components and 147 performance indicators was completed by a group of postsecondary disability services experts to get a current look at today's services.

Quantitative and qualitative methodologies were used to obtain students' perspectives of the accommodation process and experienced or potential barriers to their participation in postsecondary education. Students with disabilities completed surveys (n=108) and participated in focus groups (n=104). These students, who had various disability conditions, attended 15 community and technical colleges in California, Minnesota and Kansas. Participants' responses reflected satisfaction with certain practices and procedures as well as a need for improvements in others. More individualized methods of accommodation selection that consider the context of students' lives, individual functional needs, trade-offs between immediate and long-term costs and benefits and incorporate systemwide universal design concepts are presented as an alternative framework for consideration by Disability Support Services staff.

The article explains the roots of UDL in cognitive neuroscience, and the three principles of UDL: multiple means of representing information, multiple means of expressing knowledge, and multiple means of engagement in learning. The authors also examine the ways UDL has influenced their course goals and objectives, media and materials, teaching methods, and assessment techniques, including discussion groups, lectures, textbooks, and the course website. The authors emphasize the ongoing developmental nature of the course and UDL principles as tools or guidelines for postsecondary faculty, rather than a set of definitive rules. UDL is proposed as a way to address diversity and disabilities as constructs of individuals and their environment in higher education classrooms. (Contains 2 endnotes and 3 figures.)",

        "description":"Both learner-centered education (LCE) and universal design (UD) require an instructor to be constantly reflective and flexible. But although both focus on the needs of different types of learners, until now LCE has not explicitly included students with disabilities within the array of learners it seeks to serve. And the UD movement, while it begins with consideration of disability, does not yet provide specific processes for integrating UD principles into the design of instruction. This paper introduces one such process, dynamic course design, which can be used by disability service providers in working with instructors to develop more universally designed classes. The process is designed to help instructors systematically identify and examine their expectations for student learning in a course and to prompt them to design their course so as to make the learning in it accessible to a wide variety of students.

        "description":"Since at least  the 1980s, motivated, in part, by findings from international comparisons of students' mathematics achievement, some American  (U.S.) educators and policy makers have initiated educational reform that focuses on improving teaching practices and curriculum designs by advocating for the adoption of Asian educational models. The implicit assumption behind such reform seems to overlook the possible roles of outside of school factors in superior academic performance in the Asian countries. The purpose of this study was to investigate how outside of school factors were related to students' TIMSS mathematics achievement for the U.S and five top-performing Asian nations or regions, and to examine whether the relative role of school-associated and outside of school factors was consistent across these five Asian countries. The results indicated that students' achievement was highly related to outside of school factors across all six countries. For Singapore and Hong Kong, school-associated factors had somewhat more salient roles than the outside of school factors. However, for Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, school-associated factors played lessor roles in students' achievement performance. As for the U.S., school-associated factors were related to students' performance, however outside of school factors clearly played more salient roles than the school-associated  factors. The findings suggest that students' mathematics achievement covaries substantially with outside of school factors. Hence, students' superior mathematics achievement does not necessarily reflect only a superior public school system but also outside of school factors. (Contains 10 tables and 2 figures.)",

This effectiveness was identified as both student retention and graduate completion. The  following characteristics were not positively related to graduate completion and student retention: teacher choice, student choice, autonomous schools, and learning community characteristics of discovery learning and simulation. Teacher and administrator lengths of service were also not positively related to graduate completion. As hypothesized, smaller schools did have a  negative relationship when compared to student retention. Overall the findings in this study of Iowa's rural alternative high schools did not support the research hypotheses. All schools, however, regardless of specific characteristics, can be effective when given the right combination of learning attributes.

This study examined the work of awardees in one federally-funded program that included a focus on increasing the number, quality, and  diversity of mathematics and science teachers. Secondary data sources were used to understand representations of mathematics and science teacher quality, quantity, and diversity reported by awardees, and to identify interventions awardees implemented to influence teacher quality, quantity, and diversity. Results indicated a primary focus on the development of teacher characteristics such as subject knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and instructional practices. Seven common interventions were implemented across the program to influence the quality of individual teachers and the quantity and diversity of the teacher population. Three prevalent themes in the secondary documents included: a)   awardees' knowledge of and implementation of research-based professional development practices; b) a shift in emphasis to include specialized subject knowledge preparation for elementary teachers, in addition to the traditional emphasis on subject knowledge for middle and high school teachers; and c) involvement of STEM faculty and Teacher Leaders in various collaborative relationships, in activities at all levels (K-12) and in both mathematics and science. Intervention efforts to influence teacher quantity and diversity were in their initial stages and limited in scope. These findings are discussed with reference to the impact of the program on the quality, quantity, and diversity of mathematics and science teachers. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

These two concepts open the door to examine more general issues in the appointment of school directors and the structure of the school day. Director appointment and school time are rooted in local culture but can have implications across national borders. This study reports interviews of six first-year school directors in the state of Sonora, Mexico and six principals in Texas, USA. It is part of a larger international study that includes Australia, Canada, England, Jamaica, Scotland, South Africa, and Turkey. The purpose is to look at the appointment, preparation, and challenges of first-year school directors. School directors in both countries wrestled with parent expectations and relations with teachers. The systems for appointing school directors and the structure of the school day were different. These differences were based in cultural orientations and suggested contradictions and shortcomings in each educational system. These issues are important to consider in planning programs of educational administration preparation.",

Findings showed a general theme of parents believing that the traditional area public school did not meet their child's needs in terms of size, academics, and addressing the student's unique educational needs. When commenting on the positive aspects of charter schools, parents indicated the charter school's willingness to address the disability and strong communication with families. Reported negative aspects of charter schools included high staff turnover and academic changes in short periods of time. When  comparing the special education services provided by the charter school and the child's previous public school, the participants noted differences in staff flexibility, teacher accessibility and attentiveness, and school size favoring the charter school program.

Much less has been done to find out about students' beliefs and attitudes about teachers' feedback on errors. This study aimed to investigate L2 students' perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes about error correction in the writing classroom. Data were obtained from a questionnaire and from follow-up interviews. The findings showed that most students wished their teachers to mark and correct errors for them and believed that error correction was primarily the teacher's responsibility.

Drawing from a year-long study of beginning teaching, the author explores the complex relationship among the physical body, language pedagogy, and socially constructed understandings of beauty, then goes on to problematize the pedagogical location of the body and ask how the gendered body can be mediated in classroom contexts. The article contrasts the two teachers' pedagogical approaches to the intricate work of locating the body in the ESOL classroom and discusses the range of possibilities available for the exploration, negotiation, and expression of gender identities in relation to the physical body.",

Structured interviews were used to explore resilience issues with immigrant students enrolled in university. Two interviewers collected and recorded data together, but conducted separate and independent analyses to explore differences in results due to their own cultural backgrounds. Findings suggest that the traditional concept of resilience--one based on studies of students from lower socioeconomic classes in school in inner-city neighborhoods that identify social competence, problem-solving ability, autonomy, and satisfaction with school as significant resilience factors--is limited. The findings in this study suggest that immigrant students represent a different pattern of resilience related to a strong cultural belief in the value of education and the support, often financial, provided by their families. Interesting differences in interpretation related to the first culture of the researches suggest that &quot;mirrored reflections&quot; offers one way to capture differences in data interpretation resulting from researchers' backgrounds.",

Although intake and outcome measures appear similar on the surface for all 47 students, variability in the subscores of the outcomes measure provided the catalyst for taking a closer look at progress during the ESL program. The outcomes provide a refined understanding of the development of cognitive academic language proficiency, and in particular the role of underlying proficiency and structured ESL support. The data suggest that the youngest arrivals (i.e., those aged 6-11) remain at risk in their postsecondary education. The outcomes also suggest that the acquisition of cultural capital and metaphoric competence remains a challenge for all learners.",

A university-level ESL instructor and two of her students participated in this case study. Data were collected by think-aloud protocols and semistructured interviews, and results revealed four major categories: (a) types of feedback the instructor emphasized, (b) the instructor's beliefs about teaching writing, (c) students' beliefs about learning to write, and (d) students' views on the effectiveness of teachers' feedback strategies. Because some of the instructor's beliefs seemed to conflict with her students' views, it was concluded that teachers should make an effort to explore their students' beliefs about writing, feedback, and error correction and to try to bridge any gap between their own and their students' expectations.",

Respondents provided us with information on the nature of their programs, the role of LINC, the types of materials they used, general course content, challenges faced, and their evaluation of the success of LINC in view of the government mandate to provide instruction that will lead to social integration. Most LINC providers felt that their programs were well tailored to the needs of their students, but in general they did not see LINC as a substitute for citizenship preparation courses.

        "author":["Tighe, Wendy L."],
        "description":"The Virginia Community College System (VCCS) is increasingly offering more Web-based, online orientation courses to students. Since the fall semester of 1999, the community college campuses throughout the VCCS have offered over 100 sections of online orientation courses. However, no assessment data or research for these courses or students exists. Given the increase in VCCS colleges offering college orientation courses online, the author recommends further research to determine the efficacy of the Web-based version of college orientation. To determine how the VCCS addresses online orientation courses and whether or not any assessment data existed, the author conducted a study of the VCCS online orientation course at 13 community colleges (Blue Ridge, Central Virginia, Germanna, J. Sargeant Reynolds, John Tyler, Lord Fairfax, Northern Virginia, Patrick Henry, Piedmont, Rappahannock, Southside Virginia, Tidewater, and Virginia Western) in the VCCS. Of the 13 colleges being contacted, 6 responded by e-mail and indicated that no research or assessment data for these courses or students has ever been collected. The author also conducted an open-ended survey and syllabi analysis of the 13 colleges to determine delivery methods of course objectives. By combining the information obtained from the instructors' survey responses and the course syllabi, the author was able to identify some general themes and issues of concern for the VCCS. Here, the author discusses these themes and issues of concern for the VCCS. The author also discusses the need to explore and investigate variables, such as student course completion rates, satisfaction, academic success, persistence, and graduation rates, for students who take online orientation.",

Mathematical derivation is replaced by verbal explanation, pictorial representation, observations of phenomena, and logical reasoning. Algebraic equations are used as guides to thinking rather than recipes for computation. Introductory physics at the CP level is accessible to a much wider population of students than the more math-based introductory courses. In this article, the author provides a brief history of the conceptual approach and argues for increased and widespread teaching of conceptual physics courses in the Virginia Community College System (VCCS), both to benefit a broad range of students and to support science programs at the colleges.",

        "description":"American educators have a mindset about learners and the learning process. Although all educators do not have the same mindset, many see teaching in terms of controlling: what students learn, how they learn, and how the learning is measured. This mindset focusing on teaching--rather than on learners and the learning process--seems to be fairly common among American educators of today. Here, at the start of the 21st-century, educators are being urged to rethink how they look at learning and teaching. Educators are being asked to shift their thinking and philosophical mindset to learning-centered learning (Reynolds, 2005), to emphasize the learner and the learning process. This rethinking has had a long history in the ebb and flow of educational philosophy in the United States, but it was during the mid-1990s that an interest in learner-centered and learning-centered strategies was rekindled by an article in Change by Barr and Tagg (1995). In this article, the author presents philosophical learning assumptions that support the construct of learning-centered learning. This 21st-century construct supports learning environments that create intrinsic motivation, accommodate individual learning-style characteristics, give increased control to individual learners, and see all learning as multidimensional.",

What, then, can be done to ensure that low-income students have access to and success in community colleges? Research, both theoretical and empirical, shows that there is no one student characteristic that will predict student success--not academic preparation or lack of it, not finances, not socioeconomic status; rather, a holistic accounting of student adjustment to both the academic and social environment of the institution is needed. In this article, the author proposes a model student services organization that integrates concern for the academic with the adjustment and development issues to help ensure student success. The author examines the impact of integrating the academic and counseling services on the success of low-income students and delineates a model organization for the delivery of such services. A plan for low-income student success in the context of factors, such as affordability, counseling, academic preparation, and college organizational variables, is presented.",

        "description":"In this article, we argue that the debates about mathematics education that have arisen in the United States over the past decade are the result of a major shift in how we conceptualize mathematical knowledge and mathematics learning. First, we examine past efforts to change mathematics education and argue they are grounded in a common traditional paradigm. Next, we describe the emergence of a new paradigm that has grown out of a coalescence of theories from cognitive psychology, an awareness of the importance of culture to learning, and the belief that all students can and should learn meaningful mathematics. Reforms grounded in the new paradigm have the potential to dramatically alter the way in which students--as well as which students--experience success in school mathematics. We discuss some implications of these reforms related to how mathematics educators might work with teachers of mathematics.",

One of the main purposes of this study is to investigate how duration in a teacher education program influenced the performance and mathematical self-efficacy beliefs of pre-service teachers. In addition, gender differences between male and female pre-service mathematics teachers, depending upon year in program, are examined. Results revealed that there were significant statistical effects of gender and year in program on both pre-service teachers' performance and self-efficacy scores. Female pre-service teachers scored significantly higher than males on performance, but no significant difference was detected between female and male pre-service teachers with respect to mathematics self-efficacy scores. Senior pre-service teachers had the highest scores compared to other students in the program on bother performance and mathematics self-efficacy scores. Although the present study is small, the results tentatively suggest a further investigation of the relationship between performance and self-efficacy beliefs might be fruitful. Studying how mathematical self-efficacy develops across school years and what factors facilitate its development could yield valuable implications for the field of mathematic education.

Of these, 163 had not experienced \"Standards\"-based curricula, while the rest had used a \"Standards\"-based curriculum for over three years. Our results indicate that students at the \"Standards\"-based site expressed more sophisticated epistemological conceptions of mathematics than those of the students from the non-\"Standards\"-based site.

It looks at how this library's role and collections adapted to shifting notions of what constituted good teacher education and changing economic circumstances. In recounting this history, the paper examines the historical circumstances that created a separate education library at the University of Calgary and how issues of group and professional identity contributed to its continuing existence. The various themes which emerge may be common to many North American education libraries.",

At the time of the writing of the 1975/1976 article, the collection was known as The ETS Test Collection. However, since the collection is made up of tests of many test publishers and individual authors, the collection's title became confusing to people searching the website. Many thought it was a source for ETS tests only, or that inclusion of any test in the collection was given a \"stamp of approval\" by ETS. A slight rearrangement of the title aims to help eliminate some of that confusion. The moniker is now Test Collection at ETS.",

Twelve females participated, all of whom were enrolled in a grade 12 course in Communications' Technology. Data collection included a questionnaire, a semi-structured interview and focus groups. Participants described learning computer technology in the single-gender setting as more conducive to learning. In comparison, participants indicated that they felt they did not learn much about computer technology in the mixed-gender setting where they had negative perceptions of technology learning and use and felt  conditions were not conducive to learning. Implications arising from this study include the need for educators, administrators and policymakers to be aware of classroom conditions that students feel are conducive to learning as well as conditions viewed as non-conducive to learning.",

They explore a number of key questions: (1) Are learning style instruments valid and reliable?; (2) Do students benefit when the type of instruction matches their preferred learning style?; and (3) More specifically, is there evidence that understanding one's learning style improves concentration, memory, self-confidence, and reduces anxiety, and leads to better grades? They conclude that learning style instruments have not been shown to be valid and reliable, there is no benefit to matching instruction to preferred learning style, and there is no evidence that understanding one's learning style improves learning and its related outcomes.

        "description":"Computer-based technologies are now commonplace in classrooms, and the integration of these media into the teaching and learning of mathematics is supported by government policy in most developed countries. However, many questions about the impact of computer-based technologies on classroom mathematics learning remain unanswered, and debates about when and how they ought to be used continue. An increasing number of studies seek to identify the effects of technology usage on classroom learning, and at a time when governments are calling for &quot;evidence-based&quot; policy development, many studies applying quasi-scientific methodologies to this field of practice are emerging. By analysing a series of conceptual frameworks for assessing the use of computer-based technologies to support school learning, this article emphasises the value of research into the relationship between technical and conceptual aspects of technology use in mathematics education and beyond, and challenges the usefulness of large-scale, quasi-scientific studies that focus on educational inputs and outputs.

        "description":"This study examined the development of a mathematics teacher's proficiency in managing whole-class discussion in the context of an inquiry-based classroom. We analysed three lessons taught with the same class by a teacher-researcher. The first and second lessons were 10 months apart, the second and third lessons were 6 months apart. For each of the three lessons the analysis was carried out at two levels: macro-level analysis was applied to the general organisation of the inquiry-based lesson and micro-level analysis was applied to both the teacher's structure of the discussion and to the quality of the discussion. Based on the two-level analysis we formulate criteria to define teacher proficiency and demonstrate the enhancement of proficiency through teaching. (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "description":"This paper reports the results of two interventions involving the integrated study of mathematics and technology practice to girls in Years 6 and 7. The focus of the study was to look at factors that contributed to girls' disengagement with mathematics study and seek pedagogical solutions for this. The key mathematics concepts embedded in the two interventions were proportional reasoning and ratio. A design based research methodology was adopted. The study started with the assumption that by integrating mathematics study with technology practice students would see the mathematics as authentic and understandable. The results of the first intervention indicated that a significant proportion of the girls did not develop the hoped for improvement in perceptions about the value of studying mathematics through technology practice, despite an improvement in their understanding of proportion and ratio. These results informed the second intervention in which modified tasks and pedagogy were implemented. The results of the second intervention were similar in terms of cognitive outcomes. However, when students were given explicit scaffolding in &quot;within&quot; and &quot;beyond&quot; the domain of mathematics integration as well as tasks that they considered authentic, student perceptions of mathematics study improved.

Notions of conjecture, along with the particular faculty of the spreadsheet setting, are considered with regard to the facilitation of mathematical thinking. Employing an interpretive perspective, a key focus is on how alternative pedagogical media and associated discursive networks influence the way that students form and test informal conjectures.",

Novice writers, on the other hand, regardless of age or knowledge base, have a much more local writing process in which they focus primarily on their next thought. Their writing protocols suggest that they tend to take cues from the last sentence written to produce the next one. Moreover, they spend minimal effort on setting the overriding goals that characterize better writers. This article will detail these contrasting processes of expert and novice writers.

These competitions can facilitate a learning environment that presents gifted students the academic challenge that often is difficult to create in a single classroom or school. They can offer the types of experiences that foster the development of productive attitudes and work habits. They also can nurture emotional and psychological growth. Some of these benefits can be defined within the framework of differentiation. However, academic competitions also hold potential for a number of affective benefits that cannot be subsumed under differentiation. In this article, drawing upon their experience and related research, the authors elaborate on these affective outcomes: (1) motivation; (2) a healthy self-concept; (3) coping with subjectivity; (4) dealing with a competitive world; and (5) interacting with supportive role models.",

Although few are able to argue with this goal, twice-exceptional students, including some of the most gifted students, are often on the brink of excellence due to the unique blend of assets and deficits they exhibit. Teachers are challenged each day to find ways to empower those bright students who may be unable to write a complete sentence, even though they are able to participate actively in a class discussion. In this article, the authors present Bordering on Excellence, a framework and graphic organizational planning tool designed for teachers to use with any instructional material. Through the authors' work over many years with twice-exceptional students, they found that the complexity of these needs, along with the demands of a rigorous curriculum, often seemed insurmountable when working to provide these special students with the appropriate instruction. Bordering on Excellence was born out of this need. (Contains 1 figure, 10 resources and 8 online resources.)",

Most studies in the FCT literature consist of demonstrations of the maintenance of responding when various treatment components (e.g., extinction, punishment) are present and absent (e.g., Fisher et al., 1993; Wacker et al., 1990). Relatively little research on FCT has (a) evaluated the conditions under which alternative responses are acquired or (b) described procedures with technological precision. Thus, additional research on a cogent technology for response acquisition appears to be warranted. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of exposing problem behavior to extinction for inducing response variability as a tool for selecting an alternative response during FCT. Once participants engaged in appropriate alternative responses, the reinforcer identified in the functional analysis as maintaining problem behavior was delivered contingent on the alternative behavior. Results showed that exposing problem behavior to extinction was a useful method for producing alternative behaviors during FCT. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Five typically developing preschool children initially learned to name a number of previously unfamiliar visual stimuli. Each child then received one of two types of training. Intraverbal training involved reinforcing vocally emitted category names by the child in the presence of a spoken exemplar name. Listener training involved reinforcing the selection of visual stimuli by the child in the presence of a spoken category name. A multiple baseline design was used to evaluate the effects of training on each child's intraverbal category naming and stimulus selection. Pre- and posttests were used to assess additional emergent relations. Four of 5 participants did not demonstrate the emergence of any untrained relations. The current findings suggest that additional research is needed to determine the optimal sequencing of conditions in programs designed to teach categorization skills.

Consensus has not been reached, however, regarding the types of data or analytic strategies that are most useful for describing behavior-consequence relations. One promising approach involves the analysis of conditional probabilities from sequential recordings of behavior and events that follow its occurrence. In this paper we review several strategies for identifying contingent relations from conditional probabilities, and propose an alternative strategy known as a contingency space analysis (CSA). Step-by-step procedures for conducting and interpreting a CSA using sample data are presented, followed by discussion of the potential use of a CSA for conducting descriptive assessments, informing intervention design, and evaluating changes in reinforcement contingencies following treatment.

Several comparative probability analyses were conducted in addition to lag-sequential analyses using the descriptive data. Results of the descriptive analyses showed that the probability of the potential precursor was greater given problem behavior compared to the unconditional probability of the potential precursor. Results of the lag-sequential analyses showed a marked increase in the probability of a potential precursor in the 1-s intervals immediately preceding an instance of problem behavior, and that the probability of problem behavior was highest in the 1-s intervals immediately following an instance of the precursor. We then conducted separate functional analyses of problem behavior and the precursor to identify respective operant functions. Results of the functional analyses showed that both problem behavior and the precursor served the same operant functions. These results replicate prior experimental analyses on the relation between problem behavior and precursors and extend prior research by illustrating a quantitative method to identify precursors to more severe problem behavior.

During the single arrangement, preference hierarchies were established by having a child repeatedly select from among several foods and by sequentially restricting preferred items from the array. After being taught the associations between colored cards and the same food items, group assessments were conducted with 3 children simultaneously, in which each child chose a card and all children received the food correlated with a randomly selected card from those that had just been selected. The group assessment appeared to be accurate and perhaps more efficient for determining preferences; thus, we posit that this arrangement is suitable for determining context preferences of multiple children simultaneously.

Expert judges (N = 2) rated these students' drawing abilities based on their performance on 2 drawing tasks adapted from Clark's Drawing Abilities Test (Clark, 1989). The IFT-28 scores correlated substantially and significantly with expert ratings of drawing abilities, and with mental rotation test scores. IFT-28 also was found to be sensitive to age effect. The conjecture that IFT-28 scores could reflect drawing abilities and possibly indicate visual arts talents was generally supported even when the effects of age and general spatial ability were controlled for in partial correlation analyses. A brief version (IFT-9) based on retaining 9 figures that discriminated students with high drawing abilities from those with low drawing abilities was suggested as a possibly more sensitive measure for screening students with talents in visual arts.

        "author":["Dedmond, Rebecca M."],
        "description":"In the 2007 edition of \"Diplomas Count\", \"Education Week\" reported that nationally more than one-third of the students lost from the high school pipeline fail to make the transition from the ninth to the 10th grade. This explains why, for more than two decades, schools and districts across the country have struggled to develop freshman transition activities and courses to address this critical transitional time for students. Unfortunately, many of these efforts have failed to impact school retention because there has been no plan, no roadmap, no guidelines or standards to point the way to success. Teachers are left to their own devices to develop from scratch what should be a rigorous, comprehensive course. In far too many cases, due to lack of resources (i.e., time, money and energy), the outcome does not meet expectations and, eventually, the program is abandoned. It was this realization and the resulting \"Course Standards for Freshman Transition Classes\" that launched the Freshman Transition Initiative of George Washington University in 2004. In developing the necessary standards, the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for Career Connections and Career Investigation became the starting point to design the framework for this eighth- or ninth-grade course because they were among the best career exploration standards. It was also clear that in order to achieve the ambitious goal of impacting school retention, the new standards had to go beyond traditional career exploration. Working on the premise that individuals don't work hard until they understand the benefits of their efforts, the \"Course Standards for Freshman Transition Classes\" serve as the blueprint for well-designed freshman courses that not only carry the same rigor, credibility and status of traditional academic courses, but that also increase school retention, academic achievement, and postsecondary matriculation.",

The sixth recommendation in ACTE's postsecondary reform position statement is to increase financial support for low-income students. Cost barriers and the absence of strategies to increase financial aid often result in fewer opportunities for all students to access postsecondary education. Career and technical education (CTE) programs are particularly affected since data show that a high number of students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds enroll in postsecondary CTE. As the price of postsecondary education has increased, the purchasing power of federal and state need-based financial aid has decreased. Need-based grants at the state and federal level (such as federal Pell grants), and at individual institutions, must be increased to help low-income students enjoy the opportunities that education can provide. Financial aid policies should be expanded and revised to provide more support for part-time and working students--including those participating in short-term basic skills and workforce development programs that do not grant credit--in order to help move these students through the education continuum.",

        "author":["Gaff, Jerry G."],
        "description":"The governance of most colleges and universities is shared among the board of trustees, the administration, and the faculty. Most four-year institutions endorse the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) Statement on Government of Colleges and Universities (1966), which asserts that the faculty has \"primary\" authority over the academic area, including such matters as the curriculum, standards of faculty competence, and standards of student achievement. In this area, the governing board and administration should \"concur with the faculty judgment except in rare instances and for compelling reasons which should be stated in detail.\" The board and administration, the statement says, should have primary authority over mission, strategic direction, physical plant, and fiscal resources. In these areas, the faculty has \"secondary\" authority and should be consulted and informed about major decisions. Oddly, the AAUP statement is largely silent about faculty responsibility for \"programs of study\" and the \"learning of students\". Faculty members are hired to implement programs of study, not just to conduct their own research or to teach their own courses, and such programs are intended to lead to student learning. Both of these factors change the dynamics of shared governance in ways that were not envisioned during the early and mid-twentieth century, when basic governance agreements were devised. With regard to the area over which faculty have primary authority, the educational program, there are two problems that need urgently to be addressed. The first concerns the apparent disconnect between authority and accountability. The second problem concerns the tendency of faculty and administrators to invent faculty governance over a wide array of programs on an \"ad hoc\" basis. In order to advance thinking about how the faculty can provide more effective oversight for the educational program and improve student learning, the author offers five recommendations for strengthening faculty governance, which institutions can modify in light of their particular missions and circumstances.",

        "description":"The organization of institutions of higher education has been seen as operating with ambiguous purposes in vertically oriented structures that are only loosely connected. The rationale for this ambiguity is twofold: (1) to allow for creative thinking, and (2) to respect--and even encourage--the autonomy of different disciplines. But ambiguity of purpose and vertical organization are at odds with thinking and expectations in an era of accountability and assessment, in which cross-institutional, or horizontal, reporting and measurement of institutional performance are highly regarded and increasingly demanded. Student affairs divisions are particularly challenged, given their ambiguous purpose (to support holistic student learning and development); the perception that they are support services, rather than core academic functions; and their primarily historically and traditionally framed organizational structures (Fenske 1990). Student affairs divisions are appropriately scrutinized to display how their ambiguous purpose is manifested in practice via organizational effectiveness and responsiveness to institutional needs, and through documented contributions to the development and achievement of desired student outcomes. A curricular approach to learning, student development, assessment, and retention depends on creating horizontal structures, forces, and dynamics that intersect with vertical systems and structures. In this article, the authors point out that institutional effectiveness requires the tighter coupling of horizontal and vertical activities in ways that promote student learning and sustain an engaged student experience.

They are the stewards of campus leadership and decision making. While the faculty role has changed over time, leadership has remained critical to innovation in teaching, advances in knowledge, and alteration to many campus policies and practices. As several recent publications attest, this leadership role is threatened by a number of current trends. Most notably, the rise in part-time and non-tenure-track appointments, increasing standards for tenure and promotion, the rise of academic capitalism, and heavy service roles for women and people of color. These new factors further hinder faculty leadership by adding to the challenges posed by the faculty socialization process and the tenure system. The sharp rise in the number of part-time and non-tenure-track appointments also negatively affects faculty leadership. Faculty in these non-traditional appointments often have other full-time jobs, may work at several different universities, are generally not compensated for service or governance--and, indeed, are often actively excluded from these processes. For these reasons, it is difficult for these faculty members to become invested and involved in campus-specific issues and organizational leadership. This article discusses certain campus practices and policies that can reverse or slow the trends impeding faculty leadership.",

        "description":"In today's competitive college market, \"interdisciplinary studies\" are a major selling point for colleges and universities. Yet, on closer examination, it is apparent that the academic structure and place of the majority of interdisciplinary programs, departments, and centers are not substantially different from the academic disciplines, departments, and divisions they were originally designed to challenge. The shift to university-as-service-industry has led to a need for increased specialization to provide specific marketable skills or sites of interests that can attract the student/customer. This most cynical reading sees institutional support for interdisciplinary studies as an attempt to create and foster niche markets. Furthermore, in striking this deal, interdisciplinary studies became complicit, if not responsible, for the fragmentation of the university into a series of localized specializations isolated from, and in competition with, one another to attract niche customers/students. Thus the interdisciplinary departments, programs, and centers found willing partners but at a price: their interdisciplinarity. Far from marking the dawn of an interdisciplinary era, this pact with the devil has marked the end of real interdisciplinarity. Is the very success of interdisciplinary studies leading to its demise? And are they displacing and discrediting the traditional disciplines along the way? Not yet, but these are real and pressing possibilities. In this article, the author proposes to take the threat seriously and use these questions as a springboard to think through the past, present, and future of interdisciplinary studies in an attempt to find productive and substantive ways for it to work and flourish within the current university system. The author suggests that everyone should work to usher in an era when interdisciplinary departments, programs, and centers do not supplant or replace the traditional disciplines but serve instead to create pathways and intersections, bringing faculty and students together for the common endeavor of intellectual exchange.",

        "description":"In this article, the author discusses how it is time for higher education to think seriously about alternatives to the traditional undergraduate \"major,\" which, in the large majority of cases, tends to be focused on just a single field of inquiry. The author observes that the current idea of a major (or minor) subject may have made more sense in a less complex and interconnected world in which the perspective and method of one discipline could be applied to a fairly confined and narrow problem. However, in today's world, few problems of any significance are either confined or narrow. In order to prepare students to have the skills in facing the outside world after they graduate, the author suggests adoption of problem-based learning. The author also presents six principles for the construction of a problem-based major or minor curriculum.",

At school level, however, helping students to link, differentiate or investigate the nature of relationships between mathematics concepts remains in the shadow of skills development and the practice of routine problems. It is vital that teachers are able to design curricula that nurture students' understanding of the similarities and differences between mathematics concepts, and to present the subject knowledge in a range of simple ways. The use of visual representations, such as diagrams, tables or graphs, for showing relationships between mathematics concepts, is a common practice in classrooms. The aim of this paper is to introduce a specific visual representation in a tabular form, termed as a concept field, and to illustrate the use of this as a supporting tool for program development, topic planning and assessment design within the mathematics learning area during the years of schooling. In this paper, a type of visually represented structure that blends both the vertical hierarchy of a particular concept development to the skills and understandings associated with key knowledge and applications is used.

        "author":["Darby, Linda"],
        "description":"Inquiries into the state of mathematics and science education in Australia express the need to make the curriculum more relevant and meaningful to students' lives. However, such a vision requires that teachers understand how relevance can enter mathematics and science classrooms in meaningful and appropriate ways. This paper uses snippets from classroom practice to explore how six mathematics and/or science teachers attempted to make the subject matter meaningful for their students by presenting a humanised and relevant  subject. The paper asks the questions: (1) how is relevance thought of in mathematics as compared with science?; and (2) what problems might this pose for teachers moving between mathematics and science? The attempts of the teachers are referred to as &quot;stories&quot; or &quot;narratives&quot; because it was through discussions about stories that many of these ideas  emerged from the teachers. Various qualitative methods were used over eighteen months to periodically observe, video-record and interview six secondary science and/or mathematics teachers. Results indicate that all teachers believed it was important to relate the content matter to students' lives. However, they seemed to approach this issue of relevance differently, both in practice and in their stated beliefs about what it means to teach effectively. Four types of pedagogical approaches were found to be representative of how the teachers recognised what needed to be made meaningful and relevant and how this could be portrayed for students. These were labelled as categories of meaning making. Mathematics and science are presented differently in each category, and the stories serve to focus on different aspects of both the subject matter and the place that this has in students' lives.",

        "description":"Understanding the concept of the sampling distribution of a statistic is essential for the understanding of inferential procedures. Unfortunately, this topic proves to be a stumbling block for students in introductory statistics classes. In efforts to aid students in their understanding of this concept, alternatives to a lecture-based mode of instruction have been introduced in the literature with some of these approaches using in-class activities, simulations using statistical software, and web-based applets. In this article, the use of statistical software, for the purpose of illustrating sampling distributions, is revisited through the use of Minitab macros, an approach that has not been observed in the literature. The result is a user-friendly way for students in introductory statistics classes to explore the concept of the sampling distribution of a statistic. Although the focus of this article will be on the sampling distribution, the methods described here are applicable to instruction of other statistical concepts. including confidence intervals and power.

Without adequate introduction, many find that tangrams are just an open-ended form of a jigsaw puzzle. Happily teachers have discovered that games provide an effective introduction to a new topic. In the case of tangrams, students are likely to learn more from their construction than from playing with the finished product. This article describes how students can construct tangrams within a constraint-based geometric (CBG) environment, thereby learning much more than might be gained using scissors and cardboard, while at the same time learning to use the CBG system. The examples used here were constructed using a ClassPad 300 but might just as easily be developed using the Windows-based software package \"Geometry Expressions.\"",

        "description":"The mathematics methodology subjects the author undertook in the early 1980s encouraged him to adopt a very expository style of teaching in which each new concept is introduced by its formal definition. The teacher should then explain a few carefully chosen examples for students to copy into their books, and then provide plenty of graded practice exercises from the textbook for students to complete. It is what Mitchelmore (2000) calls the ABC approach: where abstract definitions are taught before any concrete examples are considered. So, for many years, his teaching of trigonometry in Year 9 began with exercises in identifying opposite and adjacent sides in right-angled triangles, definitions of the trigonometric ratios and the mnemonic SOHCAHTOA, then lots of work on calculating unknown sides and angles, all devoid of any realistic context. Finally, right at the end of the topic, he gave the class some word problems involving applications like angles of elevation and compass bearings. It was only when he undertook further study some years later and was exposed to alternative ways of thinking about the nature of mathematics and its pedagogy that he began to reassess his classroom practice. In this article, the author outlines briefly some of the elements of his new approach and how he developed them. (Contains 3 figures.)",

An outline of legislative change and measures that have been put in place to reform the Irish system in accordance with European developments on learner mobility is provided. The basic architecture of the Irish national framework of qualifications is set out with reference to the proposed EQF. A review of progress in implementation is presented with particular focus on developing quality assurance systems. The paper concludes by exploring the challenges in implementing new qualifications structures. More specifically, it is analysing policy on the one hand and praxis on the other in making lifelong learning a reality for all. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"In the debate on the draft European Qualifications Framework and the possible development of a German Qualifications Framework (GQF) great interest is being shown in Germany in a qualifications framework that promises transparency and permeability and is based on competences. There has also been opposition on the basis of the fundamental principles of the German system, which has had an impact on some public statements about the EQF. The aim is to create a GQF that can be linked to the EQF, and which covers all areas of education and is geared to practical vocational capacities. The design and implementation of such a tool raises several questions. Are the vocational principle and the acquisition of practical capacities compatible with a qualifications framework based on learning outcomes? What rules should be applied to standard-based certification of learning outcomes obtained non-formally and informally? How can credits function as a precondition for procedures for the transfer, recognition and accumulation of competences acquired? Finally, what consequences ensue for quality assurance in education and training provision? (Contains 4 footnotes.)",

Criticism of the table tends to misinterpret it, by looking at the EQF from only one perspective or, at most, two. In this article, we set out to show that the EQF can be understood only if it is considered from at least three perspectives, namely a hierarchy of education systems, a hierarchy of occupational tasks and functions, and a hierarchy of skills acquisition. In addition to this synchronic view of the descriptors, their development will be analysed in detail, and the reasons for changes in them will be explained. Both the synchronic and diachronic perspectives show that it does not seem to be possible to establish a theoretical basis for the EQF, nor do we claim to achieve this. What we offer is, rather, a hermeneutic approach in order better to understand the meaning of the EQF table. (Contains 1 table, 1 figure and 15 footnotes.)",

Youths were randomized to either treatment condition, and assessed before and after treatment. The principal outcome measure was the severity of PTSD symptoms measured using the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index, administered as an interview. There was a significant treatment-by-condition interaction indicating that adolescents in the TF-ART condition had greater reduction in PTSD symptom severity than youths in the TAU condition. TF-ART was not found to be associated with more behavioral problems during the treatment period. Results indicate that TF-ART may be a promising adjunctive treatment for inpatient adolescents with PTSD symptoms. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)",

Through a case study illustration, the art therapist's response art was effective in two main areas. First, in-session response art helped facilitate treatment goals in accordance with van der Kolk's (2005) conceptualization of Developmental Trauma Disorder. Second, systematic exploration of countertransference issues through post-session art led to inner change in the therapist that coincided with change occurring in the client's behavior and approach to art making. Consequently, the client transferred defensive, acting-out behaviors from the context of the relationship into the art products themselves, thereby mastering artistic processes while moving towards expression of previously masked emotions connected with her trauma.

The community studio, as perceived by the founders, is a place where anything can be expressed as a moment on life's continuum. Believing that meaning in art is renewed in the process of art itself, the project is not conceived at art therapy: there are no efforts to fix, cure, change, or interpret but merely to witness the flow of expression in the images that arrive and to learn from them. The writer both compares and contrasts U.S. and European studios. In both cases, the community studio deals with many who are at least a step or two away from the mainstream and keeps alive some important minority values as a balance to the main cultural thrust. The goal of the European community studio may be to create a dignified place in the culture for an artist who, due to disability or limitation, would otherwise remain unvalued. In the United States, the community studio may invite a wider range of individuals who are estranged from mainstream culture to have a place to create meaning in their own lives or envision images of social change and well being. The author concludes by advocating that art holds and expresses the meaning of the human condition, that it should be embraced and supported by providing a wide variety of places where the basic right of artistic self-expression is cherished and enjoyed.",

The disability studio, advocates the writer, is generally a grassroots, ad-hoc creation, staffed by self-taught practitioners who operate seemingly unaware that the operation of studio programs for artists with disabilities is a worldwide movement. Project Onward, with which the author is associated, is cited as a representative example of a studio that arose out of a specific need, which was to help a small group of talented artists with disabilities overcome obstacles to art making, with no additional agenda or modeling on an existing program. Project Onward is designed to support artists with developmental and mental disabilities by providing workspace, art materials, and professional guidance in a communal studio. Placing his own and other programs in the context of Vick's analysis, the author advocates for development of an expanded field for art therapy, wherein interested practitioners gain additional training in studio, connoisseurship, and curatorial practice, and where professional practices reflect ethical conduct with commercial gallerists and dealers.",

This study collected and reviewed data on  how people with ASD approach the drawing task and represent faces in particular. Drawings that were created by 25 children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and 15 neurotypical children were collected for a pilot study of the Portrait Drawing Assessment. Participants with ASD were rated as more engaged and conversational during the art therapy assessment than their neurotypical counterparts, contradicting widespread characterization of people with ASD as asocial. Portrait drawing was found to be successful as a structured, concrete means for engaging in relationships and holds potential as a therapeutic task for developing face processing and face recognition skills.

An art-based phenomenological case study method was used to investigate a lived experience of this transition. The participant attended 11 art therapy sessions and used a visual journal daily over a six-week period shortly after the move to the new setting. Data analysis identified themes and visual features that appeared repeatedly in the images and enhanced the description of the participant's experience. Results showed that the transitional process of moving into a community setting involved a journey of learning, self-development and maturation. Art therapy helped the process of life style transition, especially through the use of a visual journal that functioned as a continuous outlet for guiding self expression and self-identity.

        "description":"In reading research, studies on good and poor reader characteristics abound. However, these findings remain largely scattered in applied linguistics and cognitive and educational psychology. This paper attempts to synthesize current theory and research on the topic in the past 20 years along 3 dimensions: language knowledge and processing ability, cognitive ability, and metacognitive strategic competence. A profile of good readers follows a review of the literature. With a special reference to second language (L2) reading research and pedagogy in China, the author argues that a key difference between first language and L2 readers is that L2 readers typically have a gap between their L2 proficiency and their knowledge or conceptual maturation, and this tension determines to some degree the characteristics of good versus poor L2 readers. By examining L2 reading research in the country, the author proposes some areas worth exploring in the Chinese context. (Contains 3 tables and 3 notes.)",

A spelling task was used to assess the English orthographic or spelling knowledge, and standardized reading and listening tests were used to assess the general language processing and comprehension skills of the two groups. The results of the tests indicated that the Arab and non-Arab ESL students were not significantly different in listening (or auding) comprehension, but that the Arab students scored significantly lower on the spelling test and the reading comprehension test. This study discusses possible reasons why Arab ESL learners may exhibit difficulties with English spelling and then discusses the link between spelling knowledge and the development of reading fluency.

A number of studies have suggested that an extensive reading (ER) program can lead to improvement of L2 learners' reading rate; however, studies about high school students are scarce. Inspired by current issues in reading and previous ER investigations, this study examined the effectiveness of ER on reading rates of high school students in Japan. In this study, students were provided with graded readers and comic books as reading material they would find enjoyable. Pretests and posttests of reading rate and language proficiency were administered and a t test was used to compare means of the rates and language proficiency within groups. Results indicate that ER is an effective approach to improve students' rate and general language proficiency. (Contains 4 tables, 2 figures and 10 notes.)",

        "author":["Schmidt, John J."],
        "description":"Invitational theory uses many elements to define, describe, and delineate its beliefs and practices. For example, the Five Ps of people, places, policies, programs, and processes are consistently cited in the literature and research as the framework for assessing inviting practices. Another example is the presentation of four areas of inviting: (1) Inviting Oneself Personally; (2) Inviting Oneself Professionally; (3) Inviting Others Personally; and (4) Inviting Others Professionally. Such elements and components help to explain invitational theory and practices in an understandable language with useable concepts. All these concepts coexist in the approach known as \"Invitational Education.\" As an inclusive model of communication and human relations, \"Invitational Education,\" implies a belief system that embraces, celebrates, and honors diversity. Yet, invitational theorists and writers have not illustrated this proactive stance and genuine acceptance of diverse populations in many publications. A lack of research about invitational practices with diverse populations has encouraged this article. Perhaps what researchers and practitioners of invitational theory require is a schema or method by which to examine behaviors, the Five Ps, or other variables within multi-cultural and diverse contexts. In this article, the author proposes six elements of diversity (the Six E's) by which researchers and practitioners can assess relationships and organizations in terms of accepting, embracing, and celebrating diversity. These are: (1) empowerment; (2) encouragement; (3) enlistment; (4) enjoyment; (5) equity; and (6) expectation. This article is intended as a vehicle for discussion and, equally important, as a structure by which researchers and practitioners might develop methods of measuring and evaluating aspects of invitational theory and practice when applying principles and concepts with diverse students, clients, and other groups.",

It employed 10 tests measuring 5 aspects of word knowledge (orthography, paradigmatic association, syntagmatic association, meaning and form, and grammatical functions) to assess learning. Both receptive and productive tests were used to measure each aspect of vocabulary knowledge. The participants encountered target words in 2 learning conditions: glossed sentences and word pairs. The results showed that the learners had significantly higher scores for the words that had known synonyms on productive knowledge as measured using syntagmatic association and paradigmatic association tests and on receptive knowledge as measured using an orthography test. The findings indicate that learning synonyms for known words may be easier than learning words that do not have known synonyms. A list of Glossed Sentences is appended. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Research has shown that extensive reading offers a wide range of learning benefits to second language (L2) learners. However, most studies on L2 extensive reading are conducted collectively on groups of learners and do not provide a detailed picture of individual experience. Moreover, there are few studies conducted on the reading experiences of early L2 learners. This paper presents a longitudinal case study on the reading strategies and motivation of 2 Japanese middle school students beginning to read extensively in English. During this 2.5-year study, the researcher conducted interviews 4 times, gave tests regularly, and observed participant behavior in each reading session. The results show that the 2 participants used a variety of reading strategies and that their L2 reading motivation changed as they became increasingly fluent readers. The findings reveal significant individual differences in the use of reading strategies and support a dynamic view of L2 reading motivation. (Contains 4 tables, 9 notes and 6 appendices.)",

However, there is more involved in creating a thoughtful and intellectual learning environment at home than just books and science kits. The way a group communicates, what it communicates, and what it values are all components of a culture of thinking. In \"The Thinking Classroom: Learning and Teaching in a Culture of Thinking,\" Tishman, Perkins, and Jay (1994) describe the process of establishing a classroom culture of thinking in four distinct ways; modeling, explanation, interaction, and feedback. In this article, the author discusses how the four methods can be modified to create an environment of thinking and inquiry in the home. (Contains 1 table, 1 figure and 7 resources.)",

        "author":["Besnoy, Kevin"],
        "description":"There is a high incidence of today's gifted students independently interacting with their global community through technology tools. Teachers of the gifted (GT teachers) must possess an understanding of technology processes and concepts in order to engage their students through instructionally meaningful and appropriate lessons. Although many educators would like to use technology tools as an instructional medium, two obstacles prevent GT teachers from integrating technology into the curriculum: access to resources and continuous professional development. As a result of the one-size-fits-all aspect of technology-focused professional development opportunities, GT teachers cannot afford to wait for districtwide staff development sessions to teach them how to integrate computer resources. Rather, they must independently seek professional development opportunities that meet their specific instructional technology (IT) needs. A Personal Technology Improvement Plan (PTIP) facilitates this by allowing GT teachers to create an individualized professional development plan. Whether the GT teacher is a novice or an expert at integrating technology into the gifted education classroom, PTIPs can help improve his or her ability to use computers as an instructional tool. This article discusses a five-step process that GT teachers should follow in order to create an effective plan that provides continual development over a 5-year period. (Contains 1 table.)",

When a student writes a poem for a character in an assigned story or engage in other activities, the classroom becomes a more interesting space, and students think in new ways. For gifted children, such opportunities can mean the difference between an enriched, challenging experience and just another dull day in class. Differentiated instruction can provide the context for artistic representations of knowledge that show many ways of knowing and engage gifted students in meaningful learning construction. This article describes the many ways in which students can benefit from differentiated instruction. This article also describes how teachers can encourage artistic production among their students.

Positive and negative perfectionism were also found to relate differentially to life satisfaction and positive affect, as well as negative affect--the three components of subjective well-being. Although positive and negative perfectionism could be inferred to impact directly on subjective well-being, the mediating role of general self-efficacy in the relationships between perfectionism and subjective wellbeing was also suggested. Implications of the findings for future research on perfectionism scale development and on the complex relationships among positive and negative perfectionism, general self-efficacy, and the three components of subjective well-being are discussed.

Data for this study was gathered from 690 student teachers who were in their last year in college pursuing a teaching credential. The results indicated that the student teachers rated their supervising teachers' competency in supervision as poor to partially competent. Although there is no significant relation found between the gender and fulfillment of supervisory duties, the main significant finding was between supervising teachers' experience in teaching and completion of the supervisory role. The results showed that the younger or less experienced supervising teachers demonstrated better supervisory skills. Furthermore, our results indicated that although experience is important, it should not be the only criterion for selecting supervising teachers for supervisory duty.

Using a skills audit of the items, a variable of Vietnamese mathematics development was defined following an item response analysis of the data. Findings reveal that the levels of mathematics achievement were relatively high and that the mathematics curriculum was closely aligned with international trends in mathematics for primary school. There were some areas of concern in that lower achievement levels were persistently aligned with low socio economic groups and these were typically located in three regions of Vietnam, heavily populated by ethnic sub-groups.

        "author":["Gaither, Milton"],
        "description":"The author discusses his book \"Homeschool: An American History,\" and offers four primary impetuses for the current status of homeschooling as a political movement. First, he writes, social and political changes of the second half of the twentieth century partnered radical leftists who wanted nothing to do with conventional America and conventional Americans who wanted nothing to do with a country that in their view had sold out to the radical left. Countercultural sensibilities on the political left with those on the political right converged to become the mainstream American sensibility. Second, homeschooling happened because of suburbanization, which feeds the American hunger for privacy, yet serves as a breeding ground for libertarian sentiment and anti-government activism. Third, homeschooling happened because of the cult of the child, rooted in Rousseau and cultivated in the progressive education movement of the early twentieth century, another premise finding common support in both the political left and the political right. The writer completes a full circle by ending primarily where he began, reiterating changes both in public schooling and in families during the second half of the twentieth century. As public schools grew larger, more bureaucratic and impersonal, less responsive to parents and less adaptable to individual or local cultural variations, many families feel increasingly compelled to search for alternative educational options.

Accelerated failure time models show that gender has some effect on rates of promotion, but that disciplinary and institutional variation are much greater. Generally, departments in science, engineering, and professional schools promote their faculty more rapidly, while disciplines strongly oriented to training practitioners are slowest. There is considerable variation among institutions, but this is not strongly linked to institutional characteristics such as size and prestige. All these factors more strongly affect the length of time for promotion from associate to full professor, than for promotion from assistant to associate professor.

        "description":"Canadian universities and colleges are becoming increasingly ethnoculturally diverse. Two major social forces have contributed to this change: immigration and increasing enrolment of international students. Minority and international students bring their values, language, culture and educational background to our campuses, to add to and enrich our educational environments. To build an inclusive education, we have the ethical and educational responsibility to embrace such difference and diversity and to integrate it into all aspects of university life, including teaching and learning. However, in our daily encounter with cultural diversity we still confront many challenges, such as the colourblind and the &quot;difference as deficit&quot; perspectives, partially resulting from a lack of knowledge and readiness to approach diversity. The goal of this article is to bridge this gap by examining three selected models commonly used to nurture cultural diversity in higher education: the intercultural education model, the multicultural education model, and the anti-racist education model. It is hoped that this discussion will benefit the university community in Canada as well as in other countries where diversity prevails. (Contains 2 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"Canadian universities are struggling to address seemingly contradictory challenges pertaining to undergraduate education: high demand and underfunding. A number of instruments, including the National Survey of Student Engagement (National Survey of Student Engagement, n.d.), have led to greater priority being placed on the undergraduate experience. Yet, strategies to ensure student satisfaction with their education, through initiatives such as small classes and personal contact with faculty, seem at odds with the large classes necessitated by fiscal imperatives. We carried out a systematic investigation of the impact of one problem-based learning course on first year students' experiences. We also investigated the persistence of skills and attitudes learned in this single exposure to problem-based learning. The results of our investigation show that this course had very positive effects on the immediate and persistent behaviours of students. Our research provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of problem-based learning and leads us to suggest how a problem-based approach might help universities enhance the quality of education and the undergraduate experience.

        "description":"The Bologna Process is the most important recent development in higher education policy at the European level. Initially North America observed this reorganisation of Europe's higher education architecture with some scepticism and even mild irony--if not outright ignoring it. More recently, however, the obvious success of attempts to create a &quot;European Higher Education Area&quot; has increased the interest on the other side of the Atlantic. This paper provides a short overview of the initial goals of the Bologna Process, the present state of implementation, and of the difficulties this process faces.

CAB teacher ratings were compared for high-ability students who were currently functioning with ability test scores greater than or equal to 120; comparisons also were made across the students' full ability range and according to their race/ethnicity. The Bracken Basic Concept Scale-Revised and the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test were contrasted with the CAB in terms of the proportions of culturally diverse students identified as high ability. A discernible CAB scale and cluster profile was evident for high-ability students, showing significantly better adjustment among the high-ability students as compared to the typical student from the general population. High-ability students evidenced adaptive strengths on the CAB Social Skills and Competence scales and on the Executive Function and Gifted and Talented clusters. (Contains 6 tables and 3 figures.)",

Repeated analyses of variance indicate that although the first three of these variables do not  clearly divide on the basis of ethno-racial origin, non-European origin students are more likely than those of European origin to perceive that not all students are treated equally. Analyses of relationships among variables within and between years indicates that the factors  explaining the program satisfaction of students of European origin are different than those explaining satisfaction of Chinese origin students. For the former, it is likely that certain personality characteristics play a key role; for the latter, perceptions of equal treatment of students are more important.

The mixed-method survey design facilitated triangulation of findings to better understand the contextual factors that influence primary grade teachers' perceptions and behaviors. Findings indicate that primary grade teachers continue to hold traditional conceptions of talent that shapes how they view cultural minority students, nonnative English speakers, and children with other exceptionalities. These beliefs influence the types of academic, social, and programmatic interventions they believe diverse primary grade learners need, often seeing the deficits before identifying the talents.

There are some very heavy drinkers who drink daily in these populations, but most drinkers are binge drinkers. On any typical day abstinence from alcohol is the modal pattern. That is, most respondents indicated very infrequent drinking, and among the older age groups (40+), there is a high rate of abstinence. Males drink more frequently and in larger quantities than females. The number of drinking days per month is 4.7 for males and 2.1 for females, and on those days when drinking occurs, the males consume an average of 5.7 drinks and females an average of 3.1. The highest prevalence of drinking and the heaviest drinking occur among those who are under the age of 30.

        "description":"Of all Indian Health Service areas, the Aberdeen Area has consistently had the highest infant mortality rate. Among some tribes in this area the rate has exceeded 30/1000 live birth and half the infant deaths have been attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, a rate four to five times higher than the national average. The Indian Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and the Aberdeen Area Tribal Chairmen's Health Board collaborated to investigate these high rates with the goals of refining the ascertainment of the causes of death, improving cause-specific infant mortality rates and identifying factors contributing to the high rates. Ten of the 19 tribes or tribal communities, representing 66% of the area population, participated in a 4-year prospective case-control study of infants who died after discharge from the hospital. Infant care practices and socio-demographic, economic, medical, health care, and environmental factors were examined. The study included parental interviews, death scene investigations, autopsies, neuropathology studies, medical chart abstractions, blood cotinine assays, and a surveillance system for infant deaths. Controls were the previous and subsequent infants born on the case mother's reservation. From December 1, 1992 until November 30, 1996, 72 infant deaths were investigated. This report describes the study methods and the model employed for involving the community and multiple agencies to study the problem of infant mortality among Northern Plains Indians. Data gathered during the investigations are being analyzed and will be published at a later date. The following is appended: (1) Reduction of Infant Mortality Recommendations for Parents.

        "description":"Much of the data reported here regarding American Indian (AI) people has originated from specific areas with particular peoples. Thus, one must be cautious in applying information from one tribe to the hundreds of tribes living across the United States. As with any people, psychiatric disorder may be a pre-existing rationale for using alcohol. Or alternatively, alcohol may lead to various psychiatric disorders, such as organic mental conditions, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other conditions. A third alternative is that both alcoholism and other psychiatric disorder merely happen to affect the same person by chance. Recognizing alcoholism and treating it in a timely manner before disabling or even permanent psychiatric disorders ensue are key strategies. In addition, clinicians must be able to recognize and then either treat or refer co-morbid patients for appropriate care. Some psychiatric disorders, such as panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and various organic mental disorders may occur more often in some AI groups. Other co-morbid conditions, such as eating disorders, may occur less often among AI patients with alcoholism. It could be argued that resources should go solely to preventive efforts, thereby negating the need for psychiatric services. However, successful prevention of alcoholism may hinge upon, and increase the need for greater psychiatric services in AI communities. (Contains 1 footnote.)

        "description":"Self-regulated learners engage in self-generated thoughts, actions, and feelings while pursuing academic goals. The most successful learners use appropriate learning strategies and maintain high levels of motivation. Few studies on the self-regulation of learning have examined individual differences such as gender and ethnicity among college students. The study examined gender and ethnic differences in the relationships between academic performance, self-regulation, motivation, and delay of gratification using correlational analyses. The study also investigated whether students from diverse gender and ethnic groups differed with regard to their use of self-regulation, motivation, delay of gratification, and academic performance using multivariate and univariate analyses of variance. Participants were 364 college students enrolled in introductory psychology courses in a public university. The results suggested the presence of gender and ethnic differences in motivation, use of cognitive strategies, and delay of gratification, and use of self-regulation of learning is ambiguous. The reported self-efficacy beliefs of all groups of students were moderately to highly correlated with grades. The results also suggested that, independent of gender or ethnicity, the student's evaluation of the importance and usefulness of the course task was related to achievement in the class. There were differences in the relationships between delay of gratification and the use of cognitive strategies, between ethnicity and gender groups. In examining the mean differences of each group, there was a significant difference between course grades, with Caucasian students obtaining higher grades. In addition, minority males also reported significantly lower self-confidence in their ability to perform academic tasks. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This study explores how a project-based approach, based on gifted education pedagogy, was implemented in a public school program where the majority of students were from low-income families. The 2 first-grade teachers in this study were able to change their teaching practices to include more strategies commonly found in gifted programs such as brainstorming, creating surveys, and collecting data. The teachers also indicated a greater comfort level with a child-centered and project-based approach to curricular units over the course of the study. In addition, classroom observations indicated students were better behaved when engaged in project and small-group activities, as seen in classroom observations. This paper also highlights several challenges to implementing project-based approaches in the early childhood classroom. Teachers in this study perceived barriers to implementing the project approach that they had been taught in their professional development course. They felt constraints from their school context, as well as from their own beliefs and assumptions about their students. They often had difficulty assuming the role of facilitator and releasing control of learning to the students. However, as the teachers in this study implemented the new approaches, they were able to overcome many of the internal and external limitations that they expressed prior to beginning the units. This study has practical implications for reform initiatives related to the identification of strengths and talents in students who are typically underserved in gifted programs. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Previous research has indicated that most students copy and paste notes from Internet sources in a mindless way; they typically paste large sections of text into their notes and then later can recall little of what they have stored. However, supplying students with a note-taking framework that restricts the amount of text that may be pasted can prompt them to engage in more selective pasting, and this seems to result in greater learning. But the extant research has not specifically addressed copy and paste note-taking behaviors of high-achieving students. The high-achieving high school and college students in the present study used a note-taking tool on the computer that consisted of an electronic matrix to cue students to note certain types of information. In one condition, the number of words that could be included in each cell was restricted, whereas in the other group, the students' cells were unrestricted. After the note-taking sessions, all students completed assessments to document the amount of information they learned. High-achieving students in both conditions learned the same amount through the note-taking process. These results were inconsistent with the previous research. Follow-up analyses of students' notes indicated that although the high-achieving students in the unrestricted note-taking group were not limited in the number of words they copied, many of them selectively chose which information they pasted into the grid. The relationship between text-pasting selectivity and learning remained: High-achieving students were more selective in their note taking, and they also were more successful on the posttests.

        "description":"Many students of Mexican descent must learn how to be successful students. This study describes 5 students of Mexican descent from situationally marginalized lives who were a part of a support and retention scholarship program (College Assistance Migrant Program--CAMP). These case studies document how they perceived their learning and how they changed as students after their first college experience and involvement in CAMP. Through her involvement in CAMP, Laura, a high school dropout without a supportive home or school environment, came to see herself as a successful student. As an English Language Learner, Cristina felt ill-prepared to begin a college career; however, by experiencing successes in her first year of coursework and being involved in CAMP, she gained self-confidence. Maria, a teen mother with two children, saw college as the only way out of poverty. She exhibited resiliency and the desire to use the experience to gain insightful and practical knowledge about herself as a student and mother. During high school, the continual relocation between Mexico and the United States negatively affected Luz's ability to be successful. Through CAMP, she gained confidence in her ability to relate with others, particularly with teachers and professors. Ruben, a former gang member, struggled in his first semester as he acclimated to the structured environment of a classroom. Despite this struggle, the CAMP staff and his professors saw growth in Ruben's social behavior. These case studies show that students who would not normally be considered \"college material,\" when given the opportunity and appropriate support, can become successful. This success hinges on their new perspective of themselves and their participation in a community of practice. (Contains 1 table and 2 footnotes.)",

Yet the gifted education and mathematics literature suggest support for curriculum that is both enriched and accelerated with a focus on developing conceptual understanding and mathematical thinking. Project M[superscript 3]: Mentoring Mathematical Minds is a 5-year Javits research grant project designed to create curriculum units with these essential elements for talented elementary students. These units combine exemplary teaching practices of gifted education with the content and process standards promoted by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. The content at each level is at least one to two grade levels above the regular curriculum and includes number and operations, algebra, geometry and measurement, and data analysis and probability. The focus of the pedagogy encourages students to act as practicing professionals by emphasizing verbal and written communication. Research was conducted on the implementation of 12 units in 11 different schools, 9 in Connecticut and 2 in Kentucky. The sample consisted of approximately 200 mathematically talented students entering third grade, most of whom remained in the project through fifth grade. Students in this study demonstrated a significant increase in understanding across all mathematical concepts in each unit from pre- to posttesting. Thus, Project M[superscript 3] materials may help fill a curriculum void by providing appropriate accelerated and enriched units to meet the needs of mathematically talented elementary students.

        "description":"Middle school teachers, like all educators around the nation, are encountering classrooms comprised of an unprecedented number of students from various cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds. Due to the influx of immigrants entering the U.S. educational system, the number of students who speak a native language other than English has grown dramatically and will account for about 40% of the school-age population by 2040. The reality of a multicultural, multilingual student population dictates that educators, 87% of whom are Caucasian, must be prepared to interact and work with students who do not share the same language, culture, or national origin. Some researchers believe that meeting the needs of diverse students is, and will be, even more challenging for middle school teachers than other teachers, because they must also help students deal with the unique developmental changes that occur during this time. As young adolescents confront a host of transitions associated with the emergence of puberty, including dramatic physical, social-emotional, and cognitive changes, they also undergo transformations in relationships with parents, encounter more emotionally intense interactions with peers, and struggle with personal identity issues. Middle school teachers, therefore, must become educated about and skilled in using pedagogy that is sensitive and responsive to the developmental and educational needs of young adolescents from diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. This article explores instructional strategies employed by teachers in middle school classrooms in Florida, a state in which 50% of the students in public schools are members of ethnic minority groups.

        "description":"Throughout the decades, writing has been recognized as a process that helps learners to think more deeply about ideas and information they encounter through reading, listening, viewing, and physically experiencing the world around them. \"Discovery writing,\" the type of writing over which students have some control of the format, topic, purpose, and audience, leads to greater understanding of concepts across the middle school curriculum. \"Staccato writing,\" the quick, short writing required when filling in blanks, copying notes from a blackboard, or providing short answers to questions, does not generate the same deep levels of understanding. Discovery writing requires greater concentrated attention to sorting through and making sense of ideas than staccato writing does. In this article, the author adds to the longstanding literature on writing across the curriculum by showing that content area classrooms are ideal places for helping students to develop as writers, as well as content learners. Writing is a natural and easy fit in content classes. As teachers teach writing, they help students to reinforce and build on their content understandings. As content concepts are taught, students will be creating pools of knowledge that they can draw upon when they write. Here, the author makes a case for teaching writing alongside content across the curriculum and then shows what planning and organizing the classroom to teach content concepts and writing might look like.

Watch while the mixture swells with confidence, commitment, and community. Like many great recipes, the perfect mix of ingredients was discovered as much by accident, as by conscious intent when the middle level program at Texas Tech University's (TTU) College of Education and the outdoor school at Texas Tech's Junction, Texas, campus partnered to provide an intensive three-day introduction to field experiences for teacher candidates. The partnership was designed to begin the preparation of high-quality middle level teachers through a developmentally appropriate field-based experience.

        "author":["Landt, Susan M."],
        "description":"Middle school students are acutely aware of their social surroundings. In the process of emerging from childhood they attentively observe one another, looking for clues to belonging. Striving for independence from adult authority, young adolescents endeavor to blend in with their contemporaries. From clothes to music, from posture to attitude, middle school students are exploring. While peers have considerable influence, teachers are still a significant factor in students' lives. What teachers say and how they say it, what they include and what they leave out all have an impact on students' perceptions of what is right and how things should be. Teachers, serving as models, affect students beyond the intended lessons they teach. What is the message being sent when the only voices teachers advocate are from white middle class families? Middle school students, absorbing these unintended lessons, come to perceive white middle-class as normative and all other possibilities as atypical, different, unusual, other. This perception is reinforced when, in response to a holiday or a month dedicated to a specific group, teachers unearth the \"appropriate\" material to be taught and then promptly bury it until the following year. How can teachers avert this tendency in their teaching without either expanding the curriculum or eliminating other valuable content? A solution entails effectively melding literature featuring non-mainstream individuals with content area curriculum. To help teachers proceed toward this goal it is necessary to do two things: first, provide information about high-quality authentic literature representing all people; and second, demonstrate ways to naturally feature a variety of good literature within curriculum. In previous work, the author described important aspects of selecting multicultural literature. In this article, she shares specific ideas for weaving a few exemplary selections into content area curriculum at the middle level. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"In this article, the author explores the promising practices of Audrey Union (all names in this article are pseudonyms), a white principal of Integration Middle School (IMS), which served nearly 400 students in sixth through ninth grades. Approximately 40% of the students were of color and a similar percentage qualified for free and reduced lunch. In particular, the author examines Audrey's influence in creating systemic, sustained, and differentiated professional development for social justice in her school. This is a critical case study in that her practices offer in-depth insights for addressing at least two crucial challenges faced by middle level principals. The first challenge concerns providing quality professional development opportunities for \"all\" teachers to enhance their practice for \"all\" students, a core component of school improvement. Several authors have provided models of or demonstrated the crucial role principals play in creating these opportunities. However, documented principal practice is needed for creating a more comprehensive understanding of how they differentiate professional learning for individual teaching needs, especially considering the next challenge. A second, related challenge, despite its importance, has received much less attention. It is also the challenge that set Principal Union apart from most principals: providing professional development that encourages teachers to prepare students as citizens who understand and address community, national, and global social issues. In other words, Principal Union's practices not only demonstrated commitment to professional development for equity and academic excellence, but also commitment to professional development driven by student learning for diversity and social action.",

Using this comparative method, the authors looked at the similarities and differences of two different educational settings to collect data regarding the practices that best support first-year teachers. The individuals in this study are brothers, and both were employed as first-year teachers in middle school settings. Josh is an eighth grade social studies teacher in a small midwestern city with a population under 80,000, and Dan is a seventh grade English teacher employed in a large district in a Midwest metropolitan area of approximately 3 million. Josh observed the different experiences, strategies, and attitudes that existed over a three-day site visit at his brother's urban middle school. During this visit, he interviewed his brother regarding specific elements of support, as well as structural and conceptual approaches of the Midwest middle school. He also conducted several situational (informal) interviews with Dan's peers.",

However, there is very little information available on building solid business-education partnerships. Most people in the business world will say that they care about education, but how can educators find the people willing to pay education more than lip service by committing their time and resources to support schools? What do those people want to accomplish? What can they bring to the table? And how can one build sustainable partnerships that meet the needs of all parties over time--those of educators, business people and, most importantly, students? Coalition leaders represent the interests and efforts of businesses across the country, and these stakeholders are keenly interested in working with educators to prepare young people for success in life. These coalitions are collaborative, focused on results, and able to bring the time and talents of accomplished people to bear. They are also satisfied with the results of their previous partnerships and looking for new opportunities to make an impact. CTE professionals can benefit greatly by taking the initiative to develop relationships with these supporters of education. This article takes a close look at how to build solid and sustainable partnerships with the business community that benefit schools, students, and business partners. (Contains 4 charts.)",

        "description":"In this article, the author discusses Sudoku--a logic puzzle that has appeared in many newspapers in recent years. In its introductory form it consists of a 9x9 grid in which the digits 1 to 9 inclusive are each to be placed nine times in the 81 separate cells of the grid. Each row and each column may not have any digit repeated. If these were the only rules, then the solved puzzle would be called a Latin square. This name was invented by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) who first created one on a 3x3 grid using the Latin numeral characters I, II and III. Furthermore, accompanying explanation of the rules of Sudoku in many newspapers claims that solving Sudoku requires no mathematics. However, this is an incorrect statement, for although no calculations seem to be required, the solution of a Sudoku puzzle may require the use of logical reasoning, deduction, and \"reductio ad absurdum\" techniques which are all part of the rich tapestry of mathematics. Sudoku has an extra constraint compared with a regular 9x9 Latin square. Each of the nine non-overlapping 3x3 sub-grids along the edges and in the centre of the larger grid must also contain the digits 1 to 9 without repetition. To enable a Sudoku puzzle to be solved, particular digits or clues are fixed in place in some cells at the start. The number of these varies, but they should be placed so that the solution is unique. At this stage no one has created a solvable 9x9 Sudoku puzzle with fewer than 17 given clues, but this lower limit has not been proved mathematically. (Contains 3 figures.)",

Hex is played on a diamond shaped board made up of hexagons. It can be of any size, but an 11x11 board makes for a good game. Two opposite sides of the diamond are labelled \"red,\" the other two sides \"blue\" (or, often, \"black\" and \"white\"). The hexagons at the vertices of the diamond belong to either side. The game is for two players. One has a supply of red pieces, the other a supply of blue pieces. If the board is of suitable size, draughtsmen make good pieces. The players alternately place their pieces on any of the hexagons, providing that hexagon is unoccupied. Each player tries to construct an unbroken chain of pieces from one side to the opposite side: red to red, or blue to blue. (Contains 6 figures.)",

        "description":"Teachers all over the world are aware that students struggle with fractional concepts and with elementary algebra. Support for this assertion can be found in a variety of research reports. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a United States report, indicates that students have recurrently demonstrated a lack of proficiency in these areas over the past twenty years (NCES, 2000). An analysis of the 1990 NAEP in mathematics achievement found that only 46 percent of all high school seniors demonstrated success with a grasp of decimals, percentages, fractions, and simple algebra. The inability to perform basic operations on common fractions has led to error patterns that emerge in learning algebra. In this article, the authors present a study which determines if a relationship existed between proficiency with common fractions and success in algebra and its results. Proficiency in this context indicates that not only is a student able to understand fraction concepts, but also that the student is able to manipulate fractions for accurate computation without the aid of a calculator. In this study, an \"ex post facto\" design was used to compare students' performance in elementary algebra and intermediate algebra with their ability to understand and manipulate fractions.

There is so much hype about the Golden Ratio that it is worth reading an article at http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_06_04.html. It explains why some of the more far-fetched ideas are actually true and why some suggestions, such as Zeising's, gain credibility. One answer has been provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The ABS wishes to see its statistics widely used as it contributes to its mission of &quot;assisting and encouraging informed decision making, research and discussion.&quot; It therefore takes quite seriously the task of educating, and assisting those who educate, about statistics. In this article, the author talks about the well designed and user friendly website of ABS. Of particular interest to teachers is the Census At School section of their website www.abs.gov.au. Teachers can ask students from Years 5 to 12 to go online and answer a series of questions about themselves. The ABS keeps a database of the responses and anyone can go online and download a random sample of those responses. Teachers can also download very useful materials such as question sheets that help their students work through and understand the data they download.",

        "author":["Pearn, Catherine Ann"],
        "description":"Several researchers have noted how children's whole number schemes can interfere with their efforts to learn fractions. An Australian study found that children who were successful with the solution of rational number tasks exhibited greater whole number knowledge and more flexible solution strategies. Behr and Post (1988) indicated that children needed to be competent in the four operations of whole numbers, along with an understanding of measurement, for them to understand rational numbers. This paper describes a &quot;hands on&quot; approach developed by researchers that focuses on the use of paper folding, fraction walls and number lines to develop an understanding of fractions using a measurement model.

        "description":"&quot;The Dawkins era is over,&quot; Commonwealth Education Minister Julie Bishop told a Perth audience in late July 2007. This turning point in Australian higher education is not being driven by a decisive legislative change; the rapid abandonment of the old in favour of the new that everyone has seen before. It is as much the accidental result of policy as its intended outcome. The opening of the commercial international student market in the late 1980s created an opportunity to recruit full-fee students, and the abandonment of adequate grant indexation in the mid-1990s, which created a need to recruit full-fee students. It is these fees that now bring average revenue per student up to levels that make high-quality teaching financially feasible. While Australia has been very successful in the international student market, it now faces stiff competition from other nations. As such, it is imperative for institutions to think carefully about what they teach, how they teach it, where they teach it, which awards to confer and how much to charge. In this article, the author describes how the universities at Australia are standing up to face today's challenges. One such example is the University of Melbourne, which is the first to announce a major institutional reform that takes up some of the challenges in the current higher education environment. The Melbourne Model is part of a larger strategy called Growing Esteem. The author describes the mechanism of this strategy and the positive response of everyone to it.",

        "description":"There has been much critical comment in recent years about the tensions between the regulation imposed on public universities and the flexibility needed to compete effectively in international and national markets for students and funding. In the partisan world of politics each side points the finger at the other as the author of &quot;too much&quot; regulation. Yet there is a shared set of underlying assumptions about the interplay between regulation and markets that has led to more regulation without necessarily improving the outcomes for or from universities. Australia has created a vibrant international education presence, now recognized as a major contributor to the economy as the third largest export earner in Australia. Australian universities have also become more flexible and responsive to changing student and industry needs. However, difficulties have been created by increasing competitive pressures between institutions while at the same time requiring more detailed regulation of what is done and how it is done. In this article, the authors discuss how regulation and financing arrangements should be redrawn to help achieve better outcomes from and for Australian universities. They contend that policymakers should reconsider the whole regulatory framework for higher education. Until regulation moves away from selective interventions and over-concentration on directing the behavior of Australian's &quot;public universities,&quot; the benefits of an increasingly internationalised and significant sector for the country's future and economy will not be realised.",

        "description":"Ever since the radical reforms of the Dawkins years of the late 1980s and early 1990s, change has been a constant for university administrators, as well as for university staff. In the earlier years, change was driven directly by Government, as witnessed by the huge expansion of student numbers, the introduction of tuition fees and the first real venture into the then nascent international student market. These were powerful transformative years. It was in the 1990s that &quot;the market&quot; gained leverage within higher education funding decisions, and Australia became an international case study for its unique student financing system, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS). Following the election of a new conservative government in 1996, the market moved from its supporting role to become the major driver of higher education policy, and the role of business models and the appointment of business leaders to government reviews of higher education increased significantly. Over the last decade, change has been driven directly by the Government using its funding levers to ensure compliance, especially in the areas of governance and staffing and employment matters. In this article, the author contends that as in the past, government policy continued to favour the promotion of market mechanisms as key policy drivers, as long as they have been consistent with the ideological and policy agenda of the Government. On balance, from the perspective of 2006, one would have to argue that the market has become sub-servient to the ideological policies of the Government. It could not be said that current government policy is essentially market-driven when universities have seen a massive intervention into their policies and practices and are currently weighed down by the compliance requirements of government-funded activities, even activities that are only partially publicly-subsidised.

        "description":"There is little doubt that the modern university is far different to that of the early 90s and the work of academics has changed considerably over this time driven by the efficiency and accountability agenda. In taking stock of the changes, it needs to be recognised that often the cry for efficiency and accountability has been used as a mechanism for control, cost reductions and to drive particular policy agendas. In broad terms, management practices in the tertiary education sector have shifted from a collegial to a corporate or commercial paradigm. A by-product of this has been a shift in power from academia to the hierarchy, with a managerial emphasis on deploying staff to meet strategic goals and cost effectiveness. These values do not necessarily coincide with or include the values of academics, so over time the influence of academics over decision making has reduced. This article presents a discussion of the state of tertiary education in Australia, linked to an account of the recent experiences in the Faculty of Education at the University of Tasmania. The aim of the article is to consider the cumulative effects of many of the changes that have taken place in tertiary education over recent years and to question whether the prevailing management paradigm in higher education, aimed at increased efficiency and accountability is the most appropriate way forward.",

More than 6000 staff participated at each time, of whom 969 (stayers) participated at both times. This paper presents the cross-sectional data obtained on both occasions as well as the longitudinal data provided by the stayers. Overall, the cross-sectional data from all participants showed some encouraging improvements. For example, there were increases in organisational commitment, job involvement, job autonomy, procedural fairness, and trust in senior management, as well as decreases in work pressure and job insecurity. However, there were also increases in psychological strain and work-home conflict. Longitudinal results from the stayers showed a similar pattern. These participants also showed increases in job involvement, job autonomy, belief in procedural fairness, and trust in senior management, and a decrease in job insecurity, together with increased work-home conflict and increased psychological strain. However, they did not show improvements in organisational commitment or work pressure, and also reported reduced job satisfaction. Attrition analyses revealed some Time 1 differences between the stayers and dropouts that might explain the discrepant findings. Neither the cross-sectional nor longitudinal changes were uniform across all universities, or all categories of staff. The improvements were more marked for general than for academic staff, and for female than for male staff. Regression analyses found that the best predictors of organisational commitment were job satisfaction and trust in senior management; the best predictors of trust in senior management were procedural fairness and organisational commitment; and the best predictor of job satisfaction was procedural fairness. Interestingly, the only significant predictor of psychological strain was neuroticism. The next stage of the research is to try to find out what interventions were introduced at each university and to link them to the observed improvements. (Contains 8 tables.)",

There have been two waves of concern with university discipline in the post-war period, especially in respect of students: first, in the period of post-war university expansion; second, in the period of commercialisation post-1988.  For the post-1988 &quot;enterprise university&quot; the problem has increasingly been viewed as associated with academic transgression, such as plagiarism or cheating. Such concerns tend to be supported by academic research, and they go to the issue of quality, integrity and the standing of university degrees. This may be distinguished from the &quot;student problem&quot; of the 1960s, which focused on university order per se.  It is submitted that the contemporary forms of misconduct are symptomatic of a fundamental contradiction in the university-student relationship: between the maintenance of academic order and the market-orientated instrumentalism of university education.

A three-factor model of the SPQ that recognizes the strong relationship between students' GPA, achieving motives and strategies for learning warrants further investigation.

Correspondence analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed in order to identify the characteristics related to the award of market premiums and whether these characteristics account for gender differences. The correspondence analysis produces a two-factor solution in which the second axis clearly opposes faculty who receive market premiums to those who do not. Gender is strongly related to this factor, with the female category on the side of the axis associated with the absence of market premiums. The results of the logistic regression confirm that field of specialization, frequency of external research contracts, faculty members' values and attitudes towards remuneration and seniority within rank are all related to the award of market premiums, as hypothesized. However, women were still almost three times less likely than men to have been awarded market premiums after controlling for these relationships. Overall, the results suggest that within a collective bargaining context, reindividualization of the pay determination process--notably, the payment of market premiums to faculty--may reopen pay differences by gender.

        "description":"In 2002 a new Ontario college charter signaled a new era for higher education in Ontario. The charter was presumed to usher in a new way of doing higher education, one that provided greater freedom for Ontario colleges and presumably greater access for communities to higher education. Coupled with the Post-Secondary Choice and Excellence Act of 2000, which provided colleges the opportunity to offer degrees, the colleges appeared well set for the freedom they sought. With the decentralization of approval for curriculum comes an appearance of greater autonomy and authority at the local level; however, with steering mechanisms of funding, performance indicators, and discourses of the marketplace, globalization and performativity permeating curriculum processes, &quot;freedom&quot; remains strongly tempered. This paper uses Foucauldian and critical discourse analysis as a means of considering power and higher education in Ontario, and the limitations and opportunities for &quot;freedom&quot; within our existing discourses.",

From the results provided by a synonymicity estimation task, it was concluded that, in Spanish, 2 synonymous terms (&quot;morado&quot; and &quot;violeta&quot;) are used to name a category equivalent to the English category &quot;purple.&quot; Three experiments provided information about the colourimetric localization of the 11 Spanish BCCs. Two experiments used monolexemic naming tasks (free and restricted) and a third required the free signalling of prototypes and good exemplars. It was observed that Spanish and British BCCs are essentially equivalents in number and colourimetric delimitation and, therefore, our work can be considered to extend and complement previous research (on English BCCs) insofar as achromatic categories in colour space localization, the links between chromatic and achromatic categories (red and orange have no direct links with achromatic categories), and the dependence of the use of BCCs on lightness are concerned. Lastly, our results indicate the existence of 2 categories that are nearly basic: beige and garnet. (Contains 4 tables, 6 figures, and 1 footnote.)",

In three experiments, we explored this relationship by using a list-method directed-forgetting task (DF) in participants varying in WM capacity. Contrary to predictions, in Experiment 1, DF effects were only found for participants with low WM capacity, whereas high WM capacity participants did not show this effect. This unexpected pattern of results was explained as due to the differential susceptibility to interference of high and low span participants. In Experiments 2 and 3, interference was increased by introducing a memory load between the to-be-forgotten and the to-be-remembered list (Experiment 2) and by increasing the list length (Experiment 3). In these conditions of high interference, the pattern of results was reversed so that DF effects were obtained for the high span group and they were not present for the low span group. The reversal of the effect for the high and low WM capacity group depending on the degree of interference suggests that inhibition in the DF procedure depends on both: the degree of interference experienced by the participants, and the availability of controlled resources.

        "description":"The present research explores whether obtaining semantic negative priming from a single ignored word depends on whether that word is either consciously or unconsciously perceived. On each trial a prime word was briefly displayed and followed either immediately or after a delay by a pattern mask. The mask offset was followed by a probe display containing a single target word that participants were required to either categorize or identify. Participants were instructed to attend to the target while ignoring the prime word. On half of trials the prime-target pairs were highly associated words belonging to the same semantic category, whereas on the remaining half they belonged to different semantic categories. A differential priming pattern as a function of the masking condition was found: Semantic negative priming when the mask presentation was delayed, and positive priming when the prime word was immediately masked, thus preventing its conscious identification. These results suggest that masking type, which supposedly affects prime awareness, would be a critical factor to obtain negative semantic priming from single words. They also provide evidence that perceiving a stimulus with or without awareness can lead to qualitatively different behavioral consequences, which reflect the contribution of controlled and automatic components, respectively.

Groups differed in the context where they received each of the phases (AAA, ABA, and AAB). The context change after  extinction renewed taste aversion, regardless of whether it involved a  return to the conditioning context (ABA), or going to a different context (AAB). In Experiment 2, increasing to 5 the number of extinction trials eliminated renewal in group AAB. Experiment 3 replicated these results within a factorial design. The implications of the differential effect of the amount of extinction on AAB and ABA renewal for a retrieval theory of forgetting are discussed. (Contains 1 table and 3 figures.)",

Regarding the segmentation of artificial synthesized speech, this idea has been supported by experiments with languages where the stress pattern coincides with word boundaries (i.e. English, Finnish and Dutch). In this study, we present data on speech segmentation with native Spanish speakers whose stress pattern would mark the penultimate syllable of words. Results show that to stress the middle syllable of trisyllabic words in an artificial speech stream does not facilitate segmentation as would be predicted. Possible explanations of these results are explored as related to the interaction of statistical and stress cues in speech segmentation. (Contains 1 figure and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"A theoretical advantage of item response theory (IRT) models is that trait estimates based on these models provide more test information than any other type of test score. It is still unclear, however, whether using IRT trait estimates improves external validity results in comparison with the results that can be obtained by using simple raw scores. This paper discusses some methodological results based on the 2-parameter logistic model (2PLM) and is concerned with three issues: first, how validity coefficients based on IRT trait estimates must be interpreted; second, how inferences about these coefficients can be made; and third, which differences in external validity can be expected if the 2PLM is correct for the data and IRT scores are used in place of raw scores. Four empirical examples in the personality domain provided further evidence for the results that can be expected in real research in which the model is, at best, a good approximation to the data. A general result of these examples was that validity coefficients based on IRT scores were similar to those based on raw scores. (Contains 1 figure and 5 tables.)",

Participants were presented with a first visual target stimulus (T1) at fixation and after a delay (either 280 or 1030 ms) a pair of lateralized stimulus occurred (T2). For the dual task and with the 280 delay between T1 and T2, accuracy in the TOJ deteriorated evincing an AB. However, instead of the left favoring asymmetry in normal attention conditions, a significant bias away from the left space emerged during the AB. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)",

Here we present a new method that provides a continuous measure of eye dominance and overcomes limitations of previous procedures. We presented dichoptic streams of randomly selected alphanumeric characters at rates around 5 Hz and asked observers to detect a particular character. In most subjects, the dichoptic streams of letters did not perceptually overlap, instead many participants were never aware that two letters were always presented. Interocular differences in target detection were evident in most observers, thus targets presented to one eye were always detected while targets presented to the other eye were generally missed. These interocular differences (i.e., eye dominance), were normally distributed and showed high test-retest reliability. (Contains 2 figures.)",

A Spatial Stroop task was used to explore whether the long lasting facilitation effect usually found in this task, as well as the typical reduction of Spatial Stroop interference on cued trials (Funes et al., 2003, 2005) is prevented by the presence of distractors. In Experiment 1, the distractor produced a shift towards more negative cuing effects even at the shortest 100 ms SOA, and eliminated the Spatial Stroop by Cueing interaction. In Experiment 2, a larger range of SOAs was introduced, demonstrating further that the negative shift of cueing effects found in Experiment 1 affected all levels of SOA equally. This pattern of results is explained in terms of the event segregation hypothesis. (Contains 5 figures, 2 tables, and 1 footnote.)",

Although symbolic cueing effects have been reliably demonstrated, the underlying mechanisms that produce these effects are not well understood. In two experiments we test the idea that perceptual integration between cue-target pairs mediates symbolic cueing effects. Our findings suggest symbolic cueing effects may not necessarily reflect the orienting power of highly over-learned directional symbols. Rather, symbolic cueing effects are also mediated by relatively recent experiences with coherent cue-target objects during the experimental session. We elaborate on the implications of our findings for conventional explanations of symbolic cueing effects. (Contains 2 figures, 3 tables, and 1 footnote.)",

The true spirit of inquiry and investigation lies in the mind-set that continually asks questions   about a given situation. The author relates that he was brought back to earth by some of his   students when they were discussing these ideas. One of the students commented that topics like Pascal's Triangle, the Fibonacci Sequence, Golden Ratio, etc. must be among the most explored topics in mathematics and are often used for investigations in teaching. How is it possible to come up with any new questions on such topics? An Internet search using Google, for example, gives thousands of hits for each of these phrases.  So, what can possibly be left to investigate? In this article, the author provides several examples of modifying Pascal's Triangle and Fibonacci sequence, and illustrates the point that it does not matter how many previous investigations have been conducted, as long as the information that students are investigating is new to them.",

The examples demonstrate the building of a range of important mathematical ideas by modelling life-related situations using students' informal and intuitive knowledge. Over several years, ideas such as dependency, continuity, gradient, and function can be gradually formalised. Students are modelling life-related situations with functional relationships and representing the relationships in a variety of forms--tables, graphs, equations--and in everyday language. As students work with more complex functions, the need for syntactic manipulations of terms in symbolic equations arises and can be introduced in the context of the situation being modelled. Students can also be introduced to the use of technology in the forms of graphics calculators, CAS calculators, and spreadsheets as they work with functional models.",

The objective of the paper is to define the software architecture for a coherent framework and methodology for enhancing existing web services into an integrated system. This document presents the research work that has been done so far in this aspect by applying the proposed architecture for system integration in the academic field. The basics concepts used are Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), as the most commonly used approaches to information systems integration lately. SOA is an Information Technology (IT) architectural style that supports the transformation of businesses into a set of linked services, or repeatable business tasks that can be accessed when needed over a network. This may be a local network, it may be the Internet, or it may be geographically and technologically diverse, combining services in New York, Paris, and Beijing as though they were all installed on a local desktop. These services can coalesce to accomplish a specific business task, enabling businesses to adapt quickly to changing conditions and requirements. (Contains 6 figures.)",

The influences from inside the academia are being discussed, together with analyzing their positive or not so positive effect on the variables related to academic capital. The model of intellectual capital, thoroughly discussed in literature, is being adapted to this particular situation, of a university in the situation of &quot;leasing&quot; its academic capital for the sake of academic capitalism. The tensions between the two concepts are underlined, in a framework which, being applicable to every university, relies on data collected from a Romanian economic university.

Personal interviews and workshops were also conducted with respondents to understand the behavioural changes and results seen in the work environment. The study brought out the need to understand the training evaluation as a continuous process, requiring periodic review and analysis of the needs of the various sectors of rural development. It reiterated the need to develop a systematic evaluation process within the institution. It also showed that the rural development professionals undergoing training themselves were keen to participate in the evaluation process so as to help in the process of self-learning and bring about sustainable changes.

We found that the designed exams have suitable coefficients of validity and reliability. The level of difficulty of exams was high. No significant relationship was found between male and female instructors in terms of the coefficient of validity and reliability but a significant difference between the difficulty level in male and female instructors was found (P less than 0.001). It means that female instructors had designed more difficult questions.

Five hypotheses were proposed. The results revealed that inadequate funding; inadequate school facilities, work overload and poor conditions of service generated administrative stress for principals.

Such articles comprise a small subset of the voluminous research on student evaluations of teaching (SETs). In this diverse literature, research methods and aims have frequently affected the outcomes and conclusions, since SETs are typically context-specific instruments whose results, in isolated instances, do not generalize well. Thus this review questions the very generalizability of the massive and often contradictory SET-related literature on the leniency hypothesis and argues that future research must be designed and carried out in light of the implicit problems existing in the majority of earlier studies.",

To this end, a Likert-type questionnaire was administered to 635 teachers working in Turkish schools out of a 875-person sample.

As a result of the analysis, the most striking finding is that transformational leadership has a profound impact on teachers' job satisfaction, while the transformational leadership of the principal directly and, through teachers' job satisfaction, indirectly affects the school health.

Minority students who are gifted and have the potential to achieve at higher levels are being denied opportunities to participate in gifted education for numerous reasons. This position is followed by examples of such ills and recommendations that support and build upon those provided by Robinson to solve or resolve problems associated with the unnecessary competition between excellence and equity and between gifted education and diversity. I think that the different positions held by Robinson and myself both point to one central question: \"How can schools provide all young people with certain basics that are necessary to their common citizenship and, at the same time, give them the diverse opportunities and treatment that their differential abilities require?\" (Gardner, 1984, p. 89).",

Robinson's concerns that redress to inequities has been at the expense of a particular subgroup of gifted students are serious. The concerns should spark an important discussion within the field of gifted education and should be an impetus for further examination of the long-term consequences of short-term efforts to achieve equity. As Robinson noted, we may not be achieving equity for any group when we engage in educationally unsound decision making. While the interpretations that Robinson offered of the responses to gifted students and gifted programs are well grounded, I would like to offer some expanded thinking on several of the interpretations she put forward, present some alternative observations and interpretations, and raise related questions about our assumptions in the field of gifted education--and in the field of education, in general--that may have led us astray. I would first like to separate the responses to the equity issues that Robinson has identified as negative--the elimination of self-contained classrooms and the ever-increasing alternative strategies for identifying students from underserved populations--because I see the genesis of these movements resting in different spheres.",

        "description":"In this article, I present a framework that can be used in our work with special groups of gifted students--one that recognizes the effects of socioeconomic status (SES), racism, and other limiting factors on educational achievement and provides a blueprint for interventions. This framework stems from Urie Bronfrenbrenner's ecological theory of development and emphasizes the role of social support systems in the development of talent. I then argue that two important reasons to retain a strong focus on programs that serve minority students include the fact that the gap in achievement between minority and nonminority children is pervasive and exists even at high socioeconomic levels and that minority students' underachievement is largely attributable to cultural factors within our society.",

However, defining giftedness as high academic performance based on traditional assessment procedures could reverse the field's fledgling success in supporting culturally diverse gifted children and youth. Changing the focus of equity in gifted education to economic representation will not decrease educators' responsibility to understand the learning needs of racially, culturally, and linguistically diverse students. Nevertheless, a focus on children of poverty with high potential is a worthy and achievable goal and will require extraordinary commitment.",

Factor analysis indicated 6 factors (School Reputation, General School State, Staff Attitudes, Responsiveness to Change, General Perceptions of the School, and Administration Responsiveness), accounting for 42% of the variance. Reliability estimates of the factors ranged from a low of 0.76 (Responsiveness to Change) to a high of 0.94 (School Reputation and SCI Total Scale Score).

Given this context, this study sought to examine 48 middle school content-area teachers' beliefs about teaching in diverse classrooms to determine how these beliefs affected their willingness and capacity to differentiate their instruction and assessment. A qualitative study design incorporating grounded theory methodology (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Strauss & Corbin, 1990) was employed. Four teacher beliefs emerged from interview, observation, and document data that conflict with the philosophy undergirding differentiation. Each belief is presented with supporting evidence from the data and discussed in terms of its relationship to effective differentiated classroom practices. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Everybody is doing it: differentiating curriculum to make it deeper, broader, parallel, and more complex. No longer the private property of gifted specialists, differentiation is now a democratic pursuit of classroom teachers, curriculum specialists, and anyone else who subscribes to \"Educational Leadership.\" In an era of competency-based tests that seek to measure schools and students on the lowest common denominator--\"Who knows their basic skills?\"--differentiation has become a beacon of hope for learners who require more than just the same old stuff. Like any bandwagon, though, differentiation needs to be noted as one piece in the very big puzzle of educational improvement. Without shifts in some related and relevant areas, however, differentiation is just another panacea that is no more likely to improve the school experience for gifted children than is changing one spark plug on an eight-cylinder car in hopes that the car's overall performance will improve. Yet, the author believes there is hope when it comes to \"doing\" differentiation appropriately. He states that proper differentiation of curriculum demands more than \"doing\": it also requires Heart, Outlook, Procedures, and Expectations (HOPE) that differ substantially from what are now accepted as adequate.",

        "author":["Cross, Tracy L."],
        "description":"Every fall, approximately 300 gifted adolescents descend on the Ball State University campus to attend the Indiana Academy for Science, Mathematics, and Humanities (the Academy). The Academy is a state-funded residential school for academically gifted junior and senior high school aged students. It draws its students from across the state, creating a very diverse community of high-ability learners. The students come from over 120 high schools and the transition for the 160 juniors new to the Academy is always difficult. The staff of the school prepare for the onset of counseling and adjustment problems, bringing to bear a great deal of expertise and commitment. For years, the pattern has been that earliest concerns the Academy counseling staff must attend to revolve around homesickness, minor adjustment problems, roommate concerns, and then, midterms. This pattern was being observed again this year until September 11, 2001. Immediately thereafter, the pattern changed. Like most Americans (and the people of many other countries), Academy students were traumatized. A big difference this year was in the school's ability to provide effective counseling services given the fact that the adults at the Academy were very upset as well. Shock, worry, doubt, and fear were all visible in both the student and the adult faces. The need to provide a safe environment for the students may have been what enabled the school to carry on and the adults to begin the healing process themselves. This article describes what the recent tragedy taught--to deal with all people as human beings first, then applying appropriate counseling services based on the needs of the individual hold great promise for guiding the social and emotional development of gifted students.",

        "author":["Melnick, Samantha"],
        "description":"Any girl who watches TV or listens to the radio is bombarded not only with negative stereotypes of females, but also with the message that the most important qualities to possess are physical and aesthetic. From where, then, are girls supposed to derive positive role models? The author began asking herself this question two years ago as an eighth grader at Tenafly Middle School in Tenafly, New Jersey, when she participated in R.O.G.A.T.E., or Resources Offered for Gifted and Talented Education. Her hypothesis was that fictional characters in literary works can be positive role models for adolescent females. She knew she wanted to research a topic relating to books, as reading had always been one of her favorite pastimes. As a 14-year-old girl on the cusp between childhood and adolescence, she also felt that her research should be aimed at teenaged girls, because after all, that was what she was. Thus, after months of reading, interviewing, surveying, analyzing, and interpreting, she finally reached a conclusion. From the evidence she gathered, she inferred that her hypothesis is valid and truthful. Fictional characters that display good qualities and traits, such as honesty, bravery, creativity, and kindness, can teach the girls who read about them to possess these same qualities in their own lives. These characters also deal with issues and conflicts that are widespread and common to almost all teenage girls, making them personages to whom girls can easily relate. The applications of her research are very effective and easy to practice, and her findings can pertain to classroom strategies. Teachers need to assign girls to read, either in-class or for summer reading, books that contain positive role models. Parents should do the same in providing their daughters with these same types of books. The most vital application, however, is on a large-scale: there must be a change in media content, and this alteration must be a radical one in order to try to repair some ofthe damage that has already been done. Those who can bring about change consist of children's book editors, movie and television producers, and radio announcers and advertisers.",

        "description":"This paper presents two separate and contrasting &quot;opinion pieces&quot; on the subject of multiple intelligence. Over the past few years, James Delisle has become more and more bold in his attacks on Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) and Joseph Renzulli's Schoolwide Enrichment Model (SEM). He has made numerous presentations at state and national conferences and written articles claiming that Gardner and Renzulli have advocated that all children are gifted and that services to identify gifted children have been diluted or eliminated as a result. Thus, Terri Bawden challenges Delisle to provide a single reference to substantiate his claim that Renzulli says one must produce a product to be gifted. Rather, Renzulli's programming model emphasizes product development and service-oriented activities as &quot;vehicles&quot; through which gifts and talents are manifested and nurtured. Bawden states that Delisle's strong accusations and misrepresentations are simplistic and naive. Perhaps some school districts have misinterpreted these theories and implemented them poorly, but these esteemed scholars should not be blamed for the trivialization of their ideas. In contrast, James R. Delisle states that Bawden presents a weak rebuttal to his views that is more defensive in tone than it is instructive, providing little depth and even less original analysis. He states that it is fine to champion Bawden's beliefs, but to be blind sighted by the ideas that SEM practices or MI theory can compensate for the lack of a definable, separate gifted program is preposterous, naive, simplistic, and groundless. Bawden should realize that MI and SEM are partial solutions to the full-time issue of how to serve the intellectual and emotional needs of children whose abilities and insights far surpass the typical.",

        "author":["Robinson, Ann"],
        "description":"Empirical research on the philosophies, beliefs, and actions of school administrators such as principals or superintendents toward talented students is largely nonexistent in the published literature. What little is known suggests that administrators are crucial, but that advocates of services for high-ability learners need to carry the message more effectively to school leaders. While the knowledge base on the understanding and support of the school administrator for specialized services for talented youth is limited, the general literature on school leadership asserts the importance of the role of the building principal as an instructional leader. According to VanTassel-Baska (1995), the curriculum is a key feature in the development of talents. If the curriculum is the key and the school administrator is to be the instructional leader, then principals are crucial players in providing opportunities to talented youth. Landrum and Callahan (2001) noted that administrators are an important audience for their professional development efforts in gifted education. Informed administrators are more supportive of teachers engaged in differentiated instruction and are more likely to make decisions with positive outcomes for high-ability learners. This article presents the collaboration story of the Arkansas Association of Gifted Education Administrators (AAGEA), a specialized professional organization formed in 1992 to provide a home for gifted program administrators.

        "description":"Maximum academic achievement for gifted and talented students can only be accomplished when teachers are given the tools, support, and training needed to strengthen instructional skills and develop knowledge of the social and emotional needs of the students they serve. Providing meaningful professional development to develop or enhance these skills is a challenge for administrators responsible for the planning and implementation of training experiences for teachers of gifted students. As Dettmer (1998) wrote, &quot;Educators are lifelong learners who continue studying their content areas and honing their instructional skills long after they complete the teacher preparation program&quot;. She added that, unfortunately, staff development tends to be regarded by too many educators as &quot;irrelevant, time wasteful, poorly presented, and lacking in follow-up assistance&quot;. Therefore, in spite of the importance of professional development, teachers do not always accept mandated in-service sessions with enthusiasm. Research by Joyce and Showers (1988) indicated that all teachers can learn powerful and complex teaching strategies if they participate in well-designed staff development. As a result, planners of professional development must investigate models and designs that can provide educators with a variety of worthwhile opportunities to enhance their knowledge and skills. When professional development experiences are meaningful and transferable, the knowledge and skills attained will lead to enhanced teaching practices, resulting in quality instruction for gifted and talented students.

        "description":"Harriet Bishop (HB) Elementary School opened in 1996 with an articulated educational model developed collaboratively by the teachers, parents, and the administration. The model includes a mission, set of beliefs, and rationale for the instructional design. While nearly every school district or school has a formal mission, the statements articulated for HB are taken seriously. To support the mission, the students learn through an integrated curriculum using strategies such as differentiated instruction, curriculum compacting, and multiage learning. Teachers at HB are expected to meet the unique needs, interests, abilities, and learning rates, styles, and patterns of all students, from the most challenged to the most capable learners. HB is an elementary school of 700 students assigned to grade K-2, K-4, 1-3, 1-4, 3-6, or 5-6 communities, which are each located around a shared team center. Students remain with their teacher and classmates for 2 years. Because of the multiage communities, the students and staff are comfortable working within disciplines across grade levels. HB adopted the Schoolwide Enrichment Model to help meet the individual needs of students and develop student talent. Enrichment clusters, one component of the model, provide challenging, self-selected, real-world learning for all students. Enrichment clusters allow multiage groups of students who share common interests to select courses of study from an extensive list of offerings, such as \"The Society of Student Statisticians,\" \"The Sports Medicine Institute,\" and \"Young Artists Guild.\" Enrichment clusters have been used successfully at HB since the school opened. In this article, the authors describe the factors that have contributed to HB's success from the perspective of the principal and the consultant who provided the original training to the staff.",

        "description":"Most teachers have attended countless workshops that advocated new teaching methods, materials, or techniques in addressing special student populations. They politely listen as a series of presenters enthusiastically introduce their information in written and verbal form. They return to the classroom, fully intending to use their new skills, but perhaps feeling a bit anxious about their actual applications and ensuing results. This author believes that teachers, like students, must be both physically and mentally involved in the learning process for it to be successful and meaningful. As a former elementary school teacher who is working toward an endorsement in gifted education, the author had the opportunity to participate in the 2003 Baylor University Interdisciplinary Creative Problem Solving Conference. Rather than sitting passively and absorbing information presented, she actively participated in the creation and implementation of an interdisciplinary approach to curricular design based upon a creative problem-solving model. She found the experience invaluable because she physically and mentally progressed through the steps of interdisciplinary curricular design and watched them come alive. The primary purpose of the annual conference is to provide gifted secondary students with a forum to interact and address real-life problems while participating in a problem-solving curriculum (M. Witte, personal communication, June 4, 2003). However, the conference also provides teachers of the gifted with an opportunity to interact, design a curriculum, and implement it using the problem-solving process. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Yet, the research is neither extensive nor recent, especially pertaining to the role of the elementary administrator of schools for gifted learners. This article presents two different views on the role of the elementary school administrator shared by two principals of private and public schools. Both principals were asked to respond to a series of interview questions that would lead to a better understanding of the skills, competencies, and characteristics necessary in their role as principals of elementary schools for gifted learners. Some of the topics covered include the unique skills needed to run the school, meeting the needs of gifted learners, what to look for when hiring a teacher, the role of parents, challenges of the position, and advice to other administrators. A \"Final Thoughts\" section allows the principals an opportunity to reflect upon what they had written and provides a forum to express, without structured questions, the importance of their role and the impact they have had on gifted children.

        "description":"Parents, classroom teachers, and teachers of the gifted cannot be all things to the young people in their charge. The nature and diversity of gifted students' interests demand resources beyond the confines of the school and sometimes beyond the confines of the community. These demands demonstrate the need for mentors and other resources. One of the fastest growing areas of mentoring is telementoring, also known as virtual mentoring, e-mentoring (Nash, 2001), or iMentoring (Buery, n.d.). The general goal of most telementoring programs is to provide individualized academic, motivational, and emotional support by using technology to bring adults into children's school experiences. This article describes telementoring, enumerates some of its unique advantages over traditional mentoring, and discusses its benefits for teachers. (Contains 1 table.)",

This article, both in its texture and its analysis, demonstrates that reported discourse must be regarded, and taught, as more than a simple set of surface conventions, but differently--as a resource for student writers simultaneously to be read as insiders (to harness the power provided through academic discourse), and to maintain outsider status and perspectives (to push at the constraints of academic discourse). Several intertwining metaphors and theories will be used to illustrate these seemingly paradoxical desires, including musical composition, mental illness, and queerness. These representations help this essay find its tonic as a call for contesting coercive conventions. (Contains 5 notes.)",

We taught a functional grammar that featured what words do in sentences, rather than what words are called and how they are defined, to two sections of tenth graders while another teacher taught grammar identification-definition-description. Students completed a grammar test and submitted writing samples prior to, and following, the five-week treatment. Functional grammar students scored essentially the same as IDD students on the grammar test and in mechanical accuracy. However, they scored significantly better than IDD students in a holistic rating of writing. There can be a positive interaction between grammar instruction and writing performance if the grammar is functional and used for writing purposes. (Contains 4 tables and 2 notes.)",

        "description":"Several states have now implemented policies restricting basic writers' access to four-year universities, and the students most likely to be affected are African American, Latino, and nonnative English speakers. The pressure to speed students' mastery of standard written English, along with the trend toward more explicit instruction in second language pedagogy, has resulted in a renewed interest in teaching grammar. While some of these recommendations claim that standard written English can be taught as one code among many, used for certain rhetorical situations, such approaches may not prove more inclusive when the syntactic features of academic writing are presented as relatively benign choices, nor do they adequately explain the different ways we process spoken and written texts. This article describes an approach using open-ended games to help activate the switch all writers must make, regardless of home language, when they shift from spoken word to print text.

        "description":"The degree to which the lives of America's gay youth have improved over the past decade is staggering. In no small part due to frequent exposure to gay issues and gay people in the popular media, there is greater acceptance of differences in sexual orientation, and in many communities youth can access one of hundreds of gay student associations that have sprouted up across the country. But the challenges to many gay teens are still daunting. Especially for those in small, rural or conservative school districts, life can be riddled with complexities that are often far more stressful than those of their straight peers. Students who are out, rumored to be gay, or simply deemed to exhibit stereotypically gay behavior or interests are sometimes victimized in varying degrees, from verbal harassment to physical violence. At the very least, these students are often marginalized in the fickle and sometimes ruthless high school social scene, many of whom are also dealing with the anxiety of deciding whether or not to come out to family or friends. College counselors play a major role in helping students in their college search. A first step for college counselors is embracing the fact that it would be extremely unlikely for there not to be gay students at their institution, no matter the school's location, makeup or culture. This article lists some questions that may help gay students in learning more about the colleges and universities they are considering and discusses how college counselors can help their gay students.",

This article, based on the earlier discussion, examines the question of CUNY's multiple identities within the legacy of Shaughnessy, who coined the term &quot;basic writing&quot; and founded the Journal of Basic Writing in 1975. Composition theory and practice owe much to Shaughnessy's work at CUNY's City College in the 1970s against the backdrop of the University's experiment with Open Admissions. Although much has changed since then, CUNY is still associated with that rich historical moment, and with the questions Shaughnessy and others at the time confronted. These questions, which grapple with the very nature of literacy and democracy, need to be reframed for our times. Contributors to this article include scholars from a number of CUNY's 17 undergraduate colleges, each of whom begins with a quotation selected to focus attention on an issue of relevance today.",

Our primary purpose in this article is to describe the design of the SWW Program, which we envision as a Seamless Support model of instruction. In this model, basic writing students receive extra support in the form of integrated writing workshop and tutoring sessions. SWW sections of composition have the same objectives and requirements as non-SWW sections and award the same credit, enabling basic writers to progress towards completion of the Composition I and Composition II sequence in two semesters. Now in its eleventh year, the SWW Program has proven to be successful in terms of the way its students compare with their cohorts in the areas of retention and graduation rates, and overall GPAs. While further research, including more thorough qualitative analysis, needs to be done, it is our hope that the success of this model can be used to inform the ongoing conversations about the future of basic writing in the academy.",

        "author":["Graziano-King, Janine"],
        "description":"In an effort to assess student writing in a way that reflects current views of writing (i.e., as a social process supported by the interaction of a number of cognitive sub-processes), and yet still seeks to determine what students can do independently, it has become a common practice to include timed essays in student portfolios. However, this practice adds to the already heavy cognitive load, identified by Hamp-Lyons and Condon, that the assessment of portfolios places on readers. Here, I suggest an alternative method of assessment--the self-revised essay. The self-revised essay requires that students, at the beginning of the semester, write an essay in response to a prompt that reflects a theme that runs through course texts and discussions. Then, throughout the semester, students revisit, reflect on, and revise their essays three more times, with all reflections and revisions taking place in class. The result is a multi-drafted essay, written independently, but informed by course texts, class discussions, and instructor and peer feedback on other essays written for the class. As an assessment tool, it offers the best of both worlds--like the portfolio, it reflects current views of writing, and, like the timed essay, it allows readers to have full confidence that students are the sole authors of their work. Further, it does both without placing on readers an overwhelming cognitive load that might compromise the assessment process.",

        "description":"The risk posed by explicit instruction in composition is that the reduction of writing to stock moves and effective devices may diminish the writer's agency and guarantee reproduction of the teacher's. The advantage of explicit instruction is power: overt and recursive attention to selected strategies can help students imagine the public agency the instruction itself may temporarily suspend. This study argues that growth in student writing can follow from replacing problem-solving assignments (based on the problem-solving strategies found in \"Freakonomics\") with rhetorical-analysis assignments. In this latter kind of assignment, the four features of explicit instruction that this study found empowering are (1) paying attention to how published writers frame problems; (2) labeling the framing move as a rhetorical design on readers; (3) weighing the effects of such designs on readers; and, in a rhetorical analysis of \"Freakonomics,\" (4) rewriting an already-framed problem. Such instruction is necessarily preliminary to, but also part of, reflective inquiry into the ethics of the conventions, practices, and aims of teaching and learning academic writing.",

        "description":"During the fall 2005 semester, an eighth grade teacher in a Laramie, Wyoming, middle school made an urgent plea for more progressive tools for a beginning computers course. Janet Johnson, a veteran teacher returning to the classroom after a hiatus of 10 years, was frustrated with the apparent lack of motivation and engagement by the students. She knew the existing curricular materials were outdated and &quot;mind numbing&quot; and was seeking methods more relevant to this generation. In response, the school district decided to try a radical departure by helping Ms. Johnson implement a pilot curriculum built around a commercially available video game. The project was conducted as a pilot to design a unit plan supported and anchored by a video game simulation. Albany County School District in Laramie, Wyoming, has begun to take a hard look at whether teachers' techniques are sufficiently up to date for today's learners and whether the teachers know how to integrate new tools to motivate students. This article describes a pilot project to integrate commercially available video games (games that are not primarily intended as learning tools but have inherent learning value, sometimes referred to as &quot;edutainment&quot; games) into a middle school curriculum to hold students' interest and capitalize on their strengths, while continuing to meet standards.

The study was designed specifically to consider the potency of a number of mathematical affective factors, as well as background characteristics (viz., gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status), on children's mathematics performance. Data were collected by surveying the children and drawing on performance ratings from their teachers. A correlation analysis revealed that the relationships between the respective dispositional and background variables with mathematics performance were significant and in the direction as predicted. Moreover, the findings from a logistic regression showed that a combination of these variables was able to appropriately classify students who either were below-average or above-average mathematics performers. We pay particular attention to the influence of certain dispositions with respect to mathematics performance and conclude by detailing the implications of the study for teachers and researchers.

The study was motivated by a desire to fill a gap existing in the literature in relation to teachers' attitudes towards proofs. Thirty-four secondary school mathematics teachers' responses to a Likert type questionnaire and interviews were summarised using the five themes of utility, positive attitudes, methods of proof, negative attitudes, and suitability of level of students to perform proofs. The teachers expressed neutral attitudes on technology as a method of proof and disagreed that verbal proof was a valid method for proving the viability of mathematical claims. The implications of the results are discussed using the context of Zimbabwean classrooms with a view to promote debate on how teachers could implement learner-centred reform.

Built on a reciprocal relation theory from the research literature, this investigation is designed to examine models of student self-concept and mathematics achievement during the political transition. Along with a perceived \"brain drain\" from the population migration, there was a non-monotonic change in the reciprocal relationship between self-concept and mathematics achievement. In addition, indicators of mathematics achievement and self-concept have demonstrated different linkages to the permanent emigration of Hong Kong residents with valued or desirable skills and qualifications. Interpretation of these empirical findings entails a need of enhancing cross-cultural understanding in mathematics education. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)",

Introduced at a press conference in Washington, D.C., in December 2004, and endorsed by the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor, the standards are framed around 10 key elements for successful, sustained implementation of academies.

Virtual Enterprises (VE) International is a high school career and technical education (CTE) program that teaches students about business by having a class create and operate its own virtual firm. In the VE network, there are many different types of firms--including law offices, insurance companies, specialty bicycle shops, and even a hotel in Cancun, Mexico. Students are employees of their firms, making decisions on which products to sell, how to market them, how to determine salaries, and so on. Advocates of CTE reform argue that CTE programs must be academically rigorous and technically relevant, and extend learning outside of school in order to better prepare students for both careers and college. By using a project-based, collaborative learning model, this program teaches students about business and technology through task-oriented coursework. In some VE firms, students also study an applied economics curriculum, thereby linking the business enterprise to an academic subject required for high school graduation, and increasing the rigor of the course. The program also integrates experiences outside of the school with classroom learning, offering students opportunities to participate in weekend career workshops, internships, city and national competitions, and college courses.",

An important missing piece in the literature is how the concerns of experienced teachers differ from those cited by beginning teachers. Based on previous research, this study compares beginning and experienced teachers' concerns with respect to managing classroom behavior, dealing with time constraints and work load, parent interactions, and academic preparation. This paper examines these complex relationships by comparing a national sample of beginning teachers to a national cross-section of experienced teachers to ascertain if beginning teachers' concerns diminish with experience. Significant differences were found on the Classroom Management and Parent Interaction scales while no differences were found on the Academic Preparation and Time Management scales. This study points to a number of issues important to teacher educators responsible for preparing candidates for initial certification as well as to school district personnel responsible for mentoring new teachers and strengthening professional development for in-service teachers.

Only 75 Universities are available to cater to this population with one University for 1,866,000 people. The inability of the available Universities in Nigeria to cope with the high demand for University education has put much pressure on University admissions. In order to satisfy some interests the Government of Nigeria adopted such admission policies as the quota system, catchment areas, backwardness factor, and discriminatory fees. Following the observed fall in the standards of University education in Nigeria it is speculated that the admission policies are responsible for the situation. To confirm this an opinion survey involving 384 respondents sampled from eight (8) Universities in the South-South zone of Nigeria was conducted. An instrument known as &quot;Admission Policies and Effect on University Education Quality (APEUEQ)&quot; was used for gathering data after validation. The correlation coefficient reliability of the instrument was found to be 0.73. The chi-square data analysis method was applied. The finding showed that all the parameters of interest have contributed to the reduction of the quality of University education in Nigeria. The paper recommended a complete review of the admission policies and the establishment of more universities to meet the increasing demand for university education. (Contains 16 tables.)",

        "description":"In 2003, a study of two Canadian adult literacy programs included 37 learners who revealed a variety of reasons for having dropped out of school as teenagers and younger adults. Chief among these were the influences of parents, siblings, and peers both in and out of school. This article considers these research findings, in light of the educational literature, as a catalyst for recommending ways that high school administrators, counselors, and teachers can (1) make students' families and out-of-school friends feel comfortable with the school setting, (2) teach students' parents and guardians how to support their children's educational efforts, and (3) teach students how to engage in positive interactions with peers.",

Study 1 involved 156 professionals. They represent 80% of the population of professionals who provide on-campus disability support services. Results indicate that (1) 8% of postsecondary institutions reported not having any students with disabilities, (2) overall, 2% of students are registered to receive disability related services from their postsecondary institutions, and (3) this varies from 1/2% to 6% across the country. Junior/community colleges had a higher percentage of students with disabilities registered to receive disability related services (3 3/4%) than universities (1 2/3%). (4) Distance education had 3%. (5) Quebec has a smaller proportion of both college (2/3% vs 6%) and university (1/2% vs 2 1/2%) students with disabilities than the rest of Canada. A targeted study involving 46 professionals who provide disability related services in Quebec's public junior/community colleges, the CEGEPs, revealed that lack of recognition of learning disabilities for postsecondary funding by the Quebec government is an important contributor to the small percentages, although it cannot explain the huge discrepancies between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Extrapolation suggests that there are over 100,000 students with disabilities currently enrolled in Canadian postsecondary education, although only 1/4 to 1/2 of them register to receive disability related services.

A sample of 983 first year students completed the Academic Motivation Inventory (Tremblay, 1998) and agreed to provide final grades; 537 students were randomly assigned to participate in the program, while the remainder served as a control group. Mentored students who continued to participate mid-way through the second semester had significantly higher final grades than did students in the control group. There was no effect on retention from year one to year two, however data are being collected on retention and grades for all groups for the length of their undergraduate careers. Students high in anxiety in the mentored group showed achievement comparable to that of low anxiety program participants, whereas students in the control group with high anxiety scored significantly worse on achievement than did their low anxiety counterparts.

We contend that a shift in our understanding of curriculum design to accommodate learner-centeredness will provide the framework for preparing graduates for a lifetime of learning. Learner-centered curriculum proposes to create highly developed individuals, providing them the skills to continue creating learning experiences, digest current knowledge, and create new knowledge within the curriculum itself. Curriculum characteristics, as identified in the curriculum design project presented here, include content appropriate to the characteristics of a new society. It also includes all that is required of a curriculum in order for it to be transparent and easily understood as the scaffolding of learning. This definition of a learner-centered curriculum includes components that educators deem to be relevant and vital for students. It adds curriculum processes and required outcomes to prepare students for curriculum creation alongside educators.",

        "author":["Lang, Daniel W."],
        "description":"Mergers have been a frequent phenomenon in higher education in the last quarter century. The conventional wisdom is that mergers are undertaken mainly for economic reasons, either to expand markets or to reduce costs. About four out of five college or university mergers survive. In the for-profit sector the comparable rate is closer to two out of five. From this one might conclude that the future for mergers among colleges and universities is robust. If, however, the principal purpose of mergers is economic efficiency, there logically ought to be a point beyond which the efficacy of merger will begin to decline. There is, however, another motive for merger, which is unrelated to economic efficiency. Mergers can produce greater diversity of programs and services, both among individual colleges and universities and within systems of postsecondary education. If diversification is the primary purpose of merger, the future might look different and might depend on new ways of identifying peers and partners for merger. This essay examines the expectations that are held for mergers, the realism of those expectations, and the means by which partners in mergers are identified and selected. It concludes with the suggestions that diversification may replace efficiency as the main stimulus of merger, and that, as the choice is made between efficiency and merger, institutions and systems of postsecondary education may try other, less permanent, forms of inter-institutional cooperation before committing to merge.",

Drawing upon the contents of a reflective journal, the author provides an inside view of a first project, making connections between theory and practice.

Particularly in countries like Australia, Canada, and the Asia Pacific nations, as a relatively new field, counseling is taking up the challenges of encouraging a research culture that can both critique and support clinical practice and counselor education. This paper is thus written to support novice counselor researchers, and to inspire an emerging research culture through sharing formative experiences and lessons learned during a qualitative research project exploring minority issues in counseling.",

Methods include semi-structured and informal interviews with elders and family members, semi-structured interviews with local health care providers and Khmer physicians, and participant observation of everyday life and actions specific to health beliefs and behaviors. Data reveal a reliance on traditional medical ideology for understanding and treating illnesses. Utilizing a traditional ideology, Khmer elders rely heavily on traditional treatments and use Western biomedicine as supplements or adjuncts to traditional preventive and curative practices. This research has important implications for health care providers who treat SEA elders, especially for diet and treatment of chronic illnesses often associated with aging populations.

Consequently, high attrition rates characterize the first 3 years of teaching, underscoring a need to provide better support for beginning teachers. This investigation sought to answer the following question: How are 1st-year teachers supported during induction and how do they respond to this support? Four 1st-year elementary teachers participated in a year-long case-study investigation. Primary form of data collection was monthly semi-structured phone interviews. Participants faced similar challenges, while adjusting to their new profession, but received varied, often inadequate, forms of support  during their 1st year. The results suggest that rather than identifying the prevalence of induction support, future research should endeavor to assess program quality and guide educators in the provision of valuable induction for new teachers.

Reconciling dichotomous experiences at work was the label used to capture participants' core   experiences and indicated that while participants' simultaneous positive and negative experiences contributed to a sense of concomitant stress and well-being, they employed  various strategies to maintain a balance between positive experiences/well-being and negative experiences/stress.

Children between the ages of 9 and 12 from high-conflict  separated or divorced families participated in a study that examined how family and community interactions promote resilient behaviour. Substantive-level theory gained from this study yielded that children from separated or divorced, high-conflict families exhibit resilient characteristics when family cohesion is used to incorporate additional family support systems, particularly stepparents and extended family members. External support systems, particularly peers, augment these resilient characteristics. In order to build resilience in pre-teen children parents need to encourage relationships with external and internal support systems. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Social support manifestations seemed predominantly superficial and did not appear to involve complex reciprocal relationships, however, when reciprocal resident tasks were observed, they appeared to have significant value and were sources of pride for the residents. Facility behaviors and policies required by governmental mandates appeared to result in significant resident dependency, a situation that mitigates against significant social support.

Significant positive correlations were found between \"extraversion\" and metaphors for acoustics, play/sport and economy, furthermore between \"openness to experience\" and metaphors for acoustics, container, battle, illness. A positive correlation was also found between \"openness to experience\" and metaphor frequency. Significant negative correlations were found between \"conscientiousness\" and metaphors for illness.

Accessing and modifying psycholinguistic mechanisms, links language frames to changes in behavior within the context of motivational profiling.

Qualitative data change from static into dynamic measures of motivational changes. Linguistic cause-effect mechanisms dramatically enhance the results and meaning of qualitative research methods, resulting in new applications for behavioral engineering, including opinion polling, persuasive marketing campaigns, individual psychotherapy and executive performance coaching.

However, the confrontation is risky since, instead of making the patient ready for a change, it may strengthen resistance against the diagnosis of addiction and the treatment recommendations. We will explore the role of laughter in confrontational practices. The study is based on conversation analysis of group therapy sessions in an inpatient addiction treatment clinic in Finland (7.5 hours of data altogether). The laughter prevails in three different kinds of practice: laughing off the troubles, strengthening the confrontation by laughing at the patient, and ameliorating the confrontation. Laughter is a flexible device for preventing or resolving the possible risks of confrontation. (Contains 6 footnotes.)",

Statistical explanations do not explain anything in terms of the actual behavior at issue and do not lead to subsequent interventions about the motivated choices for a target group.

Twelve experienced physiotherapy practitioners participated in this research. Using hermeneutic phenomenology enabled access to a phenomenon that is often subconscious and provided a means of interpreting participants' experiences of personal learning journeys. Within the philosophy underpinning hermeneutic phenomenology, researchers need to design a research strategy that flows directly from the research question and goals of the research project.

        "description":"This inquiry examined graduate students' and preservice teachers' e-mail communication as they made decisions about supporting the instructional needs of children at-risk in a community of practice summer literacy camp. The correspondence gradually evolved from impersonal to interpersonal communication over a ten-week time span, and influenced the preservice teachers' responses. Seven themes were identified in the graduate students' messages that ranged from questioning and complaining to promoting collaboration. The study illuminates the developmental stages of interpersonal relationships and demonstrates the reciprocal nature of interactive dialogue through the medium of e-mail communication. Conclusions are that long-term e-mail exchanges can facilitate quality relationships and provide a venue for educators to share thoughts, seek advice, and discuss teaching achievements and problems.

Six pre-service teachers who took a course in educational technology applications for secondary grades at a Rocky Mountain region mid-sized university were selected to be interviewed. Phenomenological data analysis was used to analyze the interview data. The interviewees' perceptions of the asynchronous online discussions centered around purposes, group size, tools for learning, advantages/disadvantages, and the instructor's role. The findings of this study provide instructors with helpful information on how students perceive asynchronous online discussion and also provide instructors with possible interventions to enhance students' motivations for participating in asynchronous online discussion.

However, the number of Latinas/os in chemistry is not proportional to their population; they are noticeably absent from the physical science fields. Little research has explored the circumstances that Latino students encounter in high school chemistry. In this exploratory study, four Mexican American students and one Native American student were interviewed and observed in a physical science class at an alternative school that enrolled predominantly Latino students. Five underlying themes were found: negative perceptions of science, benefits and disadvantages of alternative school science, traditional teaching methods versus student-centered teaching, outreach possibilities, and changes in stereotypes of scientists. A further investigation and more in-depth contextual knowledge is needed in order to determine more precisely what caused the students to have their opinions on physical science.

The purpose of the research was to explore the personal understanding of the changes that occur during the midlife period. A qualitative case study was implemented to ascertain how women of the Latter-day Saint (LDS) faith experience the midlife transition. The narratives of 10 LDS women ages 35 to 65 were obtained through personal interviews. The data were analyzed from a feminist, social constructionist, and narrative perspective using Chenail's Qualitative Matrix as a formal coding system to guide the process of analysis and reporting (Cole, 1994). The findings indicate that the younger cohort had inner conflicts; those in the middle age cohort experienced role confusion; and the oldest cohort experienced generativity. These findings may suggest that a positive metamorphosis takes place in women during the midlife transition. (Contains 1 figure.)",

By assuming a covert research role, I was able to observe natural occurrences of female gambling activities but unable to make peace with disturbing feelings of my research concealment. By making my study overt, I was able to fulfill ethical obligations as a researcher but unable to get female gamblers to speak their minds. I responded to such ethical dilemmas by adjusting the level of involvement, participating in female gambling culture as an insider and observing it as an outsider. This fieldwork suggests that the ethics of participant observation should be addressed in relation to the sensitivity of the research topic, the vulnerability of the researched individuals, and the plasticity of field membership roles.",

In this article an overview of numeric and selected ethnographic data on the timing of \"first love\" is presented, to inform an assessment of the ontological underpinnings of milestone research common to quantitative sociology and developmental psychology. Complicating scientific normalization of love's initiatory connotation, selected ethnographic observations on the timing and notion of early/first love in non-Western societies are presented. These observations facilitate a critique of love as a heterosocial, propaedeutic event, and hence, as scientifically accessible and befitting the routines and metaphors of biomedical \"milestone monitoring.\" (Contains 2 tables and 3 footnotes.)",

Next, we use this taxonomy to provide an overview of visual techniques for quantitative data display and qualitative data display. Then, we propose what we call \"crossover\" visual extensions to summarize and integrate both qualitative and quantitative results within the same framework. We provide several examples of crossover (mixed research) graphical displays that illustrate this natural extension. In so doing, we contend that the use of crossover (mixed research) graphical displays enhances researchers' understanding (i.e., increased Verstehen) of social and behavioral phenomena in general and the meaning that underlies these phenomena in particular.

Using focus group discussions within a qualitative framework allowed me insights into the thoughts and experiences of the students and assessors, making the benefits of oral assessment apparent. These benefits included how assessment can be used as a learning opportunity, the advantages of homogeneous versus heterogeneous groups, and the benefits of face-to-face interaction, all of which led to improved relationships between students and assessors.",

        "description":"In our attempts to track changes in geological practice over time and to isolate the source of these changes, we have found that they are largely connected with the germination of new geologic subdisciplines. We use keyword and title data from articles in 68 geology journals to track the changes in influence of each subdiscipline on geology over all. Geological research has shifted emphasis over the study period, moving away from economic geology and petroleum geology, towards physics- and chemistry-based topics. The Apollo lunar landings had as much influence on the topics and practice of geological research as the much-cited plate-tectonics revolution. These results reflect the barely-tangible effects of the changes in vocabulary and habit of thought that have pervaded the substance of geology. Geological literature has increased in volume and specialization, resulting in a highly fragmentary literature. However, we infer that \"big science,\" characterized by large amounts of funding, collaboration, and large logistical investments, makes use of this specialization and turns \"twigging\" into a phenomenon that enhances, rather than inhibits, the enterprise of research.

While some academics consider this a welcome development, others experience it as a threat to their autonomy and to the meaningfulness of their work. This essay suggests a stance in response to the current conditions that should serve especially the latter group of academics. The claim is that by approaching academic work as a potential praxis in emergence, it is possible to appreciate local, autonomous activity in renewing academic work. Even if such efforts remain difficult, dispersed in space, discontinuous in time, and incomplete, they may provide a sense of direction and keep up hope. The conception of praxis is a way of articulating the mission of such efforts; simultaneously, it is also a way of defining an epistemic object for research on academic work.",

This article takes the analogy further, exploring the similarities between the research student's journey and the artisan's transition from apprentice to journeyman to member of the guild, in the light of the author's own PhD experience. Having completed her apprenticeship with the MSc, she compares her doctoral explorations of the existing literature and the methodology texts with the medieval journeyman's migration from one master craftsman to another, incorporating the knowledge acquired into the eventual masterpiece which determines entry to the guild and perpetuates the myth of a linear research process as against the reiterative reality of the qualitative research journey. The relationship between journeyman and master is key. Reflecting on her experience, the author suggests that communication and clear expectations have been vital success factors for her. Progress reports and conference papers have been tangible evidence of the distance covered. This evidence, combined with continual updating of a route map, incorporating outputs, due dates, and so forth, has prevented total disorientation. As she nears the end of her journey, she hopes this article conveys something of the hills and valleys along the way, and offers a gleam of light for future and fellow travelers.

In this article, the author argues for extending what counts as research within the social sciences to be more inclusive of differing methodologies and writing genres. Using personal narrative, diaries, and poetry, the author demonstrates unconventional ways of thinking about, doing, and writing research. He situates his personal experiences as a Ghanaian/American student within relevant literature to illuminate the merging of his home cultural values with those of the academic community and the contradictions and struggles associated with this process. Ultimately, the story portrays the journey of a graduate student as he challenges traditional research norms to open up spaces for underrepresented students to feel more at home within academe.

Each step of this research journey presented me with a variety of delicate decisions. I discuss my thought processes in resolving these dilemmas and some of the practical solutions I used to address a variety of difficulties. Although written specifically about doing research with gay and lesbian teachers, many of the lessons I learned throughout this process can be applied to a range of research situations. For example, many researchers share cultural backgrounds with their participants. This presents both the opportunity to establish rapport with participants quickly but also the danger of the researcher reading his or her own experiences into the data. I describe some of the ways I addressed this issue as well as others commonly faced by those doing dissertations.

        "author":["Trujillo, Carlos Andres"],
        "description":"Having a \"normal\" professional job and doing research impose different social and personal connotations. These differences materialize at least in two clear ways. First, it is common that researchers in the making find it very difficult to communicate to their closest social network (e.g., family and old close friends) the content and the importance of their work, as they lose known sources of social comparison. Meanwhile, professional job titles (e.g., brand manager, auditor, lawyer) are self-explanatory, and they provide for the owner an immediate social contextualization and recognition. Second, students normally receive delayed and ambiguous feedback and reinforcement while doing a PhD, contrasting with the continuous flow of assessment that companies give to their employees. In this article, I analyze how young researchers may develop a feeling of social isolation as the communication bridges with family, old friends, and undergraduate colleagues become narrower than before, making it difficult to receive external reinforcement on their social position and comparative achievement. This feeling, combined with the ambiguous feedback during the early stages of a research career, challenges the self-esteem of PhD students, forcing them to develop a self-contained personal security in order to cope with those two social contexts. Some young researchers might even withdraw from PhD programs should they fail to develop such psychological strength. I approach the issue through my own experience, first as a junior consultant in a multinational firm and then as a PhD candidate in economics. Second, I explore the behavioral phenomena that occur beneath those feelings in order to understand how to build such psychological strength. My goal is, through the exploration of my personal experience of becoming a researcher, to offer young researchers a useful narrative to help face the potentially negative feelings that may emerge when learning to balance these conflicting social roles.",

Interdisciplinarity--understood as temporary \"groundlessness\"--emerges as a means to apprehend and respond to problems that in the context of past frustrations and failures may seem insurmountable; the willingness to not-know inspires new paradigms, experiences, and relationships. Extra-disciplinarity highlights the many chords running between academe and the rest of the world. Using this framework, we discuss the featured pedagogical instances as small-scale models for changing the power structures that have historically silenced some perspectives and knowledges, thus opening these structures to new inputs and connections. We conclude that while this work has no guarantees and is never complete, we must keep trying to connect beyond our academic disciplines and ourselves, both to learn and to more effectively impact the world.",

Thinking like an economist is essential to conducting research and performing careful analysis of public policy issues. However, it can reduce the economists' effectiveness in teaching and interacting with neighbors and political leaders. Effective pedagogy requires that faculty be present as good economists to their neighbors, their fellow citizens, in daily conversations and public policy debates. Our continuing education as teachers of economics requires that we enter those conversations as committed students as well--committed to learning how our neighbors process economic facts and principles and how their insights into public policy debates might alter our own understanding.",

Having distinguished interdisciplinarity from the disciplinary approach, the advantages and disadvantages of each can be discussed. It is useful to discuss the history of both disciplines and interdisciplinarity. It is also useful to discuss the complex relationship between interdisciplinarity and other intellectual currents: postmodernism, unity of science, complexity analysis, feminism, and others.

        "description":"This essay uses the concept of the constellation to characterize the relations among interdisciplinarity, cultural memory, and comparative literature. To do so entails: (a) reviewing the paradoxical interdisciplinarity of comparative literature, (b) tracing its establishment at a liberal arts college (Bryn Mawr College, USA), and (c) describing a course on &quot;The Cultural Politics of Memory&quot; that tested the limits of scholarship and testimony. The discussion includes an account of an unusual conference on cultural memory: that is, the ways in which different cultural groups identify and describe their shared pasts. The informality and collegial dialogue of the conference were associated with a liberal arts context. It then turns to the question of theorizing aspects of cultural memory that are conveyed at the margins of conventional discourse: by what is largely unsaid, or represented in dance or pantomime. Because each of the performances discussed here is related in a distinct way to a preceding historical trauma (the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, African American slavery in the USA, the terrorism of the Shining Path in Peru), it was important to determine what source of memory, what archival materials, could persist through traumas that often suppress memory. Traditional archives consist of written documents. Moreover, they often support or represent official histories. New ways of thinking about archives--their composition, their place in cultural history, and their theoretical dimensions--have suggested new approaches to cultural memory. The essay ends with accounts of three forms of dance or pantomime that convey cultural histories informed by trauma in significantly different ways. A narrative thread foregrounds the close relations between scholarship and pedagogy.",

We propose that interdisciplinarity instead might mean teaching and learning among, between, and in the midst of those of innate or learned capacities--not only college faculty but also students and  staff. To illustrate this more radical iteration of interdisciplinarity, we draw on a range of definitions of the key terms, \"discipline\" and \"faculty,\" and we offer a case study of a workshop we co-facilitated in which we brought differently positioned individuals together to engage in the educational process and the production of knowledge.

The fundamental determinants of health include many interrelated factors such as poverty,  culture, education, environment, and government policies. However, traditional public health training has tended to focus more narrowly on diseases and risk factors, and has not adequately leveraged the rich contributions of sociology, anthropology, economics, geography, communication, political science, and other disciplines. Further, students are often not sufficiently trained to work across sectors to translate research findings into effective, large-scale sustainable actions. During the past 2 decades, national and international organizations have called for more effective interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, and translational approaches to graduate education. Although it has been difficult to work across traditional academic boundaries, some promising  models draw on pedagogical theory and feature cross-disciplinary training focused on real-world problems, linkage between research, professional practice, community action, and cultivation of leadership skills. We describe the development the Doctor of Public Health program at the University of California, Berkeley, USA and its efforts to improve transdisciplinary and translational research education.

        "description":"In the last quarter-century and especially the last decade, testing and accountability have come to dominate education policy at the state and national levels. The common concern about the effects of such testing is that it reshapes teaching in the classroom. But such claims do not look at the evidence of deeper classroom structures (the mix of teacher-centered and student-centered practices) in historical context. This article extends historical research in \"How Teachers Taught\" (Cuban, 1993) to the present in three metropolitan school districts. While testing and accountability have become more obvious concerns of teachers, the hybridized classroom environment documented in \"How Teachers Taught\" have become more pervasive. This article documents this continuing ubiquity and addresses the apparent inconsistency between evidence of a hybridized classroom environment and the unintended consequences of testing and accountability.

Students in rural schools or schools with higher percentages of African American students were likely to have less access to computers. With respect to computer use, girls and students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch were more likely to use computers more frequently when computers are available in the classroom. With respect to relationships between computer access and computer use, having computers available in a lab increases the likelihood of higher levels of computer use. The results suggested that no more than 5% of the variance in computer access can be attributed to state factors, and less than 1% of the variance in computer use was between states. The findings suggested that where student technology standards are integrated into subject-area standards, computer use was likely lower than in other states. In states where pre-service teachers must meet technology-related requirements to receive their teaching credential and states where funds earmarked for technology are distributed as competitive grants, computer use was likely to be higher.

        "description":"Using John Kingdon's (2003) multiple streams approach to agenda setting, I analyze how key actors within the state of Wisconsin understood the need to construct and implement the state's No Social Promotion statutes to improve students' academic performance. Policymakers within the state focused their standards-based reforms on the issue of improving students' academic performance through increasing accountability. In doing so, they did not see these high-stakes policies as a form of punishment for those who fail, but rather, as a tool to focus the education establishment on improving the academic skills and knowledge of all their students. Thus, the retained student is not the primary concern of the policymaker, but rather, the retained student demonstrates the state's system of accountability works. Raising the question as to whether those who support or oppose high-stakes policies such as these should focus their efforts on the agenda setting process rather than analyzing effects of such policies. I contend that while evaluating a policy's effects is important, education stakeholders must pay attention to all three streams of the agenda setting process as they promote particular reforms to improve students' academic performance.

In particular, a focused school mission and increased control over teacher hiring may lead to stronger teacher professional communities. This paper uses the 1999-2000 Schools and Staffing Survey to compare the level of teacher community in charter public and traditional public schools. It also estimates the effect of various charter policy variables and domains of school autonomy on teacher community. Charter school teachers report higher levels of teacher community than traditional public school teachers do, although this effect is less than one-tenth of a standard deviation and is dwarfed by the effect of a supportive principal, teacher decision-making influence, and school size. Charter public schools authorized by universities showed lower levels of teacher community than those authorized by local school districts. Teachers in charter schools that have flexibility over tenure requirements and the school budget report higher levels of teacher community. This study reveals that charter schools do facilitate the formation of strong teacher communities, although the effect is small. The analysis also suggests that the institutional origin of the charter school and specific areas of policy flexibility may influence teacher community. (Contains 1 figure and 6 tables.)",

The present study examines how and why five ATCPs in Missouri have evolved in different ways. To understand this variation and its potential significance for researchers and practitioners, we use political science literature on bureaucratic discretion to understand programs' varied responses within the same state policy context. Using a multiple case study design, we present two key findings. First, external factors such as the state's regulatory approach, programs' relationships with school districts, and programs' relationship with external partners shape program coordinators' perceptions of their discretionary authority. Second, within an environment of limited regulation, programs responded to these external factors in ways that shaped programs in dramatically different ways. These approaches ranged from formal partnerships with large urban school districts and philanthropic funders to alternative certification programs that were at least partially blended with existing undergraduate and post baccalaureate teacher preparation programs. In our discussion, we explore how state attempts to widen the discretionary &quot;space between the rules&quot; may have allowed external interests (e.g., school districts, and external funders) to backfill that space in ways that limit the potential for programs to provide high quality preparation experiences. This study explores these consequences and trade offs in order to inform policy makers and practitioners who are concerned with fostering innovative and creative ways to prepare high quality teachers.

Such outcomes may lead these policy initiatives to have unintended consequences for students, particularly racial or ethnic minority students. This study examines whether race or ethnicity moderate the relationship between school commitment and alcohol use or binge drinking among a sample of Florida public middle and high-school students who were surveyed as part of the 2002 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey. Low school commitment was found to be associated with a greater likelihood of alcohol use in the past 30 days and a greater likelihood of binge drinking during the past two weeks for Black, Hispanic, and White students. Both the higher average levels of school commitment among Black and Hispanic than among white students and the greater association between low school commitment and the two alcohol use outcomes for Black and Hispanic students compared to White students account for some of the difference in alcohol use and binge drinking among the different groups.

        "description":"School reform efforts across the US have focused on creating systems in which all students are expected to achieve to high standards. To ensure that students reach those standards and to document what students know and can do, schools collect assessment information on students' academic achievement. More information is needed, however, to find out when such assessments are appropriate for English learners and can provide meaningful information about what such learners know and can do. We describe and discuss a study that addresses the question of when it is appropriate to administer content area tests in English to English learners. Drawing on the student database of San Francisco Unified School District, we examined the effect of language demands on the SAT/9 mathematics scores of Chinese-speaking and Spanish-speaking students. Our results showed that while the English language demands of the problem solving subscale affect all students, they have a larger effect on English learners' performance, thus rendering the tests inaccurate in measuring English learners' subject matter achievement. Our results also showed that this effect gradually decreases as students become more proficient in English, taking five to six years for students to reach parity with national norms. These results have important implications for the design of school accountability systems and policies with high-stakes consequences for English learners such as high-school graduation requirements based on standardized tests.

Dropout rates are highest for African American and Latino youth, more than 60% for the students we followed. Findings from this study, which included analysis of the accountability policy in operation in high-poverty high schools in a major urban district, analysis of student-level data for more than 271,000 students in that district over a seven-year period under this policy, and extensive ethnographic analysis of life in schools under the policy, show that the state's high-stakes accountability system has a direct impact on the severity of the dropout problem. The study carries great significance for national education policy because its findings show that disaggregation of student scores by race does not lead to greater equity, but in fact puts our most vulnerable youth, the poor, the English language learners, and African American and Latino children, at risk of being pushed out of their schools so the school ratings can show &quot;measurable improvement.&quot; High-stakes, test-based accountability leads not to equitable educational possibilities for youth, but to avoidable losses of these students from our schools.

While students' performance on state or district tests rose after the implementation of high-stakes testing and accountability policies in Texas and Chicago in the 1990s, several studies indicate that these policies seemed to have had deleterious effects on curriculum, instruction, the percentage of students excluded from the tests, and student dropout rates. As a result, the policies seemed to have had mixed effects on students' opportunities to acquire embodied and institutionalized cultural capital. These findings are consistent with the work of Shepard (2000), Darling-Hammond (2004a), and others who have written of the likely negative repercussions of high-stakes testing and accountability policies.

Building on teacher-centric research on standards-based reform and ideas about teaching practice from research on multicultural education, this paper focuses on the assumptions embedded in Washington state's approach. Survey data from a representative sample of teachers suggest that the state's program of high student learning standards, aligned assessments and an accountability system has shaped teachers' instructional practice and their students' learning in ways that the state's reform theory assumes. However, teachers' concerns about student achievement and instructional supports indicate problems with the inherent logic of the state's reform regarding how well it serves a diverse student population.

In this paper we take a closer look at the different measures of high school graduation which have recently been proposed and which yield such low estimates of graduation rates. We argue that the nature of the variables in the Common Core of Data, the dataset maintained by the U.S. Department of Education that is the main source for all of the new measures, requires caution in calculating graduation rates, and the adjustments that have been proposed often impart significant downward bias to the estimates.

This exploration involves looking at teaching as performance in the broadest cultural sense of the word--interested more in \"efficacy of communication and mutual empathetic understanding\"--than in the more commonly-held economic, technological and political senses of performance which are more interested in \"setting, raising, and maintaining standards of efficiency and effectiveness\" (see McKenzie, 2001). In examining these issues in both performance studies and education, the conclusions are that educational researchers and teacher educators can benefit significantly from a critical awareness of the proliferation of metaphors for teaching as performance that highlight both aesthetic and socio-political challenges inherent in a life in the classroom.

The study describes and analyzes the character of these changes, within the theoretical frame of phenomenographic research on learning. The notion of &quot;resting assured&quot; is used to describe the main characteristic of the qualitative change found in the relation between the student and his/her artistic work. To 'rest assured' refers to a state of trust in their own ability that the students develop.

        "description":"Despite interest in the arts, art and design practice in Nigeria continues to witness a downward trend. A new orientation and redirection of priorities, skills development, and patterns of practice that are not contradictory to the code of professional conduct and ethical procedures is contemplated. This paper groups the professionally trained artists and designers into two categories: the academic and the roadside artists. The various art and design schools are responsible for training of graduates in the various disciplines of Fine Art and Industrial Design such as in graphics, textiles and ceramics designs, interior decoration, printmaking, sculpture, painting, art history, and art education. It is expected that graduates in these options keep the professional banner flying and earn the profession very high societal repute through practice and ethics. It appears the reverse is presently the case, as most trained artists, designers, and craftsmen are jettisoning art practice for other jobs like banking, salesmanship, trading, general contractorship, or politics. Although factors impeding professional practices in Nigeria are intended to be highlighted, the paper also intends to promote the practice of Art and Design in Nigeria. Interactions between authors and dropout artists were analyzed in this paper. Craftsmen and industrial designers are encouraged to seek patronage in order to bring the profession to an enviable standard. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Over ten years ago, Tom Barone and Elliot Eisner (1997) described seven features of existing artistic approaches to educational inquiry. Their chapter dealt primarily with written, prosaic forms of Arts-Based Educational Research, or ABER, particularly educational criticism and narrative storytelling. In their concluding section, Barone and Eisner recognize the limitless possibilities of utilizing non-linguistic forms of representation to conduct ABER. It is the thesis of our paper that such forms might be considered Research-Based Art (RBA), given the shift in emphasis from linguistic to non-linguistic ways of representing what it is that we come to know about our world. While ABER is considerably broad, we seek to apply as specifically as possible Barone and Eisner's categorical structure to our own RBA. We do so by defining RBA, reconceptualizing Barone and Eisner's seven features as they pertain to RBA, and providing excerpts of our own dialog in applying the seven features to a specific aspect of Jamie's doctoral dissertation. Specifically, we discuss how our understanding and use of RBA compares and contrasts with Barone and Eisner's seven features of ABER. (Contains 13 figures and 2 notes.)",

        "description":"Drawing on Bruner's notion of folk pedagogy, this research explores how Chinese aesthetic education is perceived and valued at two elementary schools in Taiwan. Using qualitative methods, the research explores how arts teachers guide children to experience arts through the arts curricula in school and the local culture. The study reveals that the two schools share a respect for nature and a concern for local culture. The seven arts teachers' folk pedagogy includes the desire to connect beauty and arts learning, develop children's aesthetic feelings, cultivate children's character, and integrate arts into everyday life. The teachers' shared views provide a broad picture of these folk beliefs in Taiwan as well as a cultural lens for examining aesthetic education in Taiwan and the larger Asian culture.

Several key themes arose from the analysis, including the growth and deepening of relationships amongst participants, the sense of losing track of time while engaged in art-making, and the importance of art-making sessions bringing a temporary reprive from work-related demands. These themes resonate strongly with the scholarly literature and empirical work on embodied knowing, creativity, and non-formal adult learning. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"Developing countries face a number of challenges in their efforts to compete successfully in the new global economy. Perhaps the most critical resource needed to achieve these goals is trained human capital. While many developing countries are trying to address this need through traditional means, this may not be the most effective or efficient response. e-Learning has been suggested as an alternative approach that can overcome many of the challenges involved in reaching underserved students. But most educational institutions in developing countries are unfamiliar with e-Learning, have low levels of computer availability, access, familiarity and Internet penetration which leads to skepticism about the feasibility of this approach. In an effort to assess the potential of e-Learning in meeting the needs for developing human capital in Cambodia, this paper reports on the experience and achievements of the &quot;Provincial Business Education through the Community Information Centers&quot; (CICs) project. Key findings are that e-Learning was able to successfully deliver tertiary educational opportunities to underserved provincial students, Cambodian students were able to overcome serious challenges and that female Cambodian students demonstrated superior performance in online classes. These results suggest that e-Learning is an effective alternative for delivering tertiary education in Cambodia. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the current status of e-Learning in Korean higher   education and find ways to encourage the further use and development of e-Learning systems that aim to enhance Korea's academic competitiveness. A total of 201 universities in Korea (27 national and public, 163 private, and 11 national universities of education) were examined in this study. At the time of the study, 85 percent of the universities and colleges had investigated implementing e-Learning. There were special e-Learning teams in most national and public universities, as well as private universities and colleges. Findings from this study found that both teachers and learners alike, lacked meaningful support systems and opportunities to actively participate in e-Learning programs. Although such lack of support was found to be endemic, such lack of support and opportunity was found to be more acute in private universities, private colleges, universities of education, than mid-sized, small-sized, and provincial universities and colleges. Except for a few mid- and small-sized universities and colleges, most large universities and colleges were equipped with technical support such as infrastructure and operational platforms. These same schools, however, did not provide institutional support, nor did they employ appropriate policies needed to further the quality and enhancement of e-Learning offerings. Also, there was no meaningful link found between schools and industry, nor was there adequate financial support in place for the implementation of e-Learning systems, simply because many universities failed to allocate sufficient funding for e-Learning. In conclusion, the strategies for enhancing university competitiveness through e-Learning are as follows: 1) establishing support strategies according to the types of universities; 2) developing quality assurance systems for e-Learning; 3) enhancing support systems for professors and learners; 4) developing knowledge sharing systems between schools and industry; 5) enhancing international collaboration for e-Learning; and 6) developing and supporting e-communities of knowledge for research and education.

By integrating low- and high-technology in the distance in-service teacher training programs, both the trainers (the university lecturers) and the student teachers (in-service school teachers) were able to transform their pedagogical skills. The student teachers learned to become independent learners. The university lecturers learned to adjust their teaching styles to be more learner-centred. Both the lecturers and the student teachers adopted task-based approaches to learning and teaching. Finally, the student teachers were given the means to upgrade their qualifications and teaching skills. Based on these findings, the authors offer suggestions for the future development of student teacher training in China using distance modalities. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Unlike the spontaneity of open-source movement in North America, open-source software development in China, such as &quot;Red Flag Linux,&quot; is an orchestrated activity wherein different levels of China's government play a vital role in sponsoring, incubating, and using open-source software, most conspicuously, &quot;Red Flag Linux.&quot; While there are no reports on open-source course management system in China, there are reports on the study and use of Western open-source course management systems for instruction and learning in Chinese higher education institutions. This paper discusses the current status of open-source software in China, including open-source course management software and associated tools and resources. Importantly, it describes the development model of &quot;Red Flag Linux,&quot; the most successful open-source software initiative in China. In addition, it explores the possibility of Chinese higher education institutions joining efforts to develop China's own open-source course management system using the open-source development model established in North America. A timeline of major open-source projects of significance underway in China is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential for applying the open-source software development model to open and distance education in China. (Contains 2 notes.)",

        "description":"The successful development of mobile learning is dependent on human factors in the use of new mobile and wireless technologies. The majority of mobile learning activity continues to take place on devices that were not designed with educational applications in mind, and usability issues are often reported. The paper reflects on progress in approaches to usability and on recent developments, with particular reference to usability findings reported in studies of mobile learning. The requirements of education are considered as well as the needs of students participating in distance education; discipline-specific perspectives and accessibility issues are also addressed. Usability findings from empirical studies of mobile learning published in the literature are drawn together in the paper, along with an account of issues that emerged in two mobile learning projects based at The Open University, UK, in 2001 and 2005. The main conclusions are: that usability issues are often reported in cases where PDAs have been used; that the future is in scenario-based design which should also take into account the evolution of uses over time and the unpredictability of how devices might be used; and that usability issues should be tracked over a longer period, from initial use through to a state of relative experience with the technology.",

We analyzed the models of Ferster and Lewinsohn in their theoretical approach, methodology and application. We conducted a review of the suppressive characteristics exercised by punishment, by the presentation of non-contingent aversive stimulation and by operant extinction. A number of recommendations are made concerning how these processes can inform interventions. We conclude that interventions geared towards identifying aversive control play a promising role in clinical change in the treatment of depression.",

        "author":["Traxler, John"],
        "description":"Since the start of the current millennium, experience and expertise in the development and delivery of mobile learning have blossomed and a community of practice has evolved that is distinct from the established communities of &quot;tethered&quot; e-Learning. This community is currently visible mainly through dedicated international conference series, of which MLEARN is the most prestigious, rather than through any dedicated journals. So far, these forms of development and delivery have focussed on short-term small-scale pilots and trials in the developed countries of Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim, and there is a taxonomy emerging from these pilots and trials that suggests tacit and pragmatic conceptualisations of mobile learning. What has, however, developed less confidently within this community is any theoretical conceptualisation of mobile learning and with it any evaluation methodologies specifically aligned to the unique attributes of mobile learning. Some advocates of mobile learning attempt to define and conceptualise it in terms of devices and technologies; other advocates define and conceptualise it in terms of the mobility of learners and the mobility of learning, and in terms of the learners' experience of learning with mobile devices. The role of theory is, perhaps, a contested topic in a community that encompasses philosophical affiliations from empiricists to post-structuralists, each with different expectations about the scope and legitimacy of theory in their work. The mobile learning community may nevertheless need the authority and credibility of some conceptual base. Such a base would provide the starting point for evaluation methodologies grounded in the unique attributes of mobile learning. Attempts to develop the conceptualisations and evaluation of mobile learning, however, must recognise that mobile learning is essentially personal, contextual, and situated; this means it is &quot;noisy&quot; and this is problematic both for definition and for evaluation. Furthermore, defining mobile learning can emphasise those unique attributes that position it within informal learning, rather than formal. These attributes place much mobile learning at odds with formal learning with its cohorts, courses, semesters, assessments, and campuses, and with its monitoring and evaluation regimes. This raises concerns for the nature of any large-scale and sustained deployment and the extent to which the unique attributes of mobile learning may be lost or compromised. Looking at mobile learning in a wider context, we have to recognise that mobile, personal, and wireless devices are now radically transforming societal notions of discourse and knowledge, and are responsible for new forms of art, employment, language, commerce, deprivation, and crime, as well as learning. With increased popular access to information and knowledge anywhere, anytime, the role of education, perhaps especially formal education, is challenged and the relationships between education, society, and technology are now more dynamic than ever. The paper explores and articulates these issues and the connections between them specifically in the context of the wider and sustained development of mobile learning.",

        "description":"A multiple-baseline-across two behavior sets and positions (reclined, upright) was used to experimentally examine the effect of Behavioral Activation Treatment for Pain (BAT-P) on pain-related behavior of a 44-year-old woman with a 22-year history of fibromyalgia (FM). BAT-P, based on the matching law, is comprised of Behavioral Relaxation Training (BRT), scheduled relaxation-activity cycles, daily relaxation practice, shaping performance of valued activities, visual feedback of performance and descriptive praise. Visual feedback was provided for pain interference rating, performance of relaxation skills, and self-rated depression. A behavioral contract was implemented to increase maintenance of intervention effects. Percent-relaxed behavior was functionally related to BRT with limited generalization from reclined to upright positions or across behavior sets. BAT-P resulted in clinically significant decreases in self-reported pain interference, pain anxiety, and depression and medication usage. Pain anxiety cognition declined without direct cognitive restructuring. Results were maintained at three- and six-month follow up. Findings replicate results of BAT-P for FM pain interference and pain anxiety cognition. Use of systematic maintenance procedures extends past research on BAT-P. Results provide further support for the utility  of \"pure\" behavior analytic interventions for FM and the benefit of such procedures for pain anxiety cognition. (Contains 4 figures.)",

        "description":"Cognitive and behavioral interventions have been cautiously recommended as \"best practice\" in the treatment of pathological gambling. Behavioral interventions, using a range of techniques, have been the most commonly evaluated approach to the psychological treatment of pathological gambling. The recent literature evaluating behavioral treatments has shifted from aversive therapy to alternative behavioral techniques such as interventions based on desensitization and exposure procedures. A range of other behavioral techniques, such as alternative activity scheduling, problem solving training, financial planning and limit setting, social skills training, and relapse prevention, have been included as treatment components of standardized cognitive-behavioral programs. This paper reviews the published empirical literature investigating the efficacy of the behavioral intervention strategies of activity scheduling and desensitization in the treatment of pathological gambling. Although the findings for both intervention strategies are promising, they must be interpreted with caution given the methodological difficulties inherent in the pathological gambling treatment outcome literature.

Literature on the subject of student  retention in ODL indicates that even when interventions are designed and undertaken to improve student retention, they tend to fall short. Moreover, this area has not been well researched. The main aim of our research, therefore, is to better understand and measure students' attitudes and perceptions towards the effectiveness of mobile learning. Our hope is to determine how this technology can be optimally used to improve student retention at Bachelor of Science programmes at Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) in India. For our research, we used a survey. Results of this survey clearly indicate that offering mobile learning could be one method improving retention of BSc students, by enhancing their teaching/ learning and improving the efficacy of IGNOU's existing student support system. The biggest advantage of this technology is that it can be used anywhere, anytime. Moreover, as mobile phone usage in India explodes, it offers IGNOU easy access to a larger number of learners. This study is intended to help inform those who are seeking to adopt mobile learning systems with the aim of improving communication and enriching students' learning experiences in their ODL institutions.

This research looks at the use of mobile devices to send instant messages that can carry much more information than the short message service (SMS) messages, but would be free to use, notwithstanding the price of getting online. We present a prototype IM system that can be used as a viable means of communicating and learning in higher education establishments. There is some evidence to show that learning using mobile devices reduces the formality of the learning experience, and helps engage reluctant learners and raise their self-confidence. In order for the learning process to be successful in online distance learning, unlike in the traditional face-to-face learning, attention must be paid to developing the participants' sense of community within their particular group. Instant messaging--or IM--is a natural medium for online community building and asynchronous/ synchronous peer discussions. (Contains 4 figures.)",

Based on a 2005 comparative research project, commissioned by the Australian Flexible Learning  Framework, the paper reports on research into Web-based information about the use of mobile technologies for commerce and learning, which was then tested through 29 interviews with manufacturers of mobile devices, businesses and education providers. The research found that mobile technologies were in common use in some commercial sectors, but their use purely for learning was rare. m-Learning lends itself to new methods of delivery, however, that are highly suited to the &quot;just enough, just in time, and just for me&quot; demands of 21st Century learners.

        "description":"The establishment of the Nigerian National Commission for Nomadic Education in 1989 created wider opportunities for an estimated 9.3 million nomads living in Nigeria to acquire literacy skills. This commission was struck to address low literacy rates among pastoral nomads and migrant fishermen, which put literacy rates at 0.28 percent and 20 percent respectively (FME, 2005). To improve the literacy rate among Nigeria's nomadic populations, the National Commission for Nomadic Education employed various approaches such as onsite schools, &quot;shift system&quot; schools with alternative intake, and Islamiyya (Islamic) schools, to provide literacy education to its nomads. A critical appraisal of these approaches by the commission, however, shows that very few of the schools were actually viable. This paper explores why these approaches have not notably helped to improve the literacy rate among Nigeria's nomadic people. Thus, there remains a need for alternative approaches to educational delivery. In face of the revolutionary trends taking place in information and communication technologies (ICTs) in Nigeria, there is now opportunity to embrace mobile learning using low cost mobile technologies (i.e., mobile phones) to enhance the literacy rates among Nigeria's nomadic people, some of whom are enrolled in Nigeria's current Nomadic Education Programme. Indeed, mobile telephones with simple text messaging features, for example, are prevalent in many parts of Nigeria. This paper explores the needs and advantages of integrating mobile learning into Nomadic Education programmes in Nigeria to ensure a successful implementation and achievement of the goals of the programme.

Many early childhood intervention studies report outcomes based on pre-school populations (Smith, 1999; Casto & Mastropieri, 1986) while outcome studies for younger populations are scarcer. We reviewed one year of instructional outcome data from an early intervention classroom that used applied behavior analysis in concert with verbal behavior. The population served was two and three year olds with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Special instruction was provided in individual and in group formats using learn units as the basic unit of instruction. Ninety-five percent of the children in this program progressed to lesser restrictive environments. A cost benefit analysis showed the relative dollar amounts of the learn unit, instructional sessions, and objectives met for one year. (Contains 3 tables and 5 figures.)",

Few daycare centers require any specific inservice training for their staff members. When provided, training typically occurs as a didactic workshop. For this study a multiple baseline design across participants was used to evaluate the effects of didactic training, goal setting, and feedback on day care staff members' (n=7) use of \"quality\" interactions with the children in their care. The results showed that although didactic training marginally increased the level of interactions, the day care workers' interactions were highly variable and susceptible to decay over time.

Functional assessments such as rating scales, ABC analyses, and functional analyses, are evidenced to be the most effective methods for identifying the maintaining variables of problem behavior and for informing efficient, function-based interventions. Although the empirical literature and federal mandates support the use of functional assessment, obstacles to the practical application of these procedures in school settings (e.g., training requirements, time constraints) may deter school staff from using them consistently. Recent research has addressed some of these concerns, and there is developing evidence for briefer, more user-friendly versions of functional assessment. Practitioners can maximize the effectiveness of the intervention process by linking treatment components to functional assessment results. Effective, function-based interventions are comprised of procedures designed to reduce target behavior prior to it occurrence, procedures to teach the learner to access the reinforcer (or an adaptive alternative) appropriately, and systematic procedures for responding to the behavior. Future studies should continue to refine these procedures and address the use of functional assessment with ext ended populations, including adults with disabilities and typically developing children.",

In most of the survey conditions, browser loading times were noted up to four times slower than commonly prescribed as acceptable. Failure of pages to load at all was frequent.

The data were generated by network members in Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Additional data for the follow-up study were collected in China. Using a &quot;traceroute&quot; routine, the study indicates that webpage loading time is linked to the complexity of the Internet routes between Web users and the host server. It is indicated that distance educators can apply such information in the design of improved online delivery and mirror sites, notably in areas of the developing world which currently lack an effective infrastructure for online education.

        "author":["Emurian, Henry H."],
        "description":"At the beginning of a Java computer programming course, nine students in an undergraduate class and nine students in a graduate class completed a web-based programmed instruction tutoring system that taught a simple computer program. All students exited the tutor with an identical level of skill, at least as determined by the tutor's required terminal performance, which involved writing the program and passing multiple-choice tests on the program's elements. Before entering and after exiting the tutor, students completed a test of rule-based performance that required applications of general programming principles to solve novel problems. In both classes, the number of correct rule answers observed before entering the tutor did not predict the number of learn units that students subsequently used to complete the tutor. However, the frequency of learn units was inversely related to post-tutor rule-test performance, i.e., as the number of learn units used in the tutor increased over students, the number of correct answers on the post-tutor rule test decreased. Since time to complete the tutor was unrelated to learn unit frequency, these data suggest that high achieving students may have generated autoclitic learn units while using the tutor. Interteaching, as an occasion for generating and sharing interlocking learn units, may be an effective complement to programmed instruction in promoting optimal learning in all students.

We examined the first five years and the 2000-2004 five year period of the \"Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (JABA)\" and \"Behavior Therapy (BT)\" and found: 1) a doubling of the use of DSM diagnostic categories for both, with studies published in \"BT\" using these in a majority (51%) of titles; 2) a significant increase of studies published in \"JABA\" focusing on developmental disabilities (from 24.7% to 61.8%), but no such increase or predominate focus in \"BT\"; 3) a significant decrease in \"BT\" explicitly focusing on behavioral principles (51.8% to 12.5%) with \"JABA\" showing a sustained focus on behavioral principles (100% and 100%); and finally, 4) studies published in \"JABA\" showing little interest in studying newer behavioral conceptualizations (10.8%) in the 2000-2004 five-year period.

However, several studies have shown that delayed primary reinforcement can have a substantial impact on responding in situations in which it was assumed to exert little or no influence. For example, delayed primary reinforcement has produced surprisingly strong effects on responding in procedures with simple concurrent schedules and concurrent chains schedules. This article will highlight two studies (McDevitt & Williams 2001; Ploog, 2001) that demonstrate that delayed primary reinforcement can have direct effects on choice.

To control for test-taking skills, students also answered 10 multiple-choice questions from an equivalent passage they did not read. Videotapes of student participation permitted individual assessment of time required to complete each phase. Subsequently, during the semester students took five 50-item multiple-choice exams over the major units in the course. Results showed that the brief reading comprehension measures predicted multiple-choice exam performance and that comprehension level accounted for most of the variance in exam performance.

Specifically, certain areas of development or advancement are examined which might be of special importance to the expansion  and influence of the functional analysis of verbal behavior. One critical task for the influence of the field, for example, involves the removal of an obstacle; namely, the remarkably persistent and wholly inappropriate influence of Chomsky's polemic of 1959. Strategies for neutralizing this influence are explored. In looking at the future advancement of the field, a case is offered for  broadening the domain of verbal behavior research to include a variety of complex verbal phenomena. Skinner's original work and more recent systematic treatments provide an important  framework for the analysis of verbal behavior, but there is still room for, and a need for inductively oriented, empirically based research programs that transcend specific interpretive or theoretical treatments. Such program under the guidance of the practices of radical behaviorism and effective behavior-analytic methodology, might provide additional lines of development and progress for the analysis of verbal behavior.",

        "description":"Curriculum-based measurement Reading (CBM-R) is an assessment procedure used to evaluate students' relative performance compared to peers and to evaluate their growth in reading. Within the response to intervention (RtI) model, CBM-R data are plotted in time series fashion as a means modeling individual students' response to varying levels of instruction and the interpretation of these data is used as a source of information for making special education eligibility decisions. While substantial evidence exist demonstrating the reliability and validity of CBM-R procedures from a classical test theory (CTT) perspective, little evidence exist demonstrating the quality of CBM-R from a behavioral assessment perspective. This paper discusses (a) the necessity of evaluating CBM-R from a behavioral assessment perspective and (b) those studies which have evaluated CBM-R from a perspective other CTT, and (c) recommendations for future research.",

In this article, we summarize and update Hunsley and Di Giulio's (2002) review of recent meta-analyses and comparative treatment studies relevant to this question. Taken together, the empirical evidence clearly indicates that psychotherapy nonequivalence is the rule, not the exception.

Although the topic of resurgence has received limited experimental attention, there recently have been an increased number of investigations involving the topic. This increased experimental attention also has been accompanied by conceptual analysis. This increased interest in resurgence by both basic and applied behavior analysts is noteworthy because the topic relates to several different areas in and outside behavior analysis. This paper is a brief and selective review of resurgence, and its aim is to illustrate the importance of continuing to investigate the topic. More specifically, the role of resurgence in understanding topics such as behavioral history, drug relapse, severe problem behavior, communication disorders, and cognition, is described.

        "description":"The Functional Analytic Psychotherapy Rating Scale (FAPRS) is behavioral coding system designed to capture those essential client and therapist behaviors that occur during Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP). The FAPRS manual presents the purpose and rules for documenting essential aspects of FAP. The FAPRS codes are exclusive and exhaustive for FAP essential behaviors but also include codes for generally effective therapy behaviors by both client and therapist. Client behaviors identified include those that are FAP-specific such as Clinically Relevant Behaviors (in-session improvements and problems), specification of controlling variables, and discussion of outside problems and improvements that have been identified as targeted behaviors. Therapist behaviors that have been identified as theoretically essential for conducing FAP are included such as discussions about the therapeutic relationship, responding effectively and ineffectively to in-session client behaviors, and evoking client behavior in-session. For each behavioral code a definition is provided along with examples and counter examples of how the code might be applied to client or therapist behaviors. A decision hierarchy is provided for those cases when a client or therapist behavioral event (called a turn) may receive more than one possible code. The FAPRS can be used as a tool in research (e.g., to provide evidence for the proposed mechanism of change for FAP) or as a method for assisting the training of psychotherapists. The FAPRS has demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties (demonstrated by Callaghan, Follette, Ruckstuhl, & Linnerooth, this issue).",

After this brief flourish of interest, PSI research trickled off to a nearly imperceptible stream in the 1990s. However, with the increasing availability and ease of use of computers and the internet, along with demand created by an ever-growing need for distance education, PSI is beginning to curry favor among a new generation of faculty members. The question of whether this resurgence of interest will be permanent revival or fleeting fancy will depend on how researchers deal with the PSI paradoxes that stymied the researchers of the 1970s and 1980s. This article will review the current state of PSI research including the riddles left to be untangled, illustrate how computers have affected the PSI movement, and discuss the role PSI might play in distance education.",

Empirical research to support this contention is scarce in part due to the difficulty of specifying and measuring theoretically derived mechanisms of change and the important dimensions of the client-therapist relationship. Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP; Kohlenberg & Tsai, 1991) is a behavioral treatment that delineates how the therapeutic relationship brings about clinical change in clear and measurable terms. While initial research has been conducted to demonstrating the effectiveness of FAP with different populations, the purported mechanism of clinical change in FAP has not been sufficiently documented. This study describes the creation of a behavioral coding system (the Functional Analytic Psychotherapy Rating Scale; FAPRS) to identify and specify the components believed to be essential in bringing about client behavior change in FAP. Interobserver agreement values indicated moderate to high levels of reliability for the coding system. Implications for future tests of FAP's proposed mechanism of change and the validity of the coding system are discussed. (Contains 7 tables.)",

All conditions required modification, since treatment outcomes were intended to increase, rather than decrease, the target behavior. The participant displayed a significantly greater duration of upright walking during the attention condition, which initially indicated that the desired behavior was maintained by positive reinforcement. Treatment of socially stigmatizing ambulation was implemented during natural transition times in a reversal design and consisted of differential reinforcement of an incompatible response. Results of treatment indicated that physical assistance delivered by staff produced an immediate and large increase in upright walking while verbal attention from staff was ineffective. During treatment conditions, duration of socially stigmatizing ambulation was significantly greater in baseline. These results indicate that socially stigmatizing ambulation was maintained by automatic reinforcement, rather than socially or access-based positive reinforcement, and treatment initially chosen to function as differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior may have also functioned as sensory matching and sensory extinction.

Interpretive and critical discourse analyses of versions of English/language arts standards at the high school level and of public documents related to standards promotion reveal initial conflicts between neoconservative and neoliberal discourses, which over time were integrated in final standards documents. The content standards finally released for use in guiding curriculum in each state were bland and incoherent documents that reflected neither a deep knowledge of the field nor an acknowledgment of what is likely to engage young learners.

        "author":["Wong, Andrew Lap-sang"],
        "description":"The growing popularity of e-learning may pose one of the greatest challenges currently facing traditional educational institutions. The questions often asked are how, rather than whether, to embrace this new form of instructional delivery and how to create an appropriate learning environment for the learners. Educational institutions in Hong Kong have the option of adopting programmes or learning materials developed in other parts of the world for local learners, or not. Such an approach of acquiring learning materials is not without risks in terms of the suitability of materials embedded with cultural contents &quot;foreign&quot; to local learners, or in terms of the suitability of assumptions in the communication context. What are the issues involved in the globalization of education through e-learning? This paper explores--from a critical-dialectical perspective--the implications of globalization on educational policy through cross-border delivery of educational programmes by e-learning, with particular attention given to the threat of cultural imperialism. The paper concludes that Hong Kong seems to be coping with &quot;cultural imperialism&quot; rather well because of its unique history of being a cross-road for East and West, and also with some recommendations to e-learning providers to mitigate the potential damage of cross-cultural delivery of e-learning.

The persistence rate for similar onground courses was 84 percent. The drops for both course modalities were disaggregated by the \"time\" of the request for withdrawal: before course start, during the initial week, and during instruction. There was a significant difference between online and onground requests for withdrawals during the initial week. There was no significant difference between online and onground drop rates after the start of \"instruction,\" leading to the conclusion that differences in instruction online and onground was unlikely to be a major influencing factor in the student's decision to drop.

One of these is the marginalisation of distance education (DE) in the academy as a consequence of DE's identification with low status disciplines, as well as with developments in higher education that are undermining traditional academic identities. There are also constraints arising from the social organisation of distance education itself. The paper offers a (re)conceptualisation of academic professionalism for distance education faculty that is more responsive to the challenges that they face, and more empowering for themselves and the academic and other communities of which they are a part.

The respondents were divided into four groups: 1) hearing, 2) deaf, 3) hard-of-hearing (D/HH), and 3) English as a second language (ESL). Their perceptions of communication and the blended learning experience were examined. While the hearing and ESL students were positive about blended learning, the findings indicated that deaf and hard-of-hearing students reported that both the quality and quantity of their interactions with the professor and other students was greatly improved by the inclusion of an online component. ESL and hearing students were also positive about the blended experience; but the greatest benefit to communication access was observed by students with a hearing loss. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"An all-volunteer organization called the Opensource Opencourseware Prototype System (OOPS), headquartered in Taiwan, was initially designed to translate open source materials from MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) site into Chinese. Given the recent plethora of open educational resources (OER), such as the OCW, the growing use of such resources by the world community, and the emergence of online global education communities to localize resources such as the OOPS, a key goal of this research was to understand how the OOPS members negotiate meanings and form a collective identity in this cross-continent online community. To help with our explorations and analyses within the OOPS translation community, several core principles from Etienne Wenger's concept of Communities of Practice (COP) guided our analyses, including mutual engagement, joint enterprise, shared repertoire, reification, and overall identity of the community. In this paper, we detail how each of these key components was uniquely manifested within the OOPS. Three issues appeared central to the emergence, success, and challenges of the community such as OOPS: 1) strong, stable, and fairly democratic leadership; 2) participation incentives; and 3) online storytelling or opportunities to share one's translation successes, struggles, and advice within an asynchronous discussion forum. While an extremely high level of enthusiasm among the OOPS members underpinned the success of the OOPS, discussion continues on issues related to quality control, purpose and scope, and forms of legitimate participation. This study, therefore, provides an initial window into the emergence and functioning of an online global education COP in the OER movement. Future research directions related to online global educational communities are discussed. (Contains 5 figures.)",

        "description":"Unlike conventional models of software development, the open source model is based on the collaborative efforts of users who are also co-developers of the software. Interest in open source software has grown exponentially in recent years. A &quot;Google&quot; search for the phrase open source in early 2005 returned 28.8 million webpage hits, while less than two years later that number had jumped to 376 million. This paper discusses the origin of the term open source and the key tenets of the open source software development model. In addition, it analyzes the merits and drawbacks of using this model and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of applying the model in higher education. Importantly, examples are provided of computer software, and course management systems in particular, developed using the open source model. Also included are brief analyses of the &quot;Linux&quot; operating system, and two open source course management systems, &quot;Sakai&quot; and &quot;Moodle,&quot; as well as the &quot;uPortal.&quot; A timeline of major open source projects of significance in North America is provided. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential for applying the open source software development model to open and distance education. (Contains 2 tables.)",

The study found that learners responded favourably to constructivist teaching approaches, such as asynchronous discussions, open-ended task-based activities, and assignments incorporating authentic, real-world examples. Learners viewed constructivist activities to be more useful than quizzes and traditional essay-based assignments, as they allowed new concepts to be learned in context and were perceived to promote deeper understanding of the subject matter. Nevertheless, they valued the inclusion of a blend of pedagogical approaches in the course design, as this enabled them to approach and analyze new concepts in an assortment of ways. Learners placed importance on regular interaction with other learners and course instructors, and were strongly in favour of including face-to-face components in Web-based courses.

        "description":"Listening skills research has tended to focus on strategy use in classrooms and on theory and practice of second language (L2) teachers. This study examined the teachers' and learners' perceptions of listening skills in non-classroom learning situations. Five (n = 5) study skills teachers and 19 former learners in a distance study skills course at the University of the South Pacific (USP) were interviewed for this study. The interviews with the study skills teachers sought their expectations of their learners' listening strategies, their views about the learners they taught, and the skills their learners used for listening. Former learners were similarly questioned about their perceptions of listening strategies they were taught and used. Data was collected and managed using \"NVivo,\" a computer assisted qualitative data analysis software. Besides revealing strategies that distance learners reported using their learning listening skills, the study identified a number of differences in views presented by researchers and L2 teachers, as well as differences in perceptions on listening skills between L2 teachers and L2 learners. The paper concludes that there exists a discrepancy between research and the practice of researchers, L2 teachers, and L2 learners on what works. The author also recommends further research in this area is needed, because research examining classroom-based learning situations will likely not apply to, nor fully inform, distance learning contexts.",

This article examines the response of National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) and its strategic responses in combating HIV/AIDS epidemic. This is achieved by examining NOUN's basic structures that position the University to respond to the epidemic; and second, by assessing HIV/AIDS strategies and policy framework the University has put in place. An interpretative epistemological stance was used for this study, and a qualitative research involving focus group discussion (FGD) and analysis of secondary data was carried out. Results showed that NOUN has identified the impact the epidemic has on the university, although it has yet to institutionalize an HIV/AIDS policy. NOUN's Draft Service Charter, however, has identified the fight against HIV/AIDS as a core mandate of the University, and the introduction of HIV/AIDS certification programs can be viewed as proactive policies in response to the epidemic. Results of this study are discussed in terms of their relevance to future research and the impact such policy frameworks may have on combating the epidemic, both within the University and the wider community.

        "author":["Wilson, Tina"],
        "description":"Access to education is not freely available to all. Open Educational Resources (OERs) have the potential to change the playing field in terms of an individual's right to education. The Open University in the United Kingdom was founded almost forty years ago on the principle of &quot;open&quot; access with no entry requirements necessary. The University develops innovative high quality multiple media distance-learning courses. In a new venture called &quot;OpenLearn,&quot; The Open University is making its course materials freely available worldwide on the Web as OERs (see http://www.open.ac.uk/openlearn). How might other institutions make use of these distance-learning materials? The paper starts by discussing the different contexts wherein two institutions operate and the inequalities that exist between them. One institution is a university based in South Africa and the other is a college located in the United Kingdom. Both institutions, however, deliver distance-learning courses. The second part of the paper discusses preliminary findings when OERs are considered for tertiary education at these two institutions. The findings emphasise some of the opportunities and challenges that exist if these two institutions adopt OERs. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "author":["Gulati, Shalni"],
        "description":"Learning \"using\" technologies has become a global phenomenon. The Internet is often seen as a value-neutral tool that potentially allows individuals to overcome the constraints of traditional elitist spaces and gain unhindered access to learning. It is widely suggested that online technologies can help address issues of educational equity and social exclusion, and open up democratic and accessible educational opportunities. The national governments and non-governmental agencies who fund educational endeavours in developing countries have advocated the use of new technologies to reduce the cost of reaching and educating large numbers of children and adults who are currently missing out on education. This paper presents an overview of the educational developments in open, distance, and technology-facilitated learning that aim to reach the educationally deprived populations of the world. It reveals the challenges encountered by children and adults in developing countries as they attempt to access available educational opportunities. The discussion questions whether, in face of these challenges, developing nations should continue to invest money, time, and effort into e-learning developments. Can technology-enhanced learning help address the poverty, literacy, social, and political problems in developing countries?",

        "author":["Porto, Stella C. S.",
          "Berge, Zane L."],
        "description":"Distance education in Brazil has evolved more slowly than distance education offerings in other developing countries. This is because all aspects of Brazil's publicly-funded educational system are excessively regulated, highly bureaucratic, and tightly centralized. Such highly centralized bureaucracy and strict control has resulted in tremendous hurdles that work to thwart the adoption, provision, and diffusion of distance education. This is not good news: Like many developing countries, Brazil is also characterized by wide gaps in wealth distribution, with 20 percent of its population functionally illiterate and living below the poverty line. Distance education, therefore, could be used to help train Brazil's citizens. Brazil's emerging status in the global economy, however, is generating enormous opportunities that are fueling demand for change. For example, in their quest to be competitive in the emerging global economy, Brazil's corporate sector has addressed this challenge by establishing corporate universities to train and educate their employees; much of this corporate training and education takes place online and at a distance. The established and emerging educational opportunities provided by Brazil's corporate sector, in turn, is fuelling the demand for the provision of distance education throughout Brazil. Indeed, most Brazilians are ready for distance education. Many Brazilian households own television sets and cellular telephones, and its expanding communication infrastructure has capacity to support distance and continuing education models. Moreover, this capacity is currently being used by Brazil's rapidly expanding corporate university sector. In spite of Brazil's emergence in the global marketplace and its private-sector educational success stories, Brazil's public educational institutions have not kept pace. This is due to Brazil's long-standing stringent regulation of its public education sector. Recent public initiatives, however, such as the &quot;Open University of Brazil,&quot; do hold promise in fueling the growth of distance education to meet the needs of its citizens, poor and rich alike. This paper analyzes the evolution of distance education in Brazil. It explores interrelationship between the nation's corporate and publicly-funded higher-education sectors, and the influences Brazil's highly regulated distance education practices has on the corporate environment. The paper concludes with a broad-brushed overview of &quot;success stories&quot; of Brazil's corporate universities. (Contains 6 figures and 1 note.)",

This article presents findings from a qualitative case study, which explored the phenomenon of undergraduate and graduate women learners' persistence in online degree-completion programs at a college in the Northeast of the United States. Research questions asked why women learners persisted or failed to persist, and how factors supporting or hindering persistence influenced learners. Interviews with a purposeful sample of 20 participants revealed the complexity of variables affecting learners' persistence to graduation. Findings suggested that multiple responsibilities, insufficient interaction with faculty, technology, and coursework ranked highest as barriers to women's persistence. Strong motivation to complete degrees, engagement in the learning community, and appreciation for the convenience of an online degree-completion option facilitated persistence. (Contains 1 table.)",

Stepwise multiple regression revealed that EI emerged as the most significant direct predictor of GPA. The addition of personality to EI significantly increased the amount of variance accounted for in GPA. Main conclusions are that soft skills are pertinent to academic success and may constitute a useful profile of the successful online student that could be applied to marketing, advisement, quality assessment, and retention efforts.

        "author":["Johnson, Tara Star"],
        "description":"In the author's pilot study of teacher-student sexual dynamics in five preservice teachers high school classrooms, one piece of data stood out from among the rest of the interview transcripts, field notes, and email correspondence--not as an aberrant outlier; the content, feeling attracted to a student, echoed across the data set. Rather, this one journal entry from Sandra (a pseudonym), a graduate student seeking secondary English certification, encompassed much of what the author was hoping to learn about in her research: her description of the attraction, her speculation about what implications it had for her teaching, and her theorization of why it occurred. By focusing on Sandra's journal entry, the author exercised Geertz's notion of \"power in reserve\": selecting the \"best\" data with the understanding that there are dozens of other quotations that she could have used in the exemplar's stead. Such a well-articulated gem was ripe for scrutiny, so the author set out to find a process of analysis and a means of representation that would be worthy of it. Rhizoanalysis, a method of data analysis inspired by Deleuze and Guattari's rhizome figuration, and the poetic representation of data that Richardson has modeled seemed appropriate for reasons the author outlines in this article.

Based on the examination of our reflective journals, collegial dialogue, and students' teacher-research reports, we have achieved three major insights: (1) Teacher Research is a vehicle of genuine praxis of teacher education; (2) Praxis involves a dialectical rationality, which is radically different from the conception of practice within an instrumental rationality; and (3) Modeling and scaffolding the praxis of teacher research for our master's  students--in-service teachers--facilitate both their transformation and ours.",

Following a multiple case study approach, two successful high schools in the south of a central state participated in the study. These schools were selected based on their \"Recognized\" status as measured by the state standardized test results. Findings of this study revealed that principals in successful Hispanic majority high schools have a strong focus on student achievement. They are equally engaged in goal setting meetings to develop student goals, provide support to teachers and assistant principals as a vehicle to enhance the school culture, and monitor student performance, relying on leadership teams for instructional management purposes. Findings also revealed that principals as instructional leaders involve and empower teachers to develop and implement student academic goals, shape the school culture, and monitor the instructional program closely. More importantly, principals in successful Hispanic majority high schools sustain a strong emphasis on teacher accountability for the academic performance of all students. (Contains 1 table.)",

In particular, the author examines African American female leadership using the frameworks of Racial Uplift and Oneness of Being, both concentrated in spirituality and discussed from the perspectives of African worldview and American female slavery. Finally, the author probes the importance of those aspects in describing qualities of leadership necessary to effect schools in which caring occurs. The author poses connections between the cultural attributes of African American women who lead, and the leadership qualities that are needed to establish schools in which caring flourishes.

The chapter concludes by suggesting the significance of this argument for debates regarding &quot;standards,&quot; &quot;accountability,&quot; and educational assessment more generally.

Yet, the skills and the process to build these skills are not traditionally integrated into university coursework in teacher education or aspiring leader programs. A framework has been developed that incorporates social experiences, self-direction, metacognition and learning engagement into a technology integration course. This framework includes a series of scaffolds that were instituted in five successive semesters of the identical web-based course. A global model of social, self-direction has been developed to provide a theoretical foundation to support the process of this framework and is being studied through the lens of design-based research methods. Narrative accounts, surveys, and reflective instruments were used to garner data about student satisfaction and learning progress in investigating the question: What is the impact of social, self-direction scaffolds on aspiring school leaders' ability to plan, manage, sustain and complete personal/group learning experiences? These scaffolds have been found to have a tremendous impact on aspiring leaders' ability to self-manage. Students report a transformation in perspective and ability and report large scale impact upon authentic school environments. Further investigation would need to be conducted to evaluate long-term influence and additional model iteration. (Contains 1 figure.)",

Despite the pressure, teachers reported that their principals demonstrated fairly high levels of inviting leadership behaviors. Further, we found a positive relationship between elementary teachers' perceptions of their principal's inviting leadership behaviors and their job satisfaction, the climate of their school, and the accountability rating assigned to their school. These findings suggest that there is an association between the way in which principals interact with their faculty and the achievement level of students. While many factors affect student achievement, this study reminds us that factors such as inviting leadership behaviors are an important component of quality schools. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Although at first glance our results may seem critical of the pre-service teachers, in actuality, we seek to uncover the tensions inherent in teaching \"for\" diversity.

The panel discussion was one part of a statewide Commemoration in California. A seven member panel, consisting of families and educators were invited to share their experiences with special education since the passage of PL 94-142 in 1975. The panel members' stories provide a picture about where special education began and how far everyone has come. Their stories remind educators about the importance of their role in the public education of all students. As the field of special education continues to develop, their stories remind everyone that at the center of special education--its very purpose and goals--are the students. The purpose of this article is to re-visit the early years of PL 94-142, highlighting what these legal changes meant for professionals in the field of special education, students, and their parents.

        "description":"Parent participation has been one of the key principles of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) since it was first authorized in 1975 as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA) and has continued through the most recent reauthorization in 2004. Parents of children with disabilities have decision making roles about their children's education mandated by law in part based upon historical lack of involvement in such decisions provided by school personnel and the resultant lack of effective education for these children. Beyond these legal mandates, best practice standards would suggest that services will be most effective when parents and professionals work in collaboration. The President's Commission on Excellence in Special Education (PCESE) said that a key element to achieving excellence in special education is to encourage family empowerment in relation to the special education services their child receives. Increasing collaboration with parents is also frequently mentioned as important for school reform in general. While seemingly a simplistic element, the importance of listening to families should not be overlooked in developing collaborative partnerships with parents that will allow the intended mandates of EAHCA and IDEIA to be honored. This article discusses some of what should occur in terms of listening to families in part based upon the results of a longitudinal study of over 100 families of children identified with developmental delays at age 3. This study, Project CHILD, has focused on listening to families tell their stories and while not focused on providing interventions such as school-related services, the experience of listening to these families' stories provides lessons for professionals and in particular, teacher educators. Some of those key lessons are shared here.",

        "description":"On November 29, 1975 then President Ford signed the &quot;Education of All Handicapped Children Act&quot; (EAHCA) into law, mandating for the first time that children and youth with disabilities be afforded the right to a free and appropriate public education, individualized programming, parental participation in the decision making process, nondiscriminatory identification and evaluation, instruction in the least restrictive environment, while ensuring families due process rights and responsibilities. One challenge has been ensuring adequate access to the general education curriculum for an increasingly diverse group of learners within general education classrooms. One approach to making general education curriculum more accessible to diverse learners regardless of ability, learning style, language, or culture is the application of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). Grounded in research of learner differences, the capacities of new media, and the most effective teaching practices and assessments, UDL provides a framework for creating more robust learning opportunities for everyone. By using a UDL approach in the classroom, teachers design their instruction to meet the needs of a diverse group of learners rather than make ongoing adjustments for individual students with special needs. Highlighting the importance of UDL as a fundamental instructional approach has the potential to benefit students and teachers in both general and special education programs. In this article, the authors review the historical background regarding the movement toward greater access for students with special learning needs, the development of UDL as a method for providing access, and discuss supporting the implementation of UDL within school sites and institutions of higher education.

        "description":"In thirty years since federal special education law, PL 94-142 (1975), there has been much debate about how to best identify and serve students with learning disabilities and those at-risk for learning difficulties. This debate continues even after the most recent reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) in 2004. Many classrooms, especially those in urban settings, have a number of students who are struggling with the core curriculum, particularly in the area of reading. Often these struggling students are referred for special education assessment because their teachers do not feel prepared to meet students' individual instructional needs. Until the most recent reauthorization of IDEIA, students qualified for special education under the category of specific learning disability (SLD) \"only\" if an assessment revealed a discrepancy between their aptitude and achievement. Students were generally labeled as having a SLD if they demonstrated average or higher intelligence on a standardized test, and a significant discrepancy (usually two standard deviations) on a standardized measure of achievement in one or more academic areas. One of the main criticisms of this discrepancy model is that it has not proven useful in enhancing services for students, particularly providing early intervention to struggling students. In response to the difficulties inherent in the discrepancy model, leaders in the field of learning disabilities proposed an alternative method, \"response to intervention\" (RTI), as a valid method of identifying a student with learning disabilities. This article provides an overview of the RTI model and describes the roles of general and special education teachers. Implications for teacher education and for professional development are discussed. By preparing teachers in the RTI model, including the implementation of evidence based interventions and ongoing progress monitoring, teacher educators are given the opportunity to build the capacity of all teachers to serve students with learning difficulties.",

        "description":"Participatory research is an ideal theoretical framework for understanding the lives of teachers. While there is ample research on the experiences of teachers who work in diverse settings, most researchers have often described issues of diversity for new teachers. Far too often, researchers are not able to fully capture the difficult issues and everyday realities that new teachers have to face in under-resourced schools. This article presents a case study of using photography as a tool for teacher research. Twenty-five first year teachers (also referred to as Interns) participated in a four-month ethnographic study on their experiences and interactions with others as first year teachers in under-resourced schools in Los Angeles County. Specifically, the Interns were asked to document, through photography, areas that they felt needed to be changed to make learning and teaching more effective. The project tells multiple stories of the struggles of first year teachers as they strive to promote academic achievement and change in schools that are affected by poverty, racism, and social inequity.",

Many educators who consider teaching the Holocaust feel deterred from doing so for several reasons: (1) They lack the confidence needed to develop a Holocaust unit; (2) They feel that the subject's complexity is overwhelming historically and pedagogically because the Holocaust is a thorny subject; and (3) They worry about whether or not they can present such an emotionally charged subject in a way that does justice to the topic while observing the sensitivities that must be considered in planning a course of study for middle, junior high, or senior high school students. Planning a unit of study on the subject must involve a highly developed understanding of the complexities that are central to both the history and the pedagogy of the event. This article describes how a midwestern public university developed a course on the Holocaust while taking into consideration the issues concerning this pedagogy.

Because teachers do not routinely encourage family involvement, and parents do not always participate when they are encouraged to do so, the importance of preservice training to involve family members in children's education is paramount. Recognizing this gap in training and the concern that most beginning teachers do not naturally have the skills to effectively include families in day to day activities, responsive colleges and universities have developed courses encouraging positive interactions with families as a part of their curriculum.

        "author":["Ostorga, Alcione N."],
        "description":"Teachers everywhere are being held accountable for their professional actions through the test-driven curricula sweeping the nation. The National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE, 2002) makes it clear that promotion of reflective practice is an important component of teacher education programs. This multiple case study examines the relationship between epistemic stances and reflective thinking using a set of theories and instruments that allowed for the analysis of these constructs. The participants' epistemic stances were examined through the use of instruments developed by Baxter-Magolda (1992) while the qualitative aspects of reflective thinking were examined through the use of a theoretical framework developed by Mezirow (1991), an adult learning theorist. This study involved the collection of data from four student teachers in their last semester of an undergraduate teacher preparation program for elementary grades. However, to illustrate the intricacies of reflective thought development, the author focuses on two participants who exhibited ways of knowing that are adjacent in the Baxter-Magolda's framework (1992) and represent a natural progression through maturation. This study indicates that reflectivity seems to be grounded on specific epistemic stances that are socially constructed. Therefore, the promotion of reflective teachers is a complex process that may require close attention in every aspect of a teacher preparation program. Most importantly, reflective thinking can not be taught through a few simple techniques but requires education that transforms the preservice teachers' ways of knowing, their views about knowledge and the roles of teachers and students.

        "description":"This study considered the problem of ineffective fieldwork experiences in the English Single Subject Credential Program at California State University, Long Beach prior to student teaching by combining structured fieldwork into a newly established state-mandated assessment, Teaching Performance Assessment Task 1 (TPA 1). This combination of a structured fieldwork component with TPA 1 was implemented in the last course, Curriculum and Methods of Teaching English (C&amp;M), that pre-service teachers take prior to student teaching. Specifically, the study looked at how participants, who were now student teaching, perceived the value of this structured fieldwork infused into TPA 1 and how they articulate their skills and knowledge in the four focus areas. Perception and articulation were assessed during the student teaching semester through a series of interviews with eleven student teachers. These participants had all completed the C&amp;M course with the TPA 1 structured fieldwork component and were student teachers the semester immediately following. This study, which compared three focus areas, (1) developmentally appropriate lesson plans (DALs); (2) Special Needs; and (3) English Language Learners (ELL), that included structured fieldwork and one (Assessment) that did not, found that structured fieldwork, made TPA 1 more relevant, and thus more effectively prepared students for student teaching. Not only were participants more prepared in these three areas, but they also felt more confident as they entered student teaching, what is often considered &quot;a baptism by fire.&quot; TPA 1 provided the structure, but the fieldwork infused into this state-mandated assessment made it relevant in a way that students genuinely valued.

        "description":"Despite good intentions and extensive planning by teacher education and/or induction programs, novice teachers frequently cite the first years as unsupported and lonely. Feelings of isolation and being overwhelmed help contribute to the large numbers of teachers leaving the profession. In fact, nearly 50 percent of all teachers will quit within the first five years, dissatisfied because of low salaries, student discipline problems, lack of support, working conditions, inadequate preparation, and little opportunity to participate in decision making. One approach to combating stress and fostering encouragement among teachers is offered by membership in support groups. Research shows that support groups reduce stress and feelings of isolation while cultivating enthusiasm, competency, and reflection. The collaborative study the authors offer in this article was an attempt for each of them, individually and collectively, to understand what they experienced as new teachers in order to improve their practice as educators and make sense of the complexity of teaching.

        "description":"Evidence suggests that student teaching is one of the most influential components of a teacher education program, and the cooperating teacher exerts the greatest influence on a student teacher. Therefore, it is vital to understand how the role of experienced teachers is affected by the implementation of a professional development school (PDS) as these individuals assume greater responsibility in the education of prospective teachers and in their own professional development. This paper synthesizes extant research related to the roles cooperating teachers assume under a PDS model and offers possibilities for the continued development of these roles. It first provides background on the PDS movement and describes traditional roles cooperating teachers have assumed. It then outlines organizational and personal prerequisites germane to ensuring that experienced teachers in PDSs become more intimately involved in teacher education and professional development. Positive effects as well as challenges of teachers' altered roles are described with implications for the success of future PDS endeavors. (Contains 1 note.)",

The credentialing reforms introduced in SB 2042 follow a tradition described by Irving Hendrik and stake their own claims regarding the locus of control over teacher quality, the role of teacher examinations, the balance point between pedagogical knowledge and academic content knowledge, the need for sustained preparation over time and mentored induction into teaching. This reform movement has the potential to bring to fruition ideas about learning to teach that have been evolving for some time in California's policy environment.

These programs resulted from a complex and multi-faceted process of change supported and influenced by reform initiatives at the regional, state and national levels over approximately a 15 year period. An analysis of the process that occurred at this urban, diverse, public university may be considered a case study to illustrate resources for and constraints against teacher education reform. This article situates this case study in the historical context of teacher reform in the United States, analyzes the state process of reform within the national context, outlines the regional endeavors that enabled much of the reform at this institution, and studies the transformation process from the perspective of a particular faculty and department.

        "description":"In 1992, the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment (BTSA) grant program was established to provide funded opportunities for first and second-year teachers having completed a preliminary or professional clear multiple/single subject, credential. Matriculating from a teacher preparation program to the classroom, they were ready to &quot;expand, enrich and deepen their teaching knowledge and skill through collegial reflection as well as continued instruction and study&quot;. Collegial reflection was accomplished with veteran educators while continued instruction and study occurred during ongoing district-based professional development coupled with a formative assessment system of inquiry. The BTSA program was designed to provide a smooth transition into the complex responsibilities of teaching, seeking to increase the retention of beginning teachers and improve learning opportunities for their K-12 students. Unlike other State-sponsored programs, BTSA is co-sponsored by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the California Department of Education. In this article the authors, who direct two large county BTSA consortia, describe how the transition from BTSA to BTSA Induction has dramatically changed the roles and responsibilities of school districts, BTSA Induction Directors, and the educational communities they serve. The authors will discuss four primary themes and illustrate why the transition has been difficult, and what future changes need to be made to ensure that SB 2042 Induction Programs will be successful in meeting the needs of new teachers. They are: (1) The evolving nature of California's landscape of support for new teachers; (2) System wide communication to all stakeholders; (3) Redirecting and redefining norms within a mature BTSA community; and (4) Protecting the integrity of BTSA and the induction requirements while promoting the success of beginning teachers. The article will conclude with thoughts concerning the future of teacher preparation, including California's BTSA Induction Program. (Contains 1 table and 1 note.)",

        "description":"Despite the ethnic and linguistic diversity found in California's public schools, or because of it, in 1998 voters approved Proposition 227, a ballot initiative designed to dismantle bilingual education programs in the state. By the 2003-2004 school year, the California Department of Education reports that statewide 8,908 teachers were providing primary language instruction to English learners (ELs), down dramatically from the 16,360 teachers who taught in primary language settings just five years prior. To date, the effectiveness of Proposition 227 and bilingual education are still being debated among politicians, policymakers, and educators with no end in sight. Notwithstanding the changing political climate and the educational policy shifts of the last 10 years, the need to effectively educate ethnically and linguistically diverse students is apparent. It is clear that the United States' public school system continues to become increasingly diverse and this is most evident in California, which has one of the most diverse student populations in the nation. Statewide, over 68 percent of students in public schools are classified as non-white, and over 1.5 million are classified as non-English-speaking. Within the latter group, over 85% of these students come from Spanish-speaking backgrounds. Given this large critical mass, these students' needs are the focus of this article. The authors argue that in order to work effectively with this population, and to combat the long history of Latino student underachievement in the public education system, the state must improve the overall quality of education provided. This includes, among other things, having access to &quot;highly qualified&quot; teachers capable of providing the necessary critical and technical skills to succeed academically and socially in the global society. Within the context of this journal, Senate Bill 2042 (SB 2042) has been addressed in great detail, particularly as it relates to the bill's consequences on teacher preparation and teacher credentialing. This article will focus on specific implications and consequences, both intended and unintended, of SB 2042 with regard to the essential preparation of teachers who possess the background knowledge, expertise, and dispositions to serve the large number of Spanish-speakers within a heritage language context, &quot;despite&quot; the decreasing presence of bilingual education programs statewide.

        "description":"In September 1998, the California State Legislature passed SB 2042, legislation that authorized the reform of teacher recruitment, certification, and licensing in the state. Its provisions are unique in that they represent the first time in California's history that almost all of the standards dealing with teacher preparation and induction were revised at the same time; every currently approved program that prepares teachers was requested to rewrite and submit program documents in a short time frame; the basic teaching credential was revised to carry the authorization to teach English Learners; and a requirement was created to mandate use of an assessment of teaching performance based on teaching performance expectations. The intent of SB 2042 was to use the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP), Teaching Performance Expectancies (TPEs), and a teacher performance assessment (TPA) and allied reform requirements to reform teacher education and prepare high quality teachers. The purpose of this research study was to evaluate the initial impact of SB 2042 on subject matter preparation and professional teacher preparation in California. The study has limited scope, as it took place over a six-month period and captured the impact on colleges, universities and school districts during the 2002-2003 academic year, the initial year of implementation. It also compared the experiences of early and late adopters of the reform. The findings provided feedback to the state on how the process worked, what the major successes and challenges were, and generated suggestions for the next phase of implementation. The main research questions were: (1) How did individuals and groups experience the process of implementing SB 2042 credential reform in CA? (2) What has been the impact of SB 2042 implementation on programs and curricula? (3) What has been the impact of credential reform on instructional and assessment practices (e.g., faculty development, candidate assessment, resources allocation)? (4) What has been the impact of credential reform on districts, other institutional partners, and other partners? and (5) How did early adopters differ from late adopters?

We examine meaning-making in counselling through the lenses of three research methods: (a) discourse analysis, (b) hermeneutic-phenomenology, and (c) autoethnography. Specifically, we relate the process and experience of counselling in ways consistent with how meaning-making is regarded by each of these research methods. In this regard, we describe each method as if it was a counselling theory. We conclude by reflecting upon how these lenses on meaning-making and counselling can inform counselling practice generally and generatively.",

        "description":"Developing enough quality credentialed teachers to meet the needs of America's children is the paramount goal of teacher education programs and school districts across the country and, since 2001, required by the federal mandate, No Child Left Behind (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, 2002). However, according to a 2002 report, &quot;Rather than getting closer to a qualified teacher in every classroom, the data indicate that we are drifting farther from that objective as candidates in all fields are becoming more difficult to find&quot; (American Association for Employment in Education, 2002, p.9). This current study attends directly to the question, &quot;What is the future demand for credentialed teachers in California?&quot; The authors have developed a dynamic-behavioral model to forecast the demand for credentialed teachers in California through 2012. The model is more complex than some models that attempt to forecast teacher demand using a static-mechanical approach, which simply takes into account the net difference between the current number of active credentialed teachers less those who retire and those credentialed teachers entering the field. The current model serves as a tool to facilitate decision and policy makers as they attempt to create a system of balance between the supply and demand of quality credentialed teachers in California and the nation. Without such a model, decision makers have very limited tools to help support their actions and to increase the chance that such actions will lead to the desired outcomes. With the proper decision support tools, decision- and policy-makers can continually update the model as conditions change and adjust their decisions accordingly. (Contains 11 figures and 2 tables.)",

        "description":"In this paper, the author proposes that a social reconstructionist framework of reflective practice provides an important orientation for preservice teachers to more successfully negotiate the rapidly changing contexts in which they will no doubt teach. She first illuminates the influence others have had on her understanding of reflection, arguably a somewhat elusive concept. Next, she briefly describes a group of preservice teachers engaged in a reflective study group and presents the framework she developed as result of her role as participant observer/facilitator of this group. The framework is primarily intended to be used as a tool for teacher educators to define and identify patterns of reflection in preservice teachers' oral and written discussions. In an effort to illuminate the social reconstructionist orientation of the framework and to situate it more specifically in the context of teacher preparation, the author utilizes examples of dialogue that took place in the study group. The preservice teachers' voices become a definition of sorts and provide models of reflective practice. This framework can help teacher educators consider how they might scaffold reflective development within a teacher education program and provide a structural tool for modeling and assessment. In the concluding remarks, she delineates how this reflective framework more broadly contributes to teacher education. (Contains 1 table.)",

The possibility of blending inquiry-based teaching with a sheltered instruction framework seems a promising method for providing high-quality science learning experiences to students who are still working to attain English fluency. However, through the authors' work with second graders, many of whom were ELLs, they perceived substantial discrepancies between their successes with teaching science by inquiry versus the manner in which sheltered instruction has been represented to them. The authors do not see this conflict as insurmountable; nevertheless, a fresh conceptualization of the interface between inquiry-based science teaching and sheltered instruction seems necessary. This article reports a study which represents a modest effort at addressing the issue. (Contains 5 figures.)",

It is is organized in three sections, and begins by offering a rationale for a new pedagogy. It goes on to discuss the theoretical foundations of the TIEL model. Finally it looks at contributions to the knowledge base of teaching that includes examples of implementation of the TIEL model. The rationale contextualizes the discussion in the broad sweep of education in the last century and provides a short review of literature that supports the preparation of teachers in the areas of intellectual and social-emotional processes. The theoretical section includes an analysis of the conceptual foundations of the TIEL framework. The final section explains four ways in which TIEL contributes to the knowledge base of teaching and includes examples of how implementation of the TIEL framework affects the roles of teacher educators, teachers, and P-12 students.

Using science notebooks with preservice teachers accomplishes two goals: (1) It introduces preservice teachers to a beneficial assessment tool; and (2) It provides information on preservice teachers' science conceptual understanding and process skill knowledge. Writing about science in their notebooks is an important step in the development of preservice teachers' science literacy (content knowledge, inquiry skills and disposition toward using critical thinking/science reasoning in decision-making). This article reports a study which focused on the science notebook as a formative assessment tool in a science methods course and the resultant views held by preservice teachers on the value of this assessment tool for their future practice.

        "description":"School-based coaching for literacy teachers has taken on an important role in school reform in recent years. Although the literature contains numerous and compelling descriptions of the perceived, positive effects of mentoring, reviews of the literature base on mentoring and/or coaching over the past 20 years have consistently identified the need for the development of empirically-based knowledge of mentoring. Qualitative research is needed in order to move discussions of mentoring from the abstract to an experiential level in contrast to the prevailing \"manic optimism\" with which mentoring and coaching are typically viewed. The mentoring and coaching of teachers has become a highly systematic and officially recognized practice. It is within the context of coaches' thought processes that the hope of instructional reform is interpreted and enacted, where coaches coach and teachers learn. Little is currently known, however, concerning the assumptions about knowledge, learning, and teaching underlying the work of coaches or mentors. This paper reports a case study which addresses this area of research through an analysis of the working hypotheses and themes for coaching articulated by two school-based, primary grade literacy coaches over the course of one school year.

        "author":["Dass, Pradeep M."],
        "description":"Reformed preparation of science teachers is indeed vital for the vision of science teaching reform to be accomplished. Typically, a critical component of a preservice science teacher preparation program is the science teaching methods course. The usual intent of this course is to help preservice science students develop an understanding of various aspects of science instruction such as pedagogical approaches, management strategies, and assessment techniques. For the most part, these aspects are taught as separate instructional units or topics. Since the methods course is taken prior to student teaching and may not include a field component, preservice science students often do not get a simultaneous opportunity to experience how these different aspects interplay in the actual classroom context. In order to \"reform\" a secondary science teaching methods course, the author implemented a Science/Technology/Society (STS) approach to engage the preservice science students in scientific explorations around issues, questions or problems drawn from real life situations. Thus, they experienced science learning in much the same way as their high school students ought to, for the reform vision to be accomplished. Various aspects of science instruction such as classroom management and assessment were addressed within the context of these scientific explorations. The semester-long methods course was organized around these explorations which provided his preservice science students with a hands-on/minds-on experience in science instruction that embodied the spirit of current reform in the teaching of science. The study reported in this article was aimed at exploring the impact STS approaches have on preservice science students' understanding of the visions of contemporary science education reform and their attitudes toward contributing to this reform.

        "description":"The U.S. Department of Education (USDOE, 2004) administers a formula grant program to states that is intended to increase the academic achievement of students in mathematics and science by enhancing the content knowledge and teaching skills of classroom teachers. Partnerships between high-need school districts and the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty in institutions of higher education are at the core of these improvement efforts. These programs articulate the President's priority of using partnering to close the achievement gap in math and science between majority and minority and/or disadvantaged students in order to keep the U.S. competitive in international markets. However, in rural communities, the infrastructure for developing these partnerships (i.e., nearby institutions of higher education, stable economic base, human resources) is often not available. In this article, the authors explore how, within the context of a previous national educational reform effort--the National Science Foundation's Rural Systemic Initiative (RSI)--rural communities overcame these obstacles to form viable and meaningful partnerships that strengthened both their schools and communities. This information offers a number of lessons learned about how partnerships are, or are not, formed in the rural community context, which can inform the work of the current Math and Science Partnership efforts.

The purpose of the study was to find out what teacher educators of color bring to their work and to the teaching profession--what are their experiences, goals, intentions, passions, challenges and hopes--and how they see themselves in relation to their White peers. The data indicate that one strong theme that exemplified the responses of all members of the group--their experiences, goals, perceptions--was diversity. Respondents clearly placed \"issues of diversity at the center of their teaching\" practice as well as their thinking about all facets of teacher preparation including advisement, curriculum, supervision, and student teaching. For these teacher educators of color, it was patently evident that diversity is integral to teacher education, fueled apparently by their deep concern for \"the demographic imperative\" which demands \"that the educational community must take action in order to alter the disparities deeply embedded in the American educational system.\" By firmly centering their practice in diversity and social justice, the teacher educators of color in this study underscore that multicultural education cannot be an add-on in teacher education. Rather, their responses indicate that they believe that multicultural education must be woven throughout teacher education as \"a comprehensive approach to the teaching role which informs and guides all aspects of classroom practice.\" (Contains 3 notes.)",

        "author":["Neapolitan, Jane"],
        "description":"When the author was a little girl, her father told her the story of how he once saw the great Harry Houdini escape from a straight jacket. In the early 1900s, Houdini fascinated thousands of people by performing feats of life-threatening daring and agility. Houdini was a professional in the traditional sense: he acted alone, kept his trade secrets to himself, and instilled respect in his audience. As a teacher educator, the author now looks upon Harry Houdini's magic act as a metaphor for her own work. For the past four years, she has served as a researcher, teacher educator, and mentor in a Professional Development School (PDS) and she has come to know the anticipation of the audience (applause!) the jeers of some bystanders (boo!) and the need to rethink what she is doing (duh)! In this article, the author reflects on what she believes are some of the key issues concerning research in the PDS magic show from the standpoint of the person in the straight jacket. She first describes the status of inquiry and research in PDS and how it relates to the expectations of the National PDS Standards set forth by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). This is followed by a detailed description of the case of a PDS that conducted an inquiry project as part of its participation in the NCATE PDS Standards Field Test Project (1998-2001). The case study provides an illustration of the benefits as well as shortcomings of doing PDS research, and she includes some lessons learned while she served as the research liaison for NCATE. Finally, the author discusses the lessons learned from the case study as they relate to using inquiry and research in PDS to their fullest potential.",

In response to legislative and policy changes, a growing number of schools and districts across the United States are adopting inclusive education models that integrate students with disabilities into the general education environment. However, important questions remain regarding the specific knowledge and skills needed by both general and special education teachers to effectively implement inclusive educational models. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate the essential competencies for special and general educators needed to effectively educate students with disabilities within inclusive settings.

        "description":"Second language learners continue to languish in California public schools in spite of six years of promises following passage of the controversial ballot initiative &quot;English for the Children&quot; (Proposition 227) to fix the education of English Language Learners (ELLs) through English-only instruction. In addition, with the development of new standards for teacher preparation programs following Senate Bill 2042, it is likely that the curriculum and instructional practices for heritage language students will become even more disconnected from the lived experiences of second language learners. This article discusses how the call for English-only instruction espoused by Proposition 227 and the one-size-fits-all, standards-based, mechanical instructional practice espoused by SB 2042 can have dramatic negative effects for second-language learners. As such, it is imperative for educators to adhere to the rules they need to conform to, but also be aware of what will truly be effective for second language learners. This article also suggests seven components that can help educators implement effective instructional practices for heritage language learners within mainstream settings. These components include: (1) parental support, (2) cross-aged and peer tutoring, (3) primary language cooperative learning groups, (4) computer and multimedia technology, (5) bilingual paraprofessionals, (6) integrated primary language activities, and (7) status of the language.",

Being labeled as disabled often has a negative impact on social relationships and self-concept and long-term outcomes such as graduation and employment. Disproportionate identification of students from certain ethnic and racial groups begins in general education when teachers view a child's poor academic performance and/or behavior as a problem inherent to the child. It is critical for general education teachers and administrators to understand the relationship between insufficient supports and interventions in the classroom--academic and behavioral--and the overrepresentation of minorities in special education. This paper examines the issue and explains general education practices that may reduce the number of students inappropriately identified and referred for special services. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Learning to teach is a developmental process. This process begins in some fashion when a person enters formal schooling and ideally continues throughout life, with good teachers always becoming better teachers. Teaching is perhaps the only career in which people have such an extended term of development. Unfortunately, nearly all of this growth in teaching is informal, haphazard and idiosyncratic. Only during a miniscule portion of this career development are individuals given formal, research-based information on the act of becoming a teacher. In California, formal university preparation is required by law to take no longer than one year, and new teachers then have induction programs of varying support for only the early years of their career. Numerous studies have noted that this relatively brief period of formal training is inadequate to change the beliefs and attitudes of teachers. The study reported in this article began with the following question in mind: Whether a one year intervention during mid-development is adequate to produce any great change in what teachers believe about teaching. It had two purposes. First, the study was designed to look at what the beliefs about teaching really are for entering pre-service teachers. Second, the study sought to determine whether these beliefs could be changed during the coursework of a fifth-year teacher preparation program. Findings from the study will help to answer the essential question of the efficacy of fifth-year teacher preparation programs for changing teacher beliefs. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Children in foster care face a challenging journey through childhood. In addition to the troubling family circumstances that bring them into state care, they face additional difficulties within the child welfare system that may further compromise their healthy development. This article discusses the importance of safety and stability to healthy child development and reviews the research on the risks associated with maltreatment and the foster care experience. It finds: (1) Family stability is best viewed as a process of caregiving practices that, when present, can greatly facilitate healthy child development; (2) Children in foster care, as a result of exposure to risk factors such as poverty, maltreatment, and the foster care experience, face multiple threats to their healthy development, including poor physical health, attachment disorders, compromised brain functioning, inadequate social skills, and mental health difficulties; and (3) Providing stable and nurturing families can bolster the resilience of children in care and ameliorate negative impacts on their developmental outcomes. The author concludes that developmentally-sensitive child welfare policies and practices designed to promote the well-being of the whole child, such as ongoing screening and assessment and coordinated systems of care, are needed to facilitate the healthy development of children in foster care.

        "description":"In the 1990s, fueled by the momentum of the inclusive schools movement, where students with disabilities were being encouraged to participate in their neighborhood schools and adults with disabilities were self-advocating for a chance at community independence, the collaboration model among professionals burgeoned as best practice for serving individuals with disabilities. However, although the concept of collaboration was recognized as a best practice initiative, most service providers were not prepared to make the leap to discipline reciprocity where professionals were required to actually practice cross-disciplinary skills in the workplace. With this historical framework and gap in the research in mind, the faculty of the Special Education Program at the Benerd School of Education, University of the Pacific, in collaboration with another faculty member from the Speech-Language Pathology Department, Long School of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, applied and were awarded a James Irvine Learning Assessment Grant to form an interprofessional, interdisciplinary working group. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the interprofessional collaborative group process, identify the outcomes of the collaborative working group and gather the perceptions of the faculty participants concerning their involvement in the group. The second component to the study was to measure the perceptions of students concerning their participation in the undergraduate course &quot;Introduction to the Helping Professions.&quot; (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"In teacher education settings, the extent of collaboration is far less evident than in K-12 education. There is some evidence that suggests, however, that this may be changing. Teaming among higher education faculty has been identified as one way to provide teachers with greater exposure to diverse fields of knowledge and practice, as well as to model Association of Teacher Educator (ATE) standards. Some programs have created a common core of coursework for all education majors. Some ensure that general and special education preservice students work side by side during common training experiences. Some programs have been recreated and labeled as \"unified\" or \"inclusive\" and promote dual special education-general education licensure programs. With various forms of teacher education faculty teaming being forwarded as ways to better prepare teachers for a more diverse world of teaching, questions arise about how faculty engage in such teaming practices. This study describes the experiences and perspectives of six higher education faculty who team-taught courses to preservice general and special education students. Each team included one general education and one special education faculty member. (Contains 2 tables.)",

The authors begin with an overview of some of the federal and state initiatives that are presenting challenges for schools and teacher preparation programs. They then look at &quot;lessons learned&quot; from several teacher preparation programs that have responded to reform mandates by developing programs that increase collaboration between generalists and specialists. These examples will show how in some instances teacher preparation programs respond to reform initiatives in a piecemeal fashion by continually adding courses as new mandates occur, while other programs make revisions with limited lasting effects, and still others rework their entire program to accommodate new mandates guided by a shared vision of truly collaborative teacher preparation.",

        "description":"In recent years, different professional and academic settings have been increasingly utilizing ePortfolios to serve multiple purposes from recruitment to evaluation. This paper analyzes ePortfolios created by graduate students at a Canadian university. Demonstrated is how students' constructions can, and should, be more than a simple compilation of artifacts. Examined is an online learning environment whereby we shared knowledge, supported one another in knowledge construction, developed collective expertise, and engaged in progressive discourse. In our analysis of the portfolios, we focused on reflection and deepening understanding of learning. We discussed students' use of metaphors and hypertexts as means of making cognitive connections. We found that when students understood technological tools and how to use them to substantiate their thinking processes and to engage the readers/viewers, their ePortfolios were richer and more complex in their illustrations of learning. With more experience and further analysis of exemplars of existing portfolios, students became more nuanced in their organization of their ePortfolios, reflecting the messages they conveyed. Metaphors and hypertexts became useful vehicles to move away from linearity and chronology to new organizational modes that better illustrated students' cognitive processes. In such a community of inquiry, developed within an online learning space, the instructor and peers had an important role in enhancing reflection through scaffolding. We conclude the paper with a call to explore the interactions between viewer/reader and the materials presented in portfolios as part of learning occasions.

Participants included 283 middle school teachers, 171 from high-performing middle schools, and 112 from low-performing middle schools. Questionnaires were used to gather information about middle school practices, school climate, and school health. Data suggested that low-performing middle schools scored higher on organizational structures, supportive, directive, and committed behavior, collegial leadership, principal influence, and resource support. High-performing schools scored higher on collegial behavior. No significant differences were found in institutional integrity, teacher affiliation, academic emphasis, instructional practices, and restrictive and disengaged behavior.

The study involved two teachers and fifty-two students in grades 6 through 8. Two sections of middle school science were taught by two longtime teachers where one used an STS approach and the other retained a typical use of the textbook as a class organizer. Each teacher administered the same pre- and post-assessments. Major findings indicated that middle school students experiencing the STS format with constructivist teaching practices: (1) learned basic concepts as well as students who studied them directly from the textbook, (2) achieved as much general concept mastery as students who studied in a textbook dominated way, (3) applied science concepts in new situations better than students who studied science in a more traditional way, (4) developed more positive attitudes about science, (5) exhibited creativity skills that were more individual and occurred more often, and (6) learned and used science at home and in the community more than students in the typical textbook dominated section. Further, the STS approach coincided well with the kind of teaching across the curriculum that is (recommended as) central to teaching in middle schools. (Contains 7 tables.)",

Data were collected from a sample of incoming urban sixth graders using a computer-assisted questionnaire. Data were analyzed as cross-sectional using the responses of 111 African American adolescents, ages 10-14 years. The median responses of adolescents about perceptions of parental academic monitoring were used to classify adolescents into two groups, lower and higher perceived academic monitoring. Logistic regression and stratified analyses determined factors related to higher parental academic monitoring. Adolescents' perceived parental general support (OR: 2.08, CI: 1.29-3.36) and friends' pro-social behavior (OR: 1.54, CI: 1.03-2.30), were significant factors in the multivariate model. Also, adolescents living with one biological parent and with other adults were more likely to report higher parental academic monitoring, compared to adolescents living with one biological parent and no other adults (OR: 3.58, CI: 1.00-12.83). Perceptions of general parental support and peer groups offer insight into why parental academic monitoring allows only some African American urban youth to succeed academically. Parental support provides a context that influences youths' perceptions of their parents' academic monitoring and should be considered in future research. Results identify factors in a high-risk population that may help explain why some urban youth succeed academically while others do not. (Contains 3 tables and 2 figures.)",

        "description":"This longitudinal study followed students (n = 265) from kindergarten through seventh grade and examined early social and academic predictors of school performance at two normative school transitions. Questions addressed include: (a) are there changes in students' school performance over time, especially at school transition points; (b) are changes in school performance dependent on sociodemographic factors; and, (c) does early social and academic competence predict stability or change in school performance following transition? Early social and academic competence was assessed in kindergarten via teacher report and standardized tests. Days absent, discipline infractions, and mathematics and language arts letter grades obtained from school records served as outcome variables. Findings showed stability for outcomes with the exception of discipline; discipline infractions increased after the first transition. Sociodemographic factors predicted greater performance declines following transition. Early social competence predicted reduced discipline; students rated as more socially competent in kindergarten were less likely to show discipline increases during transition, after controlling for demographic factors. Findings emphasize behavioral and academic stability suggesting that early social competencies forecast fewer increases in discipline infractions at school transition points.

In this study, preservice teachers from an elementary and a secondary preparation program were interviewed about their conceptions of teaching social studies at the middle school level. The results indicated that the social studies methods course in each pathway strongly influenced the preservice teachers' ideas about pedagogical strategies for teaching social studies, but did little to facilitate the preservice teachers' understanding of teaching young adolescents. These findings draw attention to the need for more research and teacher education focused on teaching at the middle school level. (Contains 2 tables and 3 footnotes.)",

The impact this authentic pedagogy had on preservice teachers' developing knowledge of middle school teaming is documented through student artifacts (e.g., journals, assignments), tape-recorded interviews, and field notes. The data were analyzed using techniques from grounded theory and constant comparative methods. Findings indicated that preservice teachers (a) built cohesiveness and community, (b) developed skills necessary for working on effective teams, and (c) recognized and valued the authenticity of the experience. The study offers a number of implications for middle level educators. First, virtual teaming created an authentic non-clinical setting for preservice teachers to take risks, learn about themselves, and explore middle level organizational principles. Second, time taken to build community in the class was invaluable, allowing teams to overcome conflicts, trust one another, and enhance learning.",

A middle school transition survey measured the academic and social middle school transitional experiences of 196 adolescent boys and girls from divorced families. T-Test for Independent Means procedures revealed statistically significant differences between the male and female participants' adjustment to the academic transition (F = 4.36, p less than 0.05) and social transition (F = 3.79, p less than 0.05) to middle school. The findings showed that girls from divorced families were more adjusted to the academic and social characteristics of the middle school transition than were boys from divorced families. One particular analysis revealed that girls from divorced families were less adjusted to making friends than were boys from divorced families. Overall, this and other findings indicate that gender can affect the transitional experiences of adolescents from divorced families. They also warrant the need to develop an awareness of the possible divorce-related transitional difficulties for middle school boys and girls. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Results demonstrated that professional learning community activities--that comprised same-subject, same-grade teacher teams--had the potential to achieve significant improvements in teaching effectiveness, but this effectiveness depended on a number of factors. Contributing factors included leadership and organizational practices, the substantive details of PLC activity meetings, the nature of conversations in PLC activities, and the development of community among PLC teams.

        "description":"South Carolina made a significant step forward in middle level education reform by enacting middle level teacher certification in 2001. This qualitative case study documents the process through which the state legislation developed, with a particular focus on how middle level teacher certification arrived and remained on the public policy agenda in South Carolina. The study is framed by three key research questions, which are derived from Kingdon's (1995) theoretical model of the policy process: (1) How did middle level teacher certification become defined as a public policy problem or issue in South Carolina? (2) What policy solutions addressing the problem of middle level teacher certification in South Carolina were or became available to decision makers? and (3) What political processes and conditions were involved in advancing and sustaining middle level teacher certification as a legislative agenda item? Data sources for the study include records of semi-structured interviews and conversations with key actors (i.e., policy makers and other public officials, faculty and administrators in higher education, and school district personnel), as well as policy documents and reports. In a political climate in which any educational change is tenuous, it is critical for middle level reform advocates to understand the many facets of the policy process. This study illuminates the essential role of bottom-up pressure for middle level reform at the state level; it maps the relationships that formed among state officials, higher education, and school personnel; and it highlights the importance of key individuals in moving the policy process forward.",

These teachers were most familiar with behavioral and cognitive approaches to motivation. They generally reported mastery-oriented beliefs, behaviors, and school goal structures, although elementary teachers rated school goal structures as more mastery-oriented and less performance-oriented than did middle school teachers. Counter to student-reported goal orientations found in previous studies, teachers at both levels believed their students held performance goal orientations. Teachers can promote mastery-oriented classrooms and school goal structures at elementary and middle school levels. (Contains 8 tables and 5 figures.)",

We also believe that by fostering more cooperation and more compassion in school culture, we can reduce school violence. One of the ways to develop school culture is to implement conflict resolution training. In the current study, we introduced conflict resolution training at a middle school. We chose to focus on middle school students because these are the years when bullying is especially prevalent in school culture. As a team of researchers and educators, we piloted a conflict resolution program, entitled Project WIN: Working out Integrated Negotiations, in a low-income, urban middle school in southeast Pennsylvania. The evaluation showed the program decreased reported violence and increased students' abilities to apply conflict resolution tools in hypothetical conflict situations. Specifically, the students learned to transform competitive situations into cooperative ones. Moreover, findings indicated greater competence in conflict-with-a-friend, as contrasted to conflict-with-a-classmate. We considered these results in the context of other work in this area, especially the Peacemakers model by David and Roger Johnson at the University of Minnesota. (Contains 5 tables and 2 figures.)",

After districts were determined, each middle school principal in the selected district was provided with a questionnaire. Seventy-five of 120 principals(16 from Indiana, 36 from Kentucky, 23 from Ohio) completed questionnaires for a response rate of 63%. The principals expressed apprehension about teacher dispositions and the social aspects of teaching that may be compromised in an online program, as well as general ethical concerns surrounding online courses. If middle grades principals are to acknowledge ultimately the marketability of online teacher preparation, the degree-granting institutions need to address these concerns and actively seek the input of administrators in program design.

        "description":"Authentic and constructive learning experiences that include analysis of primary source documents are necessary elements of effective social studies teaching (Bailyn, 1994; Leinhardt, Stainton, & Virji, 1994; Wineburg & Wilson, 1991; Young & Leinhardt, 1998). This study examines the abilities of 70 fifth and seventh grade students to complete individual and multiple primary source document analyses based on their current background knowledge. Three researchers coded by grade, level of response (content), and type of processing (analysis of written discourse connectors and organization of written discourse) the completed document analysis tool responses. Rather than relying on others to interpret history for them, findings indicate that engaging students with primary source documents exercises the critical-thinking skills needed to analyze and interpret historical documents. However, this can be a very challenging task for students at this level. After connecting the study's results to current research, the article concludes with a set of practical suggestions.

        "description":"This study compared two configurations of sixth-grade students and core teachers to measure the students' perceived levels of social bonding with their peers, their school, and their teachers. One configuration featured a team of four teachers, each specializing in a core subject area and teaching this subject to all 100 students on the team. The other configuration featured a team of two teachers, both delivering multiple core curricula to 50 students. The researcher used three measures of social bonding to compare the two configurations--approximately 250 sixth graders in the 100-student/four-teacher configuration and approximately 250 sixth graders in the 50-student/two-teacher configuration. A sample of ten teaching teams was matched on size, SES, and percentage of minority students. A matched-paired set of t-tests was conducted for each measure of social bonding to determine the effect of interdisciplinary team organization. A comparison of the combined scores of the five schools of the 50-student/two-teacher configuration with the combined scores of the five schools of the 100-student/four-teacher configuration revealed that students' scores were significantly higher on all three measures of social bonding for students of the 50-student/two-teacher interdisciplinary teaching team configuration.

        "description":"Systematic Treatment Selection (STS) is a form of technical eclectism that develops and plans treatments using empirically founded principles of psychotherapy. It is a model that provides systematic guidelines for the utilization of different psychotherapeutic strategies based on patient qualities and problem characteristics. Historically, it stems from accumulating evidence that no single theory is effective in treating all patients and common characteristics shared among different theoretical philosophies. A review of the literature and further research resulted in the extraction of four main decisional domains that are involved in determining effective treatment strategies. These domains include: (1) patient predisposing qualities, (2) treatment context, (3) relationship variables, and (4) intervention selection. These main principles provide the basis for which guidelines have been developed to systematically individualize treatment plans. The next step in the process is to effectively disseminate and implement this model, in which students and clinicians are taught to operate from a patient based rather than a theory based perspective.",

        "description":"In school settings, behavior analysts are often called in to consult on severe behavioral issues that surpass the knowledge, experience, and training of local school personnel. Severe behavior such as aggression to staff, SIB, and property destruction are common severe behavior referrals. The benefits of functional assessments, functional analyses, preference assessments, treatment analyses, and generalization analyses have been well documented in school and clinic-based research. However, to date, a unified framework to guide behavior analysts through these best practices in school settings has not been proposed. Further, although theoretical models for school consultation have been proposed (viz., Direct Behavioral Consultation), no empirical case examples of existing models have been published. The current paper describes the Behavior Analytic Consultation to Schools (BACS) model, its application to severe behavior problems, and provides 2 case examples of the BACS model to solve difficult severe behavior referrals in school settings.

The results of the review highlight the mixed and inconsistent findings that have been reported in the literature. While fear arousal appears important for attracting attention, its contribution to behaviour change appears less  critical than other factors, such as perceptions of vulnerability and effective coping strategies. Furthermore, threatening appeals targeting young males (a high-risk group of concern) have traditionally relied on the portrayal of physical harm. However, the available evidence questions the relevance, and hence effectiveness, of strong physical threats with this group. Consequently, further research is required to determine the optimum way to utilise fear in road safety advertising, as well as the type of threat(s) most effective with different road users.

In addition to addressing the challenging behaviors that many students without disabilities exhibit, more and more students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) are being included in the general education classroom. Effective instruction and the development of effective instructional environments have been demonstrated to decrease problem behaviors in students with histories of failure in school. Positive behavior support (PBS) provides a framework for considering development of instructional environments that increase the teacher's ability to deliver effective instruction to all students, thereby increasing success rates and reducing negative behavior across the school. The same PBS features: prediction, prevention, consistency, and evaluation apply in the classroom to decrease the number of problem behaviors and increase academic and social success. This paper presents a description of the key features of effective classroom PBS and demonstrates each via the use of case examples. The premise of PBS is that the more effectively the environment is designed, more effective it can be in facilitating classrooms that run smoothly and efficiently, allowing teachers to recognize, assess, and plan for students with special needs.",

Several studies were identified that used a common outcome measure of reduction of physical and sexual aggression, other risk related behaviors. Comparisons of MDT and, other standardized approaches typically used in treating aggression in juveniles, were made. The studies involved individual clients and small groups using MDT and comparative methodology. The studies involved varying periods in treatment settings and longitudinal follow ups. The results document a greater degree of treatment success for MDT as compared with a standard Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) or Social Skills Training (SST). These comparisons were made in varying combinations, with observances made with similar subjects or subject groups. The degree of change associated with MDT was highly discernable in the studies, and will be reviewed and evaluated in meta-analysis study in the near future. MDT was developed for an specific age group, (141/2-18) with specific disorders. It has been demonstrated as an effective methodology as an Evidenced Based Psychotherapy.

This entwinement will be understood both in terms of its capacity to \"position\" the subject, and yet concomitantly as a site of disavowal, refusal, and subjective agency. In this manner, the personal commitment of the author to art education will be developed in a way to implicate early school and familial experiences with art. Such early autobiographical experiences arguably form the coordinates of our identities as art educators, and similarly, constitute the key issues with which we must necessarily grapple in pedagogical practice. It is in negotiation with such issues and early enculturation that this article argues our relationship to art curriculum and practice is located. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"This two-year study focused on the lived terms of inquiry in middle-school science classrooms. The conditions that enable teachers to see and act on science learning as ongoing inquiry were deliberately sought in Year 2. Nine science teachers participated in search of capacities connecting curriculum, teaching, and assessment for greater student and teacher inquiry. An online logbook chronicled this search, serving as a dialogic medium revealing a movement of teachers seeking out and seizing back possibilities for teaching and learning in relation to the given realities of classrooms. The nature and role of formative assessments in support of learning were encountered as the obstacle to be worked out in teachers' practical action. The necessary interpretive eye and capacity to act in accordance with the dynamic character of formative assessments became the task at hand for teachers and researchers. This task demanded artistic teaching visions, attending to the creation of student meaning on an individual and collective basis. The difficulty, alongside the necessity, of educating artistic teaching visions offered glimpses into how formative assessment use holds potential to restore the participatory dynamic integral to learning. The philosophical/theoretical ground of arts based educational research was found to offer much potential to science inquiry, linking process-product-learner in support of formative assessment use and offering implications for a participatory mode of professional development.",

        "description":"The Australian Federal Government's call for another teacher education inquiry aims to investigate preservice teacher preparedness for teaching. Art education was selected for this study as the teaching of art education in primary schools occurs in less than ideal conditions and may often be avoided by generalist primary teachers (Russell-Bowie, 2002). Eighty-seven final-year preservice teachers were surveyed on their perceptions of their preparedness for teaching primary art education at the conclusion of their Bachelor of Education program. The 39 survey items were derived from the New South Wales' Creative Arts K-6 State Syllabus (Board of Studies, 2000) across four stage levels (i.e., early stage 1, stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3). Percentages and mean scale scores suggested that these final-year preservice teachers believed they were generally prepared to teach art education in primary schools as a result of a preservice teacher education visual arts unit. Nevertheless, more than 10% of preservice teachers indicated they could not agree or strongly agree that they could provide 20 of the 39 teaching practices advocated by the syllabus and 20% indicated this for 7 of the 39 teaching practices. Tertiary education institutions need to be proactive in responding to the challenge of determining preservice teachers' preparedness for teaching. Surveys linked to a state syllabus may assist in assessing preservice teachers' perceptions of their preparedness for teaching and may provide valuable information for further development of tertiary education coursework.

One is dressed in black--grunge shirt, pants and boots, while the other stands barefoot in a simple white dress. The black-clad figure removes three red paper hearts from her twin's chest, leaving crimson gashes in her clothing as the white-clad twin morphs into three mutilated figures. The wounded trio sings to their other self, \"no matter which way you go, no matter which way you stay, you're out of my mind, out of my mind . . .\" In this article, we respond to the ways that Tegan and Sara's music video relies on their twin bodies as visual and metaphorical narrative devices as well as sites for re-inscribing cultural memory. We do this by presenting and analyzing our personal audiovisual responses (hypertextual video shorts) to \"Walking with a Ghost.\" Employing an autoethnographic arts-based research approach, we visually and metaphorically inscribe our own video bodies with text and images to explore personal and cultural reactions. Further, using the experiences of a graduate art education technology class' work with the video, we share the curricular implications for understanding how memory and the body affect, inform, and alter human perception.

The descriptions show how the children not only made representations, but also manipulated these in abstract ways as they created and recreated images, ideas and feelings. The findings illustrate how the child becomes a cast of one, taking on &quot;multiple roles&quot; (i.e., artist, author, director, scripter, performer and narrator) and selecting when and how to play with all the available voices offered through the multimodal media--drawing, &quot;telling&quot;, dramatization, expressive sound effects, gesture and movement. These multiple texts involved &quot;embodied authoring&quot;--layers of visual and physical action, character development, plot scheme, scenery and running narrative working in harmony, simultaneously. Children's open-ended construction of meaning surfaced content that reflected universal story themes such as good-evil and capturing-defending, and their voices often were powerful, humorous, philosophical and reflective. Yet the sequencing of events did not necessarily follow linear structures--instead, the children worked within &quot;fluid structures&quot;. (Contains 2 figures.)",

Through this exploration, they relate literature on apprentice models of teaching and learning, relational education, resiliency theory, and care in the context of classroom practice to their experience and research into teaching and learning in photography and ceramic arts. Albertson and Davidson believe that what is good for the most vulnerable learners, is good for others too, and by bringing these attributes to light, it is their goal to illustrate some of the ways that all teachers might build pathways to engagement for their own \"tough audiences\" in all subject areas.

In this study we examine three high school senior boys who, as part of a unit of instruction on identity, each produced a mask through which he artistically expressed his sense of self. Using a sociocultural framework based in the work of Vygotsky, we analyzed the boys' composition of their masks in terms of their goals for working on the project, the material and psychological tools they employed to produce the masks, and the settings in which they learned how to use their compositional tools for such purposes. Based on both concurrent and retrospective protocols that the boys produced in conjunction with composing their masks, we investigated their processes of composition as what Gee terms \"identity projects\"; i.e., as efforts to project themselves into their mask texts and as part of their long-term projects to explore and develop their personal and socially-situated identities. Each participant used the mask-making composition as an occasion for inscribing his experiences, beliefs, and emotions into the text, albeit in different ways and toward different ends. The study concludes with a consideration of the use of arts in literacy education, a reconsideration of the limitations of language-based-only conceptions of literacy, and the possibilities for expanded learning opportunities when English/Language Arts classes open up students' textual tool kits to allow for broader opportunities to engage with the curriculum.

The school is connected to the external community in significant ways, and there is an emphasis on freedom of expression, self-government, and autonomy within a collaborative work culture. Their narrative excerpts show the interconnectedness of the intellectual, imaginative, emotional, and social dimensions of their lives, and the ways in which they bring all these to bear on the creation of an identity that is true to the persons they are and to the persons they want to become.

Similarly, while issues of power, democracy and co-constructed learning feature in contemporary research, the details of how power relationships can be effectively altered between teachers and children warrants closer scrutiny. This paper explores how pedagogy is enhanced when spaces are negotiated between teachers and children in the real and fictional worlds of drama. The findings emerge from a two year collaborative research project between generalist elementary teachers and university researchers. Salient issues of trust, power sharing, and metaxis, which are part of relational pedagogy in the drama classroom, are explored. In particular, the paper discusses how traditional power and knowledge positions are \"disrupted\" through the drama strategy of \"teacher-in-role\"--a strategy with both political significance and pedagogical force.",

Their conversation with the materials of music and map, with each other as collaborators, and later with the class as audience parallels the process of narrative inquiry as the students experienced the music, constructed their story, and shared their story of the musical experience. Like narrative, the process of creating a musical map serves as a form of inquiry, enabling understanding of an experience and affecting change in self through the living and constructing of the story and affecting change in others through the sharing and telling of the story.

        "author":["Bhroin, Maire Ni"],
        "description":"This study examines the interrelationships among art, play and &quot;real&quot; life, as perceived by young children. Twenty-one children aged four and five in their first year of formal schooling in Ireland, were observed during art-related play activities and classes over a period of four months in 2004. Research data consisted of art works (both original and photographed), field notes, video recordings of children's behaviours and mini-interviews with the children. Data analysis revealed the multifaceted interrelationships between art, play and real life among the children. All children showed evidence of intertwining art, play and &quot;real&quot; life experiences in all strands of the visual arts curriculum. Individual differences in &quot;cognitive style&quot; unrelated to gender also emerged. Some worked quietly concentrating completely on the process and product in hand while others verbalised what was going on as they worked. Just over half of the children extended their actual experiences into the realm of fantasy in their art and play while the remainder tended to be factual, depicting and re-enacting &quot;real&quot; life events as they experienced them. These findings have educational implications as young children's artistic play activities are an important element in pre-service teacher education and in the teaching of Visual Arts at the Primary school level.

Specifically, what can pre-service generalist teachers learn from aesthetic encounters that they may ultimately apply in their own classrooms? For evidence of emergent meaning-making I rely on examination of what I call \"aesthetigrams\". These are essentially maps of one's encounter with an artwork. They provide a basis for reflection on the encounter, for the student and for myself as the instructor, as well as insights into the nature of aesthetic learning.

During the third year, the author undertook an arts-based action research project to examine her actions as facilitator, or \"Joker\", and to explore Forum Theatre's potential for redressing oppressions in a school setting. In the analysis of one challenging session, she suggests that emotions are important data to consider when deciding how best to respond in the moment, as Joker or as classroom teacher. Noticing responses of fear, anger or shame in oneself and others may help identify oppressive practices or tacit assumptions that deserve critical attention. The sociological concept of \"saving face\" has relevance for classroom management and is recommended as an area for further study.",

This case study compared the efficacy of two treatment methodologies for adolescent males in residential treatment with conduct disorders and/or personality dysfunctions with physically or sexually aggressive behaviors over one year. The twenty patients were admitted to the same residential treatment unit, ten were given the MDT protocol and the other relied on TAU. Assessments of  depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, along with monitoring of aggressive behaviors with the evaluations conducted after one year of treatment. The results showed MDT to be more effective then TAU in reducing both physical aggression and therapeutic restraints. The promising results of this study suggest that further evaluation of MDT for the treatment of adolescent's residential patients is warranted. (Contains 5 tables and 8 figures.)",

Although its importance has been acknowledged in the literature, this construct has largely been neglected in consultation research and practice. This article describes practical approaches for assessing and monitoring the integrity of treatments implemented during the problem-solving process. A treatment-monitoring interview (TMI) is proposed as an initial step towards developing a technology to assess and facilitate treatment integrity in behavioral consultation practice.

        "description":"Students with emotional and behavior disorders represent one of the most challenging groups for whom to provide effective educational services. For many years, level systems have been used by teachers to provide an overall structure within which to deliver educational services. In recent years, a number of researchers and practitioners have criticized level systems as outdated and overly restrictive. The authors believe that many of the concerns associated with the use of level systems can be overcome with careful planning and implementation and that level systems can still be an important and useful component in effective programs for students with E/BD. Guidelines for developing an effective level system along with suggestions for overcoming some of the problems typically encountered with implementing level systems in school settings are presented in this paper.

This phenomenon is largely the result of empirical research demonstrating effective treatment outcomes in this population. The same cannot be said with regard to the treatment of conditions often referred to as emotional or psychological problems. The current article describes the philosophical and descriptive differences that likely account for the lack of application of ABA in these areas and proposes potential solutions to help ABA practitioners more effectively address these issues. Specifically, the issue of how to objectively describe these \"conditions\" needs to be addressed so that careful study of treatment effects can occur in a manner similar to the way that brought ABA to prominence in autism treatment.",

It appears to be the conventional wisdom of today that sending children with severe problem behaviors to \"counseling\" or \"therapy\" is the best method for changing these behaviors. This belief predominates despite a lack of empirical evidence demonstrating that severe behavior problems of children are not effectively treated with such an approach. Behaviorists treat these children by altering the maintaining contingencies in the current environment. However, once the structure of the altered environment is no longer present, treatment effects often fail to generalize and the child returns to pre-treatment levels. The traditional mental health model is used to explain why this occurs. A behavioral case formulation approach is presented. It is contrasted with traditional mental health formulations about children presenting severe behavior problems. A real life case example illustrates the utility of a behavioral case formulation and its direct relationship to treatment. (Contains 2 footnotes.)",

This article examines attachment theory and traditional models of family therapy from the perspective of behavior analysis, and provides a rationale for a behavioral treatment approach for abused children and their foster or adoptive parents. A research model has been developed based on the integration of Attachment Theory and the Attachment Based Family Therapy model with basic concepts and principles of behavior analysis. The purpose of this model is to provide a context to examine how abuse and neglect, separation or loss, family therapy, parent-child relationships, and secure attachments may be integrated to predict positive outcomes in families with adoptive and foster children, and the relevant but implicit behavioral principles operating in the attachment rebuilding process. Questions are raised which suggest that family therapy based models compete with the acquisition of new functional behaviors, and provide the environment for learned dysfunctional habits that are then reinforced in therapy. Conclusions are reached that \"familial environments\" in which perception and previous learning guide parent and child interaction is more important than therapy, and implications for behavioral and cognitive interventions are suggested.

The Mountain Brook Schools established the Teachers as Leaders program in order to develop a culture of continuity in leadership as many administrator retirements were predicted for the near future. The program, however, was not designed as a &quot;Teachers as Future Administrators&quot; program. Rather, it was an intentional plan to prepare teachers for continued leadership, whether that is demonstrated in their classrooms or in administrative roles. The school system partnered with private consultants, a restaurant business, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham to deliver the Teachers as Leaders program.

At the institution where this research is based, an effort is underway to shift the focus of the current teaching portfolio requirement from an exit or employment focus, summative in nature, to a formative focus where the students' professional growth and development can be represented over time. This paper presents the initial findings from  a multiyear study when the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) Elementary Certification Program began making this conceptual shift from a summative to formative teaching portfolio requirement. Working within a collaborative partnership model of teacher education, elementary education faculty and seminar instructors worked together to promote such a conceptual change, while serving the needs of both the teacher candidates and the schools in which the teacher candidates complete their fieldwork. Successes and challenges toward this goal focus on communication, knowledge, and support needs of the MAT students, department goals and current practices specific to implementing teaching portfolios, and institutional structures impacting the MAT program and the teaching portfolio requirement. These successes and challenges are discussed in this paper, along with suggestions for how the department will continue to promote the shift in the portfolio's purpose in future years.

Although there is extensive research about the experiences of new teachers, there is far less attention on preservice teachers' perceptions of schools as professional communities of inquiry. The purpose of this mixed-methods research was to compare teacher-candidates' expectations prior to the practice-teaching placements with their observations following the practice-teaching experience. More specifically, the objective of this paper was to determine the effect of the student-teacher practicum experience on prospective teachers' beliefs about schools as communities of inquiry to improve teaching and learning. Of major significance, participants' perceptions following their preservice training were significantly lower than their expectations prior to the field placements. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "author":["Sewall, Marcia"],
        "description":"Since constraints on time, resources, and even energy often come into play in finding opportunities for meaningful discussions about pedagogy between the novice teacher (NT) and the supervisor, post-lesson conversations at the school site can often be brief, superficial, lacking reflective self-analysis, narrow in focus, interrupted, or even impossible. Although traditional on-site supervisor observations and debriefings of lessons taught by the NT are certainly highly desirable in providing experienced mentorship and focused progress for the NT, given the present educational climate, they are increasingly insufficient on their own toward improving the depth and breadth of pedagogical growth that can potentially be achieved through the addition of alternative forms of supplemental supervisory support. This is particularly true in the era of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), with its mandate for &quot;highly  qualified&quot; teachers putting extra pressure on NTs and their teacher preparation programs alike. Although demands have increased, the timeframe remains the same for meeting them, which necessitates &quot;thinking outside the box&quot; to find meaningful supplementary approaches to supervision that may help in the quest for preparing highly-qualified teachers. This paper describes a study that outlines one such approach to supplement the traditional on-site observation and debriefing approach, which may assist in developing more effective, reflective practitioners within the existing format and resources of a teacher preparation program. The study considers how the use of video-elicited reflection (VER), in addition to traditional observation-based debriefing (OBD), affects the development of novice teachers working towards the goal of becoming qualified, &quot;effective, reflective practitioners.&quot; The results indicate that video-elicited reflective debriefings not only encourage more reflective commentary on the part of the novice teacher in both depth and breadth, but that commentary related to state standards for evaluating teaching performance is also broadened and deepened with the use of video elicitation compared to that which occurs in traditional observation-based debriefings. Moreover, the results indicate that supervisor-novice teacher interactions are positively impacted when video elicitation is utilized in addition to traditional observation-based approaches.

        "description":"Despite the complex emotional and interpersonal challenges inherent therein, credential students often comment that their student teaching experience had the greatest influence on their development as new teachers. An essential component of teacher education programs, the field experience serves many purposes. Although the theoretical potential for addressing problems of the field experience with technology is high, little is known about the actual  application of technology to support student teachers during their field experience. Concerned that the current, traditional model of student teacher supervision was out-of-date and unresponsive to current research on how students learn to become teachers, the College of Education at San Diego State University spearheaded a project to re-imagine the field experience. In an effort to build a field experience that was cohesive, connected to and reflective of the university curriculum, and bridged theory and practice, an instructional program was created for the field experience that included a web-based course management system as the tool for addressing issues associated with field experience. The process of using online technology to support the student teachers in the field was coined  &quot;eSupervision.&quot; The purpose of this article is to describe the eSupervision program and report its effectiveness based on data collected from the first year of implementation. The authors describe the participants, data collection method and analysis, and provide a discussion of the results. They conclude the paper with recent improvements to the program and suggestions for further study. (Contains 1 table.)",

Specifically, we were interested in finding out what game use in classroom settings taught candidates about the role of teacher as facilitator of instruction. The procedures first focused teacher candidate attention on effective learning methods followed by attention to the pedagogies of teaching digital games to middle or high school students and peers. Data was collected regarding teacher candidate reactions to this learning medium. Teacher educators may be interested in the findings to help design contemporary curricula to support candidates' development in using computer-based games for learning purposes in middle and secondary classrooms. In addition, research findings may help developers and instructional technologists design future games that are germane to specific learning contexts while challenging students to think critically and develop complex reasoning skills.

        "author":["Skylar, Ashley Ann"],
        "description":"Online learning environments are more prevalent in teacher education than ever before. In 2009, many instructors are attempting to emulate traditional instructional methods in the online learning environment as much as possible. Online courses are separated into two categories, (1) asynchronous; and (2) synchronous, depending on the nature of the online tool. Asynchronous courses provide learners with a flexible environment that is self-paced with learners accessing course content using a variety of tools such as CD-ROMs, streamed prerecorded audio/video web recordings, and audio podcasts. On the other hand, synchronous courses provide online learning environments that are very interactive and use web conferencing products such as \"Elluminate Live, Interwise, Wimba Live Classroom, Adobe Acrobat Connect Professional,\" and \"Saba Centra\". This study aims to compare asynchronous online environments and synchronous web conferencing environments and their effect on the achievement and satisfaction of students. Specifically, the study investigates whether asynchronous and synchronous online instruction result in differences in student performance, student satisfaction, or student perception of their technology skills. Forty-four preservice general education and special education students receive instruction in two different types of online learning environments (asynchronous text-based lectures using WebCT and synchronous web conferencing lectures using \"Elluminate Live\"). The results of this analysis suggest that both types of lectures are effective in delivering online instruction. In addition, almost three-fourths (30 of the 41 students) of the students indicate that they would rather take an online course that uses synchronous web conferencing lectures than an online asynchronous text-based lecture course. This finding suggests the importance of interactivity on student satisfaction in a course. This study supports the finding that students participating in an online course perceive an increased level of their technology skills. (Contains 2 figures and 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Research comparing student experiences with online-only and blended delivery has often concentrated on graduate students and nontraditional programs. However, the effectiveness of online and blended delivery depends on audience and subject matter, suggesting that findings based on data from graduate and nontraditional programs may not hold true for undergraduate students in traditional teacher education programs. This study attempts to address this need in the literature by examining the work of undergraduate teacher candidates who participate in modules delivered in an online environment. Specifically, this study addresses students' comfort and perceived competence while working in online and blended learning environments, as well as the function of teamwork in an online space. Quantitative research methodology is utilized to examine teacher candidates' perceptions of the ways that three university professors engage their students in an online course entitled \"Data for School Improvement.\" This curriculum focuses upon the utilization of value-added data in today's schools. The authors articulate the context, design, and procedures implemented to study the involved students and their professors. The authors propose that the blended environment provides a forum in which additional connections and bridges are built as the teacher candidates (and the instructors) work through the material together. The blended design provides an optimal opportunity for professors and teacher candidates. It offers a flexible option for teacher education by providing opportunities for discussion both in a face-to-face and an online space. This study illustrates the ways in which a blended design can meet the needs of differing teacher candidates at different times. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)",

        "description":"There has been a wide variety of works and views on the issue of teaching and learning online. But much of the work focused on the types of instructional methods used when teaching online. This focus is problematic due to the fact that some faculty members are suspicious of online courses, have significant reservation about the loss of face-to-face contact, and because distance education was previously viewed as an inferior form of education. Faculty concerns, small sample sizes, and the lack of focus on the field of education, coupled with the growing number of online programs in the area of education lead to a growing need for more research in this area. In an effort to address some of the limitations in the previous research as well as faculty concerns with student learning, this study focuses on learning outcomes and compares an online course and a traditional face-to-face course in an educational research class designed for students pursuing a Master of Science degree in Education. The results from the study were mixed. The results are reported in three sections: (1) papers; (2) exams; and (3) survey data. The limitations of the study are also discussed. Based on the limitations, one additional section on course interaction was added to the analysis. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"It is known from history that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people have always existed in society. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersexed, and queer/questioning (LGBTIQ) individuals, collectively known as sexual minorities, represent approximately 10% of the population. As many as nine students in every classroom of 30 are in some measure affected by sexual minority issues. &quot;Yet even with this substantial number, the code of silence in the nation's school systems concerning homosexuality remains&quot; (Fontaine, 1997, pp. 101-102). This silence and/or omission is characteristic of heterosexism, which is pervasive throughout the United States. The purpose of this article is to outline how heterosexist bias permeates the U.S. system of education and to present reasoning as to why LGBTIQ content should be included in the nation's public schools. To adapt a phrase coined by Bruce Bawer (1993) in his book about the incorporation of LGB persons in the society at-large, there is a place at the chalkboard for students of all sexual orientations, including LGBTIQ individuals. In conclusion, the authors assert that insensitive educational policies serve only to disempower LGBTIQ students. The authors provide key points to remember to promote equal access of LGBTIQ students in extra-curricular activities and the curriculum.",

Researchers often point out that one reason students may encounter difficulties in school has to do with a school district's neglect for the learning style or culture of a given group. In this article the author discusses the culture and learning styles of Native American students and offers educational practices that will likely aid this group of students to work to their potential. The author argues that in order to teach Native Americans in a way that reflects their culture, teachers must realize that Native America students are often taught differently at home than are mainstream students, but that Native American children can also differ greatly from each other. In order for Native American students to reach their potential in school, it is recommended that teachers understand those students' preferred ways of learning.",

The bottom line is that the dominant group determines what language or languages will be learned in school. In order to maintain their home language, culture, and identity, minority groups have had to fight for their home languages and for broader issues of social justice. Speaking and maintaining a home language has been asserted to be a basic human right of minority students and their families. This article investigates the efforts of Chinese American students and their parents and community members in seeking the right to learn Chinese as a foreign language. This article also examines the assimilative and oppressive nature of school language policies, the importance of learning Chinese as a foreign language for Chinese American students who are losing their home language, and the broader importance of fighting for social justice.

        "description":"In the State of California, an additional 100,000 teachers will be needed during the next 10 years to teach in K-12 schools (School Services of California, Inc., 2006), due both to population growth and the retirement of &quot;Baby Boomers.&quot; This critical need to develop teachers in California will be mirrored in other states as well, and special attention must be given to assuring that these needs are met by an increase in ethnic minorities joining the teaching profession. This growing problem has been examined in previous research both nationally and internationally. In this article, the author suggests that the United States is in the midst of a professional epidemic which requires states, school districts, junior colleges, and all institutions where teacher credentials are recommended to take active measures to increase the number of ethnic minorities entering the teaching profession. Although there are programs throughout the U.S. that seek to create ways to recruit and retain ethnic minorities in teacher credential programs, a problem still persists of ethnic minorities who are not choosing to enter the teacher profession. The author examines this problem by employing a Likert scale survey with high school students who came from two distinct populations to understand why they do not choose to enter the teaching profession. This study shows that students from two distinct populations share common ideas about teaching. Most students believe that teaching is a profession worth considering only if other career goals do not develop. One reason why students feel that teaching is not a worthy occupation is because of the low level of teachers' salaries. When asked about a career in teaching after the surveys are collected, many of the high school students continue to share negative attitudes, but reveal that they do not know about the diverse career opportunities in education. Recommendations from this study are presented. (Contains 4 tables.)",

This study is an ongoing conversation and reflection about teachers' knowledge, decision-making, and practice in diversity and multicultural education through case-based pedagogy in teaching and learning. This research uses the case of \"El Secreto de las Ninas\" to examine three preservice teachers' beliefs and knowledge about diversity and multicultural education. The teachers raise multiple issues selectively about the diversity case. Their issues include the evaluation of the classroom teacher in the case--positive aspects and critiques, interest to learn, awareness of and empathy with the case situations, and conflicts concerning the dilemmas represented in the cases. Across all data sources, the preservice teachers reveal their own practical knowledge related to the case situations around three main themes: (1) Flexibility; (2) Connectedness of Theoretical Principles; and (3) Case-based Pedagogy.",

        "description":"Over the last decade, teacher preparation programs at colleges and universities across the United States have attempted to respond to the challenges of preparing teachers for the increasing diversity that is represented in public schools today. Teacher programs have responded to these challenges by altering courses, curriculum, fieldwork experiences, and other policies to include a diversity and multicultural education focus. Such a response aligns with research that has indicated that preservice teachers often enter teacher education courses with no conception of, interest in, or concern about, cultural and racial diversity. This article examines the relationship between the attitudes of preservice teachers towards discussing controversial diversity topics with peers and the likelihood that they would address them as teachers. In this study, the likelihood that they would broach such topics was directly related to the candidates' perceptions of whether their future teaching positions would be jeopardized by doing so. The authors maintain that the teacher candidates' concern about engaging in practices that \"would rock the boat\" within their school context was due to a disconnect between understanding the possibilities of enacting positive change on an individual level versus the daunting undertaking of striving to change school culture or educational institutions as new teachers. Here, the authors outline four potential in-class strategies regarding language use that could facilitate better understandings of how to address aspects of diversity and controversy without attempting to change school culture wholesale--a daunting task for anyone, and especially new teachers trying to develop a teaching practice and start a new career. These in-class strategies include (1) inclusive language; (2) qualifying language; (3) indirect and direct language; and (4) clarifying questions. (Contains 1 figure and 1 note.)",

        "description":"Currently, public schools in the U.S. are experiencing dramatic increases in the number of English learner (EL) students they serve. According to the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES, 2006), between 1979 and 2004, the overall number of school children in U.S. public schools increased 18 percent. While the nation has a long history of competing ideologies and political controversies related to English immersion programs versus bilingual education, scholars contend that these two educational approaches need not be conceptualized as dichotomous. Rather, when educators consider what approaches and strategies will provide the best opportunities for particular students to learn in particular contexts, they must bear in mind that for EL students, their native languages and cultures are key resources to draw upon for teaching both content and language. While encouraging native language development and use among students may initially seem daunting or present challenges to monolingual teachers, creative solutions can help teachers to overcome potential barriers to this practice. In this article, the authors provide detailed strategies and considerations that monolingual teachers, or teachers who do not speak all of the native languages of their students, can utilize to help EL students learn new concepts and develop their language skills by building on students' cultural and linguistic schema.

        "description":"It is well documented that many preservice teachers arrive on campuses with few past experiences or opportunities to interact with people from diverse backgrounds. In addition, they often think of diversity only as an issue of race. Successful teaching requires a wider view of diversity that includes race, ethnicity/nationality, social class, sex/gender, health, age, geographic region, sexuality, religion, social status, language, and ability/disability. It is necessary for teacher education programs to help preservice teachers learn a broader definition of diversity. It is also important that teacher educators provide a variety of experiences for preservice teachers to give them time to reflect on their own beliefs and possible prejudices regarding diverse populations. This article presents a case study assignment designed to help preservice teachers learn about and from diverse families. The purpose of the case study is to have the preservice teachers interact with, learn from, and come to respect the diverse perspective families have on raising young children. The case study offers preservice teachers the opportunity to broaden their perspectives and understandings of young children who are different from their personal family background and experiences.",

        "description":"In this article, the authors introduce what they believe is an important distinction between teaching morality and teaching morally. In P-12 schools, the moral education debate often focuses on character education programs or other moral curricula. Such programs and curricula are championed as a means of teaching morality and transmitting moral virtue from one generation to the next. They are also derided as programs that have no place in the school curriculum because of the concern that morality is a matter of personal preference, religious conviction, or cultural commitment. Although this concern is worthy, it has, the authors believe, blocked everyone from attending to the more subtle ways that teachers, the larger society, and the state bring moral matters into the classroom, even when they do not adopt specific moral curricula. The authors understand these other ways of attending to moral matters as teaching morally. Is there any difference between teaching morally and \"teaching morality\"? They argue that there is, and that there is much everyone can learn from exploring this difference. There are, however, many complexities and subtleties encountered in the course of distinguishing teaching morally from teaching morality. The authors attempt to describe these complexities and subtleties, and explain why they are important to individuals' understanding of how teachers assist or impede the moral development of their students. The argument leads to a number of vexing places, places where people have only questions and no answers.",

        "description":"The learning value attributed to perceptual and conceptual modes of &quot;seeing&quot; in context, underscore their significance as integral to the practice teaching experience. Programmatically, it challenges teacher educators to design observation approaches and activities that allow for associating perceptual experiences with conceptual understandings. From a research perspective, it invites people to inquire into the nature of student teacher learning as prompted by such observation tasks and activities--the focus of the present study. The participants in the study were 30 junior student teachers, all of which were in their second year of a teacher training bachelor's program. This inquiry focused on the meanings that student teachers attribute to the experience of observation in practice teaching and on how these meanings can be interpreted as learning experiences. Drawing on inductive, recursive cycles of close interpretative readings, this study examined novices' sense-making of their experience of observation, as exhibited in their entries. The different forms of &quot;seeing as,&quot; &quot;seeing in,&quot; and &quot;seeing that&quot; identified in this study suggest the need to help students to make connections between the different forms of seeing, in an effort to conceptualize experience at higher levels of &quot;seeing that.&quot; Specifically, the authors propose thinking of questions that challenge the articulation of insights about the uniqueness of a particular observed context (seeing in) alongside similarities and differences across contexts (seeing as); in an effort to encourage student teachers to conceptualize these articulated insights as &quot;cases of&quot; or &quot;seeing that.&quot; Providing students with questions that raise their awareness of the learning value of dissonant experiences, might help them to distinguish the learning potential intrinsic in the multidimensional, simultaneous, immediate and unpredictable teaching reality of the classroom situations they observe, which they often fail to see as meaningful experiences",

        "description":"One professional development approach that has supported teachers in learning about particular children so as to become better teachers of those children is called the Descriptive Review Process (DRP), and involves taking an in-depth look at an individual child (Himley &amp; Carini, 2000). The DRP is a ritualized close look at a particular child that generally happens within the context of an on-going study group of teachers. The goal of this particular Study Group was to support a group of elementary school teachers in becoming better teachers of mathematics. The Descriptive Review Process was used as a vehicle to focus specifically on the development of mathematics teaching practice. This study then, included an exploration of alternatives that have been used outside of mathematics education such as the Descriptive Review Process, and the use of photography to access home and community funds of knowledge, while at the same time addressing issues of student thinking in mathematics by using the Cognitively Guided Instruction framework to examine student thinking in mathematics within the classroom (Carpenter et al., 1999). For the purposes of this article, the activities that the teachers engaged in which focused their attention outside of the classroom to learn about their target students, are the ones which are discussed. Study Group activities included (a) shadowing the student in school contexts to which the teacher does not typically have access, and (b) meeting with the student's parent to become informed about out-of-school interests and competencies that could support changes in mathematics teaching practice. One contribution of this study is that it built on the methods of the DRP in two ways: first, it used a focus specifically on mathematics teaching and learning to reflect on and inform classroom practice in mathematics, and secondly it expanded the spaces into which teachers looked for evidence of a child's experiences and competencies. Teachers literally steed outside of the classroom in order to inform their classroom teaching practice of mathematics. After providing a brief description of the Study Group, the author presents the case of one particular teacher as an example of learning that happened as a result of her participation in the Study Group, and changes in practice she was able to implement based on that knowledge gained.",

        "description":"This article explores central elements that facilitate successful mathematics professional development in urban secondary schools through a case study of one long-term effort. The following research question guided this study: How can schools structure professional development that supports teacher learning and addresses the complex realities of urban practice? This study took place in an urban school (The City School [pseudonymn]: 1,500 students, grades 6-12) located in a large city. Most of the student body was minority (99.8% African American) and considered underprivileged (according to government free and reduced lunch records). Participants included three high school mathematics teachers (female, African American), all of whom had undergraduate degrees in mathematics but did not yet hold teaching credentials. Data were collected throughout the 2004-2005 school year. Data sources included: transcripts of audio-taped instructional sessions (30) and informal meetings (10), researcher field notes of all sessions and meetings, transcribed formal interviews (3) with participants, participant journal entries and course assignments (e.g., content exams, problem sets, narrative refections, lesson design), initial surveys and end of program evaluations, observation field notes of participants' practice (five per participant), e-mail correspondences, and researcher journals. They conducted semi-structured interviews (30-45 minutes) with participants at the beginning, middle, and end of the project. This work supports the notion that teacher educators must understand more about teachers' needs, particularly in failing schools, before engaging in professional development. This study promotes the idea that teachers involved in professional development situations and/or research projects need to view the facilitators as human beings who care, as opposed to merely outsiders telling them what to do and how to behave. Based on the authors' experiences working in this effort, they have found the interactions within a given structure to be just as important as the existence of the structures themselves. As a result, they urge others to consider and systematically study the complex component that context, particularly the relationships embedded within a professional development community, plays in teacher learning and change in practice.",

        "author":["Street, Chris",

        "description":"The National Commission on Writing for America's Families, Schools, and Colleges (2006) specifies that writing-across-the-curriculum programs (including post-secondary coursework) should be well supported. The National Writing Project (NWP) is a group that understands this issue, believing that teachers must be comfortable and confident with writing before they can feel a sense of competence with the teaching of writing (Bratcher &amp; Stroble, 1994). As suggested by the NWP, until teachers know as insiders what writing is like, they will never truly be able to teach their students to write well. With this consideration in mind, every attempt is made to immerse NWP teachers in the role of authors, asking them to experience writing from the inside out. In this study, the authors asked the following questions: (1) What levels of self-confidence did in-service secondary teachers hold regarding writing when they entered their first semester of their graduate programs?; (2) What were the major influences on these levels of self-confidence?; (3) What was the impact of a graduate-level writing course on the secondary teachers' self-confidence as writers? All participants were completing their master's degrees in secondary education at a large urban university in southern California; they were taking this required course in the first semester of their graduate program. A total of 28 students were eligible and willing to participate in the research project. Results suggest that the social nature of learning should be an important consideration when designing professional development workshops or college courses for in-service teachers. This point lies at the heart of the NWP model of professional development and has been recognized as an important consideration by recent writing reports examining models of professional development for writing teachers. The authors agree with Lave and Wenger (1991) that the development of identity is central to the development of teachers as writers. If people want teachers to see themselves as members of both writing and teaching communities, teacher educators would do well to consider issues of biography, self-confidence, and proficiency with writing in their courses. As is evidenced from current research, the writing histories of teachers play an important role in their ability--or inability--to use writing with their students. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"As a teacher with more than 30 years experience at the middle school, secondary, and college level, primarily in English studies, Patterson (the first author) decided a few years ago to reexamine his practices and instructional methods. He wondered what would be the effects on him and his students when he would begin to utilize ideas emanating from a reader response paradigm instead of the formalism he had used for so many years. Would learning be enhanced, or would he actually become a less effective teacher due to his lack of experience with a different teaching paradigm? He decided to conduct his research over Ernest Hemingway's &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1986) and Amy Tan's &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; (1989). He was curious if any gender issues would become apparent during his research. Over the years he had thought that males generally preferred Hemingway and the females would more closely embrace Tan. He did not expect to notice any significant change in their attitudes, but he was curious to examine the issue more closely and systematically than he had in the past. Before beginning the research, he formulated one overarching research question with three related sub questions to structure his inquiry. They are as follows: (1) How will shifting his pedagogical practices from a formalist frame to a more response-oriented frame affect student learning?: (a) What impact will this shift have on the process of student engagement and response to specific novels?; (b) What effect will conducting teacher research have on his own attitudes towards the authors and novels he teaches?; and (c) What impact will conducting teacher research have on his perceptions of gender bias in his pedagogical practice? The study took place in an advanced novel class he had been teaching for several years in a small rural high school in a Midwestern community with a population of about 4,200. The students were primarily White and middle class. The author's intention to effect teacher change by shifting his pedagogical practices from a formalist to a reader response frame was on the whole successful in fostering student learning. Students became more closely engaged in the novels by responding to them actively, sometimes passionately, indicated by detailed oral and written responses to his questions. Additionally, the research steered him towards a reevaluation of both novels: more critical towards Hemingway; more appreciative of Tan. Finally, his perceptions of gender bias were altered.",

        "description":"The authors sought to investigate the circumstances which enabled career switchers to move from merely thinking about teaching to actually becoming a teacher. More specifically, they traced the factors that impacted a person's decision-making and transitioning from the context prior to the career change to entrance into an alternative route program. Participants in this qualitative study included new entrants in an alternative pathway to teaching sponsored by a large urban school district in the Southwest during the spring of 2007. This alternative certification program partnered with a local university to provide rigorous graduate-level coursework for its interns. Data from this study suggests timing plays a crucial role in determining whether someone will change careers and whether she or he will choose teaching as the next option. Given their findings, they have made two conclusions about second-career teachers. First, a person's access to resources impacts the timing of a decision to pursue a career change into teaching. Second, when career changers are ready for a change, availability of educational programs plays an important role in choosing to enter the teaching pipeline. Many options exist for teacher preparation programs seeking to recruit and support second-career teachers. The authors offers recommendations, which are based on their understanding of these participants' experiences transitioning as midcareer teachers. (Contains 1 table and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"With issues of teacher quality in the spotlight, it has been suggested that teachers of mathematics and science too often lack content knowledge in the subjects they teach. Accordingly, research is needed to determine whether teacher ineffectiveness in these subjects is more frequently caused by deficiencies in content knowledge or in pedagogical knowledge, and whether teachers of mathematics and science are more often content-deficient relative to other teachers. Research as such requires that teacher performance be assessed, but this assessment has proven contentious. Use of principals' evaluations to assess teacher performance, while hardly foolproof, has the advantage of providing school-level managers' perspective on whether content knowledge or pedagogical knowledge constitutes the more frequent perceived cause of teacher ineffectiveness in secondary schools, especially in mathematics and science. Research was conducted in which 251 principals responded to a survey asking them to rate the frequency with which teacher ineffectiveness has, in their experience, been caused by five components of teacher quality, including content knowledge and four types of pedagogical knowledge (&quot;lesson-planning skills&quot; and three skills requiring interaction with students--&quot;lesson-implementation skills&quot;, &quot;ability to establish rapport with students&quot;, and &quot;classroom-management skills&quot;). When data from the five secondary subjects were aggregated, perceived threats to teacher quality could be ranked on three levels, with deficiencies in student-interactive pedagogical skills (especially classroom management) as most problematic, deficiencies in lesson-planning skills in the middle, and deficiencies in content knowledge as least likely to cause teacher ineffectiveness. These results are highly similar to ones obtained in previous research conducted by Torff &amp; Sessions. The present study also examined causes of teacher ineffectiveness broken out by secondary subject (English, mathematics, science, social studies, and languages other than English). But very little variation across subjects was found, yielding the conclusion that principals judged the causes of teacher ineffectiveness to be similar in the five secondary subjects. Hence, the aggregated-subjects results obtained in this study and in prior research did not appear to be an artifact of strong effects associated with individual subjects. Teacher ineffectiveness in mathematics and science, as in other subjects, was rated as more often produced by deficiencies in pedagogical knowledge than deficiencies  in content knowledge. And teacher ineffectiveness was rated as no more likely to stem from content deficiencies in mathematics and science compared to other subjects. Results as such suggest that principals do not agree with claims that content deficiencies comprise the exigent threat to teacher quality in schools. The results also suggest that principals do not judge content deficiencies to be the exigent teacher-quality problem in math and science or to cause teacher ineffectiveness more frequently in these subjects than in other ones, as has been asserted.

        "description":"Teacher reflectivity has become significant to practice and research in teacher education and development. The literature on teacher reflectivity is substantial, and reflection has come to be widely accepted as a central factor in the professional growth of teachers. In contemporary research and practice, teacher reflectivity has come to refer to the numerous processes by which teachers respond to the dilemmas or opportunities of their teaching contexts. Reflectivity involves a meta-cognitive process through which educators increase their awareness of the implicit attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge that inform their practice--in order to transform their practice. Archetypal reflectivity as a mode of teacher reflectivity includes but transcends the more common political, pedagogical, and biographical modes of teacher reflectivity in order to delve into teachers' deeper ontological constructs and commitments regarding their professional knowledge and practice (Mayes, 2005a). In this article, the author analyzes four archetypal images (Royal, Warrior, Magician, Lover) to inquire into the ways they might facilitate ongoing teacher reflection and development. These images of maturity--and their bi-polar shadows--can serve to inspire and structure self-reflection as part of the construction and reconstruction of teachers' professional knowledge.

        "description":"The literature on the use of problem-based learning in K-12 settings has traditionally focused on gifted and average students. However, mainstreaming is placing increasing numbers of students with special needs in general education classrooms. This case study examined how members of a small group in a mainstreamed seventh grade science class interacted with and supported each other as they engaged in a problem-based learning (PBL) unit. The group included one mainstreamed and two average students. We used conversation analysis and coding to analyze interview and video data of all 10 class sessions. Results indicated that each group member filled a unique role--group manager, task guidance provider, and task performer--and helped each other overcome individual difficulties. Results suggest that mainstreamed groups have the potential to effectively engage in PBL, and that PBL may increase the motivation and social confidence of students with special needs. We suggest types of scaffolds that could support mainstreamed students during PBL units. (Contains 1 figure.)",

        "description":"This study was undertaken to develop a &quot;scale for causes of conflict in the classroom&quot; that will assess and identify the causes of classroom conflicts in university students. Construct validity of the scale was tested by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and it was determined that the scale consisted of 8 factors. In the Scale for Causes of Conflict in the Classroom, the first factor consisted of 9 items, the second factor consisted of 8 items, third factor consisted of 7 items, fourth, fifth and sixth factors consisted of 4 items each, and seventh and eight factors consisted of 3 items each. After examining the item structures that the identified factors consisted, the following factors were selected: appreciation of the student by the teacher, teaching-learning environment skills of the teacher, student behavior, communicative skills of the teacher, personal characteristics of the student, fair treatment by the teacher, biased behavior by the teacher and teachers' obeying the classroom rules. Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient values for each factor and the whole scale were found to be 0.91; 0.90; 0.84; 0.87; 0.82; 0.85; 0.77; 0.63 and 0.95, respectively. After the scale was developed, 350 students from the department of education were administered the scale and the causes of conflict were determined according to student views by taking means and standard deviations into consideration. In order to identify the effect of individual variables, t-test, one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests were used. Analysis showed that the variables of &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;department attended by students&quot; resulted in significant differences in student perceptions whereas the variable of &quot;classroom&quot; did not affect the perceptions of students.",

The sample of this study included 228 teachers who were the graduates of Faculty of Education in Marmara Region and were teaching in elementary and secondary schools around Turkey. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis was carried out for validity of the instrument. Five factors were emerged. The results of CFA indicate a good fit. Cronbach alpha and split-half reliability procedures were used to establish reliability. The subscales were found to be reliable. These factors were highly and positively correlated with each other. The teacher responses were compared on these five factors based on gender, experience, teaching level, location of the school, number of students in classroom and school, socio-economic status of schools, and whether teachers had a master's degree or not. T-tests and one-way ANOVAs were conducted to see whether there were differences among groups. Teachers indicated that the pre-service training they had received in the faculty of education prepared relatively well on supporting different learning styles. Secondly, they rated equally program and teaching and teaching and learning competencies. They rated professional development the third while they rated their preparation as the lowest on creating a productive classroom. Recommendations were made based on these findings.",

The sample of the study consisted of 124 ninth grade students attending a secondary school in Adana City Seyhan District during 2008-2009 academic year. The Meaningful Causal Thinking Evaluation Test, the Biology Academic Achievement Test, and the Reading Comprehension Test (IOWA) were used to collect the data. The study documents significant relationships between meaningful causal thinking and academic achievement, and between meaningful causal thinking and reading comprehension. On the other hand, no significant difference is found between male and female students' meaningful causal thinking abilities. It is concluded that students' academic achievement levels and reading comprehension scores are significant predictors of their meaningful causal thinking ability, but their gender is not. An individual carries all these characteristics in the same cognitive structure and probably uses them in coordination when he/she needs. Therefore, educational activities can be designed based on the relationship between meaningful causal thinking and academic achievement, and between meaningful causal thinking and reading comprehension.

For this purpose, a visit to the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations was organized for a group of visually impaired students. The study is a sample case study carried out with a small group. Qualitative data were obtained from interviews, observations, and the compositions written by the students to reflect on their experiences after the visit. The data were encoded according to content analysis and then, categories and subcategories were formed. The results revealed that blind students expect to have the copies of the works of art, embossed forms of the drawings, and some explanations in Braille alphabet. They would like some attendants to inform them about the museums while the other students who suffer from low vision expect to have more spacious and better lighted interiors, contrasting colors in exhibitions, and scripts in large-prints. The study shows that visits to museums are very beneficial for the visually impaired students, but unfortunately the educational activities for those students are still insufficient in Turkey.",

        "description":"The main purpose of this study is to determine the rate of how teachers' subjective wellbeing is predicted by their perceptions about the quality of school life and burnout levels. The participants of the study consisted of 161 teachers (93 females, 68 males) who were working in elementary schools in Adana central districts. The Positive-Negative Affect Scale (Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988), Life Satisfaction Inventory (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griff in, 1985), Quality of School Life Scale (Sari, 2007), and Teacher Burnout Scale (Seidman, &amp; Zager, 1986) were used as data collection tools. To analyze the gathered data, stepwise regression analysis was performed. Results of stepwise regression analysis showed that teachers' subjective well-being levels were predicted significantly by the Quality of School Life Scale sub-factors, namely &quot;status&quot; and &quot;curriculum&quot; and burnout scale sub-factor, namely &quot;coping work-related stress.&quot; Teachers' life satisfaction levels were predicted significantly by the variables of &quot;status&quot;, &quot;coping work-related stress&quot; and &quot;school administrator&quot; which is a sub factor of the Quality of School Life Scale. Also, teachers' positive affect was predicted by the variables of &quot;status&quot;, &quot;positive affects towards school&quot; and &quot;teachers,&quot; and teachers' negative affect was predicted by the variables of &quot;coping work-related stress&quot;, &quot;status,&quot; and &quot;curriculum.&quot; Other subscales of the Quality of School Life and Teacher Burnout Scales have no significant contribution in the estimation. Results also indicated that the contribution of predictors could be accounted as 39% for subjective well-being; 23% for life satisfaction; 23% for positive affect, and 37% for negative affect. In the direction of these general findings, it was suggested that, in-service education programs about interpersonal relations and coping strategies with stress should be applied for teachers and administrators. Besides that, the quality of life in schools should be increased. On the basis of limited similar studies in the literature, it was suggested that the number of both descriptive and predictive studies should be increased on the topic.",

Knowledge management is an ongoing process and it has to be organized in a manner that is always open to new ideas. In universities where research and development studies play an important role, knowledge management has a very critical importance. Qualitative research techniques have been applied in the study. In the present research, 52 instructors and 25 different members of the board of directors of universities have been interviewed from five different universities. As a result of the comparison statement, results showed board of directors are not using knowledge management tools effectively in areas such as the improvement of knowledge, buying of knowledge, share and evaluation of knowledge, and figuring out of lack of knowledge, based on instructors capacity. Accordingly, research stated that board of directors should study the development of knowledge management tools. (Contains 5 tables.)",

        "author":["Dilmac, Bulent"],
        "description":"Recent surveys show that cyber bullying is a pervasive problem in North America. Many news stories have reported cyber bullying incidents around the world. Reports on the prevalence of cyber bullying and victimization as a result of cyber bullying increase yearly. Although we know what cyber bullying is it is important that we learn more about the psychological effects of it. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate the relationship between psychological needs and cyber bullying. Participants of the study included 666 undergraduate students (231 males and 435 females) from 15 programs in the Faculty of Education at Selcuk University, Turkey. Questions about demographics, engagement in and exposure to cyber bullying, and the Adjective Check List were administered. 22.5% of the students reported engaging in cyber bullying at least one time, and 55.3% of the students reported being victims of cyber bullying at least once in their lifetime. Males reported more cyber bullying behavior than females. Results indicate that aggression and succorance positively predict cyber bullying whereas intraception negatively predict it. In addition, endurance and affiliation negatively predict cyber victimization. Only the need for change was found as a positive, but weak predictor of cyber victimization. In light of these findings, aggression and intraception should be investigated further in future research on cyber bullying. (Contains 3 tables.)",

In order to adapt the scale, first, the scale items were translated to Turkish by the researchers. Then, a translation form was further developed by consulting eight specialists. These English and Turkish forms were both responded by 30 undergraduate students at Middle East Technical University, department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology with two-week intervals, respectively. Two forms were accepted as equal since the correlation between them was .89. The Turkish version of the scale was implemented on 276 students who took the course in an online environment for validity and reliability studies. The scale has four factors, which was found as result of the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. In its original form for the whole scale, the Cronbach alpha value was calculated as 0.95. In the Turkish version of the scale, alpha value was calculated as .94. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Turkish version of the scale was reliable and valid.",

The study is designed to test causality with the assumption that causality exists between the two variables. In this study, spiritual leadership behavior of managers is treated as the independent variable whereas the organizational culture is the dependent variable in the model. Population of this research is 2447 primary school teachers who were working in 32 primary schools in Atasehir-Istanbul/Turkey. Sampling group consists of 359 voluntary teachers defined with (layer) cluster sampling method according to three income levels (high-mid-low). Data are collected in two scales which were originally developed by researcher. The Spiritual leadership scale consisted of two components and five subscales (&quot;performance&quot;: commitment, vision, productive and &quot;attendance&quot;: belonging, believe). The Organizational Culture Scale consisted of four subscales (managerial, social, value and aim). In order to test the structural equity model designed in the research, path coefficients and defined relations between implied and observed variables are used. Findings show that attendance highly affects performance and, in turn, performance affects school culture at the mid-level. It is suggested that the perception of spiritual leadership be improved in structural equation models in future studies.",

This is a quasi-experimental, pre-post and follow up study with two experiments and one control group. The Aggression Scale (Buss &amp; Warren, 2000) adapted to Turkish by Can (2002) was administered as a pretest to 9th grade students of Nezihe Yalvac Anatolian Hotel and Tourism Vocational High School in Adana. After the administration and assessment of the scale, 36 students who had the highest aggression levels were selected and were randomly divided into three groups. The experimental and control groups each included 12 students. Cognitive behavioral techniques were applied to the first experimental group in 10 sessions, psychodrama techniques were applied to the second experimental group in 14 sessions. No application has been done to the control group. After the groups ended, the Aggression Scale was re-administered to all groups as a post test. 16 weeks after ending the groups, the scale was administered one more time to the experimental groups as a follow up test. Findings were analyzed with ANCOVA and t test for dependent samples. Findings have showed that cognitive-behavioral approach was effective in decreasing aggression scores, except verbal aggression and psychodrama approach was effective in decreasing all aggression scores except verbal physical aggression. ANCOVA analyses showed that cognitive-behavioral approach was more effective in decreasing total aggression, physical aggression, and anger than psychodrama. Follow up test results showed that the effects of group practices on both experimental groups were lasting even 16 weeks later.",

Research was carried out by studying the related literature and structural equation modeling techniques. A structural model was created that consisted of students' mathematics and science scores used by the College of Science Schools in addition to family income, attendance at private test preparatory courses, and parents' educational levels. The study's population consisted of 23,895 students who took the Secondary Education Institutional Exam in Konya/Turkey. The study sample consisted of 310 randomly selected students from the study population. The results show that parents' educational levels have a direct effect, and that increased incomes due to both the father's educational level and a preparatory course attendance have indirect effects on mathematics-science scores.

The sample of the study consisted of 426 primary school students in Izmir, Turkey. In order to examine the construct validity of the MS, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were performed. For the validity of the MI, corrected item-total correlations were used. The corrected item-total correlations ranged from 0.35 to 0.65. In addition, t-tests between items' means of upper 27% and lower 27% points were compared. For each factor and each item, the differences between mean scores of upper 27% and lover 27% groups are significant. Finally, Cronbach alpha correlation coefficients were used. The internal consistency of the MS is 0.96 for the entire scale. The MS has eight scales: declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and conditional knowledge, planning, self-control, cognitive strategies, self assessment and self monitoring. According to these findings, the MS is appropriate for researchers or teachers whose aim is to measure his/her students' metacognitive awareness and metacognitive abilities.",

        "description":"Intended to enhance social skills instruction in Turkey, the present study highlights the process and outcome of creating a Turkish-language version of the School Social Behavior Scales (SSBS), originally developed by Merrell (1993). The social skills of the Turkish pre-and elementary school students were based on the Likert scale. The analyses of the data obtained from 467 students and their teachers were carried out on the linguistic equivalency, item-total and item-remainder analyses, confirmatory factor analyses, criterion validity, and reliability analyses of the Turkish conversion of the SSBS. The results of the analyses of linguistic equivalency reflected significance for each item of p less than 0.001. A level of significance of p less than 0.001 was found by means of the item-total, item-remainder, and discrimination analyses. Reliability values ranging between r=0.91 and r=0.98 were obtained by the Cronbach coefficient alpha, Spearman Brown, and Guttman Split-Half techniques. These reliability coefficients display a similarity with those for the original version. The data obtained by means of the Matson Evaluation of Social Skills with Youngsters (MESSY) and sociometric technique were evaluated and found to bear statistical significance (p less than 0.05). Based on the findings, it may be stated that the Turkish conversion of the SSBS may be used with Turkish samples and that it is a valid and reliable measurement tool. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Students read the primary literature about the research question, learn techniques and statistical approaches, and conduct student-designed experiments. We focus on the process of doing biology, rather than on acquiring a particular body of facts. Students are actively engaged in integrative thinking about biology, and they emerge from the laboratory experience with a strong grasp of quantitative and experimental approaches and skills. Our assessments indicate that this process-based approach is an effective way to approach introductory biology. (Contains 5 figures and 1 table.)",

Students often lack the self assessment skills and metacognition skills required to self-identify problems with their academic learning strategy. This does not allow them to diagnose and modify their learning strategies to allow them to be successful. Instructors often have little experience with such learning challenges and therefore may not be able to offer students appropriate learning strategy modifications. I present and assess a model for teaching learning strategies to students in an introductory biology course. This model presents specific techniques to assist students in accurate self assessment which then leads to recommendations for modifying their learning strategies. This model was used in an introductory biology course and students who attended these learning strategy workshops performed significantly better in the subsequent exam than students who did not attend a workshop. I present an outline of the workshop and learning strategy modifications and discuss the ramifications of incorporating learning strategy workshops on a broad scale for freshmen.

This paper describes such a course designed on the principles of cooperative learning based on a computer software industry production model called &quot;Extreme Programming&quot; (EP). The classroom version of EP included: working in pairs, switching roles between labs, partner interdependence and individual accountability. New pairings were created at random each week and at the completion of each lab, students (n = 18) indicated their satisfaction and frustration levels with working with partners, the materials, and the technology. We used a Repeated Measures-ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) statistical design to provide statistical power with a modest number of subjects. Students consistently rated working with a pair highest in terms of both ease and satisfaction, regardless of prior programming and technology experience. We found no differences in reported ease or satisfaction between undergraduate and graduate students, or between students with prior experience with technology. Surprisingly, we found that students rated the more difficult computer programming part of the course higher than the web-based exercises. The Extreme Programming cooperative model appears to be very appropriate for Bioinformatics classes, and can be easily implemented in computational labs to enhance student satisfaction and potentially maximize the use of computer workstations.

Overall, students feel that this course helps them take more responsibility for their learning and is more meaningful than other general education courses to which they have been exposed.

        "description":"Many undergraduate institutions are dealing with less-than-prepared students entering the biology major. When the biology department at College of Notre Dame of Maryland analyzed data from five past cohorts of prospective biology majors, it was evident that there was a significant correlation between their success in the introductory course in the major and their math SAT score (Spearman's rho = 0.058; p less than 0.001). Based on these results, the biology department developed a preparatory course for students whose MSAT score was below a prescribed cutoff value and stipulated that a student must pass this preparatory course with a grade of at least C+ to take the introductory course. For the first four cohorts (n = 93), 95.9% of those who enrolled in the introductory course in the semester following the preparatory course received a grade of at least C. For these students, there was no correlation between their grade in the introductory course and their MSAT score. This paper describes how the department determines which students take the preparatory course, explains the design of the course curriculum and assessment within the course, and presents an analysis of the first four cohorts of students to progress through the course.

The present study shows an exercise that can be varied in complexity, for which students compile research illustrating the fate of homologous fish skull elements, and assemble a mural to serve as a learning aid. The skull of the most primitive living Actinopterygian (bony fish), the bowfin, \"Amia calva,\" is the starting point for tracing the evolutionary fate of homologous bones in other living and extinct vertebrates. By tracing bone fates through time and across lineages, students learn both their names and association patterns. Emphasizing bone group associations, structures and functions replaces memorization of names, while facilitating understanding of evolutionary processes that shaped complexes and the vertebrates in which they occur. Working in groups, students learn cranial ossification patterns from fish to amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds that might otherwise seem unpredictable or unrelated to natural selection. Goals of this project include clarifying evolutionary processes, relating complex structures to functions, and assisting students in gaining a deeper understanding of features that define vertebrate anatomical relationships.

I conversed with and photographed Lisette, Edward, Kris, Todd, William and Theresa, asking &quot;How are your clothing choices determined by your work as a scholar?&quot; The photographs and transcripts inspired drawings, paintings and poetry. The study confirms that clothes are negotiated expressions of self and visual identity with the body as mediator (Braziel &amp; LeBesco, 2001; Butler, 1993; Davis, 1997; Holliday &amp; Hassard 2001; Shilling, 1993); scholars' clothing choices are gendered (Butler, 1999; Kirkham, 1996; Sanders, 1996), and female scholars strategize through dress (Kaiser, Chandler &amp; Hammidi, 2001; Green, 2001). The poems and artworks speak of triumph and pain. They provide opportunities to reflect on arts-informed research, the aesthetics of the clothed body, the body and social theory, and the semiotics of clothing. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

The study investigated the participants' personal Arts experiences and training, as well as their views of Arts pedagogy. In depth interviews with the participants highlighted the important influence that participants' own interactions with the various Arts disciplines had upon their role as facilitators of Creative Arts education. The findings of this study also identify multiple ways of approaching and facilitating teaching and learning activities. The research not only revealed insights into the educational value each of the teachers ascribed to individual Arts disciplines, but also the level of confidence and preparedness they felt to teach these disciplines. The generalist primary teachers participating in this research study identified a number of issues that they believed compromised their ability to teach the Creative Arts effectively.

This paper presents a pedagogical technique designed to foster creativity and imagination, while providing a deeper understanding of the concepts taught in a capstone business management course. The technique requires students to create and interpret an original work of art (visual, musical, or poetry) that symbolizes an important course concept. The metaphors utilized by students are examined using Morgan's (1986) metaphors of organizations as a framework. At the end of the project, students involved provided feedback by completing a survey of student attitudes and responding to a questionnaire. We conclude that using art and metaphor enriched the educational experience by both challenging students and promoting a deeper understanding of course material.

Understanding student autobiographical portraits not only helps art teachers gain insight into their students' prior knowledge of and experiences with art, but also allows them to use such insight for relevant instruction. Based on constructivist learning theory and with attention to the future implementation of visual culture art education, this study analyzes visual and verbal autobiographical artifacts produced by four adolescent female students to gain insight into their personal interests, knowledge and experiences with art, and artistic development. Conclusions address implications for teaching critical visual culture. (Contains 5 figures and 5 footnotes.)",

Initial data analysis suggests that the strategies that The Second City artists-in-residence used with teachers and their students contributed to individual students' self-efficacy and strengthened classroom community, making possible the opportunity for students who had previously been marginalized to take on more positive roles in their classrooms and creating inclusive spaces for children with special needs.

As a teacher-researcher, I studied my graduate students' autobiographical accounts of their experiences making music. Across these narrative writings produced over the past four years, a pattern emerged: many of the texts describe transcendent experiences. Transcendent music making experiences are distinguished by two main qualities: (a) that the performer is functioning at the height of his or her abilities; and (b) that the performer has a sense of being a part of something larger than him or herself in some way. The concept of transcendent music making experiences provides powerful insights into a unique feature of musical engagement. Music educators at all levels can relate to and learn from a more nuanced understanding of the unique qualities of musical engagement. (Contains 5 footnotes.)",

These investigations reinterpret the meaning of perception, resonance, and connection, and point to the fundamental importance of the resonant body in understanding the world of objects (including objects of art and material culture), and the world of others (including an intersubjectivity of interdependence). Presenting research results and classroom experiences, this paper ultimately advocates a move toward an art education of empathy that integrates caring, cognitive growth, and sociocultural awareness. This art education would strive to promote a connectedness in the classroom community--an authentic and resonant kind of harmony--between self, object, and other, through which the worlds of objects and others are experienced and made meaningful.

The discussion begins with findings which suggest that popular, jazz and folk musicians experience more pleasure in musical activities than their classical counterparts. Also significant are results indicating that the latter are more influenced by parents and teachers, with the former primarily motivated by intrinsic factors. In examining these findings, three interrelated themes are considered: the quality of musicians' motivation, genre-specific learning practices, and the competencies demanded by particular music systems. Critiquing the socio-cultural assumptions inherent in Western music pedagogy, and the role of external regulation in formal education systems, a case is made for the importance of autonomy. Questions are raised about the purpose of music education and consequences of formalising musics traditionally learnt through direct engagement with communities of practice.

Australian artist academics who seek a balance between their artistic and academic lives work within a government-directed research environment that is unable to quantify; therefore, to recognize the value of creative research, yet which accepts the funded outcomes of post-graduate practice-based students. This study sought to unravel how artist academics from a variety of non-written creative disciplines perceive the relationships between their roles as artists, researchers and tertiary educators. Three themes were generated from interviews with the artist-academics: (a) creative research and the academy, (b) practice, research, and teaching nexus, and (c) identity. Central to the discussions was the question of whether and how creative work constitutes legitimate research. (Contains 1 table and 1 footnote.)",

S. and Northern Ireland, was to enhance students' photographic skills to create visual metaphors of the concept of peace. Two principal research questions were addressed: (a) Could 9-10 year-old students create apt and imaginative photographic metaphors of peace? (b) Would students in diverse cultures produce comparable photographs of peace? A model of peace, metaphoric imagination, and metaphoric interpretation was researched to test the effectiveness of metaphors in promoting visual understanding of peace. Barthes' (1981) critical framework of connotative procedures and linguistic metaphors were used to judge the aptness and imaginativeness of student photographs. Analysis of an archive of approximately 2500 photographs revealed several typical images of peace common to the following three settings: nature, sun/light, community, diversity, place, peace signs, children play, children care, spirituality, and body/hands as subjects. Implications were drawn for the status of the student photographs as metaphors, pictorial concepts, and/or allegories. (Contains 2 images.)",

        "description":"Images of extreme and ever more graphic violence are a part of contemporary culture. Since students cannot avoid them, such images should be addressed by aesthetic educators. But this will require a theory for the analysis and evaluation of the aesthetic properties of violent imagery. The main thesis of this essay is that depiction of violence in certain recent art works can be understood as aiming at aesthetic perception of the sublime. We develop a model for interpreting works in this way by first presenting and then drawing on Kant's analysis of aesthetic perception of the sublime. Our thesis is important for both aesthetic and moral education. According to Kant's remarkably sensitive analysis, aesthetic perception of the sublime plays a large role in developing moral and social awareness. Using Kant's theory as our main source, and drawing on some recent artworks for illustrative purposes, we offer an analysis of how artistic depiction of violence may promote moral and social awareness. We nevertheless consider images of extreme violence morally problematic, and outline a model for educating reflection on the morality of using them.",

We then propose an alternate approach to teaching and learning about rainforest environments. This approach teaches students how to deconstruct visual culture environmental messages, such as those in the Rainforest Cafe, fine art, popular films, and children's picturebooks to learn from both accurate and inaccurate images while promoting environmental caring for the rainforest \"and\" students' own environments through art.

The expert dance educator, possesses 28 years of teaching experience in higher education, is the recipient of a national award, is actively involved in professional activities, and facilitates outstanding student achievements. Data were collected using a variety of sources: interviews with the dance teacher and college students, class observations, videotaped lessons, stimulated recall techniques, and document analyses. Data analysis followed the conventions indicated by Glaser &amp; Strauss (1967) and Glaser (1998). Four teaching characteristics of the expert dance educator were, through these means, discovered and emphasized: (1) reflecting and expressing students' lives through dance movements, (2) teaching beyond dance technique, (3) employing diverse teaching techniques in order to achieve diverse learning experiences, and (4) designing and implementing dance festivals and similar occasions for evaluating students' learning.",

This paper emerges from a three year study within a core education subject in pre-service teacher education in Australia. This &quot;practitioner&quot; research (Zeichner, 1999) engaged the problematics of authentic and meaningful learner-centred teaching and learning through an arts-based curriculum. Over the period of the study, two hundred and eighty pre-service teachers participated in a &quot;dialogical performance&quot;(Conquergood, 2003) of pedagogy about curriculum and assessment through the construction of art about curriculum and assessment. The possibilities of an arts-based pedagogy in pre-service education were affirmed by the research. An enacted epistemological move by the teacher-educators led to similar shifts by the students. This opened a space for the reappearance of learner through engagements with identities, positionings and agency. This was an act of &quot;putting theory to work&quot; (Lather, 2006, 2007) and invoked transgressive practices of academic discourses. (Contains 10 images.)",

As we play with these metaphors we see how much our understanding of relationships shape our being and engagement with others and that imagination is inextricably intertwined within our lives and our relationships. By attending to this playfulness, our spaces of knowing enlarge and spaces of possibility are never ending; yet embedded in these possibilities is also a recognition of how difficult it is to stay in relation, to remain wakeful to the tensions and boulders of the landscapes and stories we live within.

A deeper, more intimate understanding of the world of the &quot;Search&quot; can be achieved in any classroom anywhere by integrating carefully selected electronic resources for film, architecture, painting, music, costume, decor and dance with the teaching of the written text. In particular, perspective in contemporary painting as a model for Proust's innovations in narrative plays an important role in this study. (Contains 2 notes.)",

As artful inquiry, this hybrid form of arts-based educational research and teacher research examines my own classroom practice and pedagogy exploring how aesthetics can become a philosophy of care. Part 1 outlines the \"Living Compositions Exercise\", an introductory activity students play to introduce the concepts of space, relationship, and care, and a discussion on how this is an aesthetic experience that encourages empathy. Part 2, \"Inquiry into Piazza\", addresses how student inquiry, artistic critique, and dialogue can lead to self-formation through art. The outcome of aesthetic engagement here is to promote empathetic response and action, which is manifested through the living inquiry of the students. (Contains 2 images and 2 notes.)",

        "description":"In light of a recent revelation that Gersten (1985) included erroneous information on one of two programs for English Language Learners (ELLs), the authors re-calculate results of their earlier meta-analysis of program effectiveness studies for ELLs in which Gersten's studies had behaved as outliers (Rolstad, Mahoney & Glass, 2005). The correction resulted in a change in mean effect size from 0.08 to 0.19 for all outcome measures, from -0.06 to 0.14 for (English) reading, from 0.08 to 0.17 for (English) math, and from -0.01 to 0.10 for all Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) studies. The revelation of Gersten's coding error, and the inconsistency of Gersten's studies with other studies reviewed, increases confidence in the conclusion that an \"investigator effect\" suppresses results favoring TBE in these studies. Removing Gersten's studies from the meta-analysis renders an effect size of 0.17 for TBE, nearly as high as for Developmental Bilingual Education (DBE). The authors argue that the most informative result is the effect size reported for studies involving ELLs in both treatment and control groups, with an average effect size for TBE of 0.23. The new analysis therefore strengthens the conclusions previously reached in the authors' original research supporting TBE over English-only approaches, and DBE over TBE.

Using Ruiz's (1984) framework for language planning as an analytical lens, this study examined how three Massachusetts districts resisted the monolingual ideology that characterizes laws mandating the implementation of English-only programs and addresses how local policies and practices conceptualized the mandated SEI program differently according to the specific implementation context. Since each district had been ideologically opposed to English-only approaches prior to Question 2, the language as right and language as resource orientations continued to influence the interpretation of SEI. As a result, SEI was positioned differently ideologically in relation to the law (the value of bilingualism versus English-only education) as well as structurally within each district (as part of a bilingual program sequence, as part of a world language program, self-contained). As a language policy, &quot;SEI&quot; therefore does not have a fixed meaning but will necessarily be socially constructed within each context by the beliefs, experiences, and histories of the individuals involved.

        "description":"Construct validity concerns for the IPT I Oral Grades K-6 Spanish Second Edition (IPT-S) as a measure of native oral language proficiency are examined. The examination included describing a subset of items that contributes most to overall score and native-language proficiency designation. Correlations between this subset of items and the overall score are calculated. Empirical evidence suggests that if a student cannot or does not answer four questions from the second section in a complete sentence, then the student will either be labeled as a non-speaker or a limited speaker in the native language. The authors argue that the requirement that speakers respond in complete sentences reflects a naive view of language proficiency inconsistent with linguistic research, and characterize the requirement as \"academic bias,\" that is, a prejudice resulting from a confusion of academic content knowledge related to language arts with actual linguistic ability, having the result of arbitrarily favoring members of the educated classes. The authors conclude that the IPT-S should not be used for Spanish language assessment with Spanish-speaking children. (Contains 1 figure and 5 tables.)",

        "description":"The design of virtual learning environments for post-secondary instruction is rapidly increasing among public and private universities. While the quantity of online courses over the past 10 years has exponentially increased, the quality of these courses has not. As universities increase their online teaching activities, real concern about the best design for these online learning opportunities underscores the need to create effective and responsive virtual learning environments. Adams (2007) developed the Recursive Model for Knowledge Development in Virtual Environments. The premise of this model is the belief that good teaching and engaged learning should not be determined by the use of certain instructional tools but by the guiding principal that learning is an active and recursive process, where knowledge must be contextualized to be relevant to the learner. To this purpose, this article describes the initial development in the ongoing process of designing a valid and reliable assessment tool, the Virtual Learning Environment Survey--VLES, for exploring the degree to which the Recursive Model for Knowledge Development relates to effective design of online learning environments. This student self-report survey will seek to provide guidance for the assessment of online learning environments through collection of student perceptions of teaching strategies, knowledge approach, and knowledge ownership in online classrooms.

        "description":"We examined teacher characteristics predicting likelihood of intervening in indirect bullying (N=55) and piloted a 45-minute educational presentation about its mental health impact. Teachers' global empathy and perceived seriousness of indirect bullying vignettes were predictors of their likelihood of intervening, but knowledge of mental health impact was not. The presentation increased knowledge of impact and perceived seriousness, immediately and seven weeks later, compared with a treated control group. However, empathy for victims and likelihood of intervening did not increase. Recommendations include adding skills-based material, a self-efficacy measure and a focus on increasing global empathy rather than specific empathy for victims. (Contains 1 figure and 5 tables.)",

Variance components models with three levels (viz. student, class and school) for each of the 22 scales were created. Results revealed that statistically significant proportions of variance in all scale scores could be attributed to the student and class levels. Apart from one scale, no school level variance in scale scores was statistically significant. Typically, variance proportions were above 75% at the student level, above 15% at the class level, and below 5% at the school level.

A sample of 1,460 secondary three (grade 9) students from 50 express stream (above average academic ability) classes in Singapore government secondary schools was involved in the study. The perceptual measure approach was used to investigate the nature of Chinese Language classroom learning environment. A well-validated classroom environment instrument, the &quot;Chinese Language Classroom Environment Inventory (CLCEI)&quot; (Chua, Wong, &amp; Chen, 2006; Chua, 2004) was used to investigate teachers' and students' perceptions towards their Chinese Language classroom learning environments in six dimensions, namely &quot;Student Cohesiveness&quot;, &quot;Teacher Support&quot;, &quot;Involvement&quot;, &quot;Cooperation&quot;, &quot;Task Orientation&quot; and &quot;Equity&quot;. Students' motivation to learn the Chinese Language was examined using the &quot;Chinese Language Motivation Scale&quot; (CLMOTS) (Soh, 1993). Two statistical procedures, simple correlational analysis and multiple regression analysis, were used to examine the relationships between students' motivation to learn the Chinese Language and the nature of their Chinese Language classroom learning environments. The results from the simple correlational analysis indicated that students' motivation to learn Chinese Language was found positively correlated with all the six learning environment dimensions under investigation. However, the results from the multiple regression analysis indicated that students' motivation to learn Chinese Language were associated with only three dimensions of the learning environments, &quot;Teacher Support&quot;, &quot;Involvement&quot; and &quot;Task Orientation&quot;, where the &quot;Task Orientation&quot; dimension having the most significant association with students' motivation to learn Chinese Language. The findings are consistent with many previous studies on motivation that academically motivated students are usually those students who are task-orientated (Gardner, 2001; Stipek, 1993).

        "author":["Wright, Craig",
          "Conlon, Elizabeth"],
        "description":"This article presents a critique on K. Amon and A. Campbell's \"Can children with AD/HD learn relaxation and breathing techniques through biofeedback video games?\". Amon and Campbell reported a successful trial of a commercially available biofeedback program, \"The Wild Divine\", in reducing symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in a group of children with ADHD and a control group. In summary, Amon and Campbell presented a study with numerous methodological, statistical, and interpretative flaws. In carrying out evaluations of interventions, researchers have an obligation to conduct high quality studies and to present data with clarity. At the every least, the method should be replicable and the psychometric properties of the outcome measures fully described. The clinical meaningfulness of the measures used within a study is pertinent to the clinical significance of the study itself. In this study (Amon & Campbell, 2008) the ADHD questionnaire was unstandardised and the reader therefore has no way to determine the range of \"normal\". In the absence of this information one might assume that the control group represents \"normality\". In addition, measures that constitute the amount of change required from pre- to post-intervention that indicate reliable change due to the treatment program (i.e., a reliable change index) and some measure of the clinical significance of the results must also be presented. Either a quantitative approach to clinical significance by determining the proportion of children in the ADHD group who return normal function following an intervention or a measure of the social impact of change should be reported. Amon and Campbell's paper falls short of each of these criteria. The authors' aim in writing this critique is simple. Although on the face of it unlikely to cause harm, alternative treatments for all developmental disorders may give a false sense that the symptoms and impairment are being addressed, thus delaying effective intervention. Clinicians reading this research report will be unable critically to evaluate the research results so would accept the analysis of Amon and Campbell that this intervention has the potential to reduce psychological distress in both the ADHD and the control groups. The data do not support this conclusion. In addition, there are direct costs associated with the treatments as well as potential indirect costs such as loss of wages and time for working parents. In short, Amon and Campbell's data provide unconvincing evidence for biofeedback as an effective treatment for ADHD.",

        "description":"This study investigates what grade-3 teachers say they would do if faced with common test administration dilemmas--and why. Grade-3 teachers with experience administering Ontario's provincially mandated assessment were recruited through professional association newsletters and Toronto-area newspapers. They responded to an on-line questionnaire (n = 98) or an hour-long interview (n = 40). Many teachers predicted that they would not follow the test administration instructions. Their rationales included (a) supporting the students to do their best work, (b) ensuring a positive testing experience for the students, and (c) maintaining their pedagogical routines and their relationships with the students. The findings highlight the ethical dilemmas teachers may experience when proctoring tests. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

The practice of educators to engage in cycles of inquiry and actions that address challenges and improve outcomes evolved directly from the \"conversation among friends\" that began 25 years ago. The first wave of Essential schools, and early gatherings of CES educators, placed a premium on the collective reflection, data-gathering, and decision-making that has come to be a defining characteristic of the CES network. During the cycle of 2008-2009 CES year, the CES Small Schools Network (CES SSN) has made the work of establishing inquiry groups for equity its top priority. The CES SSN has focused on establishing an equity lens through which practitioners within and supporters of small, personalized, and academically challenging schools see their students, their families and communities, and the larger systems in which schools are located, CES National staff members built on efforts that included the Teacher Research Collaborative to develop inquiry groups for equity across the CES SSN.",

        "description":"On a mid-week day in mid-December 2008, Boston Day and Evening Academy's room 209, usually used for board meetings, student assessments, awards dinners, and other occasions requiring an intimate atmosphere, smelled like Chinese food. These second-trimester students at Boston Day and Evening Academy (BDEA) were having a reunion after just a few weeks apart. That these students--all overage for high school with combinations of attendance, learning, and disciplinary issues--were in school at all is significant. But the remarkable thing about this particular gathering was the number of students. Of the 40 students who enrolled at BDEA in the first trimester of 2008, 38 were still in school. This had not always been the case. Typically, the end of the first trimester found Student Support staff shifting into overdrive trying to track down students who hadn't been in school for weeks or months, and recruitment went into a kind of perpetual orbit, trying to recruit and enroll new students to take the place of those who had slipped away. As the team at Boston Day and Evening Academy (BDEA) expanded its cycle of inquiry to include faculty, test assumptions, and identify challenges, they began to recognize the need for additional services for new students which would get students to &quot;buy in&quot; to BDEA's culture as soon as they enrolled in order to prevent the disconnect that leads to withdrawal. The outcome was the creation of BDEA Seminar, a program that acquaints students with school culture, allows them time and guidance to transition to a new curriculum and new school culture, provides extra support in literacy, and offers individualized wrap-around services to help the student to feel ownership in the school.",

        "description":"As a team of job-embedded instructional coaches in an ethnically and economically diverse learning environment, the authors are dedicated to thinking through and troubleshooting the improvement of teaching and learning in the three learning communities that make up Clover Park High School. They agree with commentator Laurie Olsen who writes, \"Data provide both a stark picture of how we're doing and a wonderful tool for stimulating dialogue about how a school community is faring and what it considers important.\" The authors and their colleagues make use of qualitative and quantitative data to form the basis for the professional development--and the goal of improved student achievement--that they create and facilitate. They use a number of quantitative data sets, disaggregated for factors such as gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, content, and grade levels. These include state standardized tests, building-administered assessments, building graduation rates, and grade reports. They use multiple assessments to give them a more complete picture of teaching and learning in the building. Their conversations around improvement often begin with their interpretations of and concerns around the data. In addition, they spend time in classrooms on a regular basis to collect a variety of real-time, qualitative data. These include artifacts such as observation notes and video. From here, they begin to build professional development that bridges the gaps between the research-based best practices that are supported by their district, the capacities and belief systems of their teachers, the real quantitative and qualitative indicators of achievement by their students, and the overall context in which teaching and learning occur. While their main goal is to solve problems, their focus is also to create a community of learners. They engage teachers in the processes they would like to see them engage with their own students: they place thought-provoking issues in front of them and then ask them to reflect, respond, and act on what they've learned in the form of the crucial changes in practice that are suggested. Looking at data is a crucial first step in the process of making meaningful changes in instructional practice. But the real challenge is to create the space for honest and trustful discourse both one-on-one and in groups about what actions those data actually suggest.",

Assessment means watching and knowing the children in all areas. It is figuring out, as effectively as possible, how their minds and personalities work. Though she has found a place in her teaching for assessment to be meaningful and productive, a place from which she can describe every student as gifted because she sees and understands the areas in which they are, assessment still looms over them. The students in her class go through cycles. Often they seem happy, confident in their abilities, able to recognize various strengths in themselves and others. Yet it seems that whenever she feels confident that they have truly made progress, something happens that shows her how deeply the underlying concern about assessment is imbedded in them, and in her. This ranges from individual feelings of failure after struggling to master an easily assessed skill like spelling to a general consensus that a certain child is the &quot;smartest&quot; in the class. She keeps struggling to make her class a safe and honest environment, to make it a place where her assessments are clear to kids and parents, where they value children's progression and movement, and not only their abilities. She has no definitive answers. All she has is the underlying sense that at its core, assessment must be about looking for ways to help children learn more by about finding the ways and places in which they shine.",

She shares how she integrated the use of the Internship Ning, a social networking site that serves as a virtual classroom where students can discuss their internships, exchange ideas, and offer feedback and support to one another. This gives them the opportunity to benefit from everyone's insights and experiences in addition to their own.

It was born out of a hard conversation, good listening, and a lot of faith. A big part of her role as an educator, whether she is teaching dance, theater, social justice, or sex education (all of which she teaches at Crefeld School), is to help young people find their voices, their opinions, and their ideas. It is also vital to her that she figures out ways to support her students not only to know what they think, but also to help them find ways to express themselves. When she has choreographed dances for her modern dance class in the past, she used a theme to inspire movement. The pieces contained images and energetic qualities related to that theme. The focus was on performance skills, ensemble building, and movement execution. This time, however, they decided to make a dance that was really about something.",

        "description":"When the author first arrived at Charleston Collegiate School, she was handed a college-level Microsoft business applications textbook and told she'd be teaching a one-semester ninth grade technology course. Since the course had never been taught before, she was given little more direction than: \"Teach them Office and anything else you think they need to know about computers for the Upper School.\" She looked at the beast of the 944-page textbook and sighed; she had been teaching technology since 1991, but always in the context of the students' core subject classes. Her students learned the technical skills, but they didn't find the assignments interesting. After a year of this, she decided she needed to change things significantly. Scheduling issues and limited resources made teaching the technology skills in the context of subject areas difficult; she needed to come up with her own context which would help students recognize the many practical applications for technology, as well as those situations where a pencil sketch, a 3-D model, or a face-to-face encounter might be a better approach. Her first instinct was to have the students create small businesses. Since her background was more on the nonprofit side, she decided to teach a lesson about nonprofit organizations. The author thought that her students could get some insight into why people choose to work for a cause rather than a profit. By now she and her students were about eight weeks into their study of nonprofits and many things were becoming second nature to the students. They understood the financial constraints that nonprofits were under, and they did everything with that in mind. By the end of the semester, the students had constructed their organizations so solidly and had internalized their messages so completely that visitors to their exhibition found it difficult to differentiate between our real and invented worlds.",

        "description":"Cell phones, laptops, the Internet and social networking sites make teachers anxious and magnify the gap between teacher and student. The influx of devices creates a clamor, but little clarity for schools. When the author began investigating the issue, he discovered a heated debate and a spectrum of views. Then a colleague sent him Clayton Christensen's &quot;Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns.&quot; The term &quot;disruptive&quot; immediately resonated because he believes teaching, classrooms, and schools desperately need disruption. Although they need to balance their enthusiasm with skepticism, any potential for meaningful change warrants consideration. A set of recent developments increases the possibility of a real disruption: (1) the technology-immersed character of &quot;digital natives,&quot; known as the NetGen; (2) a bottom-up push for technology's place in schools; (3) the interactive and participatory possibilities of Web 2.0; and (4) an increasing acceptance of the notion of social knowledge construction (as embodied in wikis). Transformative disruption is much more likely to occur in Essential schools and other schools that nurture learning communities. The response of teachers to new technologies, whether they reach out with a hammer or a curious mind, can be influenced by schools culture and professional community. When a school is conceived as a community of learners in which curiosity is nurtured and where teachers are encouraged to collaborate, take risks, and experiment, technology will more likely disrupt positively. A teacher's view of a laptop as a fence or a bridge can be influenced by colleagues and the culture of the school in which they teach. Where the student perspective is front and center, technological innovation can flourish and contribute to a transformation of teaching, learning, and schools themselves. Coalition of Essential Schools (CES) schools are well situated to harness technology for the transformation of teaching and learning because the CES Common Principles incorporate a valid, student-centered pedagogy, a teacher-as-coach model, personalization, and respect for students. These schools are collaborative and reward risk-taking.",

        "description":"In 2001, Boston Day and Evening Academy (BDEA) started its Distance Learning Program (DL) to serve students who could not come to school on a regular basis. Because it is by design a competency-based school, the opportunity to have a program where students truly demonstrated the required skill set rather than just attending specific courses met the school's mission. Initially, the DL program was designed for a specified group of students who met the criteria of being able to demonstrate independent study skills and had issues that kept them from attending school regularly. BDEA aimed to lease school-owned laptops to them so they could complete a competency-based program from home. BDEA students have had interruptions in their high school careers; generally speaking, students have had a rough road of it. Because of the independent nature of the DL program, the school members prefer that students are at least 18 years old, have had some time in high school, have passed at least one if not two of the required Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) tests, and have a significant reason for not being able to attend school regularly. When students enter the DL program, the program instructors design an academic plan based on what the students' transcripts and progress reflect. The program is not a &quot;one-size fits all&quot; curriculum. Each student has his or her own academic plan and schedule, based on the school-wide, competency-based Individualized Learning Plan frameworks. Once teachers establish their students' status in terms of demonstrated competencies, they can establish a &quot;prescription for completion.&quot; BDEA students must complete three major requirements in order to graduate; competency demonstration, MCAS passage, and Capstone Project completion.",

        "description":"Many years ago, when the author first started teaching, a colleague showed him a great technique for communicating with families: At the end of the day, she used a 24- by 16-inch chart tablet to produce daily news in shared writing with her students. She, and then the author, chose one student each day to take the tablet home. That student illustrated the news from that day. The student's family read the news, along with all of the previous news reports. The students took turns, so families saw it about once a month. Over the years, the author has gotten away from that tablet technique, but he has never stopped looking for ways to get kids to write about real things with a real audience in mind. One year he ended each day by writing a blog with his class. They discussed the events of the day, chose one to focus on, and brainstormed details. They wrote and published on the spot. This year, the author decided to try using Twitter, and the more they use it, the more power he has found in it. Their class Twitter site now has more than 350 entries (called tweets), and they manage to add four or five each day. Tweeting throughout the day means that writing has become an integral part of whatever they do, rather than a separate subject that is given some attention and then put away to be forgotten until the next day. It has also taught the students to see their lives and activities as worth sharing. And it is extremely rare that anyone tells him they don't know what to write about.",

All students are trained in basic web design to build and maintain their digital portfolios. These skills equip them with tools they will likely use in their future endeavors in college and the professional world. Teachers at CNHS believe using the Internet as a tool to communicate and present ideas is a basic requirement of students heading into a future with a greater reliance on technology for a range of different careers. In use since 2004, Camino Nuevo's digital portfolios have been both an educational tool and a unifying aspect of the school culture and community. In the classes that the author teaches at CNHS--graphic design, journalism, and senior seminar--he has linked the digital portfolio closely with classroom expectations for posting work for critique, grading, and presentation, making the portfolio an integral part of the class routine. Using the &quot;DP,&quot; as the digital portfolio is often referred to, in this way gives the students practice updating and improving their skills in presenting work online.",

        "author":["Varghese, Thomas"],
        "description":"Recent reforms in mathematics education have led to an increased emphasis on proof and reasoning in mathematics curricula. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics highlights the important role that teachers' knowledge and beliefs play in shaping students' understanding of mathematics, their confidence in and outlook on mathematics education, and their ability to use math to solve fundamental problems. It is crucial that teachers, especially the uninitiated, understand on a deep level the mathematical concepts that they are expected to teach to adolescents. Thus, it becomes critical for teacher educators to assess the understanding and abilities of student teachers in constructing mathematical proof. The analysis in this study is based on three factors: 1) meaning of proof, 2) ideas about teaching methods on proof, and 3) ideas about the use-fullness of proof in a mathematics classroom. An analysis of the data collected from this study indicates that current student teachers' conceptions of mathematical proof are limited. The uneasiness expressed by student teachers about mathematical proof may suggest an examination of students' experiences with the mathematical proof in both secondary and post secondary classrooms.

        "description":"Teacher education programs are designed to provide candidates opportunities to explore effective ways to teach K-12 students mathematics. Although many of these experiences engage candidates in investigations of pedagogies using technology, manipulatives, media, etc., they often only involve and emphasize more formal experiences such as demonstrated in micro-teaching, K-12 school classroom internships, and mathematics content courses. This article describes teacher candidates' capabilities of learning how to teach mathematics through an informal learning experience. Candidates visited the North Carolina Battleship and wrote lesson plans on integrating the Battleship culture into high school mathematics objectives. The article concludes with a discussion of candidates' reaction to and attitudes about the informal learning experience and their perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of learning teaching strategies in this fashion.

The current study evaluated the efficacy of and preference for social interaction within differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) and noncontingent reinforcement (NCR) schedules with typically developing children. Results showed that 7 of the 8 children preferred the DRA schedule; 1 child was indifferent. We also demonstrated a high degree of procedural fidelity, which suggested that preference is influenced by the presence of a contingency under which reinforcement can be obtained. These findings are discussed in terms of (a) the selection of reinforcement schedules in practice, (b) variables that influence children's preferences for contexts, and (c) the selection of experimental control procedures when evaluating the effects of reinforcement.

We examined the generality of this finding by evaluating shot selection of college (Study 1) and professional (Study 3) players. The matching law accounted for the majority of variance in shot selection, with undermatching and a bias for taking three-point shots. Shot-selection matching varied systematically for players who (a) were members of successful versus unsuccessful teams, (b) competed at different levels of collegiate play, and (c) served as regulars versus substitutes (Study 2).

Next, we tested two predictions of economic theory: that overall consumption (reinforcers obtained) would decrease as the unit price (response requirement per reinforcer) increased and that the cost and benefit components that defined unit price would not influence overall consumption considerably when unit price values were equal. We tested these predictions by arranging unit price such that the denominator was one (e.g., two responses produced one reinforcer) or two (e.g., four responses produced two reinforcers). Results showed that consumption decreased as unit price increased and that unit price values with different components produced similar consumption. (Contains 4 figures and 1 table.)",

The article presents the Faculty Engagement Model (FEM), which results from a broad literature review and offers a comprehensive perspective outlining the personal, professional, and institutional factors likely to predict engagement participation.

        "description":"A significant number of community service-learning projects in higher education involve the teaching or tutoring of immigrants in English. As in related service-learning scholarship, these projects are commonly informed by perspectives on cultural difference, social justice, and power relations in U.S. society. Yet while faculty pair their students' work in immigrant literacy programs with the classroom examination of issues of race, class, gender, and ethnicity, very little of the scholarship suggests that these students are led to critique the role of language ideologies in U.S. society. In this article I urge that institutionalized notions of English in the U.S.--such as the putative role of English in social mobility and the widespread belief that English was always voluntarily adopted by immigrants--be considered closely in our community literacy projects. My argument calls upon sociolinguistic and historical studies of the Progressive period and examines most closely language ideologies in the settlement house movement, an important origin for historians of community service-learning.

        "description":"Although a vibrant literature on the social justice advantages of writing service-learning programs has existed for many years, the focus has tended to be on specific projects and courses, often accompanied by an understandable suspicion that entrenched institutions like universities have interests inimical to radical social change. As a result, analyses of the practical possibilities of building and administering well-articulated programs, especially in research universities, remain scarce. I argue for precisely such a systematic, institutional approach--a strategy from the center that underwrites flexible tactics in the field--by considering the case of the writing in the majors program at Cornell University. I survey  Cornell's environs in terms of overlapping circles of need, then illustrate how the writing program's three chief resources--training teachers and mentors, funding graduate students, and practicing a flexible, discipline-centered writing pedagogy--have enabled us to construct multiple partnerships in a short time. The example is of use to service-learning theorists as well as writing program administrators attempting to build progressive Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) programs in their institutions. I argue that although many challenges remain, this type of alliance can combat the chief threat facing service-learning today: not institutional power but rather institutional neglect, which exacerbates what Michel de Certeau calls &quot;the erosion of time.&quot; (Contains 5 notes.)",

Not only have these programs attracted individuals from different disciplines and educational backgrounds, they have also changed the ethnic and gender makeup of the classroom teaching population. This suggests an increase in point-of-view diversity in the teaching workforce which in turn suggests potential opportunities to effect planned variation in the educational experiences of students in urban schools. The current study examines the perceptions of teachers who come from these non-traditional programs. The study also addresses cultural issues related to teacher perceptions of effective classroom learning environments. The results in the present study suggest that a majority of the teachers surveyed perceived that a classroom that supports cooperative or group activities is an effective classroom environment. Finally, there were significant differences in teacher perceptions of effective teacher practices across teacher ethnicities. These differences, if viewed as resources, may manifest themselves in the form of pathways toward enriching the educational experiences of students in urban schools. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Additionally, it documents reenrollment issues expressed by district staff and reenrollees. In 2001/02, there were 3,856 first-time ninth grade students enrolled in SBCUSD high schools. By 2005/06, 45.0 percent earned regular high school diplomas, and 35.1 percent dropped out at least once during the five years. Notably, dropping out is not necessarily a permanent outcome, and among the dropouts, 31.0 percent eventually reenrolled in district high schools. The enrollment data show that the majority of reenrollees dropped out in their first year of high school, and that nearly half returned to school for only one year. It also shows variation in student  characteristics with ninth grade, Black, non English Language Learners, and female dropouts reenrolling at higher rates than others. The evidence also indicates that while reenrollees fared better academically before dropping out than permanent dropouts, most, upon reenrollment, did not earn enough credits to graduate. Nevertheless, 18.4 percent of reenrollees earned a district high school diploma by 2005/06. The study also documents what district staff and reenrollees say about policies and practices to improve graduation outcomes for dropouts who return to school. By focusing on reenrollees, this study contributes to shaping policy responses to address the broader dropout challenge. (Contains 4 figures.)",

This article reports the results of the first phase of the New York State School Library Impact Study, funded by the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services, which investigates the effect of school libraries in New York State on student achievement and extends previous statewide library impact studies, using multiple research methods, to explore (1) the influence of the SLMS on technology use, (2) the relationship between principals and their SLMSs and (3) the level of service to students with disabilities. Results are expected to provide guidance for effective school library programs and services and increase our understanding of the complex and multidimensional ways in which school libraries influence student learning.

        "description":"An analysis of postings on the LM_NET discussion list was conducted to better understand school library media specialist (SLMS) perceptions of the potential effect of structural challenges on their role in teaching Web evaluation skills. Structural challenges are institutional in the form of government regulation and school culture, and are defined in terms of a three facets: (1) high stakes testing; (2) &quot;everyone in charge, no one in charge&quot; (in which professional roles and school norms vary or are poorly defined); and (3) limited access to digital media. Results reveal relatively little discussion of the effect of high-stakes testing despite the high profile of this issue in the education literature and the mainstream media. The &quot;everyone in charge, no one in charge&quot; category garnered the most emotionally charged responses and was further subdivided into discussions of professional standards and of defining and defending professional roles. The limited access category addressed externally imposed limitations (generally in the form of filtering software) as well as the occurrence of self-limiting behaviors and choices. A prevailing theme throughout the discussions was the &quot;workaround,&quot; in which SLMSs attempt to get by or even thrive within a set of circumstances that are beyond their control.

        "description":"This study investigated how school and public librarians can become better disseminators of health information and improve health information literacy in small and rural communities in a selected research area. We used the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas as our study area, composed of the economically depressed Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, and Willacy counties, populated largely by people of Mexican descent. We used a Delphi method in which an expert panel of school and public librarians (N = 19) responded to three rounds of questions regarding how school and public librarians might become active as disseminators of health information in their communities for K-12 youth and their caregivers. Generally the panel held that (1) health information is lacking in their communities; (2) school and public librarians can play important roles in making health information available; (3) school and public librarians can network with other agencies in promoting and disseminating health information for K-12 youth; (4) resource availability will limit how much librarians can become involved in the dissemination of health information; (5) participants are not willing to assume a health-information &quot;gatekeeper&quot; role; and (6) library staffs needed training in health information resources. We included recommendations for future research in health literacy. (Contains 9 tables.)",

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to offer a critical consideration of instructional software designed particularly for children. Since the early 1990s computer applications integrating education with entertainment have been adopted on a large scale by both educators and parents. It is expected that through edutainment software the process of learning is going to be colorful and fun and that learners can acquire information without work and serious study. The aim of this article is to draw attention to possible harmful effects of this wholesale adoption of edutainment software, particularly to introducing learning \"as a bitter medicine that needs the sugar-coating of entertainment to become palatable\" (Resnick, 2004). It argues that it may be time to examine critically the educational potential of such software together with the advantages and disadvantages it might bring to the instructional process. The discussion focuses, after a brief definition of edutainment, on five English language teaching software packages for kids which are randomly selected from the market. They are examined through McKenzie's (2000) Assessment Chart to see to what extent the implementation of edutainment software has been able to match their promises. The study calls for critical awareness of how instructional software is impacting education and at the same time for the engagement of teachers in exploring the computer applications that shape classroom learning and teaching.

Self-efficacy was assessed by three factors: Basic Teaching Skills (BTS), Advanced Teaching Skills (ATS), and Technology for Pedagogy (TP), and intended use of technology was measured by two factors: Traditional Use of Technology (TUT) and Constructivist Use of Technology (CUT). Participants responded to a 7-point Likert-type scale for each factor. Analysis was conducted using the structural equation modelling approach and a good model fit was found for both the measurement and structural models. Results showed that significant relationships exist among BTS, TP, TUT, and CUT. However, ATS did not influence TUT and CUT in a significant way. Overall, the results of this study offer some evidence that student teachers' self-efficacy is a significant influence on whether they use technology in a traditionalist or constructivist way.

Data were collected from pre and post surveys, journal entries, participant observations, and electronic portfolios. Findings indicate that over the course of the program the project participants significantly increased their confidence and competence to integrate technology into the teaching and learning process. Technology-integrated lessons developed by the project participants included the use of a variety of advanced technology tools to facilitate learning in science. Using collaborative partnerships helped many teachers to use technology with their students and increased their motivation and enthusiasm towards technology based training. The study demonstrates that an approach to professional development that encourages networking, mutual learning, and sharing of strategies and resources among science educators is an effective strategy to improve technology integration in science education.

The two instruments were used to collect data for this study. The pre-posttest designed to identify students' achievement score and Kolb's Learning Style Inventory to measure students' learning style. As a result, it has been clarified that the type of the learning style was not significantly effective on students' achievement in different learning environments. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)",

An experimental pattern with pretest-posttest control group was used in the study. The study group consists of a total of 57 students--28 in the experiment group and 29 in the control group--at Kirsehir High School. The experiment group was subject to hybrid learning through the Geography web page, while the traditional learning model was used for the control group. The data were collected through literature review, the Geography Attitude Scale, and the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory with Cronbach Alpha values of 0.92 and 0.88, respectively. The data were then subjected to percentage, arithmetic mean, t-test, ANOVA, Scheffe and Pearson correlation tests and the results were interpreted (p less than 0.05). As a results: Blended learning model contributed more to student attitudes toward geography course when compared to the traditional learning model; blended learning model contributed more to student critical dispositions and levels when compared to the traditional learning model; and there was a positive correlation between student attitudes toward geography course and their critical thinking dispositions and levels.

        "author":["Cochran-Smith, Marilyn"],
        "description":"Despite the fact that most teacher education programs report that they have thoroughly incorporated diversity perspectives and multicultural content into the curriculum, external examinations often prove to the contrary. Likewise, synthesizers of the research on teacher education have consistently concluded that despite more than two decades of multicultural reform, little has really changed in the ways teachers are prepared in college- and university-based programs. Along related but somewhat different lines, institutional and governmental policies purportedly committed to the same goals of providing all children equal access to highly qualified teachers often turn out to be strikingly different from (and sometimes even diametrically opposed to) one another in implementation and ramifications. Discrepancies like these attest to the fact that there are dramatically different takes on &quot;teacher preparation for diversity,&quot; &quot;multicultural teacher education,&quot; and &quot;teaching for social justice&quot; as well as major disparities (sometimes even among people considered like-minded) in notions of &quot;equity,&quot; &quot;teacher learning,&quot; &quot;social change,&quot; and &quot;highly qualified&quot; teachers for &quot;all students.&quot; Given the importance of these issues and the multiple meanings noted above, this article suggests that rich conceptual frameworks are needed to help clarify differing underlying assumptions, sort out discrepancies between theory and practice, and analyze the ways they are entangled with competing political agendas. In this article, the author proposes a conceptual framework designed to accomplish these tasks, building its pieces through a series of interlocking figures and also sketching the &quot;answer&quot; to each of the key questions that is suggested by multicultural teacher education theory. The answers suggested by theory, however, are not necessarily (and sometimes not at all) the ones operating in actual teacher preparation policies, practices, and programs. Thus as she describes the framework, the author also illustrates in broad strokes some of the differences between multicultural teacher education theory and practice as well as some aspects of the range and variation among actual examples of policy and programs.

        "author":["Hoffman-Kipp, Peter"],
        "description":"Interest of teacher educators working in the field of social justice focuses on the ways in which teachers learn to inscribe their professional activity within social movements (for progressive change. The community of practice (COP) approach to understanding learning as a social process has a lot of currency right now in teacher education programs (TEPs), especially those that require such a fundamental social justice commitment. The creation of social justice educators becomes a transformation of active and peripheral participation within a community, not a transmission of social justice content. The COP approach is an important development in the move from transmission to transformation of participation as a model for teacher education. As the COP approach widens its influence on teacher education, it would be wise for teacher educators to challenge this framework to include more rigorous attention to the actual activities in which teachers engage both from a process and content point of view. The COP approach could benefit from attention to cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) and critical pedagogy (CP). These theoretical traditions would assist teachers and teacher educators in making sense of the kind activities that provide the most potential for social justice teacher education. Utilizing data from a larger study, this paper provides a framework rooted in CHAT and CP for understanding how preservice teachers develop a political consciousness and cultural sensitivity in their teaching.

        "author":["Moscovici, Hedy"],
        "description":"Various major publications such as the National Science Education Standards (National Research Council, 1996) and the collection of research results regarding the use of inquiry methodology in the teaching and learning of science edited by Minstrell &amp; van Zee (2000) recommend that science should be taught in the same way that it is constructed--using inquiry. The National Research Council (2000) takes a step forward and provides practitioners examples and illustrations of how inquiry science looks in the classroom. During inquiries, students ask questions and plan ways to answer them, collect, represent, and organize data to create knowledge, and then test the reliability of the generated knowledge. During this process, students learn to cope with difficulties, and react to constructive criticism provided by the teacher and peers. As a result, students re-examine their research, and decide if more data needs to be collected in order to enhance the generalizability of their findings. But, the question is, can students feel empowered to take such a meaningful role in their learning? How do teachers cope with such a change in the teaching and learning roles and how do they solve their discomfort once they get out of their &quot;comfort zone&quot;? And, how much support for implementing and sustaining inquiry in the science classroom do these teachers get from their schools and their districts? This study explores the effect of a teaching module that encourages secondary science teachers working on emergency permits (EPTs) to analyze their power positions within the classroom, their school, district, and community. This study reinforces the idea that educators need to school the future generation of teachers to be able to analyze their teaching conditions, and, with the help of theoretical and practical ideas on teaching, make the necessary changes that will lead to improved students' learning. This study concludes that teaching and exploring power relationships in science teachers' lives is essential if everyone wants the teachers to change their practices toward inquiry science.",

        "description":"Efforts at reforming urban schools have often revolved around choosing the \"right\" formulaic programs or providing sufficient funds to repair schools. However, too little attention has been paid to staffing schools with competent teachers who desire to stay and effect reform. Finding ways to educate student teachers and novice teachers at these schools so they see themselves as capable of generating substantive change has been difficult. How does a university assist student teachers at urban sites to become both competent and empowered while simultaneously learning to teach? As teacher educators who place student teachers solely in urban settings, the authors contend that novice teachers need to develop feelings of \"ownership\" so they feel empowered to transform the urban educational setting rather than feel defeated by it. The question, then, is this: How does a teacher education program based on the premise of developing novice teachers as \"transformative\" urban educators place student teachers in urban classrooms? The authors seek to investigate this question by examining the placement of their student teachers in two urban schools. At both schools, at the end of the first year, it was found that the preservice teachers had become change agents for their guiding teachers in terms of implementing changes and thinking about practice. This finding fueled additional study and analysis to flesh out the conditions under which students effect change in their placements. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"Over the past decade or more, educators and policymakers have sought to define new directions for teacher education in order to address widely perceived failures to prepare teachers adequately for the challenges to be faced in schools, especially those serving the poor and English learners. As colleges of education and urban school districts have established collaborative Professional Development Schools (PDSs) to meet the particular needs of under-resourced urban schools, they have discovered unexpected challenges that exacerbate the already difficult issues that they set out to address. This article investigates some of these structural, equity, and political obstacles that confront the reconstruction of teacher education programs in the effort to make them responsive to the needs of low-income, culturally and linguistically diverse (LI/CLD) students in public schools. In addition, the article elaborates some principles of the engaged pedagogy required to address these students' needs and the broad range of inequities that impact their schools. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "author":["Morrell, Ernest"],
        "description":"Teacher attrition and teacher burnout are among the most serious problems facing urban schools today. With teachers under constant siege, under resourced, and often under prepared, the revolving door of urban teaching has left schools, and therefore children, in a constant state of flux. These dehumanizing and de-intellectualized conditions of teaching have led many would-be critical educators out of the classroom. Without stable teaching forces in central city schools, students and staffs are at a loss to build networks of trust or engage in long-term, local-level reforms. The recent emphasis on teacher education is important, but it cannot overshadow the need to focus on the teachers who are already in schools. Key components in the struggle for social justice urban schools have to be teacher retention and meaningful professional development. This article examines a critical research seminar involving urban students and teachers as a site for teacher learning and development. The author locates this work within critical and sociocultural traditions to advocate for professional development that is situated in meaningful practice and empowering of teachers as intellectuals and as agents of reform. He describes in detail the summer research seminar of the Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access (IDEA), a community of practice where urban students and teachers, along with university researchers, come together to investigate issues related to equity and access for marginalized populations within schools. From a variety of sources, including interview and survey data, videotapes of seminar activity, and transcripts from meetings, the author articulates four key participation structures that facilitated legitimate peripheral participation during the critical research seminar. He concludes by suggesting ways that learning generated from this seminar can assist teachers, administrators, and teacher-educators who wish to reconsider professional development.",

        "author":["Cooper, Camille Wilson"],
        "description":"In this article, the author discusses African American mothers' beliefs about the negative impact that teacher bias can have on students' self-esteem and academic achievement. She draws from in-depth interview data to highlight mothers' opinions of, and experiences with, teachers they characterize as &quot;unqualified&quot; and &quot;uncaring.&quot; The data stem from a qualitative study of African American mothers' educational views, experiences, and choices. The data shed light on how these mothers perceive teachers as powerful figures who can undermine their efforts to provide their children with equal, educational opportunity and a positive sense of racial identity. The mothers' sentiments accord with growing bodies of research and critical theory that stress the influential nature of teacher ideology. In addition, the narratives of African American mothers challenge prior research that questions the caring nature of low-income and working class parents of color and doubts the extent to which they value education. Data resoundingly show that the mothers whose standpoint is discussed in this article deeply care about their children's schooling. In fact, their shared conviction that educational attainment is vital to their children's success contributes to their efforts to find competent and caring teachers--even if it requires them to exit the traditional public school system, despite their limited socioeconomic means. Consequently, the author draws from feminist theory to underscore the importance of teacher education programs training social justice educators to be knowledgeable about the positionality of the students and families they serve. She stresses the need for teachers to recognize schools as sites of political resistance, which they must work to improve. This requires that teacher education programs offer ongoing opportunities for their students to examine their beliefs, acknowledge and overcome their biases, and understand the relationship between teacher ideology and practice. It also warrants that educators and school reformers capitalize upon parents' strengths and heed their input to better educate children. (Contains 2 notes.)",

To assess how well students were prepared for the reality of teaching, faculty members interviewed and observed the graduates teaching in their classrooms. They deliberately chose to select graduates who had been teaching three to five years, well beyond their first year of teaching. What is it like, they asked, to be a new teacher? What is the nature of the teaching context (the professional community, administrative support, school climate, etc.)? What theories and methods were most useful to these new teachers, and in what ways did their experiences in the credential programs prepare them for these jobs?

        "description":"This article represents the author's mindscape as she grew in her teaching of educational philosophy from using a transmissive approach to an approach that seeks to make educational philosophy--an abstract learning content--instructive to the everyday life of teaching in classrooms. The author took a detour in her thinking about the relevance of educational philosophy in the curriculum of teacher education as a result of the convincing advocacy for connection of belief and practice from a respected voice in education. Once she became receptive to this initial idea, the door of her mind was opened to consider other voices extolling the same idea. The change in her teaching started first in her mind and thinking. In other words, her philosophy of teaching educational philosophy changed, then tentatively, but assuredly the change that had occurred in her mind took life and shape in action. She has given voice to the stages of the transformation in her teaching for the purpose of inviting other teacher educators to do the same. It is also important to reiterate that this process is continuous. In this article, the author has described one example of how she has effected a transformation in her teaching of educational philosophy with a group of graduate students at an off campus teaching site. This initial implementation of a paradigm shift has opened up other possibilities for empowering preservice teachers to become knowledge constructors, and not mere passive absorbers of the educational beliefs of more knowledgeable others.",

        "author":["Street, Chris"],
        "description":"The relationship between attitude and the practice of teaching writing among preservice teachers is an important consideration for a number of reasons. Perhaps most significantly, these students will soon be responsible for teaching writing in schools where superior writing instruction is needed. The need for improving the effectiveness of future writing teachers is underscored by a recent evaluation by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which indicated that only half of the students in grades 4, 8, and 12 in the United States are able to write adequate responses to informative, persuasive, or narrative writing tasks. The NAEP report also reveals that students generally receive little writing instruction. Furthermore, work by Lucas (1993) indicates that writing process is not as well established in the United States as advocates might have hoped. Therefore, it seems that greater efforts should be &quot;given to the professional development of teachers who will be expected to guide students' writing.&quot; Certainly in any profession there are &quot;certain sets of attitudes essential to the effective conduct of that profession.&quot; Since research clearly demonstrates the important relationship between teachers' attitudes about writing and their performance in the classroom, research that explores where writing attitudes originate and how they influence practice are worthy of attention. In this study, the author asks the following questions: (1) What attitudes did pre-service teachers hold regarding writing and the teaching of writing when they entered their final semester of pre-service professional education?; (2) What were the major influences on these attitudes?; and (3) What was the relationship between the participants' writing attitudes and the teaching process they actually employed during student teaching?

        "description":"Over the previous two decades the emergence of post-modernist thought (i.e., radical constructivism, social constructivism, deconstructivism, post-structuralism, and the like) on the American intellectual landscape has presented a number of challenges to various fields of intellectual endeavor (i.e., literature, natural science, and social science). Nowhere is this challenge more evident and therefore more problematic than in the application of post-modernism (in the form of constructivist teaching) to the classroom. Employing constructivist teaching practices is problematic at two levels: (1) there is an absence of empirical evidence of effectiveness; and (2) employing this approach for which there is a lack of evidential support, means not employing instructional practices for which there \"is\" empirical support. This article presents an overview and critique of constructivist teaching practices, followed by a brief review of evidenced-based practices in teaching. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"Although it is recognized that teachers play a pivot role in shaping the overall attitudes towards students with disabilities in classrooms, little research has focused on redesigning preservice teacher training programs to facilitate more positive feelings in the interactions between teachers and students with disabilities. Specific factors have been shown to influence how teachers interact with students with disabilities. By addressing these factors in preservice teacher training, it is suggested that the classroom practices of future teachers would ultimately be modified. Recently, two Australian universities (The University of Queensland and the University of Southern Queensland) reconfigured their preservice special education courses to address concerns that existing preservice programs are not adequately preparing teachers for inclusive education and the newly developed national standards and guidelines for initial teacher education in Australia. The redesigned courses incorporated a number of innovative practices to help improve students' attitudes toward people with disabilities. The present study investigates the effect of participating in the 10-week special needs course on preservice teachers' attitudes towards people with disabilities. Of particular interest, were any changes concerning preservice teachers' feelings of discomfort during interactions with individuals with disabilities. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"In order for teachers to reflect deeply upon themselves, they need powerful models and images to guide their introspection. In teacher reflectivity, as in the therapeutic processes, psychic energy must ultimately be \"contained\" by models and modalities that enable one to make sense out of one's inner and outer experiences. This enables those experiences to form the basis for the transformation of self, setting, and other. In this article, the author would like to introduce and employ a model that he believes can enrich teacher reflectivity at biographical, political and spiritual levels. The author is speaking of alchemy--and specifically, Carl Jung's psychotherapeutic interpretation of it. In the last major phase of his career, Jung, the father of archetypal psychology, turned to the lost art and arcane texts of alchemy in his researches, claiming that alchemical processes subtly embodied and richly symbolized the psycho-spiritual transformations that occur in the course of deep therapy. He asserted that \"the world of alchemical symbols definitely does not belong to the rubbish heap of the past, but stands in a very real and living relationship to the most recent discoveries concerning the psychology of the unconscious.\" In this article, the author shows how alchemy in its psychotherapeutic contexts offers especially rich symbols for exploring oneself as a teacher.",

          "Beck, Clive"],
        "description":"Much has been written in recent decades about the importance of community in education. According to some of the literature, a solution to the lack of community in preservice education might lie in the creation of \"cohort programs,\" in which a relatively small number of student teachers engage in their coursework and (insofar as possible) their fieldwork \"together,\" under the guidance of a small faculty team. The authors' elementary preservice cohort program at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto (OISE/UT)--the Mid-Town Option--is similar to many of the cohort-based programs described in the literature. And they have experienced many of the same successes and challenges. Their program is somewhat distinctive, however, in its unusually heavy emphasis on class community. They devote a great deal of attention to community building, viewing the experience of community as perhaps the single most important feature of their program. In this paper, the authors concentrate on only one aspect of the topic of community in preservice education, namely, the role of \"faculty\" in building community. Further, they focus just on \"student\" perceptions of this role. Their data source for this study was six randomly selected students in the class of 1998-99, each of whom they interviewed on four occasions. In reporting the findings, they present in turn a series of themes that emerged in the interviews, each one corresponding to a contribution most or all of the students felt the faculty had made to building community in the program. In each section, the authors first report the students' views of the faculty role, and their assessment of its importance for the life of the community and their personal and professional development. They then briefly discuss the theme in general terms, showing how, in their view, the contribution fits into the structure of class community.",

        "description":"The literature indicates that caring is beneficial to children both academically and socially. As teacher educators, then, one of their goals should be to create curricula and preparation programs that engender in preservice teachers an understanding of the pedagogical power of caring and a commitment to implementing care-centered teaching practices in their classrooms (Arnstine, 1990; Goodlad, Soder & Sirotnik, 1990; Noddings, 1986). The authors explored these fundamental issues in a recent study of a group of preservice elementary teachers. In a previous article (Goldstein & Lake, 2000) the authors focused on the preconceptions and beliefs about caring brought by preservice teachers to their first field placements; in this article they examine the ways in which the preservice teachers' preconceived understandings of caring teaching played out as they engaged in their first field placements. Central to this article is discussion of the shifts and changes that occurred in their preservice teachers' beliefs about the relationship of caring and teaching. Their findings reveal preservice teachers poised at a threshold of professional possibility. Working in a zone of discomfort and disequilibrium, the preservice teachers struggled with establishing their professional identity as caring teachers and coping with the tensions between caring and loss in teaching. Hollingsworth (1989) insists that teacher educators \"should come to understand the incoming beliefs of [their] students\". They support this belief. However, their work in this study suggests that understanding preservice teachers' incoming beliefs is only a first step. Teacher educators must also attend carefully to the ways that those beliefs are challenged or reinforced during the preservice teachers' field placement experiences.",

While the numbers of students from diverse backgrounds are increasing, the U.S. teaching force consists primarily of monolingual middle- to lower-middle class European American women who may lack the requisite background knowledge, skills, and dispositions to teach effectively children from sociolinguistically diverse backgrounds. Unexamined mismatches between prospective teachers' worldviews and the worldviews and life experiences of their students can be devastating for children. In this manuscript, the authors frame some of the most significant problems that they face as teacher educators striving to help preservice teachers in their courses examine their world views and the impact that their world views can have on their work with children whose backgrounds are different from their own. In the following sections, the authors draw on scholarly literature to explore what their colleagues have learned about teaching others to develop positive dispositions about diversity. They also explore the persistent problems scholars identify as they continue to struggle with educating preservice teachers for diversity. Then, using a dialogue format, they discuss their experiences with one problematic student (pseudonym, Shanna) who was enrolled in each of the authors' courses during a recent semester. Their goal is to use this article to explore ways to improve their own teaching so that their students will learn to serve effectively children from diverse backgrounds in their future classrooms.",

        "description":"During the 1998-1999 academic year, the authors' state board of teaching changed the licensure configurations in early childhood from Birth to Age 5 to Birth through Age 8. This made early childhood teacher licensure commensurate with the National Association for the Education of Young Children's recommendation that an early childhood program is any group program in a center, school, or other facility that serves children from Birth through Age 8. Historically, their early childhood studies program at a small university in the Midwest has prepared students to work in child care centers, family-child-care homes, Head Start programs, private and public preschool, and parent education and community education programs. They needed to expand their program to prepare students to work in kindergartens and primary grade schools. The movement to a new program meant that education licensure students in their last year of teacher preparation had content and practice in the area of Birth to Age 5, but still needed the Age 5 to Age 8 content information. The authors developed and implemented a special course in the summer of 1999 that addressed mathematics and literacy Kindergarten through Grade 3. They then used the experience of implementing this course to guide their development of the Birth to Age 8 mathematics and literacy course for the new licensure program. This article reports their thoughts, struggles, expectations and surprises as they describe their backgrounds, planning for the course, implementation of the course, preliminary findings, implementation of subsequent courses, conclusions, and implications. The authors share these ideas from a new experience in hopes of fostering discussion and thought about content learning in early childhood courses.",

The BLTEP curriculum blends the regular Liberal Studies Program with the elementary credential program. Students take both subject matter and pedagogy courses concurrently, as well as a set of blended content and pedagogy courses in science, social science, and mathematics. This article details the curriculum development process of the blended mathematics course, &quot;LBS 360 Math Content and Methods.&quot; The content in this course combines the study of real numbers and problem solving with pedagogy for teaching math content to elementary-aged students. The blending of content and pedagogy is described, along with a discussion of specific issues related to blending of disciplinary and professional studies in a teacher preparation program. The idea for the blended math course came about as a result of a collaborative effort of a professor in the Mathematics Department at CSUDH, a professor in the Teacher Education Multiple Subject Credential program, and the coordinator of the BLTEP. The motivation for blending the mathematics content and methods courses came from the instructors' belief that learning mathematics content while at the same time learning how to teach it would deepen prospective teachers' understanding of content and alert prospective teachers to those aspects of mathematics that may be confusing to the elementary students they will eventually teach.",

As a new, young, female junior faculty member in the School of Education at a major research university, the author has struggled to build a strong sense of community in her school. She has also encountered ambivalence about openly expressing personal-professional-political concerns in the workplace. Further, she wanted to connect the theoretical discussions that she was enjoying in her classrooms with hands-on applications in challenging educational settings around the world. In an effort to address some of these issues, and to engage her students and colleagues in proactively creating a more nurturing professional environment, she initiated an international service-learning program that is integrated into their graduate course of study. The overarching goals of the author's international service-learning program or L.I.N.C.S. (Learning Integrated with Needed Construction and Service) are to offer a challenging set of service-learning experiences.

        "description":"The purpose of this study is to explore the use of triad journaling as a collaborative tool for enhancing teaching and learning in a professional development school context. This study employed descriptive case study methodology (Merriam, 1998) in an effort to capture the content, complexity, and interactive nature of the participants' journaling. The study investigates two years of data, and the ways two cohorts of full year interns used triad journaling over the course of the school year. Findings indicate that the triad journal served four strategic roles in the professional development school work. The journaling: (1) offered evidence of mentor/supervisor role re-conceptualization, (2) escalated communication between all triad members by providing the opportunity to engage in the dialogue about teaching and learning, (3) acted as a vehicle for nurturing a problem posing culture which is a critical, and often missing feature of ail inquiry oriented professional development school, and (4) created a \"professional energy.\"",

While she has always loved the learning process itself, she has often felt a deep sense of alienation on many of the educational landscapes she has traveled. Her own alienating experience of schooling, and her discomfort with the \"technically correct\" model of teacher education that leaves compassion outside the classroom door have been the impetus for her finding ways to build a learning community within her pre-service teacher education classes. In this article, she discusses the following: (1) why teachers should be concerned about building classroom community; (2) how a learning community is defined; and (3) how teachers can create a learning community.",

        "description":"After the author's first semester teaching at the university, she began to ponder the lack of emphasis placed on the relationships among school, community and home within her students' practicum experience. Through lectures, readings, and audio visuals, the author shared the importance of including parents in the educational decision making process and in honoring their voices, but she was not giving the preservice teachers a chance to dialog with parents themselves. Because the preservice teachers only \"read about\" but did not \"talk with\" parents, they only had minimal understanding of the powerful role that parents play in their children's education. While reading theoretical literature is necessary, the lack of field-based experiences exploring the out-of-school lives of children often pushes preservice teachers to question the validity of involving the parents in conversation. This is especially true for Anglo American middle-class preservice teachers (Wolf, Hill, & Ballentine, 2000). In this paper the author shows the impact that preservice teachers' participation in home visits had on their view of home-school-community relationship. Next, she presents the theoretical framework. Then she briefly introduces the participants and describe the revised classes and the year-long assignment which was key in supporting preservice teachers' growth in understanding the importance of knowing the students' families.

        "description":"In a two-day workshop, 12 teachers who had not previously used graphics calculators not only learnt how to use a calculator but also completed calculator tasks designed to explore their misconceptions and then learnt about students' difficulties. Observation of lessons taught subsequently by 6 of the teachers, and interviews with 15 of their students, were used to investigate the effectiveness of the workshop in promoting appropriate use of technology in their mathematics classes. It was found that the teachers consistently drew their students' attention to limitations of the technology. Apparently as a result, their students showed considerably fewer misconceptions than students in a previous study who had been taught by teachers who had not undertaken such professional development. The few remaining student misconceptions could be traced to lingering uncertainties on the part of their teachers. Implications of the findings for mathematics teacher education are discussed.

        "description":"Many mathematics educators share a view of mathematics as a social and cultural phenomenon and believe that the learning of mathematics concepts is developed and enhanced through the use of learning communities. Electronic discussion boards provide one avenue for supporting such social learning. This paper discusses the use of a Question and Answer section of a discussion board in a first year mathematics education subject for primary student teachers, and the way in which this facility fits with ideas of social learning. Theoretical perspectives of social learning in mathematics through the use of an electronic community are explored. Examples are given of how learning was developed through questions and answers in the mathematics education subject and insights shared regarding the various uses of this facility by the students. Issues related to participation, peer misconceptions, learning styles and teacher intervention are raised and discussed. The paper concludes that for students who are comfortable with the use of electronic conferencing, there is value in Question and Answer facilities in raising autonomy and supporting conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts, but that the medium does not suit all learners of mathematics.",

        "description":"Recent developments about cognitions underlying mathematical learning are beginning to suggest that the activation and appropriate use of prior knowledge by students is, to a large measure, controlled by the quality of organisation of that knowledge. Thus, teaching needs to support the construction of well-connected mathematical knowledge. An important assumption here is that teachers need to construct a repertoire of subject-matter knowledge that is rich and well connected before they can help their students build similar mathematical knowledge. Thus, mathematics knowledge building is an important issue in teacher preparation programs. This paper reports on a study about the knowledge state of a pre-service teacher who planned to use computers in the teaching of linear functions. The results of the study indicate the existence of gaps in the student teacher's subject-matter knowledge. Significantly, there was also a lack of important connections between his understanding of linear functions and the instructional use of a computer software. Knowledge gaps and implications for classroom students' acquisition of mathematical schemas and mathematics teacher education programs are examined and discussed. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

The project had the following characteristics: Firstly, it employed the formation of an action research network. Secondly, it targeted the concern of the teachers on how to make mathematics more inclusive for children from a variety of backgrounds. Thirdly, it bridged the divide in jurisdiction between the responsibility of the university for preservice training and the responsibility of the school and the employment departments for induction and inservice professional learning.

        "description":"Recent teacher professional development in California tends to focus on increasing teachers' mathematical knowledge. In Australia, pedagogically focused programs are preferred. The two approaches are contrasted by comparing a Californian professional development model based on improving mathematical knowledge in number and algebra with a New South Wales school-based model involving the teaching of angle concepts. In both approaches, strengths and weaknesses are identified in terms of appropriate mathematical content, research-based pedagogy, and accreditation. Examples of courses incorporating all these components are given, and difficulties associated with implementing such courses are identified. Two important criteria for success, perceived relevance and teacher enthusiasm, are seen to be dependent on cultural factors in the education systems involved. (Contains 2 figures.)",

The aim of the investigation was for in-service middle school teachers to externalize their thinking about their students' mathematical thinking and to then reflect upon these externalizations and make refinements accordingly. This aim mirrors the purposes of student-level mathematical activities entitled model-eliciting activities. Therefore, the teacher investigation was patterned after the design principles for student-level model-eliciting activities. These design principles and how the teacher investigation was modeled after these principles are described. In addition, the teachers' externalizations, reflections upon, and revisions to their thinking about their students' thinking are explained. The article concludes with general design principles that other teacher educators can use in designing their respective professional development contexts.

Informed consumers are less likely to purchase useless health products if informed of misleading and deceptive advertising methods. The purpose of this study was to conduct a content analysis of health-related TV infomercials. An instrument specifically for health-related infomercials was developed and tested. The instrument assessed product  category, health problems solved, production format, persuasive techniques, implied health benefits, implied social/emotional benefits, testimonial frequency, and product acquisition information presented in the program. Four trained observers analyzed the content of 31 health-related infomercials. Health infomercials were divided into five categories of products. Frequency of use for 21 different promotional techniques varied from 93 to 10%. Analysis  demonstrated that particular types of products were far more likely to utilize selected persuasive tactics. Frequency distributions for implied physical and emotional/social benefits were calculated. Health-related infomercials utilize a consistent formula of promotional techniques. Veteran health educators will recognize these techniques from long-standing consumer health recommendations on how to spot health fraud. Implications for media literacy in health education are explored. (Contains 6 tables.)",

Previously sedentary mothers and daughters (N = 34) were randomly assigned to a 12-week university-or home-based physical activity group. Program activities were designed using focus group information, aspects of the social cognitive theory, and information from previously successful interventions. The university-based group  met three times a week for fitness building and recreational activities. The home-based group received a packet of information and training to perform activities in or near the home. Changes in physical activity and family bonding were assessed for mothers and daughters separately using a 2 (group)(2 (time) repeated measures analysis of variance. On completing the program, mothers and daughters in each group reported increased participation in physical activity (p = 0.02 to 0.000). The majority of mothers (94%) and daughters (88%) agreed that &quot;my relationship with my daughter/mother has improved as a result of participating in physical activity together.&quot; On the Parental Bonding Instrument daughters reported no statistically significant changes in their perceptions of &quot;mom's level of caring&quot; (p = 0.73); however, &quot;mom's level of control&quot; (p less than or equal to 0.05) increased. Group by Time interactions were not significant, indicating that there were no differences between results from either program.

A 3-week health education unit focusing on the pharmacists' role in nutrition and physical activity counseling was developed and implemented in a required nonprescription drug therapy pharmacy course for fifth-year doctor of pharmacy students. As expected, the majority of pharmacy students postintervention believed that diet and physical activity health-related behaviors were very important for the average adult. Furthermore, significantly more pharmacy students believed that it was their professional responsibility to educate patients about diet and physical activity, felt more prepared to educate on diet modification and physical activity, and felt more comfortable with implementing behavioral-modification strategies to help patients achieve change than currently practicing pharmacists. The importance pharmacy students assigned to diet and physical activity health-promoting behaviors indicates that a similar health education program may help currently practicing pharmacists sharpen their skills in these areas.

Additionally, each woman completed a detailed historical physical activity oral interview with the investigator. Physical activity decreased significantly across all age groups. Physical activity during ages 13 to 18 and 19 years and older, counterconditioning (i.e., substituting physical activity for other behaviors), self-liberation (i.e., making a commitment to adopt an active lifestyle), self-reevaluation (i.e., recognizing the personal  importance of physical activity in one's life), reinforcement management (i.e., rewards associated with physical activity), physical activity during ages 6 to 12 years, and dramatic relief (i.e., experiencing negative emotions associated with physical inactivity) had the strongest relationship with current physical activity participation. Cons (i.e., costs associated with physical activity participation) were negatively correlated with current physical activity  patterns.

Six suburban high schools in North Carolina were randomly assigned to treatment and comparison conditions. Immediate pre- and posttest surveys were used to evaluate program effects. Results indicate that students exposed to All Stars, Sr. became increasingly likely to view drug use, poor nutrition, and stress as not fitting with their desired future lives.

Mean reaction times were significantly higher when participants were talking on a cellular phone, either handheld or on a headset, than when they were not. In the second study 40 undergraduates steered a remote-controlled car through an obstacle course. Performance scores were significantly poorer for participants when they were talking on a cellular phone than when they were not. A majority of participants reported using cellular phones while driving, yet believed this was a dangerous practice. We recommend incorporation of education about cellular phone use and driving in health/safety curriculums for high school and college students.",

        "description":"An evolving body of research has examined the process of mentoring relationships among senior and junior faculty in health education and health promotion academic programs. However, little attention has been given to understanding the specific content of interactions between mentors and proteges. This qualitative research was conducted to identify the knowledge, behaviors, and skills senior faculty believe are important for success of new health promotion and health education faculty. Senior faculty (n = 11) in health education/health promotion at major universities in the United States were interviewed to determine the kinds of advice they have given to junior faculty whom they have mentored. Data were collected by in-person and telephone interviews. Research-related themes included having a research focus; working with teams; knowing institutional expectations; and balancing quantitative versus qualitative methodology. Teaching-related themes centered on the importance of working with students; using resources; and balancing teaching load with other responsibilities. Themes related to service included seeking appropriate types of service for achieving promotion and tenure; realizing the quantity of service required; and using service for learning opportunities. These results can be useful to developing junior faculty in health education and health promotion and to senior faculty mentors in terms of advising their proteges. (Contains 2 figures.)",

As with many other public health problems, some racial and ethnic populations are disproportionately affected. This article presents current information on the prevalence and consequences of obesity for racial and ethnic groups in the United States and evaluates race/culture-specific causes of obesity for these populations. After analysis of various interventions that attempt to address this problem, a full-spectrum, three-pronged model for eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in obesity is presented and discussed. It is argued that a comprehensive population model, with a balance between downstream, midstream, and upstream interventions is necessary. Examples of culturally appropriate interventions that address the behavioral, social, and environmental determinants of obesity at each of these levels are presented. Using the tools of sound theory, appropriate methods, and cultural sensitivity, health educators are in a unique position to provide leadership to this effort. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

A content analysis abstraction form was developed to collect information from the articles in the following areas: sources of information used, description of insulin/diabetes, incidence/prevalence statistics, risk factors, symptoms, prevention measures, and long-term complications. Forty-nine articles were identified in all magazines combined over the 7-year time period. Overall, current diabetes prevalence rates, risk factors, symptoms, preventive measures, and long-term complications were not discussed in great detail. The findings suggest that coverage of diabetes in women's magazine articles does not reflect the true public health significance of this disease. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) representing classic, enlightenment philosophy as it pertains to historiography was primarily a philosopher who wrote tangentially on history. Oswald Spengler (1880-1936), a modernist German historian and philosopher famous for his pessimistic tome, \"The Decline of the West\" (1924-26), was primarily a historian with an interest in philosophy. Michel Foucault (1926-1984), who stated the case for post-modern historiography from a French perspective, seems to have been interested in history and philosophy more or less equally. Each of these three had important things to say to music education historians about the nature of history itself. All three addressed fundamental questions on the nature and value of history: What is it? What good is it? Twenty-first century commentators have made interesting applications of their ideas to present concerns of historians in general, which music education historians may well extrapolate to their own concerns.

Researchers have investigated this situation in terms of historical precedent, traditional socialization, discrimination, segregation, professional identity, and lack of role models. They have not, however, addressed the culture of conducting college bands. Cultural analysis is essential because the percentage of women conducting college bands in the U.S. has remained virtually static during the past thirty years. It is appropriate because it provides a multi-layered, broader view of the problem which make possible explanations that may be more appropriately generalized and less subject to essentialism. This project analyzes the paucity of women college band directors in terms of the cultural contexts in which they inhabit: the cultures of music, performance, and college bands. Reviewing and interpreting the literature related to these cultures, I use a perspective that takes into account the positionalities of individuals while also locating them in cultural and by implication, historical, contexts. Analysis (reading) creates a narrative in which I foreground what challenges dominant discourse in these cultures, and describe how they function in terms of women college band directors.

The control group (n = 18) received no classroom music instruction or computer instruction. The instructional-treatment period spanned seven months from October, 2000 through April, 2001. A spatial-temporal measure, a spatial measure, and a nonspatial (verbal) measure served as the dependent variables. Three separate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed no significant difference between the three groups in pretest, posttest, or gain scores (posttest minus pretest) for each of the three measures.

        "description":"This pilot study compared two approaches for teaching rhythm reading skills to first-grade children. Two intact first-grade classes participated in six lessons focusing on simple rhythms (4 beats using eighth and quarter notes). The lessons were based on the same musical materials; only the approach was varied. After random assignment, Class 1 experienced the \"Subdivision Approach\" where the quarter note is the beat, and eighth notes are subdivisions of the beat. Class 2 used the \"Additive Approach\" where, in this case, the eighth note is the \"shortest sound\" and a quarter note is the equivalent of two short sounds. Pre- and posttests were administered using the respective rhythm icons, asking the children to say the rhythm syllables and do the corresponding hand movements. Within-group pre- and posttest scores showed learning took place with each method. Several t-tests showed that the Additive Approach class scored significantly higher than the Subdivision Approach class (p less than 0.001). The results of this study indicate that, for this particular set of subjects, the Additive Approach was more successful than the Subdivision Approach in this rhythm reading task. Of particular interest was the fact that the Additive Approach prepared students to more successfully decode and perform syncopated rhythms seen only in the pre- and posttest. The research approach employed appears, with modification, to be a useful one that may successfully be employed in a larger project. Although the results of this particular study cannot be generalized to a larger population, the positive results indicate that further study is merited. (Contains 5 tables and 3 figures.)",

Unlike previous studies of the processes and philosophies of jazz instruction, I examine such processes from a cultural standpoint, to identify why certain methods might be favored over others. Specifically, jazz education is treated as a fusion of two distinct historical and cultural forces: those of musical academia, and of the jazz community. I argue that methods of teaching improvisation reflect a dual identity, in which these two cultural traditions sometimes exert an uneven influence upon the learning environment. Improvisational curricula, pedagogical methods, and evaluative strategies all reflect this dual influence, and the tensions they engender impart a powerful influence on the ways in which students and teachers interact with each other, with the institution, and with the larger community of jazz performers.

        "description":"&quot;Elementary Science: Where are We Now?&quot; is a review of Elementary Science Education from the 1960s to 1999. Curriculum moved from uniform programs in the 1960s based on two assumptions to a wide diversity of goals, philosophies, and types of materials in the 1970s. The two assumptions behind the elementary science curriculum programs of the 1960s included (1) If science is presented as scientists would do it, it will be interesting to all students; and (2) Any subject can be taught to any child at any stage of development. Project Synthesis was a discrepancy study of data collected from three earlier studies on the state of science education in the 1970s. The programs of the 1970s varied in student outcomes, learning/teaching styles, cost, format, and content. The goal for science education for the 1980s was scientific and technological literacy (Staver &amp; Bay, 1987). National Science Foundation funds were invested in developing new curriculum materials in the 1980s to reach this goal (Harms &amp; Yager, 1981). This article will focus on the answers found from a small sample of teachers representing multiple districts. What criteria are being used to select science curriculum materials? The first part provides a historical perspective of elementary science education, and the last part presents the results of where elementary science education was in the late 1990s. This discussion begins with the Project Synthesis, which was a discrepancy study of data collected on the state of science education in the 1970s. The rest of the article examines the literature from 1981 to 1999 and research conducted by the author. The author found that educators wanted to use the inquiry-based science curriculum materials recommended by the standards but were restricted by non-academic considerations such as funding.",

The Science Teacher Inquiry Rubric (STIR) was developed based upon the National Science Education Standards' essential features of inquiry instruction (NRC, 2000). A pilot study using a purposive sample of ten science teachers was conducted to establish the rubric as both an observation tool and a self-reflection instrument. While the overall correlation of the instrument (r=0.58) does not support its use as a self-assessment instrument, a perfect correlation between two raters (r=1) established the STIR as an effective observation tool. Additionally, the validation of the instrument provided various insights into the teaching of inquiry in science classrooms. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

Results showed that the fifth-grade treatment group showed statistically significant differences in the measures of environmental knowledge and comfort levels when compared to the control group. There were no significant differences between the fourth-grade treatment and control groups. In addition, significant gender differences were found in the fifth-grade treatment and control groups. The females showed significantly higher scores in the measures of environmental attitudes and behaviors when compared with the males. The significant differences in the fifth-grade treatment group with regard to environmental knowledge and comfort levels in the outdoors, as well as the significant gender differences in the fifth-grade treatment group with environmental attitudes and behaviors, indicate the potential for the effective use of the schoolyard for environmental education activities.

        "description":"With the revamping of the Canada Immigration Act in 1985, the demographic profile of new arrivals to Canada took a marked shift to place a priority on better educated, business-class immigrants. Most of these immigrants are from the Pacific Rim, and they have high expectations for the academic achievement of their children in the Canadian school. system. The purpose of this study was to look at age on arrival and first-language proficiency of these children, as these factors interact with instructed ESL support on achievement measures in grade 12. Analysis of the data reveals that although all learners benefit from structured ESL support, it is the younger-arriving ESL learners who have the most to gain, even after many years of little or no support. We note that all ESL learners, regardless of age on arrival, struggle to acquire the cultural and metaphoric competence that is beyond the linguistic threshold required for success, but nevertheless central to successful engagement in a literature-based program of studies.",

Three participants were selected through purposeful sampling to do within-case comparisons. One participant was an experienced writer in both Japanese and English; one was an experienced writer in Japanese, but not in English; the other was an inexperienced writer in both Japanese and English. Using think-aloud protocols, these participants produced two revised essays in Japanese and two revised essays in English. The revised texts, think-aloud protocols, and retrospective interviews were analyzed to identify revision patterns and revision intentions. first, it was found that all three writers produced many more revisions in Japanese than in English. Second, it was found that these writers showed similar revising intentions across languages.

        "description":"This article reports the findings of part of a major study exploring the disciplinary writing processes and perceptions of 15 Chinese graduate students in sciences and engineering at a major Canadian university. The findings relate to the thinking languages of the participants in writing disciplinary assignments. The study reveals that whether an L2 writer thinks in L1 or L2 may not depend on one factor as proposed in earlier studies (Friedlander, 1990; Qi, 1998), but on a number of factors including the language of knowledge input, the language of knowledge acquisition, the development of L2 proficiency, the level of knowledge demands, and specific task conditions. It is the interplay among these (and possibly other) factors that determines the writer's choice of the thinking language, which may switch back and forth between L1 and L2. Further, although translation may be a positive strategy for a student with limited L2 proficiency, it may gradually phase out as the student thinks more in L2 and writes L2 in approximation to the language of native writers. Thus a thinking language continuum may exist along which the use of translation varies.",

Building such a community involves a re-imagining of the teaching of English, as well as the preparation of future English teachers, as the creation of opportunities to engage in literacy practices that, through the performance of both skills and dispositions that involve wrestling with issues of difference, foster a critical, compassionate way of being in the world. In this article, the author advocates for a two-layered approach toward fostering a more holistic, humane English education for American youth. In the first section of the article, the author discusses how English education, traditionally conceived, might contribute to youth violence. In the second portion, the author describes the ways in which both secondary English classes and post-secondary classes for prospective English teachers can be conceptualized and taught in order to cultivate critical and compassionate communities both within and, ultimately, beyond schools.

If people want an educated citizenry, they need teachers who know how to think about their students' needs and write their own curriculum in community with others. When high school language arts teachers in Portland were asked by the Professional Development Committee--a group founded by the school district and the Portland Association of Teachers--which professional development programs had the greatest impact on their students' learning, they overwhelmingly named the Portland Writing Project, the Summer Literacy Curriculum Camp, and the Professional Development Days--which were all led by classroom teachers. Teachers stated that these three programs were practical and related specifically to their content. The programs gave them models of new strategies and curricula, hands-on practice, and time for collaboration and implementation.",

        "description":"In recent decades, federal, state, and local policies have demonstrated renewed efforts to address the concerns of both teacher quality and quantity, resulting in initiatives to attract, reward, and retain qualified people in the teacher profession. Initiatives to address the problems of teacher quality and quantity often take the form of recruitment and retention efforts designed to both attract teachers and support them in ways that will increase the likelihood that they remain in their school and/or district. The School District of Philadelphia is an example of a district making strides towards improving their recruitment and retention strategies. To begin to understand the impacts or effects of these efforts to address teacher quality and quantity, it is important to account for the influence that teacher preparation, teacher hiring, school placement, and targeted supports may have on the experiences of first-year teachers. This paper utilizes a one-time survey of new teachers to gain insight about the characteristics of teachers recruited to the School District of Philadelphia for the 2004-2005 school year. The data reveals information about teachers' preparation, hiring experiences, knowledge of school assignment, and expectations as they enter the School District of Philadelphia. Analysis of this data has implications for actions that the district may consider taking to ensure that their recruitment strategies are supplemented by their retention initiatives, which take the form of a variety of new teacher support activities and programs.

        "author":["Green, Kitty"],
        "description":"For many novice teachers, the first solo effort in the classroom is a \"sink or swim\" experience. With good pre-service preparation that includes extensive field experience, the beginning teacher may feel more confident, but even those with the most confidence still find the complexities of decision-making bewildering. For those novices who are less confident, frustration and depression may ultimately drive them from the classroom. In fact, nearly half of all new teachers leave teaching within the first five years. Although providing new teachers with information about curriculum design, instructional strategies, assessment techniques, classroom management, content, and professional strategies are all important components of a quality pre-service teacher education program, in this article the author argues that teacher educators need to focus more on helping novices to ask themselves the right questions as they think about teaching. She presents a structured model for preparing teachers to engage in professional discourse, either with or without a mentor. It is essential for teachers to explore elements of their teaching practice while at the same time recognizing on how those elements work together. They need a structure through which to reflect on their professional practice. (Contains 2 tables.)",

The author's intention is to show that such a personal inquiry can reveal ways in which her story is a telling case that may enable others to respond and make meaning out of their own experiences. Unraveling what constitutes professional knowledge in the practice of teaching is messy work, but the author hopes that when seen through the lens of one teacher's balancing act of managing dilemmas, blending the practical and theoretical, improvising, and reflecting on these processes, some clarity will be revealed.

The first section provides a brief overview of the Australian education system from 1950--1980 as a way of introducing the larger historical context in which teacher education is situated. The second part describes the Centre for the Study of Urban Education at La Trobe University, and more specifically, a project called the City Educational Taskforce. The author explores why this has been the only initiative to study urban education, and offers an explanation of how the concept of &quot;rurality,&quot; rather than &quot;urbanity,&quot; is of particular significance to education in Australia. The final part of the article discusses how disciplinary knowledge and pedagogical knowledge are currently at odds in programs of teacher education. Suggestions are offered for (re)imagining teacher education through a blurring of institutional boundaries.",

        "description":"Civic education, democratic principles, peace and war are tangled together in many ways. When teachers teach children to be citizens, they inform them of processes and practices in which they can and should engage; they inform them of the relations they are to have with their state through its proper institutions; they teach them what they can expect of their country, and what it can expect from them. When democratic stability is threatened by external perils such as terror attacks and conflict, and by the correlating internal responses such as suspension of rights and the narrowing public agenda, civic education becomes an even more crucial factor for the preservation of a stable democracy. In times of war, the boundaries of the political are redrawn. The conceptualization of citizenship is reformulated, and the relations between individual and state change their contents to express different expectations. The education system, with its teachers, administrators and other stakeholders representing the widest range of social actors, cannot evade this fate. As a public institution responsible for preparing future generations to becoming active members of society, schools are bound to undergo change during conflict. The author suggests that the proper response of the public education system to the social circumstances of wartime should be designed to balance the demands of belligerent citizenship with an ongoing commitment to democratic principles. As a teacher in conflict-ridden Tel-Aviv, the author shares that as he encourages his students to express their (mostly grim) views of the governing institutions, he tries to weave into their classroom discussion an awareness of what it means to be a citizen, what it means to be governed and represented, and what it is that they as active, engaged participants in the ongoing construction of their society can do to contribute to the discourse that envisions this society as it is, and as it should be.

Purposeful teaching in times of crisis should occur both with children directly impacted by catastrophic events as well as with those less directly impacted. As a direct reflection of the author's most recent work and experiences in a school district that includes hundreds of classrooms with students recently evacuated from New Orleans, this essay will focus on working with children directly impacted by catastrophe. The examples provided in this essay for teaching in times of crisis are drawn from the positive work of committed schoolteachers and others in Austin, Texas as they have been working with a student community that since September 2005 has come to include close to 10,000 new families and 1000 new students who came from New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina. Unfortunate counter-examples, against which this framework stands, also come from Austin educators, specifically teachers and administrators whose prejudices, fears or lack of proaction have outweighed their better selves and furthered the miseducation of children. This essay is grounded in the work of community responsive and action oriented educational anthropology undertaken between September 2005 and May 2006. (Contains 7 endnotes.)",

Up front the author wants to make clear that the focus is on children, any child anywhere, children everywhere, regardless of their gender, race or ethnicity, nationality or religion. The author wants to encourage conversation, critical thinking, original ideas, creative thinking and imaginative thought that is accepting of a diversity of ideas, and addresses pejorative controversy and disagreement. It is with this in mind that the author shares some of her thoughts about children, teachers, catastrophic events and mass trauma.

        "description":"On December 26, 2004, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake--the most powerful in more than 40 years--struck deep under the Indian Ocean. It was centered about 100 miles southwest off the coast of Aceh, Indonesia, and triggered massive tsunamis across the coasts of Asia and Africa. In Aceh province, located at the northwest tip of the island of Sumatra in the Republic of Indonesia, as a result of the earthquake and tsunami more than 150,000 people were killed, and more than 500,000 were left homeless. In Aceh, the tsunami destroyed more than 800 km of the coastline, damaging roads and bridges, destroying approximately 2,135 schools and more than 120 health facilities. Reports indicate that over 40,000 students and 2,500 teachers and educational personnel died in the tsunami. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) was one of the NGOs supporting the Achenese people by focusing on protecting and educating children. Throughout the next few months, out of the disaster came the opportunity for IRC and the University of Pennsylvania to develop a partnership and plans for U.S. professors and graduate students to work with teachers in Banda Aceh, Indonesia for two weeks in July. In this article, the authors describe that experience, highlighting the opportunities that arose as a result of the disaster of December 26, 2004 and a number of tensions that remained prominent in their minds.

His perspective is unique, as he was a student at the University of Cincinnati (UC) when the race riots of the 1960s took place, and--after a long career in the city's educational system as a teacher and administrator--he was again at the University as a faculty member when racial violence erupted in 2001. As he struggled to help his graduate students in UC's unique College of Education Urban Education Leadership program find a deeper understanding of the events unfolding around them, he was profoundly struck by the similarities in conditions from the 1960s to 2001.",

        "description":"The attacks of terror carried out on September 11, 2001 gave rise to waves of hate-fueled violence across the country. It has been argued that the attacks and the subsequent, current context of war have resulted in a heightened sense of American intolerance. They have led to discernable shifts in how certain minorities are perceived and treated in the United States. Since the attacks, an alarming number of Arab, Iranian, and other Muslim Americans have been targeted and hurt, becoming victims of a vicious brand of &quot;patriotism.&quot; The FBI reports that the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes filed has spiked from 28 in the year 2000, to 481 in 2001--representing a seventeen-fold increase. Backlash continues to take on the form of verbal taunting, airport profiling, and even physical violence. The group hardest hit by hate crimes post 9-11 has been the South Asian Americans. Today, young desi Americans find themselves--perhaps for the first time--in the shaky, undesirable position of standing out for the &quot;wrong&quot; reasons. Listening to reports of hate crimes directed at South Asian and Muslim Americans after the events of September 11th, they must now contend with the understanding that their position in this country is more tenuous than they perhaps realized. In this paper, the author discusses what growing up during a time of rising confusion and xenophobia has meant for the children of Indian immigrants. (Contains 24 endnotes.)",

But it is an \"illusion\" because in reality safety is never guaranteed for anyone. At times, traumatic events disrupt the safe environments that people have created. Janoff-Buhlman (1992) describes the \"shattering of illusions\"--one of them being the illusion of safety--that takes place when people experience trauma. Children sometimes experience traumatic events first-hand, but they can also experience trauma vicariously as well. When children become vicariously aware of war, large-scale violence, and terrorism, their illusion of safety may become bruised. The bruising may take the form of worrying about whether the adults in their life, whom they have assumed to be powerful enough to guarantee their safety, may not be able to keep them safe. When that happens, the illusion of safety needs to be reestablished. Adults can help to reestablish this illusory sense of safety using children's literature about violence--a rather new genre, within which some picture books have become available. It is essential, however, that when adults use children's literature focused on violent topics, they do so with an understanding of children's dominant age-related fears, behaviors, and needs and connect these to those fears, behaviors, and needs that may be created by traumatic events. This article focuses on how adult readers can assess children's picture books and use them to engender an illusion of safety, reestablished by caring adults.",

        "description":"In this essay, I examine the underlying assumptions of one secondary English teacher, Sara, who professes to teach for social justice, in an urban school. My primary concern arises from a need to clarify what it means to teach for social justice in specific locations, and to look closely at what assumptions teachers have as they teach secondary students. I utilize the ethnographic tools of interview, document analysis, and classroom observation for this study. To read the data, I utilize Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to reveal that the Discourses of Working, Equity, and Schooling influence Sara's teaching for social justice. Finally, this essay illuminates the power relationships between students and the teacher in this particular classroom, specifically how these discourses are laced with the rhetoric of \"white talk\", which obscures and reinforces specific racist perspectives. This essay concludes with a call to dig deeply into our assumptions about teaching for social justice, specifically when we proclaim to do so in secondary English classrooms.",

        "description":"Urban public schools and their teachers are under siege. From increased standardization, privatization and testing to a growing number of students whose needs are not being met by schools, urban public school teachers face a daunting task. Without a space in which to critically examine their daily experiences within schools, many well-intentioned teachers find themselves unwittingly reproducing existing social inequities. The Social Justice Critical Inquiry Project (CIP) at New York University was a two-year program piloted to create a space to support preservice teachers as they transition into their first year of teaching in New York City public schools. This group allowed participants to reflect on their experiences and share their apprehensions, struggles and excitement about teaching with equity centered in their classrooms. Participants used the lens of social justice, applying the frameworks of equity, agency, cultural relevance and critical literacy (Lipman, 2004), to their practice in order to improve the educational experiences and achievement of their students. The following article provides details about the project's goals, activities, outcomes, challenges and its implications for teacher education.",

In this article, I discuss the ways that a group of four new teachers found flexible support for developing a vision of teaching for social justice through participation in a teacher professional development network. In a context of political upheaval and wide-sweeping reforms, the new teachers planned and executed an event that celebrated the capabilities and talents of all children. Although this event had roots in the traditions of the professional development network, the new teachers brought certain generational specific concerns to their vision of social justice teaching, particularly around questions of action and audience. Exploring the ways that new teachers are supported to teach for social justice has implications for teacher education programs, teacher retention efforts, and professional development.

        "description":"The continued persistence of sexism and institutional gender bias in schools is well documented. The empirical research in this area has uncovered a host of negative outcomes associated with gender inequity for all children. Research suggests that schools provide an excellent forum in which issues of gender inequities may be examined and challenged. The literature further suggests that teachers can be critical allies in schools' struggle to achieve gender equity. Drawing on three years of data from an evaluation of an in-service professional development program aimed at raising teachers' awareness of and responses to gender inequities in their schools, this paper explores teachers' perceptions of school climate with regard to gender inequity and teachers' perceptions of their own efforts to challenge these inequities. Findings suggest that teachers who participated in the program made significant inroads in their thinking related to gender equity. Findings also suggest that considerable challenges, especially around personal growth, awareness, and change persist and that teachers continue to grapple with gender bias, both within themselves and in their schools.",

This deliberation over standards was rooted in the model of standards development presented by these future teachers' licensure program and called upon this next generation of urban educators to develop standards for their own teaching practices. Relying upon a set of urban standards, this program (the Master of Urban Secondary Teaching, or MUST, program) has attempted to focus its constituents--its interns, mentors, and university faculty--on preparing novice teachers to work in urban schools and to be responsive to their urban communities and students. This standards development method first allowed a cohort of teacher candidates to consider the nature and specifics of the current emphasis on standards that is increasingly a part of every educational context. It then provided these pre-service city teachers with both a process for integrating relevant community experiences into their teaching practices, as well as specific criteria that might make their teaching responsive to the intense urban conditions of their students' lives. These methods allowed these teacher candidates to &quot;see&quot; how the sources for their own educational standards are present in the spaces and environments of their schools and communities.",

(Archer, 1998; Williams, 1999; Daniel, 2003) If this is the case, those students that could use the most assistance to improve academically are not receiving the most effective method of instruction when technology is integrated in the curriculum. Researchers have also determined that it is necessary to provide on-going, site-based support and assistance in order for teachers to integrate effectively computer-based technology into the curriculum. Therefore, this paper will focus on the use of technology and technology pedagogy in urban schools, effective technology pedagogy, and suggest a model for professional development to integrate technology.

        "description":"As the nation celebrates the 50th Anniversary of the 1954 Brown Decision, it is important to examine the achievement gap between children attending resegregated public schools and their counterparts attending integrated schools. The achievement gap is directly impacted by four specific interdependent types of deficits: moral, human capital, functional and agency. These deficits guide the analysis of trends in the reading and writing achievement gaps between resegregated and desegregated schools in the Norfolk School District. The results of the Virginia &quot;Standards of Learning&quot; for 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 were computed. The findings suggest that the district has narrowed the gap significantly between the resegregated and desegregated schools. (Contains 5 figures.)",

This research's purpose was to determine the characteristics of faculty who engage in innovative pedagogy, specifically community service learning (CSL). The researchers analyzed faculty responses from 32 structured interviews completed at a large metropolitan, southwestern university. Results suggest that faculty who engage in CSL pedagogy share many attitudes, beliefs, and values about teaching, learning, and community. CSL, respondents said, satisfies various faculty/teaching, student/learning, and community/nonprofit needs. Sustaining faculty participation was noted as a significant challenge in perpetuating CSL efforts; however, results suggest a learning-driven model enables a self-perpetuating process that involves increasing faculty numbers to effect cultural change in the university.

By asserting the importance of intentionality and transparency, the author claims that service-learning activities find their value to citizenship development when: space is created for political dialogue; the nature of service is deconstructed; a community assets outlook is adopted; students are asked to refine their perspective-taking skills; and service-learning is understood within a broader movement of institutional reform.

        "description":"Teacher education in California is currently under attack. Politicians and the general public have lost confidence in the entire educational system. While some critics argue that too many credential courses are required, the majority seem to criticize Colleges of Education for simply failing to produce quality teachers. One question asked by both teacher educators and critics of education is, &quot;How do we ensure that the next generation of teachers will be adequately prepared to face the challenges of teaching in the 21st Century?&quot; In a recent U.S. government report (1998) entitled &quot;Promising Practices: New Ways to Improve Teacher Quality,&quot; professional development schools (PDSs) were identified as one of the most promising efforts to improve teacher education programs. Although, PDSs come in all shapes and sizes, with varying levels of collaboration between school and university, two common threads running through all such partnerships are a commitment to collaborative decision-making regarding the curriculum and the development of authentic and meaningful learning experiences for teacher candidates. Recent studies indicate that graduates of professional development schools learn better and outperform peers who have graduated from traditional teacher preparation programs. In this article, the author describes how one school-university partnership, for which she is the university liaison, is working collaboratively to prepare high caliber teachers. The author subsequently provides evaluative evidence from program graduates and district personnel to support the value and effectiveness of this unique teacher preparation program.",

        "author":["Anderson, Hal",

        "description":"Elementary school mathematics teaching begins with the teacher's understanding of the mathematical content to be taught. The teacher knows how to \"do\" the mathematics, i. e., understands the concepts and truths concerning that mathematics. The teacher then decides how to present the mathematics. Based on the students' background in mathematics, the teacher selects the explanations and instructional strategies that will help the students build on their current background and develop a thorough understanding. After selecting the strategies, the teacher designs and implements a series of activities aimed at facilitating all students' learning of the mathematics. These activities may include direct instruction, group work, guided discovery, or any other of the many pedagogical tools available. The teacher then assesses the students' level of understanding, diagnosing areas of misunderstanding, and designs additional activities to alleviate those misunderstandings. Based on this description of elementary school mathematics teaching, an elementary school teacher certainly needs a strong conceptual understanding of mathematical content and an equally thorough understanding of pedagogical skills and practices. However, the lack of any research conclusively connecting either of these two sets of knowledge with student success in learning mathematics seems to indicate that something is missing. The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) recently recognized pedagogical content knowledge as a distinct and important aspect of a teacher's knowledge base. In the 2002 edition of its \"Professional Standards for the Accreditation of Schools, Colleges and Departments of Education,\" NCATE discusses three types of Candidate Knowledge, Skills and Dispositions (Standard 1). They are: (1) Content Knowledge for Teacher Candidates; (2) Pedagogical Content Knowledge for Teacher Candidates; and (3) Professional and Pedagogical Knowledge and Skills for Teacher Candidates. NCATE will begin evaluating teacher preparation programs on the strength of their candidates' pedagogical content knowledge, in addition to their content knowledge and pedagogical skills, in 2002. This article explores pedagogical content knowledge in the context of elementary school mathematics, and its relationship to students' learning of mathematics.",

        "description":"Service learning can be a vehicle to promote democracy in the teacher education classroom. Incorporating service learning into a teacher education program is an uphill battle: teacher candidates lead complicated lives with professional and family responsibilities, some continue long-standing volunteer commitments to their communities, and course syllabi are already stretched to the limit with other requirements and reforms. There seems to be no time and space left to require teacher candidates to perform &quot;community service.&quot; Because the will and interest to serve seem to be missing also, there is some controversy. Many teacher candidates and their instructors see aspects of teaching as an act of public service, so any additional service requirements seem excessive. This article addresses some compelling problems of building democracy and doing service learning in the context of teacher education. The article looks at the outcomes of a service learning exercise within a teacher education course, drawing primarily from the written reflections of the teacher candidates who complete the exercise. The main question is: &quot;How has one social studies methods course used service learning to learn and teach about building a sense of civic engagement, democratic participation, and social responsibility?&quot; The answer to the question has interesting implications for teacher education having to do with the teaching of social studies, particularly government and civics. A traditional and familiar approach to teaching government in elementary and secondary schools consists of teaching about three branches of government, the system of checks and balances, and &quot;how a bill becomes a law.&quot; The reflections of the teacher candidates in this course, however, argue for an alternative, possibly much more interesting and engaging approach addressing more fundamental principles of civic engagement and participation that originally led to the establishment of democracy in this country.

        "description":"Teacher preparation programs in California are governed by standards established by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CCTC). In September 1998, pursuant to Senate Bill 2042 (SB2042), California's recent comprehensive teacher credentialing legislation, the Commission launched an extensive effort on standards and assessment development that led to the development and adoption of new Standards of Quality and Effectiveness for Professional Teacher Preparation Programs leading to a preliminary teaching credential in California. As a credential program sponsor and an early adopter of the SB2042 standards, Notre Dame de Namur University (NDNU), the only four-year accredited university in San Mateo County, endeavored to include each of the elements of SB2042 in its teacher preparation programs. Credential programs at NDNU place particular emphasis on NDNU's core values and competencies that promote social justice by creating equitable classrooms where: (1) all students learn and achieve at high levels; (2) there is little variation--or a small &quot;gap&quot;--between the levels at which students are achieving; and (3) there is no correlation between a student's level of achievement and his/her background characteristics (e.g., gender, race, primary language, family income level). How has NDNU responded to the mandate of SB2042 as a small independent university with specific core values and competencies that are somewhat different from the exceedingly prescriptive SB2042 standards? This article describes the complexity of NDNU's work in redesigning its programs, the challenges it faces striving to maintain institutional integrity while responding to SB2042, and some of the strategies that NDNU developed to address these challenges in order to design and implement a quality program that is in compliance with SB2042 and yet maintains its integrity as an institution with core values and competencies. This article also addresses why the substantive changes in NDNU's program will result in preparing teachers who are able to create equitable learning environments. (Contains 1 figure and 1 note.)",

        "description":"The newly developed &quot;Learning To Teach System&quot; for the preparation of teachers in California and the accompanying standards (referred to as the &quot;2042 Standards&quot; since they were derived from Senate Bill 2042 (SB 2042) passed by the California Legislature in 1998) have changed the way some California educators perceive the differentiated roles for preparing California's new educators. Many institutions of higher education (IHEs) and their partners in the P-12 community seem to have embraced the notion that SB 2042 is a &quot;system&quot; of preparation that, to work effectively, must involve subject matter preparation of would-be teachers, preparation in pedagogical knowledge and skill, integration of those into the first years of teaching, and have that early teacher preparation build toward advanced preparation. On-going professional development may focus on teacher needs and involve preparation for national board certification, advanced degrees, specialist credentials, or further preparation in pedagogy. Another major emphasis is professional development programs designed to increase student performance in the academic content areas (e.g., AB 466, the mathematics and reading professional development initiative). It appears there are some basic understandings about collaboration that everyone who wishes to form a partnership to deliver an articulated, coherent &quot;system&quot; of teacher preparation needs to consider. The collaborative partners need to reach agreement about a common goal or goals of their efforts to work together. The idea of a partnership between IHEs and induction programs was designed to assist the transition from the previous way of doing business where there was a distinct separation between preservice teacher preparation and induction to an integrated system of preparation as called for in SB 2042. This local partnership, designed to make the philosophical and pragmatic transition to SB 2042, was named the Northeastern California SB 2042 Transition Team (Transition Team). This article discusses Northeastern California SB 2042 Transition Team's history, accomplishments, and future activities and also the impacts of collaboration.",

        "description":"In the last decade, the education and policy communities in California have undertaken a major effort to reform the preparation of public school teachers. At the heart of this work is quality education for all children and high-quality teacher education. With the passage of Senate Bill (SB) 2042 in 1998, the state has set in motion the building of a learning to teach system. To date, subject matter, professional teacher preparation, and induction programs are in the early stages of implementing the mandates of this reform. It is at this juncture that the author reflects on the evolution and direction of the state's work. The author does so as a credentialed teacher in California and as a teacher educator. The author brings to this reflection two broad questions that are raised and addressed in this article: (1) Are reforms in teacher preparation and the school curriculum just a cycle?; and (2) Apart from being a radical shift in how we think about the preparation of teachers, what distinguishes this reform legislation?",

        "description":"The purpose of the present study was to profile, using a K-means cluster analysis, the cognitive, motivational, affective, and goal orientation characteristics of elementary school students with and without learning disabilities (LD). Participants were 58 fifth and 6 sixth graders (29 typical and 29 LD) selected using stratified random procedures. Results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the two groups of students across all variables with the exception of task avoidance and positive social experience orientations. Within groups analyses suggested the presence of three reliable clusters: (a) Amotivated/Disengaged-Low Achievers, (b) Motivated-High Achievers, and (c) Avoidant/Uncommitted-Low Achievers, representing 100% of the participants. Subsequent discriminant analyses verified the presence of the three clusters producing correct classification rates for 97% of the participants who belonged to the three clusters. Results indicated that most of the LD students belonged to the third cluster and their lower achievement could be well attributed to their orientation toward avoidance and to their general lack of motivation. It is concluded that students with LD may have &quot;ill&quot; motivational strategies, and they resemble the learned helpless type described by Seligman (Seligman, 1975) due possibly to exposure to repeated failure.

        "description":"The overall purpose of this paper is to describe a practical and useful approach to mathematics assessment that is meaningful to teachers, students and families. The format is highly flexible, yet specifically designed to provide detailed information as to the performance characteristics of the student and a variety of curricula and instructional options for the teacher and school. The assessment focuses upon three key factors. They are: (1) the availability of an organized curriculum, (2) the utilization of multi-modal interactions between student and evaluator and (3) time for the teacher or other sources to actually conduct instruction in a manner indicated by the results of the assessment. The assessment we describe can be conducted in whole or in part in most every topic of mathematics and once the teacher has assured himself that he has mastered the curricula and instructional design, the teacher can ad-lib the instruction. As described, the assessment was an integral component of a four year project involving 23 teachers, about one-half from general education and about one-half from special education. The greatest obstacle encountered by the teachers was a lack of time to implement their instructional findings due to the rapid pace established by the district to cover the content of each grade in a year (Parmar, Cawley &amp; Frazita, 1998).

        "description":"A proximal cause of reading disabilities is a deficit in phonological processing. A consequence of this deficit is inferior performance in one or more cognitive operations that use phonological information, including phonological awareness, lexical retrieval, and verbal memory. Some assert that these phonological processing difficulties are the direct result of impaired auditory perceptual skills. This paper examines the theoretical and empirical grounds for this hypothesis. First, evidence in support of perceptual deficits as a root cause of poor reading achievement and specific language impairments is presented, followed by opposing evidence. Finally, research that has examined the efficacy of interventions based on the auditory perceptual deficit hypothesis is reviewed. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Because of criticisms leveled at statistical hypothesis testing, some researchers have argued that measures of effect size should replace the significance-testing practice. We contend that although effect-size measures have logical appeal, they are also associated with a number of limitations that may result in problematic interpretations of them in research on children and adults with learning disabilities (LD). The purpose of the present paper is to provide a framework for reporting and interpreting empirical research findings in LD research. Specifically, we recommend that: (1) researchers apply criteria of both statistical significance and substantive significance to help consumers of research assess the believability and importance of reported results, respectively; with (2) the establishment of statistical significance, obtained via the use of inferential statistical techniques serving as a precursor to the interpretation of measures of substantive importance. We further contend that the family of standard effect-size indices represents just one approach for assessing substantive significance in LD research. Other methods include the use of confidence intervals and consideration of the results' clinical significance and economic significance. In addition, the critical role played by independent replications must not be overlooked by LD researchers. As such, effect-size measures have an important, though not exclusive, function in evaluating educational and psychological research findings in general and LD research results in particular.",

        "description":"In the mid-1980s, the author discovered the soon-to-be-Coalition of Essential Schools as she was contemplating starting a secondary school in East Harlem, a follow-up to their successful little network of progressive-minded elementary schools: Central Park East, Central Park East II, and River East. Through a series of lucky connections, she and her colleagues got Ted Sizer interested in their new venture, and thus was founded Central Park East Secondary School (CPESS) in the fall of 1985. One of the lessons of their Coalition-style elementary school work was the power of the connection between five year olds and 18 year olds, and the thread that runs through those years to produce a truly powerful educational experience. Together, they threaten what America truly needs and undermine the best of what people once were. A new K-12 drive to turn schooling into a business--with the bottom line being test scores, test scores, test scores--isn't even good for business. The new leadership of school reform, personified in NYC by Klein and Bloomberg, is driving schools to pay for results, offering financial rewards to children, teachers, and principals who improve scores (by any means necessary). Win or lose, people will pay a price. The Coalition needs to rethink deeply the implications of its views about secondary education as they apply to younger children. Educators need to relink the world of adults to the world of childhood, in all its facets. Not just the world of adult leisure, but the world of adult craftsmanship.",

        "description":"What is a Coalition elementary school? In the Chesapeake Coalition of Essential Schools network, each of its schools has made meaning of the ten Common Principles in very different ways. Many of the network's elementary schools have grown into fine examples of what CES brings to pre-kindergarten through fifth grade schooling. Principals, teachers, community members, and sometimes district administrators have come to see the value in centering education not on a checklist of purported &quot;best practices&quot;--implemented step-by-step and without reflection--but rather on a philosophy of schooling that requires and inspires teachers to redefine their expectations for themselves, their colleagues, their students, and their communities. One such community is Salem Avenue Elementary School in Hagerstown, a small city in western Maryland. Salem Avenue joined CES in 2004. Teachers at Salem Avenue describe the differences between a CES school and other schools in terms of student engagement, expectations, and support. Amanda Weighley, a second grade teacher who began her career last year, describes the difference between her CES experience and her training to teach: &quot;There's a lot more student centered learning; it's not all about the teacher. Students get more out of their learning because they are responsible for it.&quot; During the 2005-06 school year, as appreciation for the power of the CES Common Principles began to grow, Salem Avenue's teachers and parents reached consensus around six school-wide habits of mind which form the core of instruction at the school. The habits of mind have helped the school community to understand the Common Principles as philosophy rather than checklist.",

        "description":"Since joining the Coalition of Essential Schools in February 1999, the South Lawrence East Elementary School has used the CES Common Principles as the foundation for enhancing its culture and ensuring student success. To help the teachers meet their literacy goals, the school began a partnership in the spring of 2000 with the Eliot-Pearson Center for Applied Child Development (CACD) at Tufts University. CACD provides customized support to schools that seek to improve literacy teaching and learning, and its child development and literacy specialists have developed the \"Learn to Read by Reading\" (LRR) model. The LRR model depends on a skillful and committed approach. Teachers must understand the strategies used by proficient readers and writers, use assessment to identify their students' learning needs, and plan instruction that meets these needs. The model requires a high degree of personalized teaching, collaboration with colleagues, and ongoing reflection. In the school's classrooms, teachers have a daily two to two and a half hour literacy period with the following elements: (1) Readers' Workshop--approximately one hour; (2) Writers' Workshop--approximately 45 minutes; (3) Phonics/Word Study--approximately 15 minutes; and (4) Interactive Read Aloud--approximately 15 minutes. The school's efforts to implement a balanced literacy model have helped it to achieve Adequate Yearly Progress in English Language Arts for several cycles. Although state and federal mandates are making such goals more and more difficult to reach, teachers are confident that their commitment to continued professional learning and growth, along with their Common Principle guideposts, will help them ensure the success of each and every one of their students.",

        "description":"In this article, the author discusses the importance of &quot;field research&quot; at Marlboro School in southern Vermont. Field research began as a way to expose backwoods kids to the wider world. The Marlboro School Board recognized the value of getting these kids down off the mountain, of learning about other people and places, and of tying classroom learning to real life experience. Marlboro's field research makes student learning and skills durable and memorable as students go on to apply them in many different contexts. It is a significant commitment. A week in New York City or Costa Rica is preceded by months of preparation and study and followed by more study and presentations of what was learned.",

        "description":"The Common Principles, originally developed and applied to high schools, guide schools to evaluate what is happening and strive, through reflection and common understanding, to seek improvement. What distinguishes the application of the Common Principles in an elementary school? And what makes a Coalition of Essential Schools (CES) elementary school different from other elementary schools? This article sheds some light on those differences by examining Windsor Elementary School, one of 13 elementary schools in the Elyria City Schools. Windsor began exploring the Coalition for Essential Schools in 1992 as a way to improve student performance at a time when state accountability was starting to come into practice in Ohio. Windsor became affiliated with CES in 1998 through an on-site review process conducted by the Ohio Center for Essential School Reform. Staff members embraced CES and have actively shared their work through attending and presenting at the Fall Forum. CES has provided consistency during times of transition; the school has seen four leadership changes since first embarking on Coalition work.",

        "description":"The Coalition of Essential Schools (CES) is not a reform movement. To reform is to make a thing again; reformation implies a stasis that doesn't deliver enough for the educational future. This issue of Horace demonstrates that Essential schools and the districts and networks that support them are at various points in the journey of transformation, the process of creation that irrevocably moves teaching and learning within schools and school systems, over, through, or beyond to somewhere entirely different. The schools and systems described here have moved from teacher-centered to learner-centered, from disengagement to connection, from isolation to cooperation, from inequitable exclusivity for many to inclusive opportunity for all. CES stands for the principle that real transformation is driven by the belief that public schools--and all of their associated civic, business, and other institutions--exist so all people can reach their fullest potential. This commitment to democracy and to the value of everyone demands radical transformation in the truest sense of the word. This issue of Horace provides first-hand accounts from writers within the CES network that reframe and redefine transformation; the perspectives here not only provide evidence of system-wide change, but they restore one's faith in \"transformation.\" This issue highlights specific CES network strengths, such as sustained coaching within schools.",

        "description":"During the summer of 2006, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and union officials announced that the Pico Union area of East Los Angeles would soon be home to the Belmont Zone of Choice (BZC). The BZC encompasses the Belmont High School attendance area and will include up to 10 Belmont Pilot Schools, each with a targeted enrollment of 400 students. The small schools will be open to all Pico Union students and represent the demographics of the local district. This groundbreaking agreement, formalized in February 2007, will create a network of high-caliber, theme-based public schools for families to select from based on students' interests. While many stakeholders were crucial in getting to this moment, the intent was originated through a partnership with the leadership of LAUSD Local District 4 and the Belmont Educational Collaborative (BEC), a powerful group of Community Based Organizations (CBOs). This coalition of 40 local organizations and Local District 4 educators kept the players at the negotiating table, especially in the early going. BEC is dedicated to promoting a secondary education reform agenda that prepares Belmont students to pursue college, career training, and civic participation in a democratic society. In September 2007, two new pilot schools opened their doors: (1) The Los Angeles High School of the Arts; and (2) Civitas School of Leadership (SOL). As in-district public schools, they can show the city and district the possibilities of effective reform and will blossom into a network of Pilot schools. This article tells the story of how community members and educational leaders in the Belmont area of Los Angeles were able to reach agreement to create the Belmont Pilot School Network. The story points to the powerful potential for reform that exists when dedicated, innovative educators collaborate with community members.",

        "description":"The Bay Area Coalition for Equitable Schools (BayCES) has been working to build the capacity of people to transform the educational experiences and outcomes of underserved students in the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Area for more than 15 years. BayCES supports people in urban districts and schools undergoing reform efforts to improve their individual and team performance through a research-based coaching approach led by a team of professionals with extensive educational, administrative, and coaching experience. In 1996, BayCES launched a Small Schools Initiative based on the belief that achieving educational equity would require smaller, more personalized schools in which each student could be known well and supported to learn and thrive. Today, adults and students speak in compelling ways about how the effects of a small school created an opportunity for them to be seen, supported, and challenged. Students assert that their lives have been changed through the relationships they have developed with adults who expressed care and pushed them to produce excellent work. Groups of adults are taking responsibility for the learning and success of cohorts of students: responsibility for students' academic preparation, for providing access to a world beyond their block, for encouraging them to make meaning of and take responsibility for the awesome, challenging world they will inherit. Parents are learning and leading cycles of inquiry, making informed decisions about school policies and practices, and asking questions about student learning and results. School communities are holding Data Nights, Exhibitions, and Portfolio Conferences. High school graduate college-going rates have increased to nearly 70 percent with half of those students attending four-year colleges. In this article, the author reflects on what BayCES had accomplished.",

Three years ago at Tyee, the author did not display that same full potential at school when it was a large high school, because teachers couldn't identify with her needs as easily and comfortably as they do now. Before, they dealt with overloads of students constantly. But teachers at ACE see the same students in longer class periods and sometimes multiple times a day. Also, in small schools, students often are with the same teachers for several or all of the years of their high school career. Familiarizing themselves with each other for that long keeps everyone in close contact. These hours spent together result in strong teacher-student bonds and relationships that last to support one another's learning.",

Next, the experimenter gave the participants the options of a smaller immediate reinforcer with no response requirement or a larger delayed reinforcer with a response requirement. Self-control training exposed participants to a procedure during which they chose between a smaller immediate reinforcer and a progressively increasing delayed reinforcer whose values varied and were determined by a die roll. The participants chose whether they or the experimenter rolled the die. All participants initially demonstrated low baseline durations of the physical therapy task, chose the smaller immediate reinforcer during the choice baseline, and changed their preference to the larger delayed reinforcer during self-control training.

In subsequent tests, participants showed derived more-less mands (mand with C1 for more and mand with C2 for less). A training procedure reversed the B-C conditional discriminations, and participants then showed derived reversed more-less mands (mand with C1 for less, C2 for more). Baseline B-C relations were retrained, and participants subsequently demonstrated a return to the original derived manding. A second experiment with 1 prior participant and 1 naive participant removed a possible confounding effect. Establishing derived manding may be an advantageous component when teaching a mand repertoire in applied settings. (Contains 8 figures.)",

This paper provides an overview of the logic that underlies a sequential analytic approach to the analysis of descriptive data. Several methods for quantifying sequential relations are reviewed along with their strengths and weaknesses. Data from descriptive analyses are used to illustrate key points. Issues germane to contingency analysis in natural environments are discussed briefly. It is concluded that the conceptual distinctions among contiguity, contingency, and dependency are critical if the logic of sequential analysis is to be extended successfully to a behavior-analytic account of reinforcement in natural environments.

Six individuals who had been diagnosed with developmental delays and exhibited problem behavior participated. Functional analyses indicated that participants' problem behavior was maintained by social positive reinforcement (n = 2), social negative reinforcement (n = 2), or automatic reinforcement (n = 2). Results showed that for all but 1 participant, descriptive analysis outcomes were similar across methods. In addition, for all but 1 participant, the descriptive analysis outcome differed substantially from the functional analysis outcome.

Next, functional analyses were conducted to identify reinforcers for problem behavior. Then, using data from the descriptive observations, lag-sequential analyses were conducted to examine changes in the probability of environmental events across time in relation to occurrences of problem behavior. The results of the lag-sequential analyses were interpreted in light of the results of functional analyses. Results suggested that events identified as reinforcers in a functional analysis followed behavior in idiosyncratic ways: after a range of delays and frequencies. Thus, it is possible that naturally occurring reinforcement contingencies are arranged in ways different from those typically evaluated in applied research. Further, these complex response-stimulus relations can be represented by lag-sequential analyses. However, limitations to the lag-sequential analysis are evident. (Contains 7 figures.)",

        "description":"Father Bruce Wellems didn't know the dropout statistics when he came to Back of the Yards in 1990 to serve as a parish priest. Born and raised in New Mexico, Wellems initially had only vague notions of what an inner-city ministry might look like and little commitment to the neighborhood's struggling youth. But after some prodding from a local park district supervisor, he began trying to build relationships with teens in the community who were gang members, many of whom were spending their days on the streets instead of in school. He quickly discovered that most of them desired one of two things: (1) a decent job; or (2) the chance to continue their education. For several years, Wellems tossed around the idea of starting a community-based high school that would serve the kids he'd gotten to know on the streets. But with so many other pressing needs in the parish, the high school stayed on Wellems' back burner until February 1998, when a tragic incident of youth violence moved him to act. With the city's gaze focused on Back of the Yards in the wake of two murders, Wellems decided to try to use the attention to make something good from the tragedy. This article describes the launching of the Irene Dugan Alternative High School and how it has been life-changing--a refuge, a second chance, a step down a different, more hopeful path--to troubled kids.",

Most descriptive analyses have focused on relations between consequent events and behavior, and it has been noted that attention is a common consequence for problem behavior even though it may not be a functional reinforcer. Because attention may be prescribed simply as a means of stopping serious problem behavior, it is possible that naturally occurring antecedent events (establishing operations) might be better predictors of problem behavior than consequences. We conducted descriptive and functional analyses of the problem behaviors of 7 participants. Conditional probabilities based on combined antecedent and consequent events showed correspondence with the functional analysis data for 4 of the 7 participants, but antecedent events were no better than consequent events in identifying the function of problem behavior.

The ethos of the school and the nature of the classroom environment as determined by teachers are therefore significant and continuing features of its pedagogy and its taught and &quot;hidden&quot; curriculum. This paper draws on evidence gained from an evaluation of the work of 10 junior (middle) and primary (elementary) schools involved in the Parents And Children Together (PACT) project in County Durham, in the northeast of England, since 1998. At its centre is an analysis of test scores in reading and the gains made by children as a result of their participation in the PACT programme. Informal interviews and participant observation notes have also been drawn upon from interviews with school headteachers (principals), basic skills tutors, class teachers, parents and children. Documentary analysis is also reported from teacher lesson plans, evaluation sheets and questionnaires completed by parents and children. (Contains 6 figures.)",

Critical evaluation throughout history, however, has shown that it is these very users who are least consulted in the structuring of education. In this article, the authors describe an experiential programme designed for educationalists that enhances their understanding of and ability to tackle thorny issues that arise in life skills teaching. Inspired by a pivotal report on the state of the country's education practice that showed that content and delivery of education ignored social realities, the programme signals a radical and brave departure for Indian pedagogy.",

        "description":"The establishment of the UK government's OFSTED (school inspection service), published league tables, standardised testing, the literacy and numeracy strategy, imposed external targets for improvement, performance related pay and the gifted and talented programme, show the present government's concerns with educational improvement. Schools have tended to concentrate on those young people who will be successful (Blyth and Milner, 1993; TES, 3-4-98). This is inevitable, for within the current educational climate, emphasis on academic performance leads to local and national credibility. However, for some young people, academic achievement is not always possible. For them, the way forward is to seek attention through aspects of poor behaviour. Such young people can be loosely labelled &quot;disaffected&quot;. The present three year study, which started in September 2000 and was completed in July 2003, was conducted in a comprehensive high school in the Midlands (for ages 11-18). It seeks to add to the debate that &quot;experiential&quot; National Curriculum subjects which include opportunities for practical activity, in this case music, have potential for re-engaging the &quot;disaffected&quot; young person. Furthermore, it suggests that the drive for academic excellence pursued by the present government is ill-advised if it is seen to be at the expense of more creative subjects.",

        "description":"The purpose of the present study is to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms among senior high school students preparing national university entrance examination (OSS) in Turkey. The authors conducted a survey during the second term of students' senior year at high school, a time when they were exposed to a stressful standardized national examination. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of depressive symptoms and to identify a possible association of depressive symptoms with other student and socio-demographic characteristics. The authors used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), adapted for Turkey, to assess self-reported depressive symptoms among 984 students. Overall, 45.1% of the students reported depressive symptoms. The relationship between the presence of depressive symptoms and student gender, family size, living circumstances, academic grade, number of times national exams were taken, monthly family income, daily study time, number of friends of opposite sex and involvement in social activities were examined. Gender, academic success and monthly family income had statistically significant differences on BDI scores. The high rate of self-reported depressive symptoms reflects heightened exam-related stress, social expectations, worries about future success linked to uncertainty about securing a university placement and personal, familial and demographic factors. The greater prevalence of depressive symptoms among females (49.5%) compared to males (40.6%) highlights higher degrees of stress or vulnerability among female adolescents facing similar circumstances to males in Turkey. Based on the data gathered, the authors propose that the population exposed to the national university entrance examinations in Turkey should in essence be regarded as a very high risk group for depression and approached as potential depression patients.

        "description":"Social exclusion is a serious social problem. Not \"fitting in\" at school may be an experience that can scar children psychologically for life. This is unsurprising since being part of the \"in crowd\" (i.e. accepted in-group members) is extremely important to children and adolescents. Being rejected by one's peers can cause an increase in antisocial behaviour, deviance, aggression, lowered intellectual performance, self-defeating behaviour and a series of other maladaptive responses. Thus, an important social task that children face is to work out when their own and others' behaviour contravenes social norms, and to decide how to respond when such norms are contravened. Namely, they need to form attitudes towards nonconformity. Societal and interpersonal responses to deviance may focus primarily on the \"problem\" child and his or her personal or family relationships. However, the authors argue that such focus may miss a significant dimension, namely that when and how a behaviour is defined as \"deviant\" is also part of a wider peer group process that defines and defends group norms and boundaries. In this paper, the authors consider how the intergroup context (i.e. perceived relations between one's own and other social groups) and socio-cognitive development (i.e. the emergence of social-cognitive abilities) affects school children's reactions to non-conformists in their peer group.",

Family-centered practice positions the family at the center of attention or field of action. Its focus is on those transactions occurring between a person, family, and environment, which affect individuals, families and the larger social forces and systems in which families are embedded. Based on eco-systemic and strength perspectives (Hartman and Laird, 1983; Pecora, Whittaker and Maluccio, 2000), family-centered practices address students' school refusal behaviors in their contexts. The process of family-centered practices with students who have school non-attendance problems is highlighted in the following: (1) joining and discovery; (2) change and celebration; and (3) separation and reflection.",

Days after Hurricane Katrina hit, Hamline sent students, faculty and staff to help with recovery efforts. The Education Club adopted Martin Luther King Science and Technology school (MLK) soon after to help in cleaning and rebuilding the school and sent over $20,000.00 in books, supplies, merchandise gift cards, food and water to help with this effort. Still fueled by the great need in New Orleans for assistance, the group's leader Dr. Jean Strait worked with Traveler's Insurance Company and received a grant of $30,000 to start an online tutoring and mentoring program that would be staffed by Hamline University and Avalon High School students in St. Paul. This article talks about a program called &quot;Each One, Teach One,&quot; which grew out of a Hurricane Katrina rebuilding project. The goal of the program is to create a national disaster-related education response model that could be replicated in any city in the U.S. The program consists of a joint on-line service-learning tutoring/mentoring program between Hamline University, Avalon High School and grade five through nine New Orleans students. Hamline Students serve as tutors/mentors to both the Avalon High School students and the grade five through nine students. Hamline students and Avalon students are paired together to lead pods or groups of New Orleans students as a team. The authors discuss the process for creating the program, as well as the preparations and limitations faced in implementing the program. (Contains 1 figure and 3 tables.)",

Some have shown remarkable improvements and have turned around the situation from being &quot;at-risk&quot; to &quot;excellent.&quot; This paper is based on a qualitative study of two selected turn-around at-risk schools, one in the State of Selangor and the other in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Both had been listed as at-risk by the education department, but are now considered as exemplary due to their accomplishments in various endeavors.

        "description":"This paper is concerned with findings about gender which form part of a larger ethnographic study. The study was undertaken during the author's employment as a local authority (school district) Pupil Support Officer, where the author's work involved the support of young people who had been permanently excluded (expelled) from school for a variety of reasons, including sexual assault, violence against their peers or teachers, and what was known as &quot;persistent disruptive behaviour&quot;. It focused on the effects of instances of actual or threatened permanent exclusion from secondary school on pupils, families and professionals in an urban local authority: &quot;Enway&quot;. This paper focuses on the effects that professionals' assumptions about gender-identity and sexuality can have on effective support planning for young people at risk of or subject to permanent exclusion; and the lived experience of these young people with regard to their gender-identity and sexuality, with particular regard to how this can contribute towards exclusion. The author begins with a story about Nama, a young woman of Iraqi Kurdish heritage, who had been excluded for aggressive language and behaviour. Nama's story introduces some of the complex gendered issues experienced by students at risk of or subject to a permanent exclusion and how these interact with issues of class and ethnicity. The author also briefly discusses the connection between habitus (Bourdieu, 1977), embodiment and the &quot;extended body&quot; as a theoretical background to a discussion of sexuality, gender and identity, through three cases of &quot;compulsory heterosexuality&quot;. The conclusion clarifies some of the links between gender normativity and instances of threatened or actual permanent exclusion. (Contains 8 notes.)",

        "description":"The impact of the economic crisis in America is having significant consequences across all environments. Children in Alabama are being hit particularly hard, with budget constraints leading to greatly reduced services for marginalized children and families in rural and urban areas. According to the United States Census Bureau, 16.6% of the population in Alabama fell within the poverty level in 2007. Census data also reveals that only 75% of Alabamians have attained at least a high school education. For urban and rural children in Alabama who exist at or below the poverty line, their social, environmental, and educational difficulties are magnified by an overall lack of resources and opportunities and further reduced services. The profound level of deprivation that these children experience has been well documented through reduced graduation rates, higher incidents of incarceration, and a perpetuation of family legacies defined by impoverishment. The Uniform Crime Reporting prepared by the Disaster Center ranks Alabama as having the 15th highest Crime Index in the US, which includes violence, theft and property crimes. Alabama ranks 24th highest for forcible rapes and 15th highest for murders, with a 22nd highest ranking for overall violent crime in 2007. The need for a comprehensive approach to reduce disruptive behaviors continues to grow in the face of insufficient funding for therapeutic services for many of these children. In this article, the authors discuss how a program at the Center for Attachment and Family Development in Decatur, Alabama seeks to reach these children with a multi-disciplinary approach. The authors stress that this type of intervention is most effective in addressing the needs of the children, the parents, and other professionals involved with each child.",

When implementing PUBS, administrators, teachers, and other professionals teach behavior relentlessly by promoting similar attitudes, rewarding school and class rules and expectations with high levels of praise and prompting, using a unified correction procedure to address inappropriate behavior and adopting mutually supportive roles and responsibilities. While an ultimate goal of school-wide interventions is improved learning, documenting differences in how they are implemented is an important first step in continuing research related to positive behavior support. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of PUBS on key instructional variables: (a) frequency of teacher reinforcement, (b) frequency of teacher correction, (c) reinforcement/correction ratio, (d) degree of teacher monitoring, and (e) voice tone used during teacher correction, and (f) total rule violations. Within the broad range of systemic and individualized strategies that entail positive behavior support, there are a myriad of possible implementation approaches. This research provides evidence to support the operationally defined and replicable interventions within the PUBS model and evidence on key instructional behaviors associated with those interventions. This study illustrates the effects of using proactive strategies central to positive behavior support and highlights the differences in instruction that are evident in classrooms using instructional techniques that use and consistently enforce school-wide rules and procedures, reinforce positive behavior and teach alternatives, ensure that all staff members are \"on the same page,\" and are relatively easy to implement and monitor.

In an effort to better understand what pair programming looks like, we describe an observational study of middle school girls. We coded audiotape transcripts to show the kinds of interactions that appear to promote or undermine effective problem solving.

The study reported here is part of a larger body of research on video-enhanced teacher reflection. For this study, we used a qualitative research design to examine two guided reflection activities for two groups of novice teachers. The first group debriefed with a teacher educator immediately after teaching their lesson. They later wrote about critical incidents that occurred during their teaching. The second group had no debriefing, but the participants were asked to capture their lessons on digital video, edit their video for two critical incidents, and reflect on the incidents in written form using the same rubric as the first group. Given that both groups used the same reflection guide, we found that students who developed video vignettes produced longer and more multifaceted reflections. We found implications of these results to be an important step towards facilitating novice teachers' development. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"As the population of the United States becomes more diverse, both challenges and opportunities are created for the educational system. The gap that currently exists between a predominantly White, middle class, female teaching workforce and an increasingly heterogeneous population of students is one of the key factors that shapes these challenges. In an attempt to address this gap and better serve the needs of all children, Banks (2006) has advocated that every level of education should be &quot;substantially reformed and educators must acquire new knowledge and skills.&quot; The efforts of teacher education programs in this endeavor are critical to any hope for successful change. It stands to reason, however, that if the majority of teacher educators come from positions within teaching, then they are likely to be more similar to those currently entering the teaching workforce than to the students occupying seats in classrooms. With this in mind, it is imperative for doctoral programs in education to follow the lead of the multicultural teacher education literature and help future teacher educators cultivate the strategies and habits of mind necessary for preparing culturally responsive teachers. This article reports a research which examines the experiences of students in a doctoral seminar in critical pedagogy that attempts to foster multicultural knowledge and dispositions by providing future teacher educators with opportunities to examine their sociocultural identities while critically exploring the current system of education in the United States. Specifically, the focus is to understand the impact the course had on participants' personal and professional beliefs and practices. Additionally, the researchers were interested in features of the seminar that explained its impact on the participants. Insights from the study have implications for transforming teacher educators and are therefore relevant to successful multicultural teacher education.",

        "description":"Given the need for high quality teachers in every classroom, it is important to understand what might contribute to the preparation and persistence of teachers. Two lines of literature in teacher education relate to such an understanding. One line of literature follows the circumstances of how people decide to become teachers. The other line explores the relationship between spirituality and teaching. This article considers the intersection of those two lines; namely, what is the relationship, if any, between why people enter the K-12 teaching field and the spirituality of teaching? To answer this research question, two researchers interviewing 18 first-year undergraduates during a program evaluation of an elementary teacher education program at a Catholic institution included three questions related to spirituality, the decision to teach, and what makes a good teacher. They wanted to know how teachers at the very beginning of their careers thought about their teaching choice and how spirituality might relate to it. (Contains 2 tables and 1 note.)",

        "description":"In the last decade, educational reform efforts have focussed primarily on &quot;technical fixes--changes in structures and practices&quot; such as mandated curriculum and standardized tests. The imposition of these accountability measures has led to the deprofessionalization of teachers as mediators between the curriculum and the students in the classrooms. Today, these imposed solutions are increasingly viewed as superficial and ineffective. One of the major criticisms is that these technical fixes fail to address the beliefs, behaviors and core beliefs of the teachers. There is growing recognition that teachers' activities are central to meaningful learning in classrooms and that teacher development must actively engage teachers in order to improve learning and reculture schools. While the professional knowledge and ongoing professional development of teachers have long been subjects of inquiry, there is much still to be understood about the experiences of teachers and, particularly, the professional renewal of veteran teachers. This narrative inquiry, which focusses on the experiences of one teacher, examines how a respectful and relational approach to teacher development can result in deep and sustained professional growth and renewal.",

        "description":"A teacher's sense of self-efficacy has been consistently recognized as an important attribute of effective teaching and has been positively correlated to teacher and student outcomes. A number of studies show the impact of teachers with high levels of efficacy. Students of these teachers have outperformed students who had teachers with lower levels of efficacy on the mathematics section of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Greater achievement was also found in rural, urban, majority Black, and majority White schools for students who had teachers with high levels of self-efficacy. In addition, studies have shown that teachers with high levels of efficacy have demonstrated different characteristics related to work ethic and pedagogical practice than teachers with low levels of self-efficacy. The benefits of having high levels of efficacy have been firmly established; therefore, many researchers have explored methods of increasing levels of efficacy in preservice teachers; but few studies have explored the concept of raising inservice teachers' efficacy levels. This is partly due to the fact that the concept of self-efficacy, as developed by Bandura (1993), has been thought to impact novice individuals early in the context of new learning, thus limiting the studies of practicing or in-service teachers. In this article, the authors examine teachers' self-efficacy and change over time. They detail self-efficacy and the ways that self-efficacy can impact teaching. In considering the context of an inservice teacher with lower levels of specific content knowledge, the authors posit that content courses which are designed to support a teacher's development of content knowledge and pedagogy can be a valuable way to increase levels of self-efficacy. This study investigates whether inservice teachers' levels of personal efficacy and/or outcome efficacy changed as a result of completing courses in mathematics and/or science that intertwined content acquisition with pedagogy. In addition, the authors are interested in the reasons teachers participated in content courses and if this information helped identify characteristics of teachers with high levels of efficacy.

        "description":"The report of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) Panel on Research and Teacher Education recommended that teacher educators need to systematically and empirically study their own practice. The premise of the report was that teacher educators need to carry out quality research in order to better inform those inside and outside the field of education. The report was timely, as many outside the field of education question the need for teacher preparation programs as well as their effectiveness in preparing highly qualified teachers as defined by the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; legislation. In response, teacher preparation programs need to base their work on solid evidence that indicates whether or not teachers are well prepared by their programs and whether they have a positive impact on student achievement. Without question, university-based teacher preparation programs are under assault at a time when the need for good teacher preparation is more important than ever before. In response to the call for more rigorous self-study by the educational research community and the need for high quality teacher preparation programs, the authors empirically studied their own pedagogical practice, the peer feedback process, during two semesters of clinical experiences to examine how that practice affected teacher candidates' professional development. Peer feedback refers to reciprocal teaching in which paired teacher candidates provide assistance to one another as they incorporate new teaching skills, strategies, and approaches to their teaching, while in a P-12 school setting. The process emphasizes giving and receiving feedback in both written and verbal formats. The goal of reflective peer feedback is to promote self-assessment, collaboration, and professional learning. Although peer feedback practices have been studied in the past, the focus has been on the nature of peer feedback at one point in teacher education programs, rather than its impact over time. Therefore, this study examines how the peer feedback practices teacher candidates gave and received affected their professional development during successive clinical experiences. Changes in, as well as the consistency of, teacher candidate comments and survey responses are the focus of this study. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Four teachers began the three-year study, but only two remained in the profession after their second year. This development was consistent with estimates that 40-50% of novices leave the profession within five years. Bandura's (1977) construct of self-efficacy beliefs was used as a lens to examine how personal characteristics and professional experiences either contributed to new elementary teachers' success, increased sense of self-efficacy, and desire to remain in the profession, or contributed to their desire to leave teaching.",

        "author":["Namaghi, Seyyed Ali Ostovar"],
        "description":"Teaching must be recognized &quot;as a socially constructed activity that requires the interpretation and negotiation of meanings embedded within the context of the classroom.&quot; As part and parcel of this interpretation and negotiation, there is a continual redefinition of teacher identity. &quot;Teaching and teacher identity are socially constructed through experiences in and with members of the teaching profession,&quot; and various student and other groups. Teachers who see their main task as that of responding to students' needs create a coidentity with their students. Thus teacher identity is constructed in activities that are responsive to students' needs. The professional identity of teachers can be described as a tension between the subjective and personal aspects of teaching and the intersubjective or collective aspects. That is, every teacher sees himself or herself as a &quot;rational decision-maker&quot;; however, he should also see himself through the roles he is socially expected to play, or through &quot;cultural lenses.&quot; Thus in addition to being a rational decision-maker, every teacher sees himself/herself as a social being who responds to the particulars of a given culture. Teaching activities initially tend to be subjective. Over time, however, they tend to be more intersubjective or collective. Teacher preparation programs focus on the universal component of teacher knowledge. Research has demonstrated that teachers' sense of professional and personal identity is a key variable in their motivation and commitment to change. To foster change, the field is in urgent need of &quot;field-internal&quot; and data-driven conceptualizations that are deeply grounded in teachers' free expression of their identity in actual teaching situations. Such conceptualizations will help researchers contribute sounder concepts to language teacher identity rather than just consuming theory-driven concepts. This study aims to contribute to this line of research by exploring language teachers' self-conceptualizations in public high schools in Iran.",

        "description":"In this age of heightened accountability, academia is increasingly being asked to link assessment to candidate performance outcomes in multiple ways. Research demonstrates the importance of aligning assessment with content standards but cautions that it is critical that assessments match the content, cover a wide range of knowledge, are cognitively demanding, and avoid irrelevant materials. Case-based pedagogy is one way to link program content to classroom practice. Much of the research on case methods calls for the use of cases to &quot;create bridges across the great chasm that divides policy from practice&quot; in order to help teachers understand &quot;how&quot; practice is constructed in the classroom. Within case-based pedagogy, the cases become teaching tools that serve as a context for making meaning of concepts presented during instruction in a variety of instructional settings, and thus make understanding transparent. In this article the authors examine the use of candidate-authored case studies as a culminating assessment activity in one Reading and Language Arts Specialist Credential Program (RRLA) in a large, urban public university with a diverse student population in southern California. Candidates in the program earn an M.A. in Education, Option in Reading, along with the state-issued specialist credential. The authors ask the following research questions in order to examine the use of case-based assessment in the RRLA program: (1) Are case studies an effective way for graduate candidates to demonstrate knowledge and skills learned in the program?; and (2) Can candidates use case studies to demonstrate what they know about serving culturally and linguistically diverse urban students?

        "title":"Personal Attitudes and Technology: Implications for Preservice Teacher Reflective Practice",
        "author":["Shoffner, Melanie"],
        "description":"The increasing importance of technology in today's world challenges teacher educators to create technology-proficient teachers, practitioners who can utilize existing technology, learn to work with emerging technology and adapt as needed when confronted with technological issues. Acknowledging the need for technologically proficient teachers, teacher educators across the nation now infuse some degree of technological competency into the preparation of their preservice teachers. Teacher educators face several obstacles to the implementation of technology into teacher preparation, however, among them the attitude held by preservice teachers toward the technology itself. While providing opportunities for preservice teachers to engage with technology personally, academically and pedagogically, teacher educators must also consider the attitudes toward technology that influence preservice teachers' experiences with that same technology. Technology has a place not only in preservice teachers' emerging classroom pedagogy but in their professional development as well. Reflective practice is one area currently drawing on different technologies, as teacher educators incorporate a range of technology into preservice teacher reflection. Drawing from a qualitative study in which weblogs were used for voluntary preservice teacher reflective practice, this article examines preservice teacher attitudes toward a specific technology and the influence of those attitudes on the use of that technology for voluntary reflection. The researcher uses the term &quot;voluntary reflection&quot; to express reflection that is undertaken by choice, outside course or programmatic requirements, with all aspects of the reflective activity (such as topic, quantity, formality and medium) determined by the preservice teacher. This article opens with an overview of reflection in teacher education and the use of asynchronous communication technologies in reflective practice, with a focus on the specific technology of weblogs. The study, in which preservice teachers volunteered to use a weblog for their personal reflection while completing a teacher preparation program, is then briefly explained. Next, the preservice teachers' use of reflective weblogs is presented, followed by a discussion of the role played by individual attitudes toward technology in the use of reflective weblogs. The article concludes by considering the implications of preservice teacher attitudes toward technology for teacher educators. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "author":["Gainsburg, Julie"],
        "description":"Training and investing teachers at all career levels in student-centered practices is widely recognized as a significant challenge. Various studies document the failure of student-centered teaching practices to take hold in K-12 mathematics classrooms in significant ways, including collaborative work; problems that are cognitively demanding or that encourage connections, inquiry-based approaches; teacher questioning to enhance student understanding; classroom-based performance assessments; and student choice. While pre-service math-teacher education is not solely to blame for this failure, it is also the case that pre-service training has been relatively unsuccessful at promoting nontraditional teaching practices in new mathematics teachers, in spite of the efforts and intentions of university-based teacher educators. Overcoming resistance to student-centered methods has been the author's major challenge in teaching the secondary-level mathematics-methods course in her institution's credential program. An often-recommended strategy for promoting student-centered methods in pre-service courses is to show video of exemplary K-12 classrooms. Ideally, classroom video can illustrate how theories about teaching can be implemented in practice, provide teachers with a shared, concrete experience for discussion and reflection, and encourage teachers to adopt a practice by showing a real teacher implementing it successfully. Several professionally produced video projects for teachers have aimed to capitalize on these potential benefits and are available for purchase or free on the Web. In this article, the author describes a project to produce a video library for her methods and other teacher-education classes that was designed to retain the many benefits of professional classroom video but overcome its shortcomings. The author also shares the results of its use in her most recent methods course. Although her project focused on mathematics teaching, the author believes the problems she found with professional video, the resistance of her pre-service teachers (PSTs) to nontraditional methods, and the efficacy of the features and use of the video she produced are directly relevant to the teaching of any subject. Most importantly, this low-budget project required few technical skills and could be easily replicated by any teacher educator. (Contains 2 tables and 4 notes.)",

          "Heinen, Ethan"],
        "description":"&quot;Alternative teacher certification program&quot; (ATCP) is widely used as a term for a variety of programs designed to train and credential teachers in expedited fashion. In practice, however, ATCPs consist of a loose confederation of programs and practices ranging from &quot;emergency certification to very sophisticated and well-designed programs that address the professional preparation needs of the growing population of individuals who already have at least a baccalaureate degree and considerable life experience who want to become teachers.&quot; The policy rhetoric suggests that these programs address teacher shortages, improve teacher quality, increase diversity of the teacher pool, and increase retention rates. While these goals are laudable, the underlying assumptions of the policy have been challenged. Studies question assumptions about the effectiveness of alternative certification policy to attract teachers of higher quality than traditionally trained teachers. However, the antecedent assumption that ATCPs are substantially similar in structure and function remains tacit and under-explored in policy circles, among practitioners, and in large part in extant research. This article presents findings from the initial phase of a longitudinal research program designed to evaluate alternative teacher certification policy in one state. The study used program theory evaluation (PTE) to investigate policy assumptions, program logics and dilemma points from alternatively certified teacher training to teacher practice. The authors specifically explored how and why ATCPs differed in form and function by presenting an emergent framework to make sense of these differences. Gaining a better understanding of ATCP variation is critical given national, state, and local pressure to address teacher shortages &quot;and&quot; improve teacher quality. The following questions guided the authors' exploration into ATCP theories: (1) what are the program theories that guide practice in the five largest ATCPs in Missouri? and (2) what factors contribute to formation of these program theories. In their discussion the authors consider the implications their findings have for the practice of alternative teacher certification. As this study shows, policy makers and ATCP directors must address the external factors that shape program logics and the contradictions these influences can create.

        "description":"Paraprofessionals represent a growing segment of district employees seeking professional licensure. National preparation programs through the American Federation of Teachers, national testing programs, and state initiated portfolio programs offer a variety of options for meeting the stipulations set under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) legislation and for attracting paraprofessionals into the teaching profession. The federal government defines paraprofessionals as any person who works under the direct supervision of a classroom teacher in an early childhood, elementary, or secondary school. Paraprofessionals may work in traditional classrooms or with language education teachers, special educators, or in immigrant education programs. Clearly the work of paraprofessionals is becoming more technical, requiring increased training and evaluation. Now more than ever, those employing paraprofessionals are in need of professional development resources that are current and reflect the changing work responsibilities of paraprofessionals and the communities in which they work. Several studies have sought ways of strategically recruiting minority paraprofessionals into the teaching profession. However, the majority of studies on paraprofessionals fail to address the ways in which collaborative linkages between institutions of higher education and local school districts respond to the unique needs of individuals within the paraprofessional community. Additionally, past studies fail to examine the relationships between immigrant paraprofessionals and the development of a pre-teacher recruiting curriculum that extends beyond test preparation and skills training. This project examines the collaborative efforts of stakeholders involved in developing an innovative seminar series for recruiting paraprofessionals into the teaching profession. Participants in the study completed a year-long preservice Introduction to Teaching course through a western university. This project investigates the effectiveness of a professional development experience designed to increase the recruitment of paraprofessionals as a pool of prospective teachers. This collaborative project examines the curriculum and assignments used as part of a recruiting seminar series. The perspectives of non-native and native English speakers employed as paraprofessionals in an urban school district are discussed. The goal is to examine how a recruiting curriculum meets the needs of a diverse group of paraprofessionals. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"In this article, the author examines her racial identity and its impact on her interpretation of the schooling experiences of a 10th grade Latina in an ethnographic case study. Prior to this study, the author had been working in a university-based family literacy program where she met Zulmy's mother, Manuela. Due to her experience as a middle grades English/Spanish bilingual teacher, and due to the observations she made about the difficult transition for many of her former bilingual students who entered high school, she was primarily interested in following the school and literacy experiences of Mexican immigrant students in the high school. She had originally met three young Latinas who were in their freshman year; all of them, including Zulmy, were daughters of the Mexican mothers with whom she worked in the literacy program. As a Filipino American whose second language is Spanish, the young women were curious and intrigued about her interest in them, and about her knowledge of Spanish, which she learned in high school and later in college. To orient herself with the school setting, she also interviewed Zulmy's teachers and friends about the academic and social life in Zulmy's high school. For the purpose of understanding how class, religion, and immigration influenced her interpretation of Zulmy's life, this article mostly addresses the relationship the author had with her. The author describes her relationship with Zulmy, first through her initial description of her as a church girl. Then she follows this piece with a personal refection on language, identity, and ethnicity. Throughout the article, Cynthia Reyes  examines their research relationship vis-a-vis her personal reflections on language and identity, and analyzes the implications that such a relationship has on understanding data and writing about one's participant.

        "description":"In the fall of 2005 and as a second year doctoral student in an educational leadership program, the author was given the opportunity to participate in oral history research with three other White women, including one professor and two doctoral students. The oral history involved interviewing approximately twenty prior students of Frederick Douglass School in Parsons, Kansas. Douglass School was built in 1908 for the purpose of educating Black students in Parsons. This article considers the intersection of the oral history of Douglass School and White researchers investigating the experiences of people of color. In the process of writing about this intersection, the author chose to divide this article into five sections. First, she includes her reflections on her background and influences on her White identity. Second, she shares her initial reactions and approach to the oral history. Third, she discusses a synopsis of the themes that emerged from stories the Douglass alumni selected to share with the research team, resulting in greater awareness of her White privilege. Fourth, she discusses a brief overview of the literature on White racial identity, including sections on Helm's model of White racial identity development and her growth in owning a positive White identity. Finally, she shares implications and considerations for oral history research and White researchers researching across differences. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "author":["Choi, Jung-ah"],
        "description":"Critical educators, particularly Critical Race pedagogues, critique colorblind ideology as tantamount to racism because it serves to maintain racial inequality. King (1991), for example, refers to colorblindness as \"dysconscious racism\" since colorblind ideology sustains and justifies the culture of power. As an attempt to unpack the colorblind model that so many pre-service teachers endorse, the author made the most of her own teaching experience as a teacher educator, reflecting analytically on classroom discussions and student reactions. What she found most vexing was that colorblind ideology seemed so well-intentioned that it was hard to fight against. Apparently, she was not alone: in scholarly journals, she located the stories of a number of teacher educators who struggled to problematize liberal discourse in their classrooms. Also, she collected first-hand interview data by talking with teacher educators (her colleagues) who have taught multicultural issues. These interviews were conducted in a dialogue format rather than as structured, formal interviews, and these dialogues occurred as the interviewed instructors and she casually talked about their dilemmas and quandaries. This study thus incorporates the spirit of the self-study method in the sense that it emerged from her own quandary and that her goal was to improve teacher education practices, including her own. The self-study has gained increasing legitimacy and popularity during the last ten years as a methodological stance in teacher education. From her interviews and scholarly articles, the author gleaned a multitude of information about the colorblind rhetoric that propels pre-service teachers' beliefs on education and race. In this paper, the author identifies and details the ideological constructs of colorblind rhetoric. These constructs are: the apprenticeship model, the nationalistic/assimilationist stance, the deficit perspective, meritocratic belief, and the neoliberal/postmodernist framework.",

        "author":["Hughes, Sherick A."],
        "description":"The author's former College of Education encouraged faculty to implement pedagogy that responded fully to the needs of citizens in diverse situations, including the urban, metropolitan community they served. Such a vision requires, by default, a sincere effort to change or \"reform\" schools. Research endeavors involving the social and historical contexts of education (e.g., Hughes, 2006a; Milner, 2003; Noblit & Dempsey, 1996; Valenzuela, 1999) suggest that any sincere and sustainable school reform effort must necessarily begin with critical reflexivity and subsequent individual and collective action. Results of this research also suggest that such an effort must involve a transformative caring agent to disrupt oppressive experiences and narratives of race, while remaining \"intimately cognizant of the necessary intersection of ...class and gender\" (Jennings & Lynn, 2005, p. 26). This article addresses how autoethnography may contribute to this effort by illustrating a promising connection of autoethnography to \"critical race pedagogy\" (CRP) (Jennings & Lynn, 2005) in graduate teacher education. The remaining text discusses: (1) the theoretical framework of \"critical race pedagogy\" and its challenges for traditional caring; (2) autoethnography and its extant connection to pedagogy; and (3) evidence and concluding thoughts regarding how the author, one Black male professor from a working poor background, connects autoethnography to \"critical race pedagogy\" along with a White graduate-level, urban high school English teacher named \"Maggie\" (pseudonym). The connection of autoethnography to critical race pedagogy is illustrated through interwoven narratives of race-, class-, and gender-related struggles and hopes voiced by Maggie and the author.",

          "Price, Paula Groves"],
        "description":"The authors use Noddings (1984; 1992; 1999) and Beauboeuf-Lafontant's (2002) theories of caring in education to look at how race (conceptualized to include Whiteness) affected the implementation of the A+ Schools Program, an arts-based reform designed to augment student achievement and appreciation for the arts. They examine the implementation of the A+ Schools Program in three very different schools, with a particular focus on instruction and pedagogy. One school, Mountain Top, located in the mountains in the western part of North Carolina is all White. The second school, Piedmont Elementary, is located in an urban setting in the center of the state. Predominantly African American, it is more racially diverse than the other two schools, with Whites comprising about 20% of the population. The third school, Jackson, located in a rural, northeast corner of the state, is over 90% African American. These cases illustrate the importance of race in understanding how caring and educational reform are defined and enacted in schools. The authors maintain that the enactment of caring and educational reform must include claiming a school's racial identity and an acknowledgement that the world is a place where race matters. Furthermore, they assert that both caring and the interpretation of educational reform are not racially neutral. Reform expresses the race of the people who design it and those who implement it. Practitioners, policymakers, and researchers must make race an explicit focus of educational reform rather than merely letting race play out in unexamined ways. Their analysis in this article explicitly contradicts the ideology of colorblindness.",

The president issued the following challenge to all Americans: &quot;And so tonight, I ask every American to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training, or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma. And dropping out of high school is no longer an option.&quot; In response to the President's challenge, the U.S. Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship program offers young men and women many opportunities to learn valuable skills, establish relationships with employers, and get paid while they learn to build successful careers. Today's Registered Apprenticeship works directly with many two- and four-year colleges and universities to provide the technical classroom instruction that employers demand. Working with partners in the career and technical education (CTE) system allows Registered Apprenticeship programs to provide young people with increased opportunities, and support the goals of preparing U.S. workers to compete in a global economy and training America's next generation of skilled workers.",

        "description":"This year has been a very difficult one for the average American worker. Many of them have seen significant job losses in their communities, particularly in fields that appeared relatively stable a short time ago. There is no doubt that this past year has brought to light the need for skilled workers. To help prepare a skilled workforce, the Obama Administration and Congress have placed an emphasis on ensuring that Americans have access to education and training. In February 2009, Congress injected billions of dollars into the economy with the passage of the historic American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This law is being used to help states and localities alleviate some of the financial burdens encountered in recent years. The stimulus package included money for training and retraining workers so that they are equipped to be successful in a high-tech workplace. Some states are deciding to use their stimulus money to accommodate a surge in postsecondary enrollments, others are establishing apprenticeship programs or helping students experience firsthand the broad array of lucrative careers available to them after their schooling. Although how states choose to use their money may differ, all are developing programs that will benefit the entire community. This article highlights new programs that are using ARRA money in innovative ways to ensure that youth and displaced workers are learning new skills that can secure their place as successful employees in a rapidly evolving global economy.",

        "description":"Today's long-term jobs crisis is not about the current financial meltdown. It is about an accelerating talent showdown. The basic cause is that unprecedented technological advances are ever more rapidly transforming the world of work. The global economy will be more tech-driven with each passing year. This will continue to raise the U.S. talent ante for people seeking employment or for businesses that need to fill high-skill jobs. The U.S. Department of Labor finds that 62 percent of all U.S. jobs now require two-year or four-year degrees and higher, or special postsecondary occupation certificates or apprenticeships. By 2020 it is expected that these talent requirements will increase to include 75 percent of U.S. jobs. Across America renewed civic engagement and best practice models, such as community-based organizations (CBOs) and career academies, are already helping communities expand their pool of qualified talent. People must create a new sense of urgency regarding the global talent showdown and its broad economic ramifications. The author contends that it is time for a revitalization of talent creation systems that will lead to America's economic growth and that of other nations around the world.",

        "description":"ACTE Issue Briefs provide background information, highlight research, profile career and technical education (CTE) programs and include examples of how CTE is tied to a broader issue of national interest. This brief, &quot;The Role of Career Academies in Education Improvement,&quot; was released in the spring of 2009 to capitalize on education reform discussions related to the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. As economic development issues dominate policy debates around the country, it is critical that the focus on improving education and training opportunities for students does not wane. Despite the attention paid to education reforms in recent years, there has been no &quot;silver bullet&quot; to increasing student engagement, achievement, and transition to successful post-high school education and career opportunities. There is strong evidence, however, that career academies improve student performance, and the consistent involvement of business and industry provides a critical link between student learning and workforce needs. The benefits of career academies include a more educated workforce, a greater ability to attract new business to communities, reduced dropout rates, increased graduation rates, greater earnings among graduating students, and increased readiness for college. Through new and sustained investments in the career academy model, school districts and communities can reap the rewards of a school improvement model that can positively contribute to the nation's economic development and recovery by helping to prepare a well-educated and skilled workforce.

Green jobs encompass a range of skills, educational backgrounds and occupational profiles. The green industry has been recognized as a high-growth workforce sector because of the demand for sustainability products and services, in addition to government initiatives. Within the next 20 years, one in four Americans will be directly or indirectly employed in a green industry; however, reports indicate that there is a tremendous shortage of qualified individuals with the necessary skill to work in the green economic market. Despite the exploding interest in green jobs and the real potential for their development, there is a lack of a trained workforce that is hindering the development of green industries. To ensure a pipeline of qualified individuals, education and training is necessary to prepare students for the industries into which they will be entering. This article describes how a team of career and technical education (CTE) and academic teachers in Illinois developed a curriculum to expose students to the green-collar workforce while integrating science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in an applied context.",

        "description":"How does one know when it is time to either give a program extra attention or perhaps close it? That problem faces many career and technical education (CTE) programs and there is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all solution. Traditional assessments are inefficient in helping programs learn how to leverage their strengths and compensate for their weaknesses. In St. Louis County, Missouri, a team of CTE advisers and administrators arrived at a model for reviewing programs facing this challenge. This article looks at how districts can develop a Program Status Indicators (PSI) Score Card to help their CTE programs leverage their strengths and address their weaknesses, or to determine when it is time to close them down altogether. Five PSI are defined and cutoff points identified: (1) placement; (2) enrollment; (3) advisory committees; (4) certification; and (5) occupational outlook. Programs below a designated composite score are placed on a watch or probation list and those that continue to perform at less than acceptable levels may be recommended for termination.

VET in Australia may face the same image battle as CTE does in the United States, since the Australian Government's Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Web site for high school students acknowledges that most parents encourage their children to take math, science and English courses in preparation for entering a university, but it recognizes that some students may prefer to learn on the job. And just as CTE can keep such students engaged in learning, research in Australia shows that VET subjects (or modules) taken at school and continued at Registered Training Organizations such as Technical and Further Education (TAFE) are more likely to improve students' chances of getting the job they want. Whether it is called CTE or VET, the bottom line is that when there is a national commitment to include high-quality education and training for 21st century skills, students have a greater chance for success--and the country will have the workforce it needs for the future.",

The Technologie Academie in Soissons, France, had a goal for all the career and technical students in the Picardie Region of France to have an international experience before completing their technical program. Manes was visiting Oklahoma on another project but wanted to connect with the career tech system. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technical Education identified in its strategic plan the importance of preparing career and technical education (CTE) students for the global economy. The goals of the two were aligned and ready to be realized in an unexpected way. This article describes how four technology centers in Oklahoma with culinary programs forged partnerships with French Lycee schools to offer students and teachers a transatlantic exchange that influences instruction and learning on both sides of the ocean. The author concludes that this type of global exchange will help CTE students be successful in the workplace of the 21st century.",

        "description":"In a study by the World Bank in 1993, &quot;Skills for Productivity: Vocational Education and Training in Developing Countries,&quot; researchers found that skill training in the rural and urban informal sectors in developing countries may contribute more to the alleviation of poverty than training for modern sector wage employment. They also found that in small low-income countries a strong participation by workers and employers in training and education was an effective way for programs to better respond to the needs of local businesses. An example of a program that has begun to put these principles into action is the Economic Growth Initiative for Haiti (EGI), a non-governmental organization (NGO) that offers a business development and mentoring program for university graduates just outside of Port au Prince. Its goal is to create and expand local entrepreneurship while also increasing opportunities for networking between the students and current local business owners. EGI offers two tracks for students, one for management and another for entrepreneurs. Both programs require that students take business courses from current business professionals for a full year, during which they are taught how to apply the lessons they learn to their current business plan or job. One factor that has helped this program to succeed is the emphasis on the community. It has made it the responsibility of community members to act as mentors and guides. With business plans that suit the needs of the Haitian culture and opportunities to network with community and business leaders from abroad, EGI participants become empowered and in control of their futures. Down the line this may help to attract foreign investment which could, ultimately, lead to increased prosperity for more Haitians.",

Unlike the streaming of vocational models in many European and Asian countries, the CCTI model creates opportunities for students along pathways that lead to further education or careers. CCTI, utilizing the organizational work of the career clusters project, developed a common definition for career pathways and provided a template outlining both academic and career and technical education (CTE) course sequences in a career pathway. The template also details dual-enrollment opportunities and emphasizes the need to assess students' interests and achievement early and often. The impact of CCTI as a demonstration project has been unique because it has created its legacy of an expanding network of colleges to sustain and extend the pathway concept after funding ends. The outcomes of the CCTI project and the components of its success are presented. (Contains 4 tables.)",

The author illustrates a film's ability to present a different perspective with reference to Sean Penn's \"The Pledge\" (2001) and Ivan Sen's \"Beneath Clouds\" (2002), which show how cinema allows viewers to recognize the implications of actions and states of affairs that are not captured by one's subject-centered perceptions.

        "description":"Over the past several decades film and video have been steadily infiltrating the philosophy curriculum at colleges and universities. Traditionally, teachers of philosophy have not made much use of \"audiovisual aids\" in the classroom beyond the chalk board or overhead projector, with only the more adventurous playing audiotapes, for example, or showing slides to provide historical context for a thinker's work. But with the advent of videotapes it became financially feasible to show films in classes in order to stimulate or amplify discussions of philosophical issues. In this article, the author argues that film and video can be used to philosophize as well as to teach philosophy. His own creative compositions, or video essays, exemplify his approach and outline a variety of techniques that he employs in his work. The author shows how the creative use of media can be not only a means to enhance instruction, but an extension of traditional literary methods of philosophical composition. (Contains 30 endnotes.)",

The idea of appreciative resistance draws on \"appreciative inquiry,\" an action research methodology based in a model of positive thought called the \"appreciative paradigm,\" and on ethics literature in environmental education.

The Outward Bound Canada College (OBCC) offers a variety of programs where students can earn credits towards their high school diploma. In 2002, OBCC began providing students with an integrated semester program that included extended expeditions, dog sledding, winter camping, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, kayaking and canoeing across Canada while completing a five-subject course load. Learning used an integrated curriculum approach in which subjects are overlapped to show their true interconnections; students and teachers rave about the benefits of this approach. This study used literature reviews, surveys, and interviews to triangulate data, thus providing a greater understanding of results and making conclusions more credible. An electronic survey was used to acquire information on the lifestyles of the 100 graduates of OBCC. The integrated semester was engaging, and learning expanded beyond course material. Some students thrived for the first time and felt a sense of accomplishment. The responses to the open-ended questions highlight the transformative capacity of integrated outdoor experiential education (OEE) programs such as OBCC.",

It was in this environment that Voyageur Wilderness Programme (VWP) was founded on Voyageur Island, Nym Lake, Quetico, Ontario, Canada, by Charlie Ericksen and Jean Goff Marantette. Charlie and Jean's great vision was influenced by their connection to the planet and world around them. Even after 48 years the mission remains the same: &quot;ecological education through wilderness experience.&quot; The goal is to give youth an appreciation and understanding of wilderness that will positively influence their connection to the planet. In 1986 Guy Savoie and family, friends of the late founders and descendants of Metis and French-Canadian voyageurs, took over the program. Inspired by the Savoie family's proud heritage, the program was further developed to highlight the lifestyle and history of the voyageurs as the first eco-travelers of the lakes, rivers, waterways and portages in this wilderness park.",

        "description":"In the author's fourth year of undergraduate studies at the University of Waterloo he had the opportunity to explore the benefits attained by children attending a summer camp by way of an academic literature review. The author worked with Dr. Troy Glover who has been commissioned by a group of camping associations to perform a study on the benefits realized by children who attend summer camps. The author's review focused on the literature regarding overnight or sleep-away camps. During this review the author realized that studies on the outcomes of summer camps dated as far back as 1909 (Stone, 1986) and covered topics as diverse as race relations within children's play (Moore, 2002) and the physical effects of attending summer camp on children with cystic fibrosis (Blau et al., 2002). The author divided the 26 studies he reviewed into four general themes: (1) sociological research that excludes the camp environment as a study variable; (2) medical research that examines medical interventions administered at specialized summer camps for youth with specific illnesses; (3) work experiences (e.g., how employment at summer camps benefits employees); and (4) benefits of camp for campers. The author was able to identify areas of both strengths and weaknesses in camping research, providing guidance for future studies. As a result of conducting this review he feels not only comfortable, but also confident, in telling parents that summer camp is beneficial for youth based on his personal experience and the amalgamation of the results of a number of studies. It will take a few more large-sample, longitudinal research studies that provide quantitative measurements of changes in a person's abilities, skills and self-perceptions, similar to Philliber Research Associates' (2005) ground-breaking study of 5,000 diverse families from 80 camps of varying characteristics and associations, before he will be comfortable and confident in telling parents that summer camp is academically proven to be of benefit to their children.",

The main goals of the program are to: (1) separate youth from the negative influences in their daily lives and place them in challenging but safe environments where they must communicate, cooperate and work as a team and, as a consequence, improve their behaviour and learn new skills; (2) help participants understand their pattern of self-defeating behaviour and learn new and effective coping skills; (3) promote therapeutic change through experiential learning, Challenge by Choice and group process activities; and (4) provide training in experiential education and adventure therapy for professionals. The centre offers various programs to achieve these goals: (1) the training program; (2) wilderness therapy; and (3) adventure therapy and experiential education.",

        "description":"Outdoor education--be it canoe tripping, adventure programs, field studies or anything else--is inherently risky. Outdoor educators deal with unpredictable settings and situations, where change is constant and outcomes are sometimes uncertain. In this naturalistic environment, their risk management procedures have the potential to break down and people can get hurt. It might be a change in the weather, staff fatigue, a lapse of judgment or just a freak accident. They may have written the best policies, set the highest standards and hired the most talented people but accidents can still happen. In this article, the author mentions the areas where, as an industry, outdoor educators excel: they have great policies and operating procedures, good standards and stellar people. But there are three more areas where he thinks they can improve. Specifically, he thinks they can do a better job training good decision makers, reporting and utilizing incident data, and providing adequate supervision that leads to proper and regular retraining. Their programs and facilities will benefit from a fresh approach to risk management. (Contains 1 footnotes.)",

The 5-year program (extended into a 6th) was funded in 1999 with a grant from the U.S. Department of Education: Technology Innovation Challenge Grant. The Rediscovery Project's &quot;touchstones&quot; include the historic record of challenges and encounters of Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery on their epic expedition, community studies highlighting 200 years of change along the Lewis and Clark Trail, and the development of technology-infused inquiry in teaching and learning. The program immersed 51 lead participant K-12 teachers in eight states along the Lewis and Clark Trail in activities designed to increase technology efficacy and facilitate the infusion of inquiry-based learning projects into their own classrooms. The participants are Lewis &amp; Clark Rediscovery Project fellows who were successfully mentored through online courses and in  summer workshops. Fundamental to the success of the project was the development of a model to mentor teachers in the field and to help facilitate outreach and peer mentoring of technology infusion across many districts. We have included in this review a description of the major Rediscovery professional development model strategies and activities, as well as lessons learned and emerging trends and movements in interactive online teaching and learning.

        "description":"It is no longer a question whether or not technology should be used in the classroom. The emphasis is ensuring that teachers use technology effectively to create new opportunities for students to learn and raise their achievement. The use of technology in the classroom requires teachers to be knowledgeable and competent in ICTs and to integrate them into the curriculum, align them with student learning goals, and use them to engage learners in a quest for meaningful academic development. This study was a survey designed to engage postgraduate inservice teachers from selected universities in the south-south geopolitical zone of Nigeria in self-assessment of core technology competence. There were 238 participants, including 108 male and 130 female teachers, who responded to a 61-item Likert-type questionnaire. The study was also designed to determine the professional development needs of the inservice teachers and their preferred mode of professional development. Results revealed that the majority of the inservice teachers lacked competencies in core technology areas, and they all asserted that they need extensive professional development in 17 skill areas in ICT and training in 10 competency areas. The inservice teachers preferred attendance at conferences/seminars, university courses, and mentoring as the major modes of training in ICT skills. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)",

Many teachers believe the only way to project the contents of a computer is onto an interactive whiteboard, but this is not true. Any computer can connect to a projector, and any software can be projected onto a wall.

In general, the teachers in this study focused on traditional characteristics of giftedness and did not tend to include characteristics associated with diverse gifted students in their theories. Comparisons of teachers with greater and fewer hours of training in gifted education showed no significant differences between the groups. However, there was also little consistency among the teachers in their graphic representations of their theories, suggesting that not all elementary classroom teachers define common characteristics of giftedness in the same way.

The approach includes cognitive/behavioral techniques as well as psychologically informed mentoring, coaching, and advising. Once a psychodynamic formulation was established, it was used to guide all subsequent therapeutic interventions. Three phases of psychotherapy can be recognized. In the first phase, patients addressed their guilt about being exceptionally endowed. They elaborated and organized a personal vision for their giftedness and found an appropriate venue for its expression. In the second phase, patients modulated their need for complete autonomy so they could collaborate more effectively with the therapist and others. In the third phase, patients were able to integrate their extracognitive abilities with their superior intellect. They learned more mature methods of conflict resolution and were able to employ all aspects of their gifted endowment more effectively.",

        "description":"Matthew Stagner and Jiffy Lansing chart developments in the field of child maltreatment and propose a new framework for preventing child abuse and neglect. They begin by describing the concept of investment-prevention as it has been applied recently in fields such as health care and welfare. They then explain how the new framework applies to maltreatment prevention, noting in particular how it differs from the traditional child protective services response to maltreatment. Whereas the traditional response aims to prevent a recurrence of maltreatment once it has already taken place, the new framework focuses on preventing maltreatment from occurring at all. Rather than identifying risk factors for maltreatment and addressing the problems and deficiencies of the primary caretaker, the new framework focuses on strengthening protective factors and building family and social networks to reinforce the ability of parents to care for their children. Whereas the orientation of the traditional child welfare service approach is legal and medical, the new framework has a more developmental and ecological orientation. It aims to build on the strengths children have at particular points of the life stage and enhance the social context of the child. Rather than putting families into the hands of unknown professionals who shuffle them from one program to another, including foster care, the investment-prevention model seeks to integrate professionals and paraprofessionals from the family's community into their everyday life, as well as to ensure an interconnected system of services. Finally, rather than seeking to minimize harm to the child, it aims to maximize potential--to strengthen the capacity of parents and communities to care for their children in ways that promote well-being. Researchers have struggled to define maltreatment, identify its causes, and assess its consequences and costs. In recent years, however, researchers have clarified the severe consequences of child maltreatment and highlighted several risk factors. They have also developed new prevention interventions based on a variety of theories explaining why maltreatment takes place. Stagner and Lansing conclude with a brief survey of these new prevention interventions. The task for researchers now, they say, is to conduct rigorous evaluations of the interventions to demonstrate the benefits of prevention. (Contains 80 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Fred Wulczyn explores how data on the incidence and distribution of child maltreatment shed light on planning and implementing maltreatment prevention programs. He begins by describing and differentiating among the three primary sources of national data on maltreatment. Wulczyn then points out several important patterns in the data. The first involves child development. Based on official reports, maltreatment rates are highest during certain periods of children's lives, especially infancy and adolescence. Bringing a new baby into the home, in particular, heightens stress and increases the risk of maltreatment by parents, who tend to be younger and less experienced as parents. These data patterns should help shape strategies that target these families. A second pattern in the data involves social context and the contribution of race and poverty to maltreatment. Children of color, for example, are much more likely than white children to be reported. Research, however, suggests that when the whites and minorities who are being compared live in a similar social context, disparities in maltreatment rates narrow to some extent. What scholars must examine more closely is the means by which community processes contribute to maltreatment. Thus, the question for researchers is not whether investments in communities are an important part of the prevention strategy, but rather what type of investment is most likely to replace what is missing in a given community. Wulczyn also explores substance abuse and maltreatment recurrence. He points out that substance abuse not only increases the risk that a parent will neglect a child but also appears to affect that child's experience in the child welfare system: when substance abuse is part of an allegation history, decisions affecting the child tilt in favor of deeper involvement with the system. Patterns of recurrence mirror those already described. Base rates of recurrence are about 9 percent but are higher for infants when allegations involve substance abuse and when children received services following the initial report. Wulczyn stresses that much more research remains before analysts understand the mechanisms that underpin these persistent patterns--knowledge that is essential to designing sound interventions.

        "description":"Deborah Daro and Kenneth Dodge observe that efforts to prevent child abuse have historically focused on directly improving the skills of parents who are at risk for or engaged in maltreatment. But, as experts increasingly recognize that negative forces within a community can overwhelm even well-intentioned parents, attention is shifting toward creating environments that facilitate a parent's ability to do the right thing. The most sophisticated and widely used community prevention programs, say Daro and Dodge, emphasize the reciprocal interplay between individual-family behavior and broader neighborhood, community, and cultural contexts. The authors examine five different community prevention efforts, summarizing for each both the theory of change and the empirical evidence concerning its efficacy. Each program aims to enhance community capacity by expanding formal and informal resources and establishing a normative cultural context capable of fostering collective responsibility for positive child development. Over the past ten years, researchers have explored how neighborhoods influence child development and support parenting. Scholars are still searching for agreement on the most salient contextual factors and on how to manipulate these factors to increase the likelihood parents will seek out, find, and effectively use necessary and appropriate support. The current evidence base for community child abuse prevention, observe Daro and Dodge, offers both encouragement and reason for caution. Although theory and empirical research suggest that intervention at the neighborhood level is likely to prevent child maltreatment, designing and implementing a high-quality, multifaceted community prevention initiative is expensive. Policy makers must consider the trade-offs in investing in strategies to alter community context and those that expand services for known high-risk individuals. The authors conclude that if the concept of community prevention is to move beyond the isolated examples examined in their article, additional conceptual and empirical work is needed to garner support from public institutions, community-based stakeholders, and local residents.

        "author":["Barth, Richard P."],
        "description":"Researchers have identified four common co-occurring parental risk factors--substance abuse, mental illness, domestic violence, and child conduct problems--that lead to child maltreatment. The extent to which maltreatment prevention programs must directly address these risk factors to improve responsiveness to parenting programs or can directly focus on improving parenting skills, says Richard Barth, remains uncertain. Barth begins by describing how each of the four parental issues is related to child maltreatment. He then examines a variety of parent education interventions aimed at preventing child abuse. He cautions that many of the interventions have not been carefully evaluated and those that have been have shown little effect on child maltreatment or its risk factors. Although some argue that parent education cannot succeed unless family problems are also addressed, much evidence suggests that first helping parents to be more effective with their children can address mental health needs and improve the chances of substance abuse recovery. Barth recommends increased public support for research trials to compare the effectiveness of programs focused on parenting education and those aiming to reduce related risk factors. Child welfare services and evidence-based parent training, says Barth, are in a period of transformation. Evidence-based methods are rapidly emerging from a development phase that has primarily involved local and highly controlled studies into more national implementation and greater engagement with the child welfare system. The next step is effectiveness trials. Citing the importance and success of multifaceted campaigns in public health policy, Barth discusses a multifaceted parenting campaign that has demonstrated substantial promise in several large trials. The goal of the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program is to help parents deal with the full gamut of children's health and behavioral issues. The campaign includes five levels of intervention, each featuring a different means of delivery and intensity of service. More broadly, Barth suggests that the evidence-based Triple P approach offers a general framework that could be used to guide the future evolution of parenting programs. (Contains 92 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Kimberly Howard and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn examine home visiting, an increasingly popular method for delivering services for families, as a strategy for preventing child abuse and neglect. They focus on early interventions because infants are at greater risk for child abuse and neglect than are older children. In their article, Howard and Brooks-Gunn take a close look at evaluations of nine home-visiting programs: the Nurse-Family Partnership, Hawaii Healthy Start, Healthy Families America, the Comprehensive Child Development Program, Early Head Start, the Infant Health and Development Program, the Early Start Program in New Zealand, a demonstration program in Queensland, Australia, and a program for depressed mothers of infants in the Netherlands. They examine outcomes related to parenting and child well-being, including abuse and neglect. Howard and Brooks-Gunn conclude that, overall, researchers have found little evidence that home-visiting programs directly prevent child abuse and neglect. But home visits can impart positive benefits to families by way of influencing maternal parenting practices, the quality of the child's home environment, and children's development. And improved parenting skills, say the authors, would likely be associated with improved child well-being and corresponding decreases in maltreatment over time. Howard and Brooks-Gunn also report that the programs have their greatest benefits for low-income, first-time adolescent mothers. Theorists and policy makers alike believe strongly that home visiting can be a beneficial and cost-effective strategy for providing services to families and children. If home-visiting programs are to have their maximum impact, service providers must follow carefully the guidelines mandated by the respective programs, use professional staff whose credentials are consistent with program goals, intervene prenatally with at-risk populations, and carry out the programs with fidelity to their theoretical models.

        "description":"Evidence linking alcohol and other drug abuse with child maltreatment, particularly neglect, is strong. But does substance abuse cause maltreatment? According to Mark Testa and Brenda Smith, such co-occurring risk factors as parental depression, social isolation, homelessness, or domestic violence may be more directly responsible than substance abuse itself for maltreatment. Interventions to prevent substance abuse-related maltreatment, say the authors, must attend to the underlying direct causes of both. Research on whether prevention programs reduce drug abuse or help parents control substance use and improve their parenting has had mixed results, at best. The evidence raises questions generally about the effectiveness of substance abuse services in preventing child maltreatment. Such services, for example, raise only marginally the rates at which parents are reunified with children who have been placed in foster care. The primary reason for the mixed findings, say Testa and Smith, is that almost all the parents face not only substance abuse problems but the co-occurring issues as well. To prevent recurring maltreatment and promote reunification, programs must ensure client progress in all problem areas. At some point in the intervention process, say Testa and Smith, attention must turn to the child's permanency needs and well-being. The best evidence to date suggests that substance-abusing parents pose no greater risk to their children than do parents of other children taken into child protective custody. It may be sensible, say the authors, to set a six-month timetable for parents to engage in treatment and allow twelve to eighteen months for them to show sufficient progress in all identified problem areas. After that, permanency plans should be expedited to place the child with a relative caregiver or in an adoptive home. Investing in parental recovery from substance abuse and dependence, the authors conclude, should not substitute for a comprehensive approach that addresses the multiple social and economic risks to child well-being beyond the harms associated with parental substance abuse.

        "author":["Finkelhor, David"],
        "description":"David Finkelhor examines initiatives to prevent child sexual abuse, which have focused on two primary strategies--offender management and school-based educational programs. Recent major offender management initiatives have included registering sex offenders, notifying communities about their presence, conducting background employment checks, controlling where offenders can live, and imposing longer prison sentences. Although these initiatives win approval from both the public and policy makers, little evidence exists that they are effective in preventing sexual abuse. Moreover, these initiatives, cautions Finkelhor, are based on an overly stereotyped characterization of sexual abusers as pedophiles, guileful strangers who prey on children in public and other easy-access environments and who are at high risk to re-offend once caught. In reality the population is much more diverse. Most sexual abusers are not strangers or pedophiles; many (about a third) are themselves juveniles. Many have relatively low risks for re-offending once caught. Perhaps the most serious shortcoming to offender management as a prevention strategy, Finkelhor argues, is that only a small percentage of new offenders have a prior sex offense record that would have involved them in the management system. He recommends using law enforcement resources to catch more undetected offenders and concentrating intensive management efforts on those at highest risk to re-offend. Finkelhor explains that school-based educational programs teach children such skills as how to identify dangerous situations, refuse an abuser's approach, break off an interaction, and summon help. The programs also aim to promote disclosure, reduce self-blame, and mobilize bystanders. Considerable evaluation research exists about these programs, suggesting that they achieve certain of their goals. Research shows, for example, that young people can and do acquire the concepts. The programs may promote disclosure and help children not to blame themselves. But studies are inconclusive about whether education programs reduce victimization. Finkelhor urges further research and development of this approach, in particular efforts to integrate it into comprehensive health and safety promotion curricula. Finkelhor also points to evidence that supports counseling strategies both for offenders, particularly juveniles, to reduce re-offending, and for victims, to prevent negative mental health and life course outcomes associated with abuse.

        "author":["Waldfogel, Jane"],
        "description":"The nation's child protection system (CPS) has historically focused on preventing maltreatment in high-risk families, whose children have already been maltreated. But, as Jane Waldfogel explains, it has also begun developing prevention procedures for children at lower risk--those who are referred to CPS but whose cases do not meet the criteria for ongoing services. Preventive services delivered by CPS to high-risk families, says Waldfogel, typically include case management and supervision. The families may also receive one or more other preventive services, including individual and family counseling, respite care, parenting education, housing assistance, substance abuse treatment, child care, and home visits. Researchers generally find little evidence, however, that these services reduce the risk of subsequent maltreatment, although there is some promising evidence on the role of child care. Many families receive few services beyond periodic visits by usually overburdened caseworkers, and the services they do receive are often poor in quality. Preventive services for lower-risk families often focus on increasing parents' understanding of the developmental stages of childhood and on improving their child-rearing competencies. The evidence base on the effectiveness of these services remains thin. Most research focuses on home-visiting and parent education programs. Studies of home visiting have provided some promising evidence. Little is as yet known about the effects of parent education. Waldfogel concludes that researchers have much more to learn about what services CPS agencies should expand to do a better job of preventing maltreatment. Some families, especially those with mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence problems, are at especially high risk, which suggests that more effective treatment services for such parents could help. Very young children, too, are at high risk, suggesting a potentially important role for child care--one area where the evidence base is reasonably strong in pointing to a potential preventive role. Although preventive services for the lower-risk cases not open for services with CPS are much more widespread today than in the past, analysts must explore what CPS agencies can do in this area too to ensure that they are delivering effective services.

        "description":"Is there anything that screams &quot;College!&quot; more than the local pizza joint? As a high school college counselor, the author has been on too many campus tours and sat in on too many information sessions to keep count. Honestly, they all tend to morph together. All good colleges have passionate, engaged students immersed in learning, intramural sports, undergraduate research, small classes, financial aid, opportunities for faith, study abroad, and diversity. What always stands out, however, are the many wonderful restaurants he visits on his trips. This past summer he visited colleges in New England and based many of his meals around the local college town pizza place. He also had some parameters to follow regarding pizza selection. First, the pizza had to be recommended by a local, preferably a student. Second, the restaurant had to be within walking distance to campus (within reason). Finally, no chains. For the author, the surprising taste of clam pizza or even enjoying a bad New York City slice in a perfect setting can bring back memories of a particular campus experience--the reason he goes on these visits in the first place. If he can tell a high school junior where to find a good pizza or some BBQ at any school from Auburn to Yale, then he has helped that student immediately find a friendly spot near campus. Sometimes a student's interaction with the college culture and environment is just as important as academics when searching for the right fit. On a four-state, six-college tour, a friendly spot provides plenty of comfort for mom, dad and junior.",

        "description":"The advent of the modern form of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), brought to bear by the combination of the Educational Testing Service (ETS) and Harvard's former president James Bryant Conant (Lemann 1999), was designed to promote the recognition of talent and intellect, wherever they may be found. Their aim was to provide greater educational access for academically gifted and accomplished students, requiring students at elite institutions to prove their worthiness by performance rather than merely by pedigree. Within a few short years, it began to clarify the distinction between social and intellectual elite. During the 1950s, use of the SAT grew rapidly. When the University of California adopted the exam in 1968, its expansion across the nation was solidified. In 1990, from a desire to move away from the idea that the test measures innate ability, its intent mid-century, the SAT changed its acronym to the Scholastic Assessment Test. This move marked a formal break from its early 1920s precursors that were forms of IQ tests. Then, faced with challenges to the claim that it truly measured achievement, in 1994 it removed the acronym entirely, keeping only the initials SAT. This article discusses the following: (1) how SAT is used in the present times; (2) the dawning and dominance of the importance of scoring; (3) the threat of SAT-optional movement; (4) the critiques within higher education of SAT-optional policies; and (5) the advocacy efforts made by Fair Test: The National Center for Fair and Open Testing in encouraging schools to adopt SAT-optional policies. A possible solution that addresses some major concerns about the SAT while utilizing its major strengths is also discussed.",

In particular, rank in high school graduating class, math SAT and verbal SAT were examined. Secondly, these three variables were examined as predictors of group membership for students retained in math and science, students who changed from mathematics and science with GPAs less than 2.0, and students who changed from math and science with GPAs equal or greater than 2.0. This study informs admission counselors about SAT and high school performance for would-be STEM majors.

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to identify the current practices and future plans for using technology in admission practices at four-year colleges and universities. This study collected data through an online survey. The survey was largely quantitative but also included several qualitative questions, and focused on 12 broad categories of technology. Each technology was further described by a total of 58 specific activities (such as: relationship building, information sharing, notification of acceptance, counseling, virtual campus tours, etc.) in order to get a more detailed understanding of the specific uses within the broad technical categories. These specific activities were derived from existing literature on e-recruiting practices. Participants were admission directors and representatives from a small collection of public and private four-year colleges and universities located throughout the United States whose voluntary participation was recruited through local/regional chapters of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO). Several themes are apparent from the results drawn from these 36 schools. First, all responding institutions use some form of technology in recruiting. This may be an indication of the prevalence of technology in recruiting or it may indicate institutions using technology in recruiting were more likely to participate in this study. Second, the highest use of technologies are associated with more established technologies such as school Web sites and email, rather than emerging technologies such as podcasts, vodcasts and virtual worlds. Third, technology is used primarily for one-way communication or information sharing. Finally, although there is a large amount of recruitment activities using technology, there are few institutions that perceive these activities as having a high Return on Investment (ROI).

The author contends that this bill uses impressive sounding buzz words and phraseology with which one can hardly disagree, but in essence it offers no new innovations or does nothing to improve the fundamental quality of education. This bill is not based on educational research and research-based theory. Instead, it is an illusion built upon ideological fallacies, nested within the narrow confines of a parochial paradigm, and sprinkled with a lot of I-think-isms. Sadly, NCLB will ultimately cost a great deal of money to implement and enforce; money that could have been spent on things that really matter such as books, smaller class sizes, professional development, early childhood education, child care, and parenting education. And in the end, students, schools, and teachers will be worse off and education will have taken a giant step backwards. The author stresses that if people want fundamental change in the quality of education, then they need to take a qualitative look at the teaching methodologies and curriculum used in schools and classrooms and make changes in the way they do education. This bill does nothing to address the quality of education. NCLB does not change how people go about the business of educating children. Instead, it promotes a test-and-measure mentality that serves only to create winners and losers.",

        "description":"A primary responsibility of elementary schools is to help children become independent readers. Once children have started decoding, teachers work hard to make sure that students have access to \"just right\" books--books that they can read with fluency, good understanding and at least 95% accuracy. Effective teachers support students by offering appropriate word analysis and comprehension strategies so that students can progress to increasingly challenging material. Despite intensive instruction, there are some students with specific learning disabilities who still do not and may never read with fluency. Although these students may have average or above average intelligence, some struggle through grade level texts at relatively slow speeds and without full comprehension. It is hard for these students to keep up with the large quantity of reading required when just using their eyes. They often get frustrated, some get lower grades, and some do give up. In this article, the author stresses that students who have learning disabilities and who continue to struggle with decoding deserve the opportunity to try listening to text. If listening to text enhances their fluency and comprehension, then such opportunities should be provided in all subjects including reading. Students with learning disabilities have the capacity to become independent readers.",

In this book, Vanier spells out several interconnected principles for promoting and practicing a curriculum of &quot;becoming human.&quot; Vanier's first principle is that &quot;all humans are sacred, whatever their culture, race, or religion, whatever their capacities or incapacities, and whatever their weaknesses or strengths may be.&quot; For Vanier, &quot;the belief in the inner beauty of each and every human being is... at the heart of all true education and at the heart of being human.&quot; According to Vanier, another principle for informing a curriculum of becoming human is that &quot;our world and our individual lives are in the process of evolving,&quot; and because we are always in process, &quot;maturity comes through working with others, through dialogue, and through a sense of belonging and a  searching together.&quot; Leggo states that school culture is often based on competition not collaboration, on a measure of excellence that renders many students mediocre, on a focus on academic or athletic accomplishments instead of emotional, spiritual, political, psychological, and philosophical growth. What is needed in schools, according to Leggo, is &quot;a commitment to investigating seriously and sincerely what it means to be human, to become human, to acknowledge the humanity of other humans, to know our ecological interconnections in the wide expanse of the earth, even the universe.&quot;",

        "description":"When establishing inclusive or whole schooling practices, the attitudes of students towards their peers with differing abilities to themselves is potentially a critical determinant in the success of schools to manage diverse student  populations. This research investigates any potential changes in peer attitudes following the inclusion of previously segregated students into a regular school setting. The target group for this study is all Year 8 (N=199) students at a middle school in regional Western Australia. The attitude of the Year 8 students towards students with disabilities is measured using the &quot;Peer Attitudes Toward the Handicapped Scale (PATHS).&quot; The PATHS questionnaire was administered at the beginning and end of Semester 1 in 2003. Teacher perspectives of student attitude are also assessed via a focus group discussion after the second PATHS administration. Analysis of variance of the pre-test data shows the frequency of participant's prior classroom contact with students with a disability to have a significant impact on acceptance. Gender differences at the pre-test stage also prove to be significantly different in several measures. After six months of the inclusion program, data trends and the focus group discussion indicate an increased acceptance of students with disabilities by their mainstream peers. The implications of these results and recommendations for future research are discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)",

This study's conceptual framework was grounded in teacher curriculum development (Ben-Peretz 1990; Remillard 1999; Craig 2006), curriculum implementation(Snyder, Bolin, and Zumwalt 1992; Randolph, Duffy, and Mattingly 2007), curriculum-making (Clandinin and Connelly 1992; Doyle 1992; Shawer 2003), student cognitive and affective change (Erickson and Schultz 1992; Craig 2001) and social constructivism (Vygotsky 1978; Wells 1999; Terwel 2005). The study made use of the qualitative paradigm at the levels of ontology (multiple curriculum realities, Jackson 1992), epistemology (interaction with rather than detachment from respondents) and methodology (idiographic methodology and instruments) (Guba and Lincoln 1994; Cohen, Manion, and Morrison 2000). Research design involved qualitative evaluation (Clarke 1999) as the research strategy and general interviews, pre- and post-lesson interviews, group interviews and participant observation. Grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss 1967; Strauss and Corbin 1998) was the data analysis approach. Based on work with English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers and mixed-nationality college students, the results indicated that classroom-level curriculum development improved student learning and motivation; whilst curriculum-transmission did not result in significant student learning or increase their motivation. The study provides recommendations for curriculum and school development and future research. (Contains 4 figures.)",

Statistical analyses of three assignments by 50 students indicated significant differences between CPR and TA feedback on student writing quality.

Students also progressed in CPR-generated measures of their writing and reviewing abilities. A separate analysis including 256 students found no significant differences between males and females.

To show the complexity and value of seeking to understand students' learning expectations, over 80 juniors and seniors at a state university participated in a survey wherein they identified five things that everyone should learn at college, and evaluated and described how those expectations related to their courses, faculty, and grades. The students' responses show that they have a wide range of learning objectives that fall unequally under three categories: Academic Content, Career/Academic Skills, and Life Skills. Student responses suggest that learning is often independent of courses and instructors, and that grades are not always indicative of what is learned in classes, suggesting that more could be done institutionally and in classrooms to better align what teachers intend to teach and what students expect to learn.

The goal of the current study is to consider whether contacting consistently absent students increases success in an undergraduate research methods course. Results of this classroom action study suggest that students view contacts positively and a majority stated that they were more likely to attend class following the contact. In regression analyses, however, net of other factors such as prior grade point average, contacts did not predict final grade percentage and D/F rate comparisons to a prior semester without contacts showed modest but not statistically significant improvements.

Through this creative process changes occurred in their assumptions and expectations about what is of value in teaching and relationships between themselves, their students, and the community. The ideas of philosopher Michel Serres are used to analyze the themes that emerged from this creative process. Specifically, I examine the relationships between three of Serres' key themes: (1) prepositions, (2) spaces &quot;in-between&quot;, and (3) noise, and how aesthetic forms of expression such as creating sculptures open alternative pathways for pre-service teachers to imagine or re-envision transformative pedagogies.

        "description":"This study investigated whether undergraduate teacher education students were prepared to teach their students in both an academically stimulating and culturally sensitive way. During the fall of 2003, student teachers were asked to complete two open-ended questions about diversity. The students were working on certificates in either the preschool through grades 4 generalist or bilingual programs. A total of 56 students completed the questionnaire. We identified 16 categories of ideas, experiences and/or activities that the preservice teachers said they would use to create diverse opportunities in their classrooms. Multicultural books were mentioned most followed by visual aids. Most of the responses were brief and not fully developed. While Banks' levels of multicultural awareness were not evident or mentioned, students had some of their own ideas on how to integrate diversity in the classroom that at least met Banks' contributions levels and, in some cases, the additive levels (Banks, 2003).

        "description":"Critical thinking skills are crucial for both academic and everyday life. This paper presents the author's Text Analysis Matrix (TAM), a model for developing skills for the critical examination of texts. The TAM guidelines involve finding and clarifying the main claims of a text, discovering and assessing arguments, uncovering the implications for thinking and for action of the claims made in a text, and, finally, looking at the social and political impact of a text in the form of a critique. Results of the application of the TAM with an introductory Ethics course indicated more sophisticated arguments and more awareness of the broad implications of one's beliefs, as well as a greater awareness of social and political critique, at the end of the semester than at the beginning.

I begin to fill the research gap by examining two of the most salient characteristics that structure faculty dynamics and everyday lives--gender and years of experience--and four activities generally agreed to be indicators of the SoTL. Guided by identity theory in tandem with recent data on the characteristics and trends of higher education faculty in the U.S., I find that female faculty are more likely than their male counterparts to engage in the SoTL and that this gender gap increases with teaching experience. The data come from 2001-2002 survey data on 85 faculty at a large public research-intensive university in the Northwest. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)",

        "description":"Through email correspondence and interviews with former students the author explores how the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning can serve as a way to reflect upon philosophy and pedagogy in an intercultural communication course. Key lessons of intercultural competence from former students and how these lessons have impacted their professional and or personal lives are shared. The essay includes an assessment of how issues of diversity and intercultural competence from former students can be implemented in the classroom. Questions that draw from the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning that challenge and sustain teaching and learning are posed. (Contains 2 footnotes.)",

        "description":"Public relations curriculum often incorporates professional experience for progressive skill development. In the traditional public relations (PR) campaigns course, students typically research, develop, and implement a strategic campaign for a community organization as the client. Service learning is an effective pedagogical approach for the PR campaigns course with value-added learning outcomes, such as critical thinking and civic engagement. Adapting a National Society of Experiential Education (NSEE) best practices approach helps integrate service and reflection components as learning components. The instructional framework presented in this article combines service and reflection principles with course and campaign planning, implementation, and evaluation. Using the best practices framework as foundational scaffolding, instructors can strategically select elements from the framework to build a customized course plan.",

The program has its theoretical basis in the Kolb Experiential Learning Cycle (Kolb, 1983), combined with principles of collaborative learning and a philosophical understanding of teaching in higher education. An action research study was conducted to investigate the lecturers' perceptions of the program, with a particular focus on how support could be provided to them through a combined model of learning. As a core of the program is the importance of developing a personal philosophy of teaching, this was considered an integral aspect of the study. Philosophical perspectives are key to successful curriculum design in this context because values and beliefs affect the development of curriculum at various levels and it is important for program participants to be able to defend their own thinking and principles.

        "description":"A large body of research demonstrates the incredible power of initial conceptions, scripts, and stereotypes that result from our naive theories. Prior knowledge compatible with information introduced by instructors enhances encoding and retrieval, but hinders learning when in conflict with it. Theories and facts contradicting existing beliefs are conveniently misinterpreted, treated as insignificant, or taken as valid only within the confines of classrooms. Belief perseverance--clinging to explicitly discredited beliefs--is ubiquitous to the point of serving as the ultimate evidence of the feebleness of our mind. Standard explanations in terms of supporting beliefs and affective-motivational components are partial at best. This paper proposes an explanatory model that illuminates the cognitive-adaptive sources of perseverance, demonstrating its inevitability given the general principles of economy and equilibrium that govern brain operations, the naive theories we generate to make sense of the world, and the heuristics we employ to meet adaptive goals.

Providing academic content alone may not provide the problem-solving skills necessary for practice in a complex world in which practitioners must analyze, evaluate, and revise knowledge. Thus, reflective process becomes a core skill for functioning effectively in a diverse and complex practice environment. Analysis of data from focus groups with social work students is presented. Implications for using reflective writing are discussed as a pedagogical tool for preparing students for professional practice.",

We compared students who received a handshake to those who did not at the first class meeting and evaluated teaching skills, instructor's ability to motivate student interest, and instructor's support of students as a function of touch group and instructor gender. Our findings revealed significantly higher ratings for female instructors than for male instructors when they shook hands, with these differences specific to ratings of instructor skills and instructor's motivation of students. In addition, students with whom male professors shook hands actually rated their professors lower on teaching skill and ability to motivate than those with no handshake. Thus, female professors may establish immediacy through the touch of a handshake, but male professors should avoid this seemingly innocuous touching of students.

Although they will continue their growth and development in many aspects of their lives during this time, perhaps a most critical, but often ignored, attribute for them to develop is resiliency, the ability to bounce back from difficulties. This article examines the findings from a phenomenological study of eleven students who participated in resiliency development education (RDE) as first semester post secondary students. The data confirmed that, when taught through the pedagogy of storytelling, students are able to use stories of their experiences and those of others to shape not only their perceptions and choices, but also behaviors and characteristics reflected in resilient individuals.

On a social validity questionnaire, most participants reported a preference for answering study guide questions because that condition better prepared them for quizzes.

Analysis of the data yielded 6 large categories of turning point events, including instrumental (discussion of grade; discussion of course assignment, course content, course more generally; discussion of college, major, independent study, and/or internships; discussion of course policy/rule), \"personal\" (discussion of coursework and personal information; discussion of common interest; compliment; invitation; name used), \"rhetorical\" (lecture topic or claim; teaching style), \"ridicule/discipline,\" \"locational,\" and \"other person.\" As the first of a series of studies on relational turning point events between teachers and students, the current study presents new insight into the literature on relational turning points and the larger body of literature on teacher-effectiveness.

Results indicate that students with both physical and learning disabilities had graduation rates that were virtually identical to those of nondisabled students, although students with disabilities took approximately one semester longer to graduate. When average grades and course pass rates were examined, students with disabilities generally did at least as well, and in some cases significantly better than their nondisabled peers. The overall trend for grades and course pass rates was for students with learning disabilities/attention deficit disorder (ADD) to have similar or slightly poorer outcomes than the nondisabled sample, and for students with all other disabilities to have slightly superior outcomes. Males had poorer results than females with respect to all indicators. This was true for students both with and without disabilities.",

However, the procedures were not as successful at attracting students who were at risk for academic failure. Only 12% of the target students completed the first intervention while 55% of the target students completed the computerized tutorial. Participation in the computerized intervention was enough to markedly reduce the number of failing grades earned by the class as a whole. Additions and alterations to the interventions are proposed to extend their efficacy. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)",

This study examined the relationship of metacognitive knowledge monitoring (MKM) to classroom performance. Eighty-four undergraduate students in an introductory educational psychology class completed ten weekly in-class tests in which they were allowed to choose test questions. Students were asked to identify the number of hours they studied, their level of confidence, and to predict their test results after completing the test but before it was graded. High achieving students were: more accurate at predicting their test results; more realistic in their goals; more likely to adjust their confidence in-line with their test results; and more effective in choosing test questions to which they knew the answers. The study supports the relationship of metacognitive knowledge monitoring to self-regulated learning and academic success. (Contains 1 table, 1 figure, and 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"The increasing use of technology to meet the vast educational needs of our expanding world has led to heightened concerns about learning experiences within educational environments that are removed from the immediate purview of instructors (Duffy & Kirkley, 2004). Recent calls for use of more collaborative environments in which students interact with their instructors as well as with fellow students, have become more pronounced because of the purported learning benefits for students (Bonk, 2002). Constructivism, a theory of learning that is based on collaboration and interactions, provides such an environment (Jonassen, 1991). We report on the experiences of one professor who maintained a constructivist approach while teaching a foundation course in education (classroom learning theory) in a distance education setting. Emphasized are the challenges associated with creating the appropriate conditions for learning when moving from the face-to-face interactions of the regular classroom to the setting of compressed video. The implications of the medium for her role as facilitator, the establishment of a learning community, techniques of questioning and inquiry, and group collaboration are addressed. The impact of the medium and the greater cultural diversity of the distance education classes on how the tenets of constructivism are manifested and experienced by the students is also discussed.",

For decades, Americans have come to expect a diploma to do at least two things: (1) offer a chance at jobs that support a family; and (2) qualify its holder for entrance into the military. But today, most young people and their parents also expect it to open the door to postsecondary education, whether directly after high school or later to advance their careers. Young people understand the relationship between education and earnings better than anyone. Regardless of the path they initially choose, these young people are gambling on the same thing--that their diploma will prepare them to succeed. But it is not exactly a safe bet. Despite sky-rocketing college-going rates, all but a few states still consider college-preparatory courses to be \"electives.\" Neither are the skills and content needed for further education typically reflected in state high school assessments. In this article, the author looks at the implications of this mismatch for young people. What does the labor market hold for young people with varying levels of education? What does it take to succeed in college compared to the demands of work in a rapidly changing marketplace? How do today's high school requirements and course-taking patterns stack up against those needs? Finally, the author examines the following question: what can educators do to assure that all, rather than just some, of the young people are adequately prepared for the future?

        "author":["Knowlton, Dave S."],
        "description":"Because rapid prototyping results in the quick development of curriculum, materials, and processes, it is a form of design that could be particularly useful to professors in higher education. Yet, literature documenting the use of rapid prototyping in higher education is scarce. This paper offers a case example of rapid prototyping being used as a design process. After presenting the case, the author points to necessary considerations for other faculty members who are considering using rapid prototyping. These considerations include the need to gain perspective on the roles of instructional strategies and computers within teaching and learning processes, understand the distinction between traditional research rigor and design rigor, and the importance of approaching design systematically.

A quasi-experimental design using student case studies and non-random survey methods was used to explore instructors' perceptions of students' social integration, academic and occupational skill attainment, and postschool occupational employability. Significant effects were found for gender, age, and years in current position concerning students' fit socially, having similar academic attainment compared to others, and having the potential to be employed in the full range of jobs in the occupational area. Implications for future research and CTE training are discussed. (Contains 9 tables.)",

However, many teacher candidates are unable to successfully develop conceptual level lesson plans and some are unable to differentiate between skills and concepts. The purpose of this study was to enhance the conceptual understanding of teacher candidates and in turn help to develop their understanding of the learning process. This was accomplished by presenting the candidates with ideas concerning conceptual learning in a way that facilitated more meaningful learning and higher-level thinking. From survey analysis and evaluation of course projects, this method seems to achieve the goal of breaking down the cognitive barriers and allowing teacher candidates to conceptualize the difference between instruction that focuses on skills and instruction that focuses on conceptual understanding.

Experience in online courses had a statistically significant effect on online students' perceptions of social presence. Students' social presence scores did not have a significant effect on their learning outcomes, perhaps due to the small amount of variation in learning outcomes.

Answers to the questions are shown through graphs, charts, and tables complemented by short explanatory text. The report is divided into three sections: a national picture of children and students with disabilities served under Parts C and B; individual profiles of states that summarize selected aspects of special education in each state; and data tables that show states' ranking regarding exiting and educational environments for Part B and early childhood intervention and settings for Part C.

Forty low-verbal ability students and 40 high-verbal ability students (as measured by SAT scores) were chosen for the study and randomly assigned to experimental or control groups. The experimental groups received the reciprocal teaching intervention, whereas the control groups did not. The instructor modeled four listening comprehension activities: summarizing, self-questioning, clarifying, and predicting, and guided the students in performing the comprehension activities. Six lectures were presented to all subjects in both experimental and control groups. Lectures were followed by comprehension tests. Results showed that low-verbal ability subjects receiving the reciprocal teaching method significantly increased their lecture comprehension. These significant increases were maintained over time.

Some research has addressed this issue and recommends multiple strategies for overcoming the problem of student noncompliance. Much of this research, however, treats the problem as exclusively student-centered. This paper presents a small case study designed to engage explanations for student noncompliance and to reflect on strategies used by faculty to incorporate reading assignments into their course design. This study suggests that more attention be placed on the reciprocal nature of the problem and how faculty behavior can contribute to reading apathy. How faculty members conceive, integrate and utilize assigned reading in the classroom does affect how students respond and take responsibility for the practice.",

In order to build a new approach for our Technical/Professional Writing classes, we assessed our individual teaching practices and past experiences, studied current scholarship on teaching writing, and conducted research on technical writing in our local community. Using this information we developed a teaching model that involves students in discovering/establishing the class content, creating time frames/project plans, selecting tools to complete projects, contributing to evaluation  criteria, and working  with the local community. The success of this approach requires students to reconstruct their roles and their attitudes toward the dynamics within the classroom. It also requires the teacher to rethink his/her role in the classroom, sense of authority, and perceptions of how knowledge is created. These changes, however, are not achieved without challenges and struggle. While our programmatic approach has proven successful, we found the need to help students view struggle as a normal part of the decision making processes that writers experience.",

An essay covering three aspects of Native American history was evaluated for content and critical thinking. Significant differences were seen between classes in describing cultural differences that lead to conflict between Native Americans and Euro American settlers. Additionally, regardless of instructor approach, many students tended to maintain common stereotypical views of Native American cultures. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)",

Discussion revolves around how the course was conceptualized, the procedures and protocols created, engagement and collaborations developed, learnings and outcomes experienced by students and faculty, and resulting works-in-progress and performances. The study finds that students benefited from collecting ethnographic data and creating their own particular performances--especially in response to stories and data from persons unlike themselves. This study suggests that iterative and responsive teaching that spans multiple modes of teaching and experience impacts students' learning--especially in an arts-based oriented teaching and learning environment.

This study aims to explore the ways in which traditional and newer EST designs relate to quality of life, using factor analysis on Colombian data for the period 1997-2000. Results for the Colombian case show that level-based non-mechanistic approaches are better at describing and promoting the relationship between educational indicators and quality of life assessments.

Data were collected from participant journals, an open questionnaire and dialogic email communications. The study revealed that the workplace is an important influence upon the nature and quality of the learning experience largely through issues relating to finance, time management and technology or other resources. Learning, in turn, influences the workplace with individuals operating as educational change agents applying their learning about student centred methods to classroom practice. The findings are likely to be of interest to both Australian and Thai educators as postgraduate distance programs continue to be marketed in Thailand.",

        "description":"The aims of this study were considered under three headings. The first was to elicit misconceptions that students had about the terms &quot;solute&quot;, &quot;solvent&quot; and &quot;solution.&quot; The second was to understand how students' prior learning affected their misconceptions. The third was to determine if students were able to make a connection between their own knowledge and chemistry in everyday life. To achieve these aims, a paper and-pencil test composed of 18 open-ended questions was designed, but only four questions related to chemical solutions and their components. The test was administered to 441 students from different grades that ranged from Grade 7 with students aged 13-14 years to Grade 10 with students aged 16-17 years. As a result of the analyses undertaken, it was found that students' misunderstanding about the concepts of dissolution and conservation of mass influenced their knowledge about the these terms. Moreover, it was found that students had difficulties making connections between their knowledge and life experiences. Furthermore, it was elicited that the examples given by most of students under investigation were limited to particular solid-liquid and liquid-liquid solutions; however, some students in the upper grades referred to solid-solid and gas-gas solutions such as air, nitrogen and oxygen (N[subscript 2]-O[subscript 2]), and alloy composition. Therefore, it was concluded that although students' conceptions and misconceptions were acquired and stored, they occurred without ostensible links between everyday life and school experiences. Furthermore, depending on the instruction students received and over time, it was deduced that their conceptual understanding showed a steady increase from Grade 7 to Grade 10, except in the case of Item 1. In light of results of this study, some suggestions for future instruction were made. (Contains 6 tables.)",

In 1980, there were more female graduates in the humanities than male. University women could study most of the same subjects as their male counterparts except those, which might lead to their mixing with men.

Data were collected in Zimbabwe from policy documents and program implementers (technical teachers, teacher educators, and program managers) using a questionnaire. Lack of clarity and differences between the purpose as viewed by implementers and that in official documents were found.

        "description":"This article discusses the adjustment of ten Asian-born university students to the academic culture of an English-speaking university in the United States. Findings from a case study reveal an instrumental role played by compatriot networks in the students' adjustment process. Spindler's cultural therapy model provides the lens for an anthropological understanding of the role of the co-national networks in the participants' adjustment to the new school culture. Implications of this study are two-fold: they indicate the need for universities to revise their orientation programs for international students, especially Asian students, whose home country school practices differ from the English-speaking school cultures. It is also suggested that cultural mediation upon arrival is a more viable alternative than institutional remediation of academic difficulties experienced by Asian students that come from cross-cultural maladjustment.

        "description":"This study was motivated by the need to redress the problem of decline in the quality of education in Nigerian schools. Although there are several factors that influence success in the learning situation, it is contended in this paper that the provision of the other conditions of learning may not have marked impact on successful learning if the learner is not intellectually prepared and fit for studies at that particular level. Selection is required in order to identify suitably qualified candidates for admission or promotion. In Nigeria, everybody wants to go to the university and earn a degree, including those who do not have the capacity to do so. The issue of selection therefore, seems to be controversial. This study sought to find out the perception of Nigerian parents and teachers of selection as a factor of quality in the curriculum process. A 13-item four-point scale questionnaire was administered to a sample of 2000 parents and 1000 teachers on this subject. While parents and teachers were to a large extent in agreement on the importance of quality education in any society as a guarantee for the effectiveness of that education, they disagreed on selection as a means to it. The teachers were better disposed to the practice of selection in the curriculum process than the parents. The paper recommends the need for the government to insist on standards in the admission and promotion processes in the schools. (Contains 2 tables.)",

Participants included 6,811 (3,547 women and 3,264 men) young adults (mean age = 20.3 years) who were in Year 9 when the study began. In the analysis, the AM Statistical Software was used to take into account the design features of the sample. The results indicated (a) that family background and adolescents' aspirations combined to have large associations with young adults' educational attainment, (b) there were gender differences in the linear and curvilinear nature of relationships among family background, adolescents' aspirations, and young adults' attainment, and (c) for young adults from lower social status families there were ethnic group differences in attainment at all aspiration levels, whereas for young adults from higher social status families, ethnic group differences in attainment were minimised at high aspiration levels.

        "description":"This article examines the factors fostering and inhibiting student achievement in Germany and Spain at the 15-year-old level in the OECD Programme on International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2000. Both countries performed significantly below the OECD average not only in Reading but also in Mathematics and Science on this occasion. Since the two countries are similar in average levels of student achievement, it is of interest to consider whether similar patterns exist in the ways in which factors operate to influence student achievement in these two countries. Preliminary analyses were carried out with PLSPATH and subsequent two-level models were analysed separately using Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) software. Some similar factors influenced reading achievement in the two countries, but substantial differences in explaining reading achievement were also found. Much of the difference between the two systems arise from the large components of variance in Germany at the school level and in Spain at the between student within school level. Thus efforts to improve reading achievement should focus in Germany on low performing schools, whereas, in Spain remedial programs should be directed towards increased assistance at the individual student level in many of the schools.

Altogether, 340 boys and girls (156 gifted and 184 non-gifted students) from four high schools in Shiraz (two high schools for gifted and two for non-gifted students) took part. Although there was no significant difference between gifted and non-gifted students in stressors, gifted students showed significantly more cognitive reactions to stressors. Boys had higher scores in frustration than girls, but their scores on emotional reactions were lower than those of the girls. There was an interaction between sex and type of student (gifted versus non-gifted). Moreover, there was a significant negative relationship between father's education and the experience of frustration in gifted students. Finally, the gifted students showed significantly higher self-esteem than the non-gifted. (Contains 2 tables.)",

        "description":"Embedded in the contemporary issue of gifted education is the contentious notion of ability grouping. The debate surrounding appropriate educational provision for gifted students continues to argue the cognitive and affective influences of ability grouping on gifted students. While recognising the various forms of intellectual giftedness, analysis of the research about mathematically gifted students, especially during adolescence is scarce and underrepresented (Diezmann and Watters, 2002). Adolescent boys' education coupled with a priority for mathematical giftedness is paramount in a time of technological development and advancing global partnerships for future sustainability. Recent Australian Senate Inquiries into Gifted Education (Collins, 2001), Declining Rates of Achievement and Perspectives of Adolescent Boys (Trent, 2001), and Boys' Education (Australian House of Representatives, 2002) highlight the interconnected relevance of examining mathematically gifted adolescent boys' education.

The comprehensive musicianship approach is closely related to Gestalt psychology in that music is approached as a totality, with a concern for constituent parts and how they relate to the whole (Willoughby, 1971). The concept of integration is central to the philosophy of comprehensive musicianship. By relating and integrating the various areas of music, integration allows for a logical and meaningful learning experience. The comprehensive musicianship approach brings balance and focus to the disparate areas of music, allowing students to pursue and explore all aspects of music and their interrelationships (Willoughby, 1971). The intent of the comprehensive musicianship approach is to integrate and synthesise all areas of music including music history, music literature, music theory, performance and pedagogy into a unified whole (Spearman, 1979; MENC, 1965).

The presented examples show that mathematically gifted elementary students stand out in the ability to work systematically and quickly, getting an insight into the problem's mathematical structure. Additionally these children stand out in their high ability to verbalise and to explain their solutions. In comparison to non-gifted children these qualities in problem solving show significance.

It was conjectured that these prior results would change if subjects were sampled from a much younger age pool, and so, a test instrument (the Integrated Creativity Test) to measure creative thinking ability and creative personality was developed and validated. About 1,000 preschoolers aged 4 to 5 years old were sampled nationwide to verify the relationship between creative thinking ability and creative personality. Then the ICT was administered. The relations between creative thinking ability and creative personality were analysed according to total scores and factors.

Such characteristics may include curiosity, advanced mathematical skills, large vocabulary, acute sense of humour. This paper examines the demands that humour, as a creative activity, makes on cognitive and social development. It is derived from research that includes interviews with renowned professional humorists and examination of their work. The production of humour requires a sophisticated cognitive ability in order to relate multilevel disparate concepts. Furthermore, to amuse an audience, a humorist needs a high level of empathy, the ability to see the world from another's point of view, and a sensitivity to people's feelings and beliefs. On the other hand, much humour is cruel, and class clowns are seriously disruptive. An understanding of humour in the context of social and cognitive development reconciles these contrasts and suggests appropriate responses.",

        "description":"&quot;Talent in the New Millennium&quot; was a research study into gifted education, conducted over a two-year period in 68 centres and schools in three disparate regions of New Zealand. Using questionnaires, oral interviews and sample case studies, the study drew input from educators of the gifted, from children and students identified as gifted, and from the parents and caregivers of children thus identified. Through this input, the study sought information on how giftedness popularly is defined; the demographic profile of those identified as gifted; the range of strategies used to address the needs of those identified as gifted. From the identified gifted and their parents/caregivers, the study sought evaluative comment about these strategies. The study's findings highlight areas of strength, potential and deficit in gifted education in New Zealand. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)",

Many factors are associated with a successful classroom experience for the gifted child, and the classroom teacher plays a vital role in that success. The teacher influences not only the academic side of classroom life, but the personal one as well. There is a growing research interest in the interpersonal relationship between teacher and child and how it affects the child's experience in the classroom (Pianta, 1992, Kesner, 2000), but this research has not been systematically applied to the study of gifted children.",

Comparison between the groups has been made. Findings indicate that social environment has a significant impact on the non-gifted adolescents while its influence on the gifted is comparatively slight. The Year 1993 sample shows that the gifted adolescents have a more positive academic self-concept than the non-gifted group while Year 2003 sample reflects inconsistency with the former result.

        "description":"From my study in the field of gifted education it became apparent that published works related to perceptions of what constitutes giftedness began with a narrow view focused on achievement in intelligence tests and in the latter part of the twentieth century developed to a much broader view. In the New Zealand context the work of Bevan-Brown (1996, 1999) with New Zealand Maori provided a new and different perspective on special abilities or giftedness. This pioneering work was the inspiration for my study. As principal of David Henry School in Tokoroa, New Zealand for nine and a half years I worked in a community with both high New Zealand Maori and Cook Islands Maori populations. I began to wonder whether Cook Islands Maori had similar perceptions of giftedness to New Zealand Maori and whether their perceptions were different in New Zealand by comparison with the Cook Islands. I also wondered how the Cook Islands Maori children who were plainly gifted in the context of their own culture could be better nurtured by the school in order to foster and develop their gifts. Thus my study was born. (Contains 1 table.)",

Those students identified by teachers to be gifted in non-academic areas but disaffected and occasionally disruptive (n=20) were compared with the other students (n=79) in the four measures. Analysis of variance showed that students found to be disaffected and disruptive did not differ from the other students in self-concept and their effort goal orientation. However, they scored significantly higher in their self-perceptions of originality and imagination. The results cast doubt not only on the assumption of the weaknesses of disaffected students, but also challenge the appropriateness of the school curriculum to suit the needs of some gifted children.

Although resource allocation decisions are based on many factors, administrators must always consider the financial implications of their decisions. To that end, this paper illustrates one approach that administrators can use to estimate the expected monetary value of their educational programs. The paper begins by providing a brief overview of the relevant cost and revenue factors that are involved in resource allocation decisions. The paper then illustrates how a private, regional university used this approach to estimate the monetary value of an ongoing international education program.

School inputs include per pupil non-teaching expenditure, pupil teacher ratio, teaching experience and instructional hours. On the other hand, environmental inputs consist of home educational resources index and an out-of-school study time index. Gender influence is represented by the percentage of female students in a class. From the study, teaching experience can be dropped from the model because it does not give any additional explanatory power. Marginal products and marginal rates of substitution are calculated and it was found that schools with low-level out-of-school study time can compensate for these deficiencies by having extra instructional hours.

The analysis reveals that the policy is inadequate to impact positively on the Nigerian education system, and that the philosophical frame of reference is market driven. The policy places little emphasis on the integration and infusion of ICT in the country's education system. Policy implications and suggestions are offered to ensure maximum use of ICT potentials in the Nigerian school system.",

Dramatic growth and development in the Arabian Gulf region over the past two decades has made fundamental changes in the education system necessary. There has been a shift in focus from more traditional education and delivery methods, to contemporary approaches to support student learning with the emphasis on preparing students for careers in the knowledge economy. These changes in higher education, and its widespread provision, have impacted on the UAE and its economy in particular. This paper reviews the provision of higher education, its role in the rapidly developing society and economy of the UAE, and how the community is contributing to and benefiting from emerging partnerships.

The study examines the general rise of educational institutions, particularly private ones, where the average number of students is considerably less than in the state institutions of higher learning. There has also been an increase in the number of students in state-paid and private higher education institutions. This is discussed, together with the fact that 75 per cent of students are involved in the system of paid education in the Republic of Armenia. For that reason, the financing of education is a serious problem for a considerable part of population at the present time. Gender issues that are involved in professional higher education are examined. The structure of financing higher education and problems unique to the Republic are also considered. Some measures for the further development of a financing and lending system in higher education are suggested, particularly the creation of an educational lending system that would enable more people to study for degrees in the higher education sector with the assistance of student loans.

        "description":"As a democratic country which aims at nurturing and sustaining its envied democracy, organisations in Botswana are expected and encouraged to build and maintain democratic structures and principles. In September 1993, the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Botswana and the then British Overseas Development Agency (ODA) launched an ambitious joint venture, the Secondary Schools Management Development Project (SSMDP) whose main objective was to raise management standards in secondary schools through the democratisation of the structures which had hitherto been authoritarian. This paper is based on a quantitative study undertaken in a number of randomly selected secondary schools from all over the country after a decade of the launch. The paper evaluates the extent to which the SSMDP was effective in transforming the management of secondary schools in Botswana since 1993. However, it first gives a background by reviewing relevant literature in an attempt to showcase the nature of schools as organisations. (Contains 6 tables.)",

However, low level of literacy and education is one of the major challenges facing most of the underdeveloped countries. Active community involvement and participation has emerged as an effective mechanism in improving the sustainable level of education in many of these countries. This paper analyses the crucial aspects of community participation in education and supports its importance by reviewing the basic framework and outcome of Janshala--a Government of India-UN program in Jharkand, India. Though community participation is not a panacea for addressing all barriers, the Janshala experience in Jharkhand and cross country experiences involving community in educational programs indicate that the active involvement of the community has facilitated in identifying community specific education issues and formulating effective strategies to address those barriers by mobilising resources within the community.

        "description":"Criticisms have recently been voiced of constructivism, the leading metaphor of human learning since the 1970s. Inspired by inconsistencies in interpretations of constructivism in current literature, we examine the underlying epistemological beliefs of popular constructivist theories and their criticisms. We find that popular constructivist claims and criticisms, instead of being based on contrasting philosophical ideas, are similarly grounded on the dualist separatism of the human mind and the external world. We then present our interpretation of Vygotsky's historical-dialectical-monist philosophy, through discussions of Vygotskyan concepts including social environment of learning, the role of language, and individual consciousness. The paper concludes that confusions about Vygotsky's theory often arise from concepts taken literally and from the lack of appreciation of the general philosophical orientation underpinning his works.",

Mathematics textbooks also play an important role in environmental education, because environmental problems have two distinct features: the quality and the quantity of environmental resources. It is well known that as students go higher in their education they often show a negative attitude toward mathematics. One possible reason for this is that mathematics contains many abstract concepts. Another reason is that students think that mathematics has nothing to do with their everyday needs. In this study research is conducted on the frequency of environmental topics in selected Greek mathematics textbooks. The results show that there are some environmental topics, but the way they appear does not help students forming positive attitudes towards the environment. (Contains 1 footnote and 4 tables.)",

        "description":"In this study the adjustment process in a designated group of expatriates, (teachers), who have severed ties with their home country and employer is investigated. Based on existing literature, the value of self-efficacy and flexibility on the adjustment process was explored. It was hypothesised that adjustment would result in reduced turnover intention, increased life satisfaction, and higher job satisfaction. Results revealed the significance of self-efficacy but failed to reveal a significant relationship between flexibility and adjustment. As a result of this study, there are some clear implications for individuals and organisations involved in the expatriation process. From a personal point of view, those who score high on scales which measure self-efficacy would appear to be the ones most likely to find success within the international relocation process. From an organisational perspective, the accurate measurement of self-efficacy may provide valuable information to the employer regarding those applicants that have the greatest probability of adjustment. Given that this study looked exclusively at educators in its sampling, the implications for the staff of faculties of education, who are seeing increasing numbers of their graduates accept postings in foreign jurisdictions, are significant.

        "description":"Schooling for girls is a relatively recent process in Booni Valley, a remote mountainous village in Chitral District, Pakistan. It is impacting greatly upon the lives of the women. This study has taken an ethnographic perspective and has assumed that an understanding of women's schooling requires a detailed, in-depth account of women's actual experiences in a specific cultural setting. The women in the study perceive their local language, Khowar, as having little value and place great importance upon learning Urdu and English, the official languages of Pakistan. The women also perceive schooling to increase their mobility and independence and to gain access to employment. However, gender structures are deeply rooted. The women encounter many barriers which restrict them from participating in many activities in the community. (Contains 5 footnotes.)",

Citizenship should be central to the formation of viable civil societies that claim a tangible stake in national public spaces in post-Cold War Africa. These and related topics are discussed relative to new possibilities that could lead to the full realisation of the concept as well as the practice of enfranchised citizenship and inclusive social development in aspiring democracies in the Sub Saharan African context. The complexity of the development &quot;problematique&quot; that Sub-Saharan Africa is facing is unique in that it is multi-dimensional, but above all else, politically located. It is, therefore, central to our discussions here that to correct the continent's current schemes of underdevelopment, pragmatic schemes of governance must be achieved. To do that, we are suggesting, new possibilities of citizenship education should be formulated for the general African scene in general, and for   democratising but still both institutionally and economically weakened Zambia.",

        "description":"Technology such as Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a potent force in driving economic, social, political and educational reforms. Countries, particularly developing ones, cannot afford to stay passive to ICT if they are to compete and strive in the global economy. The health of the economy of any country, poor or rich, developed or developing, depends substantially on the level and quality of the education it provides to its workforce. Education reform is occurring throughout the world and one of the tenets of the reform is the introduction and integration of ICT in the education system. The successful integration of any   technology, thus ICT, into the classroom warrants careful planning and depends largely on how well policy makers understand and appreciate the dynamics of such integration. This paper offers a set of guidelines to policy makers for the successful integration of ICT into the classroom.",

The aim of this study was to collect factual information about adjustment problems of Iranian international students in Scotland, such as psycho-social and cultural adjustment problems. The findings of this study underline the importance of sojourn's expectations in cross-cultural adjustment particularly in the case of migrants from developing countries to Western countries and also the role of religion in adjustment. On the other hand, this study questions the role of the acculturation particularly in the case of international students and adjustment. The study concludes by making a series of recommendations to agencies involved with international students. These include provision of more pre-arrival information, better accommodation, extensions of financial or employment support and improved support to the barriers of students. (Contains 6 tables.)",

        "description":"That children should be educated to be ideal citizens, capable of making rational and informed decisions, has been proposed in cultures ranging from Ancient Greece to current societies. In particular, societies that favour liberalism preach the primacy of the individual autonomous citizen and a concomitant tolerance for others. In modern multicultural societies, ways must be found to maintain stability and tolerance of cultural differences. Some cultures do not favour the primacy of the autonomous individual, so educators face a dilemma. Should they promote autonomy in their students, even though that is counter to some cultures' values, or should they abandon promoting autonomy in favour of even-handed treatment of all cultural values? This paper argues for the former, maintaining that educators have a duty, as a matter of professional ethics, to equip their students with the ability to make their own decisions in a modern complex world.",

In the study reported here, the image of Europe and Europeans is explored based on the perceptions of 478 Emirati (United Arab Emirates citizens) prospective teachers. In general, the results reveal that the respondents' perceptions of Europe and Europeans are mainly negative, although there are also some positive and neutral perceptions. Emirati perceptions of Europe and Europeans confer to one major point that Europe represents economic, scientific and technological development but Europeans lack moral values.

The empirical findings presented in this paper suggest that there are critical links between Arab-Australian students' perceptions of belonging, identity and citizenship on the one hand, and their attitudes to schooling and educational experiences on the other.

Within and outside Nigeria, analysts are of the view that the country clearly has the potential to be prosperous. As Nigeria attempts without much success to pull itself out of the quagmire of underdevelopment, the inevitably persistent question has been: given the resources at its disposal, why has the country remained mired in poverty? This paper attempts to provide a partial answer by arguing that Nigeria's inadequate commitment, over the years, to pursue the development of adult education as a strategic objective, as well as an instrument for national development has been one of the major drawbacks to the country's efforts to pull itself out of poverty. Underscoring the role of education in contemporary society, the paper proposes an adult education agenda for Nigeria.",

Since sociology and sociological education started in 1914, there have been many evaluations of sociology in Turkey. The present study differs from others in its evaluation methods.The basic assumption of this study was that none of the sociological studies could be carried out within the confines of only one sociological subfield such as economic or educational sociology. Based on this assumption, a six- point evaluation tool known as a composite index was used in each study. After collecting publications, a group of sociologists held comprehensive discussions and allocated the proportion of the composition for each sociological subfield represented in each study. The results, based on sociologists' published studies in seven well-established departments in Turkey, showed that there were major differences between departments. Among them was Middle East Technical University (METU), where teaching was in English and many staff members had been educated in England or the United States. The sociology department in that university was the leader in almost every field studied. (Contains 6 tables.)",

Research in this area has indicated that the security of the teacher-child relationship influences children's development in many of the same ways as secure parent-child attachments. The purpose of this study is to examine and compare a United States and Turkish sample of teachers and their perceived relationships with their students. It was hypothesised that because teachers in the United States receive more information related to the developmental needs of children, they would be more sensitive to the need for closeness in teacher-child relationships. Results indicate that, in fact, Turkish teachers report less conflict and more closeness to their students than did United States teachers. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"Higher education in Australia contributed almost $3 billion to the Australian economy in 2000 and education has become an essential source of export profits. Australia now provides university places for over six per cent of the global student population. However, there is little empirical research undertaken in that domain. The research underpinning this paper addresses this problem by focusing on students from Singapore, which represent an overseas student client group of Asia. It sets out to explore personal, environmental and behavioural factors that influence educational decisions of students from Singapore, and to build a model that represents the complex interaction of factors and processes involved. While a built model is the major objective, the focus of this paper is on one component, the two interpretive, in-depth case studies. These present an interpretive phenomenological perspective that represents the complexity of individual experiences and supplements the quantitative research and building of a descriptive decision-making model.

Prior research indicates that many international students from Asia, studying in Australia, face serious learning difficulties and lack confidence in speaking and taking a proactive role in classrooms. The paper reports on data gathered in interviews with students from five Asian nations, which suggest that these learning difficulties are grounded in weaknesses in students' prior learning experiences--focused on grammar and reading skills in teacher-centred classrooms, not conversational skills--and in beliefs about language learning instilled during schooling. The paper proposes strategies for overcoming these problems.",

        "description":"In developing countries like India, the onus of development lies mainly with the government, which faces the predicament of multiple demands and limited resources. This leads to a situation where even fundamental objectives such as basic literacy for all are not met. On the other hand, there exists a vibrant private sector, which has resources and the desire to undertake social responsibility. This sector is also coming up with innovative approaches to overcome barriers to education and is targeting the have-nots. Minimally Invasive Education (MIE) is one such endeavour. This paper discusses results obtained from Madangir (New Delhi), one of the sites where MIE learning stations were installed. It encourages children to learn on their own, with minimal, or no intervention. Children are provided with free access to computers in an open outdoor location. The informal environment enables children to acquire computer literacy, enhance their academic levels and imbibe other life skills. This project is an illustration of a public-private partnership between the Government of Delhi and NIIT (India's leading private sector corporation offering IT education, training and global IT learning solutions) to overcome digital illiteracy.

        "description":"The study investigated the prevalence of peer victimisation among secondary school students in a state in South Western Nigeria. Participants consisted of 385 secondary school students selected from ten secondary schools across 10 local government areas in Osun State, Nigeria. The participants, aged between 10 and 19 years, were stratified into junior and senior secondary classes. The Multidimensional Peer-Victimisation Scale was used to collect data on four types of peer-victimisation commonly found among students. Results from descriptive and inferential analysis of data indicate that the majority of participants reported overall high levels of peer victimisation with attack on property as the most frequent form of peer victimisation. There were significant differences between male and female participants on all forms of victimisation with females reporting higher level of social victimisation, verbal victimisation and attack on property than males. The study also found that while students' level of study did not significantly influence the extent to which they were victimised by peers, age was a significant factor in reported levels of peer victimisation. The study brings into focus the need to make guidance services functional in Nigerian secondary schools to overcome the problem of bullying and peer victimisation. (Contains 6 tables.)",

In common with other developing countries, India has seen a proliferation of such schools and yet little systematic study has been made of them. One hundred and thirty eight lessons were analysed using a computerised systematic observation system; a further 20 lessons were video recorded and analysed using discourse analysis. The findings reveal patterns of classroom interaction and discourse similar to those reported in earlier studies of Indian government primary schools. Teacher-led recitation, rote and repetition dominated the classroom discourse with little attention being paid to securing pupil understanding. The wider implications of the findings for improving the quality of classroom discourse in Indian primary schools are considered together with the need for further research into how the wider social order is influencing pedagogic practices.

Quantitative studies such as meta-analyses are still widely used in the United States while recent large-scale research in United Kingdom used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods.

        "description":"Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) is the rate that dissolved oxygen leaves the water column in a body of water due to the build-up and decomposition of organic carbons in the sediment. The introduction of organic materials changes the chemistry of streams, and many chemical reactions occurring in bodies of water, with the exception of photosynthesis, require oxygen. Also, when the organic carbons are in the sediment of streambeds, bacteria and other microorganisms go to these organic materials to feed on them and decompose them. The combination of these two events results in an increased oxygen demand and, therefore, a decrease in streams' dissolved oxygen (DO). This increase in the oxygen demand does not only have the potential to be harmful to the aquatic life in these streams, but can also lead to a build-up of total organic carbons (TOCs) where they pour into Beaver Lake, thereby polluting the lake. This pollution can lead to dangerous effects with the potential to be hazardous to one's health, such as disinfection bi-products (DBPs). An experiment was done to measure oxygen dynamics in the sediment and water column of the White River. (Contains 2 figures.)",

        "description":"With support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Siemens Foundation, and the Associated Colleges of Illinois (ACI), National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology (NCSSSMST) hosted its third summer science program in June 2006 at Aurora (IL) University's Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, campus. This program followed the successful programs held at North Carolina Central University in 2003 and Princeton University in 2005. The mission of all three programs has been to increase the percentage of underrepresented populations enrolled and matriculating at NCSSSMST schools. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which has generously supported the summer science program in the past, continued its support for the third event with the express purpose of engaging underrepresented groups in careers in mathematics and science and encouraging them to apply for admission to NCSSSMST schools. A second goal of the 2006 program was to create opportunities for young, innovative, pre-service teachers of mathematics, science, and humanities. The juncture of new teachers, underrepresented students, and experienced NCSSSMST master teachers created a powerful opportunity for learning, reflection, and application in a science-rich context. This article discusses the 2006 summer science program, which began with a goal of expanding knowledge through an exploration of astronomy but developed into much more than just stargazing. The authors discuss the feature of the 2006 summer program and present reflections of the program's pre-service teachers.",

        "author":["Teahan, John"],
        "description":"In little more than a decade, the Web has become an essential medium for information, entertainment, and commerce, making its adoption among consumers quicker than any other medium before it. The majority of American classrooms have become connected to the Internet in the same short time span. Previously, science or mathematics students might have had access to only a few dozen images in a printed textbook; now, thanks to the Web, they have access to hundreds of thousands of images illustrating almost any conceivable topic. Likewise, teachers now face a new generation of robust web-based applications conducive to classroom use. With a wealth of resources categorized as \"Web 2.0,\" search-weary teachers are increasingly challenged to mine the instructional gold within the fast-moving river of social networking tools. Coined by book publisher Tim O'Reilly, the term \"Web 2.0\" refers to a second generation of services available on the World Wide Web that allows groups of users to share information and collaborate online. In this article, the author considers two applications--(1) Del.icio.us; and (2) Flickr--in terms of their practicality and the unique ways they can enable today's teachers. The author describes the characteristics of Del.icio.us and Flickr and discusses how the two applications can be adapted for classroom instruction.",

        "description":"With clockwork regularity, the real or perceived shortage of scientists and engineers in the US pops up as a topic of debate in academic and industry circles. Discussions of an imminent shortage have deep impact for education, career prospects, immigration, and \"The American Dream.\" The purpose of this article is twofold. First, it poses a somewhat alternative view of the current job market for scientists and engineers. Second, the article explores how this issue affects students at National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science & Technology (NCSSSMST) schools: gifted and talented high school students with an interest in math and science. Post-graduate data suggest that the students do well in their chosen careers in science or science related areas, and accumulating evidence, summarized in this article, shows that there is no current shortage of scientists or engineers. The author argues that it is more important that the nation's most capable students meet the demand for important math and science jobs than to create a large pool of college graduates with math and science degrees.",

        "author":["Hackney, Zachary Carl"],
        "description":"Previous work on fish, frogs, and salamanders, showed the ability for estrogen (EE2) and anthropogenic endocrine disruptors to skew sex ratios and cause hermaphrodism. This study addressed the effects of estrogens on growth and development rates of African clawed frog tadpoles (\"Xenopus laevis\") during their gender determination stages. The effects of estrogen mimics (EM2) have never been studied side-by-side with EE2; I investigated the effects of estradiol [beta]-17 (EE2) and ethynylestradiol [alpha]-17 (EM2). Tadpoles were kept individually in containers filled with either EE2 (100 ng/ml), EM2 (100 ng/ml), or dH[subscript 2]O control. Stage transitions and body sizes were monitored daily over three weeks. Results showed EE2 and EM2 caused faster development rates relative to the control (p less than 0.001) and slower growth rates relative to the control (p less than 0.005). While there were no detectable differences between EE2 and EM2 development rates, the growth rate in the mimic treatment was significantly slower than the growth rate in the EE2 treatment (p less than 0.001). The inverse correlation between development rate and growth rate has implications for the onset of sexual maturity and fecundity. The difference in the growth rates between EE2 and EM2 may be explained by the higher binding affinity of the mimic, which in turn causes the mimic to stay in the body longer than EE2 and may exacerbate the effect on growth rate. How this affects populations of amphibians needs to be explored further. (Contains 2 figures.)",

On October 18, 19, and 20, 2007, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) will hold a student conference attracting approximately 350 students from member schools of the National Consortium of Specialized Secondary Schools of Math, Science, and Technology. This conference will advance student interest in math, science, and technology by bridging the gap with public policy. 2007 marks an important year in Virginia history and because of that, they name their conference--2007: Yesterday Never Dies, blending espionage and history into an interactive three day session. This conference is produced by the dedication of 30-some TJHSST students with the guidance of staff and administration, and with Montgomery Blair High School and sponsorship from GMU. This conference will be the culmination of over four years of hard work, cooperation, and dedication. (contains 27 endnotes.)",

        "description":"Mathematical knowledge can be categorized in different ways. One commonly used way is to distinguish between procedural mathematical knowledge and conceptual mathematical knowledge. Procedural knowledge of mathematics refers to formal language, symbols, algorithms, and rules. Conceptual knowledge is essential for meaningful understanding of mathematical ideas because it is knowledge rich in relationships. Students use conceptual knowledge to develop underlying meaning for procedural knowledge, and to make decisions and problem-solve. Traditional approaches to mathematics teaching and assessment too often overemphasize procedural knowledge at the expense of conceptual knowledge. Not surprisingly, research shows that students' performance on procedural tasks is often adequate but that their conceptual knowledge of mathematics is poor. In this article, the author discusses the importance on the development of conceptual mathematical knowledge and describes how to enhance conceptual knowledge of linear programming with an interactive Flash tool.

Brazil's National Alcohol Program stood out among its contemporaries regarding its success at displacing a third of Brazil's gasoline requirements, primarily due to favorable market conditions and government support. Similar to the Brazilian experience, future progress towards displacing gasoline with fuel ethanol in the U.S. will depend largely upon political support and economic circumstances in the agricultural and energy sectors and markets. Accounting for differences in aggregate gasoline usage and feedstock availability compared to Brazil, the United States would have to speed up commercialization of cellulose ethanol technology in order to achieve a similar degree of success as Brazil, support co-production of biomass derivatives along with fuel ethanol production, and maintain profitability of innovation in the bio-ethanol sector, among other initiatives.

        "description":"In this keynote address presented at the 2008 National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology (NCSSSMST) Professional Conference, Stephanie Marshall describes what is needed to transform STEM education in today's world. While such an endeavor will take multiple systemic actions, here Marshall focuses on three: (1) The need to transform the way mathematics and science are taught so school science and math and real science and math, are the same and not estranged; (2) The need to transform the way mathematics and science are learned so all children are immersed in the knowledge, skills and habits of mind essential for doing real science--ethical inquiry, and creative and collaborative problem-finding and solving; and (3) The need to transform this nation's system of STEM education P-20, so that innovation is ignited and sustained, and the language of mathematics and science is \"spoken\" and understood by all Americans. Marshall believes it will take a new map--a new design, and states that STEM leaders have significant experience with what it needs to be: (1) Concept-centered, experiential, and integrative curriculum, so children understand fundamental science concepts, deep organizing principles and linkages, and how science builds knowledge and enriches the human experience; (2) Inquiry-based, problem-centered, and technology embedded instruction, so children engage in the process of doing science, not as an experimental \"recipe,\" but as an unfolding inquiry because real world problems are messy, complex, and tangled and science knowledge is tentative; (3) Extensive practice and immersion in self-determined and self-directed investigation and research with mentors and peer collaborative teams, in real and virtual laboratories and incubators, and in the natural world so that students are immersed in the joy of doing real science; and (4) Authentic, on-going, multi-dimensional, and performance-based assessment; so children are invited to creativity demonstrate evidence of their understanding, in multiple and novel ways. She discusses how the NCSSSMST, as a real and virtual global STEM Innovation Network, could be a dynamic force for transformation. (Contains 1 note.)",

An IRB is the group charged with the protection of human subjects that are part of research endeavors. Throughout history, there have been multiple and egregious atrocities visited by individuals on others ostensibly in the name of research. One needs only to think of Auschwitz, the Tuskegee syphilis study, and Stanley Milgram's obedience studies to elicit feelings and visions of the gross abuse of humans. While people probably feel that such abuses are at an end, it has only been through national and international mandates--in the not-too-distant past--that the Federal system of laws and practices has been put into place to ensure that human subjects are treated in an ethical manner. Abuse and unethical treatment of human subjects still occur, although infrequently. In this article, the authors raise these issues specifically as they apply to non-biomedical research, the type of research that one is most likely to encounter at the secondary school educational environment.",

Staunton is a rural community like many others in the midwest, populated by hardworking, down-to-earth people who value friends, family, and tradition. Staunton was not an easy place for someone like him to grow up and flourish. As a gifted, inquisitive kid who was more interested in books and science than football, he was an outsider in an environment where natural physical ability and adherence to tradition and the status quo was valued far more than intelligence, innovative thinking, questioning, and academic aptitude. In many ways, he has his parents to thank for his tenacity; they were and always have been enormously supportive of his intellectual pursuits, and they pushed him to focus on his strengths despite these (and other) pressures. He is not sure, however, that their support would have been enough to lead him to his current place in life had he not left Staunton and attended high school at the Illinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA). At IMSA, he discovered a culture he never knew and could never have hoped existed, a culture where inquisitiveness was encouraged, individuality was cherished, and being a &quot;nerd&quot; was the norm. IMSA forever instilled a fundamental and foundational belief and confidence in himself and his abilities, and the conviction that life is about the continual search for answers, the never-ending quest for self-actualization, and the lifelong pursuit of learning and inquiry.",

The author was always interested in math and science, but, then, he was interested in most all subjects. The expected path that his friends and siblings had followed was clear: attend a junior college or maybe Mississippi State University; make use of the best that Mississippi had to offer; perhaps become a doctor or an engineer. The Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science (MSMS) came into his life at just the right time. The advertisements he saw on TV inspired him to apply, as much because it was free of charge as because of the great opportunity. He knew that he would get more and deeper science and math instruction at MSMS than at North Pontotoc, but he had no idea of the breadth of exposure to the world that the school offered. The whole approach of MSMS, the fact that they dispensed with the practice of ranking students against each other, the open and discursive style of discovery, and the residential atmosphere helped foster a type of collaborative problem-solving that stuck with him ever since. It's quite clear how formative and lasting the influence of MSMS has been, especially in revealing his twin missions in science and social justice. He doesn't know if he'll be able to repay Mississippi for that inspiration. He only hopes that his life in public service, as an ambassador from MSMS and the State of Mississippi, can somehow return the favor.",

While attending KAMSC as a member of its inaugural class required a bit of imagination regarding the opportunity at hand, and since Kalamazoo, Michigan was just inventing this concept, the author can say quite irrevocably that choosing KAMSC wasn't just the best choice for high school. It was the best choice for her life. Every single part of her life--college, professional, and even personal--has been touched by KAMSC. KAMSC truly brought a smoother path to college. First, the author received numerous offers to top programs, and, even more importantly for a child from a blue-collar family, tremendous scholarship opportunities. Second, KAMSC employed some tough teachers who truly saw every class as college preparation, regardless of whether the class bore the initials &quot;AP&quot; in its title. Third, the author learned her limits. Attending KAMSC made her realize there were people smarter than her on the planet, and that she was never going to be as tremendously talented as them.

However, his interests changed when he enrolled in the Central Virginia Governor's School (CVGS) for Science and Technology. The author's experience at CVGS has been essential to his early career in science, considering it was his introduction to developing research methodologies, collecting and processing data, writing research papers, using spreadsheets and other computer software, learning to appreciate the joy of observing natural systems in something akin to real time, cultivating a healthier sense of skepticism. But it was not simply learning new ways of thinking and the experience with computers and other technology that really placed him at an advantage. They had a faculty that knew what they were doing. The atmosphere, curriculum and general approach to learning at CVGS were fundamentally collegiate. The author was surprised by how far ahead of the game he was when he started college. Without this great, practical benefit provided by a strong science and technology school with a clear intent to prepare students for a more collegiate style, the author does not see how he would have been as successful academically in college, or how becoming a professional scientist would have been a natural choice for this amateur historian.",

KAMSC also taught him how to use the latest technology to help solve problems. The author salutes KAMSC and thanks her. She has nurtured him and watched him grow, as his experiences have taught him to respect and honor the quest for knowledge. At a time when the country's ability to effectively provide math and science education has been questioned, KAMSC has served as a veritable beacon of hope where many bright and dedicated students continue to explore, learn, and share ideas.",

        "description":"The purpose of this investigation was to determine if three Western species of the Panax, Lycium, and Astragalus genera had antibacterial and/or antioxidant properties, and how their properties compared to Eastern herbs in the same genera. The group hypothesized that when compared, the corresponding herbs would have identical antibacterial and antioxidant properties. An antibacterial disc test was used to determine each herb's ability to inhibit the growth of &quot;Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus.&quot; Herb and bacteria pairs which were not antibacterial were tested in a UV exposure test, a method used to qualify antioxidant properties. Mixtures of bacterial broth and herbal teas were exposed to UV light, and plated onto agar. Survival of the bacteria was observed. In addition, to determine if color of the herb impacted the protection of the bacteria, Nigrosin, a black stain, was tested under the same UV exposure procedure. In a DPPH test, the color change of the DPPH was used to calculate radical scavenging activity as a measure of antioxidant strength. The corresponding herbs' data were then compared. For the antibacterial test, only the known antibiotic control, Streptomycin, yielded a zone of inhibition. All of the herb and bacteria pairs showed antioxidant properties after UV exposure. The DPPH test found that the herb from the &quot;Lycium&quot; genus had the most radical scavenging activity, followed by the &quot;Astragalus&quot; and &quot;Panax&quot; genera. When compared to the data from Eastern species of these herbs, all three of the Western herbs were found to have greater antioxidant properties, especially in the Lycium genus. In the wolfberry trials, the Eastern wolfberry had a radical scavenging activity of 65.0% and the Western herb had 93.1% scavenging activity (Har &amp; Seetoh, 2008). (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Currently manufactured microchips are expensive to make, require specialized equipment, and leave a large environmental footprint. To counter this, an alternative procedure that is cheaper and leaves a smaller environmental footprint should be made. The goal of this research project is to develop a process that creates microchips from polystyrene sheets. This was done by printing with ink on the polystyrene plate to create a mask. Then two methods of plating metal onto the circuit, electroless and electroplating, were tested. Time plated, procedure, and ink level were manipulated to achieve the best results. None of the samples were conductive. After investigation with a SEM, Scanning Electron Microscope, it was found that when the ink was heated, it shriveled and created cracks, or opens, in the circuit in all trials. Additional research was done to reduce the cracks in the shrinking process. However, the alternate methods did not reduce cracks. A third round of testing altered the method of measuring resistance, but damaged trials and had to be abandoned. Currently, there is no combination of variables that produced a working circuit, but significant advances have been made. Microchips created from this procedure would be for small scale applications, such as classrooms or home projects. In future research, microchips that could be used in electronics could reduce electronic waste. They could also lower costs of electronic devices, making them available to lower income markets.

The Summits have awakened Consortium students to a world of problem solving that incorporates critical thinking and consensus and provided them with the experiential tools to find solutions to issues they will inherit from previous generations. Two groups of students met during the 2008 Summits. The 2008 topics were \"Sustainable Fuels in America\" and \"Obesity in America.\" Participants researched each topic prior to their YPS and came together to meet with experts and to discuss and negotiate policy recommendations.

These different types of representations \"often illuminate different aspects of a complex concept or relationship,\" and each has its own features, advantages, and limitations. For students to have a conceptual understanding of functions, they not only need to understand each representation on its own, but also need to be able to link different representations meaningfully. Solving equations using a function approach, with different representations, can help students learn to better connect representations.

Integration and inclusion, it seemed, were in the air, embracing not just science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, but philosophy, language, rhetoric, and the fine arts as well. In this article, the author describes the different presentations offered and highlights two sessions which seemed of especially far-reaching significance. Susan Owens and her colleagues from the Anne Arundel STEM Magnet High School in Maryland discussed the development of a required fine arts course that utilizes scientific concepts. As interesting as the course itself was their explanation of the impetus behind it. It seems that stakeholders in their school had complained that engineering graduates were lacking in creativity, and insisted that the arts be included in the school curriculum as a means of fostering innovation and imagination in future engineers. Another presentation with broad implications was given by Corey Alderdice and Tim Gott of the Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky. Drawing on a book by Daniel Pink, their presentation emphasized the importance of developing the whole brain by incorporating humanistic education, as well as social and emotional nurturing, along with scientific education.",

And \"diversity\" is quickly becoming the latest buzzword for an idea that, though politically correct, causes people to dread the discomfort associated with real discourse on the issue. In this article, the author discusses six areas of challenge that leaders must address in order to promote institutional diversity. These areas are: (1) Changed Power Dynamics; (2) Diversity of Opinions; (3) Perceived Lack of Empathy; (4) Tokenism, Real and Perceived; (5) Participation; and (6) Overcoming Inertia. NCSSSMST member institutions have had a transformative impact on designing innovative curriculum, research and teaching models in STEM fields, as well as in the fine arts and the humanities.

This is why a wide array of task forces and organizations has recently raised the clarion call for more and better scientists and engineers. While the policy proposals offered are wide ranging, one key policy innovation has surprisingly been largely ignored: the role of specialty math and science high schools. Today, there are well over 100 of these high schools throughout the nation. And evidence shows that these schools are a powerful tool for producing high school graduates with a deep knowledge and strong passion for science and math that translates into much higher rates of college attendance and graduation in scientific fields. As a result, any solution to the scientist, technician, engineer, and mathematician (STEM) shortage must include a national commitment to expand the number of specialty math and science high schools. The United States faces a new and pressing competitiveness challenge as a growing number of nations seek to gain global market share in technology-based economic activities. In this article, the authors address the STEM challenge by suggesting the expansion of specialty math and science high schools and the development of institutional partnerships.

        "description":"Content analysis has dominated computer-mediated communication and educational technology studies for some time, and a review of its practices applied to online corpus of data or messages is overdue. We are confronted with complexity given the various foci, nuances and models for theorising learning and applying methods. One common suggestion to deal with the complexity in content analysis is a call for standardisation by replication or systematic research studies. This article presents its \"discontent\" with content analysis, discussing the issues and concerns that surround the analysis of online transcripts. It does not attempt to resolve nor provide a definitive answer. Instead, it is an open inquiry into another way of looking at online content. It presents an alternative or perhaps an extension of what we have come to know as content analysis. It argues for the notion of genres as another way of conceptualising online transcripts. It proposes two things: first that in performing transcript analysis, it is worthwhile to think how messages relate to a system of interactions that persists even beyond the online environment; secondly, there is an emergent and recurring \"metastructuring\" that is at work in online environments that is worth exploring, instead of imposing structures--models and frameworks that do not fit the emerging communicative practices of participants.

One hundred and twelve visitors to youth &quot;drop-in&quot; centers estimated the costs (&quot;dangers&quot;) of four behaviors as presented to them and the cost that they perceived for themselves. The four behaviors were chosen to plausibly signal different characteristics about the risk taker and also to have different magnitudes and probabilities of cost. Cost discrepancy, the excess of presented over perceived risk, was associated with intention to smoke in females. It is concluded that costly signaling seems to operate in behaviors with low magnitudes but high probabilities of cost. Other behaviors with this risk profile may also be associated with costly signaling. (Contains 4 tables.)",

A Unique opportunity arose involving the chance to scrutinize the transformation of a school-within-a-school alternative program in consideration of Raywid's (1994) typology using a mixed-methods case study relying upon questionnaire, documentary, observational, interview data, and propositions. The findings yielded significant contributions through expansion of the typology. (Contains 4 figures and 11 tables.)",

One such method, narrative story, provides a way to examine the historical and current-lived practice of those engaged in the educational system. As a design conversation, it encourages the participation of all levels of the organization in creating a living narrative. This paper addresses how narrative story can be used to engage students within the system in developing that narrative, providing the construct within which to examine students' perspectives. Ten at risk students from 7th through 12th grade participated in the study, with the intention of making school a better place for all students. This paper examines these stories and their implications in the design process. It also examines narrative story as an appropriate social discourse in creating and sustaining educational systems that contribute to human betterment for all students.",

Data from learning style inventories, surveys, journals, teacher observations, and formal assessments were collected for 29 sixth-grade students in a language arts class. Students were videotaped and observed for three weeks before the intervention and for seven weeks when they used the stress balls. The frequency of distraction incidents decreased during both direct instruction and independent practice when students used stress balls. Kinesthetic learners used the stress balls more consistently and their attention spans increased more when compared to other learners. Student achievement on writing paragraphs improved. Based on journal entries, all types of learners thought that their attitude, attention, writing abilities, and peer interaction improved due to stress ball use. (Contains 5 tables and 1 figure.)",

Students were identified as at risk with a 95% minority enrollment, 100% free lunch and transportation, and the lowest NAEP test scores in the nation. Total standardized test scores from the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT)-Expanded Edition were compared according to instructional methods. The results of an ANOVA showed significant differences. Statistically, the Success for All Group achieved the highest mean score, while there were no significant differences in the mean scores between the Direct Instruction Group and the Basal Reader Group. The importance of this study lies in its effort to analyze available data on three modes of reading instruction. The school district should select one reading program and institute it districtwide after longitudinal quantitative and qualitative data are collected. This study is only the first step in that direction. (Contains 1 figure and 1 table.)",

Each school's CATS Accountability Index, a measure of school performance based upon both cognitive and non-cognitive measures, has then been compared to these individualized improvement goals for the purpose of designating schools as &quot;Meet Goal&quot;, &quot;Progressing,&quot; and &quot;Assistance Level&quot; (Kentucky Department of Education (KDE), 2000). Considered an interim target model, the design of CATS has been intended to negate the biasing effects of socioeconomic factors on school performance on accountability tests through the individualization of school goals (Ladd. 2001). Results of this study showed that 39.9% to 55.5% of the variance of the CATS indices was shared by school socioeconomic factors. Analysis of this interim target model for the 2000-2002 biennium showed that for elementary and middle schools this model negated the biasing effects of socioeconomic factors, but not for high schools. Moreover, analysis of the progress of schools toward their Improvement Goals in 2001 showed that both elementary and high schools from higher poverty backgrounds lagged significantly behind their more affluent peers, indicating inequitable capacity to meet improvement goals between the poorest and most wealthy schools. Adaptations to the present accountability systems were suggested for the purpose of providing more accurate information to the public regarding the effectiveness of public schools in Kentucky.

More importantly, we sought to understand &quot;why&quot; teachers perceived the tests to be taking schools in the right or wrong direction. Based on the survey results of 708 teachers, we categorized their concerns and praises of high-stakes testing into ten themes. Most of the teachers believed that the testing program was not taking schools in the right direction. They commented that the test was used improperly and that the one-time test scores were not an accurate assessment of students' learning and development. In addition, they cited negative effects on the curriculum, teaching and learning, and student and teacher motivation. The positive effects cited were much fewer in number and included the fact that the testing held students, educators, and parents accountable for their actions. Interestingly, teachers were not opposed to accountability, but rather, opposed the manner in which it was currently implemented. Only by understanding these positive and negative effects of the testing program can policymakers hope to improve upon it. To this end, we discuss several implications of these findings, including: limiting the use of test scores, changing the school grading criteria, using alternative assessments, modifying the curriculum, and taking steps to reduce teaching to the test.

        "description":"This study examines the characteristics of elementary schools that experience chronic teacher turnover and the impacts of turnover on a school's working climate and ability to effectively function. Based on evidence from staff climate surveys and case studies, it is clear that high turnover schools face significant organizational challenges. Schools with high teacher turnover rates have difficulty planning and implementing a coherent curriculum and sustaining positive working relationships among teachers. The reality of these organizational challenges is particularly alarming, given that high turnover schools are more likely to serve low-income and minority students. The negative relationship between teacher turnover and school functioning, and the fact that turbulent schools are disproportionately likely to serve low-income and minority students have important implications for both district and school-level policies. Specifically: (1) Teacher turnover rates are one indicator of school health, which school districts should consider when focusing on school improvements. Districts need to begin by developing the means to identify individual schools that experience high levels of teacher turnover. (2) Current district policies in implementing professional development for teachers in low-performing schools are inefficient when teachers do not remain in the schools in which they are trained. (3) In order for low-performing schools to improve, districts need to consider providing incentive programs so that high quality teachers apply for, and remain in, these schools. Future research is needed to address the causal link between turnover, organizational functioning and student outcomes. Additionally, there is a need for research examining district policies that may facilitate teacher turnover within a district, including how districts place and transfer teachers, as well as how teachers' salaries are budgeted.

        "description":"At the core of standards-based reform are content standards--statements about what students should know and be able to do. Although it is &quot;state&quot; standards that are the focus of much public attention and consume substantial resources, many local school districts have developed their own content standards in the major subject areas. However, we know very little about the role state standards have played in local standards efforts. In this article we report on a study of the relationship between state and local content standards in reading in four states and districts. Through interviews with key personnel in each state, and district and analyses of state and local content standards in reading, we explored the alignment between state and district content standards, the path of influence between the two, and the role of high-stakes tests in state and districts reform efforts. Our findings suggest that alignment had multiple meanings and that state standards had differential utility to districts, ranging from helpful to benign to nuisance. This wide variability was influenced by the nature of the standards themselves, the state vision of alignment and local control, districts' own engagement and commitment to professional development, and student performance on high-stakes tests. We explore implications for the future of content standards as the cornerstone of standards-based reform and argue that states must promote district ownership and expand accountability if state content standards are to have any relevance for local efforts to reform teaching and learning.

        "description":"Contemporary research on teaching indicates that teachers are powerful contributors to students' academic achievement, though the set and interrelationships of characteristics that make for high-quality and effective teaching have yet to be satisfactorily determined. Nevertheless, on the basis of the extant research and a vision of exemplary teaching, the &quot;National Board for Professional Teaching Standards&quot; stipulated a definition of a superior teacher. The Board did this without empirical evidence to support their claim that teachers' who meet the standards set by the Board were superior in promoting academic achievement to those who did not meet those standards. In the 17 years since the founding of the National Board, only a few empirical studies have addressed this important issue. In this study we compare the academic performance of students in the elementary classrooms of 35 National Board Certified teachers and their non-certified peers, in 14 Arizona school districts. Board Certified teachers and their principals provide additional information about these teachers and their schools. Four years of results from the Stanford Achievement Tests in reading, mathematics and language arts, in grades three through six, were analyzed. In the 48 comparisons (four grades, four years of data, three measures of academic performance), using gain scores adjusted for students' entering ability, the students in the classes of National Board Certified Teachers surpassed students in the classrooms of non-Board certified teachers in almost three-quarters of the comparisons. Almost one-third of these differences were statistically significant. In the cases where the students of non-Board certified teachers gained more in an academic year, none of the differences found were statistically significant. Effect size, translated into grade equivalents, informs us that the gains made by students of Board Certified teachers were over one month greater than the gains made by the students of non-Board certified peer teachers. Teachers identified through the assessments of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards are, on average, more effective teachers in terms of academic achievement, one of the many outcomes of education for which teachers are responsible. This study does not address whether other, cheaper, or better alternatives to the National Boards exist, as some critics suggest. On the other hand, the results of this study provide support for the policies in many states that honor and provide extra remuneration for National Board Certified Teachers.

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between age and achievement. It is an attempt to evaluate the hypothesis that older students fare better academically than their younger classmates. Findings indicate that on average for students in elementary school there is positive linear relationship between age and achievement for age normal peers. Even though there is positive linear relationship, the difference in average test scores between the oldest and youngest students is not great and by the time students reach 10th grade the positive linear relationship has disappeared. For overage students there is on average a negative linear relationship between age and achievement at all grade levels. That is, the negative relationship between age and achievement remains constant over time. These results argue against modifying entrance age policies, delaying school entry, implementing transitional kindergarten or first grade programs or retaining students to improve educational achievement. Policies and practices that make students older than their classmates inversely affect their educational achievement. (Contains 26 figures, 10 tables and 4 footnotes.)",

Disaggregating data for former ELLs can therefore provide important information for long-term district and program accountability. The study was concerned with the achievement patterns in English language arts, Math, and Science of former ELLs who attended a bilingual and a English as a Second Language (ESL) program. It also explored whether length of program participation and grade level exited played a significant role in predicting academic achievement patterns for these exited students. Results indicate that 4th grade students more closely paralleled non- ELL students' achievement patterns than 8th grade students, particularly for the BE students. While length of program participation is not a significant predictor of former ELLs' academic success, exit grade does emerge as an important variable to take into consideration in setting exit guidelines.

        "description":"Most of the recent literature on the achievement effects of school size has examined school and district performance. These studies have demonstrated substantial benefits of smaller school and district size in impoverished settings. To date, however, no work has adequately examined the relationship of size and socioeconomic status (SES) with students as the unit of analysis. One study, however, came close (Lee &amp; Smith, 1997), but failed to adjust its analyses or conclusions to the substantial bias toward larger schools evident in the data set used. The present study, based on the same large data set, but with size issues in the rural circumstance clearly in focus, reaches rather different conclusions, extending previous work for the first time to a more adequate examination of size effects on individual students. Findings challenge assertions about &quot;ideal&quot; and &quot;minimum&quot; size. Analyses include comparison of means and multi-level modeling. Methodologically, the study illustrates the challenge of using nationally representative data sets of students to investigate second-level contextual phenomena, such as school size. When aggregated to schools attended by nationally representative students, the result cannot be a nationally representative set of schools. Adjustment with weights to simulate such a distribution, moreover, is inadequate to overcome this threat if one is interested in investigating size relationships among the smaller half of US schools, as one must be in seeking to generalize results to the nation as a whole. The present study finds that the smallest national decile of size maximizes the achievement of the poorest quartile of students. Moreover, &quot;appropriate&quot; size is shown to vary by student socioeconomic status. (Contains 10 tables and 31 footnotes.)",

        "description":"I take issue with several points in the Howleys' reanalysis (Vol. 12 No. 52 of this journal) of \"High School Size: Which Works Best and for Whom?\" (Lee & Smith, 1997). That the original sample of NELS schools might have underrepresented small rural public schools would not bias results, as they claim. Their assertion that our conclusions about an ideal high-school size privileged excellence over equity ignores the fact that our multilevel analyses explored the two outcomes simultaneously. Neither do I agree that our claim about \"ideal size\" (600-900) was too narrow, as our paper was clear that our focus was on achievement and its equitable distribution. Perhaps the most important area of disagreement concerns non-linear relationships between school size and achievement gains. Ignoring the skewed distribution of school size, without either transforming or categorizing the variable produces findings that spuriously favor the smallest schools. Our recent involvement as expert witnesses on opposite sides in a court case may have motivated the Howleys' attempt to discredit our work. Finally, I argue that research attempting to establish a direct link between school size and student outcomes may be misguided. Rather, school size influences student outcomes only indirectly, through the academic and social organization of schools. Considerable evidence links these organizational factors to student outcomes (especially learning and its equitable distribution). (Contains 4 notes.)",

        "description":"We seek to understand why persons develop their musical preferences by identifying with a particular cultural group and social background. This identification is greatly shaped by experience in their environment. Resources employed for this identification are mostly different from those employed in schools to foster academic knowledge. We argue that there needs to be renewed attention to the epistemological and ontological bases of education to examine how we can most effectively educate for the 21st Century in a relativistic and globalized world. Our focus is on music education but with the entire curriculum near at hand, together seeking to bring about a better intellectual, sociological, and aesthetic process of education. Our interest in music stems from a perceived necessity that persons trained in the arts will have special answers to the challenges of this so-called postmodern world. We offer: (1) elements of epistemology, discussing how education and music education have traditionally been focused on propositional rather than interpretive knowledge; (2) a particular perspective on ontology, making evident the ways that individuals construct meanings, interacting with their cultural environment in the shaping of social identity; and (3) the need, today more than ever, for a music curriculum fostering aesthetic experiences that develop interpretive understanding of reality and personal self. Characteristics of postmodernism in cultural studies will be employed throughout the paper. (Contains 1 footnote.)",

        "description":"The No Child Left Behind Act has brought great attention to the high school graduation rate as one of the mandatory accountability measures for public school systems. However, there is no consensus on how to calculate the high school graduation rate given the lack of longitudinal databases that track individual students. This study reviews literature on and practices in reporting high school graduation rates, compares graduation rate estimates yielded from alternative methods, and estimates discrepancies between alternative results at national, state, and state ethnic group levels. Despite the graduation rate method used, results indicate that high school graduation rates in the U.S. have been declining in recent years and that graduation rates for black and Hispanic students lag substantially behind those of white students. As to graduation rate method preferred, this study found no evidence that the conceptually more complex methods yield more accurate or valid graduation rate estimates than the simpler methods.

The first hypothesis focuses on program implementation: to achieve success, any systemic reform must overcome challenges at each stage of the policy-making process, from agenda-setting to policy choice to implementation. The second hypothesis focuses on the federated nature of education policymaking in the United States: any successful systemic reform must offer a program that aligns local efforts with state and sometimes federal policy. I derive and test more specific hypotheses related to recent systemic reform efforts in the Los Angeles region--especially the Los Angeles Annenberg Metropolitan Project, or LAAMP--which ran from 1995 through 2001. The case confirms the hypotheses and enables a clearer understanding of systemic school reform. (Contains 3 figures.)",

They find that a &quot;support gap&quot; exists: new teachers in low-income schools are less likely than their counterparts in high-income schools to experience timely and information-rich hiring, to benefit from mentoring and support by experienced colleagues, and to have a curriculum that is complete and aligned with state standards, yet flexible for use in the classroom. Such patterns of difference between high-income and low-income schools warrant careful consideration because they reveal broad patterns of inequity, which can have severe consequences for low-income students. Survey data for this study were collected from random samples of teachers in five states. One survey, focusing on hiring practices and teachers' relationships with colleagues, was administered to 374 first-year and second-year teachers in Florida, Massachusetts, and Michigan. A second survey, focusing on curriculum, was administered to 295 second-year elementary school teachers in Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Washington. The inequitable patterns of support for teachers reported here have important implications for the work of state policymakers, school district administrators, and principals. The authors describe these and offer recommendations for policy and practice in the conclusion. (Contains 3 tables and 3 footnotes.)",

But no markets are perfectly competitive, and the local market for public goods is filled with institutional arrangements that make it differ from the neoclassical ideal. In this paper, we look at a particular institution--the provisions of charter school legislation--and assess how it affects the ability of charter schools to gain market share. Using data from the 36 states that had passed charter legislation by 2000, and controlling for a variety of other factors, we estimate a model of the effects of various provisions in the charter laws on charter school market share. We find that two such provisions, one concerning the sponsorship of charters and another their funding sources, appear to have a strong effect on the market share of charter schools.

Interdisciplinary cooperation and the synergization of resources are being promoted, and institutional autonomy is gradually increasing. Schools and faculties have been restored in universities, and new research institutions, research schools, research centers and the like have been established. From a unitary three-level model-- university/department/teaching and research group--before the reform, the organizational structures of the universities have developed a new organizational structure that is more flexible and more open. This more adaptable structure is intended to meet the developmental demands of modern universities with close links being created between their work and regional economic and social development. China has moved from a very centralized educational system in which the main decisions were taken by the central government to a decentralized educational system. This reform is also taking place within the institutions of higher education, and their internal organizational structure has also become more decentralized. (Contains 1 table and 20 footnotes.)",

        "description":"The College Board's Advanced Placement (AP) Program, which allows students to take college-level courses while in high school, enjoyed tremendous growth in the 1990s. Despite overall growth, small rural schools and high poverty schools continue to offer relatively few AP courses, and black, Hispanic, and low income students remain grossly underrepresented in AP classes. During the 1990s, AP incentive programs primarily subsidized test fees for low income students, but this provided no incentive for low income and rural schools to expand their AP course offerings and did nothing to strengthen the weak academic preparation of low income, black and Hispanic students. Recent federal funding changes provide a step in the right direction by supporting a comprehensive approach to increasing the AP access and participation of traditionally underserved students.

The analysis is intended to help state leaders, educators, and others obtain a picture of highly qualified teachers in their state, and to be able to compare their state statistics with states across the nation. Since states have some flexibility in meeting the standard for highly qualified teachers outlined by NCLB, the analyses presented in this paper from a national survey may be useful as a common benchmark for use by states as they develop their own state-specific definitions and measures.

        "description":"Higher education in Flanders has seen some major changes in the 1990s. One of the key elements of the new higher education regulations was the quality assessment system. This exemplified best the government's policy of granting all institutions of higher education autonomy, making them responsible for their policies, while still keeping the quality of higher education somewhat under governmental control. In this article, we focus on the tension between the government's aim of improving and controlling the quality of higher education and universities' concern for their autonomy. We describe the Flemish government's view on issues of quality in higher education and confront these with an account on the basis of case studies of how the quality assurance system was actually implemented in universities. We conclude that the model of the &quot;market state&quot; or the &quot;evaluative state&quot; is only realised partially in Flanders. The government is still interventionist when it comes to key policy issues. (Contains 1 table and 6 footnotes.)",

Data came from the complete cohort of 989 low-income children (93% African American) in the Chicago Longitudinal Study, who attended preschool in the 20 Child-Parent Centers in 1983-1985 and kindergarten in 1985-1986. We found that implementation of an instructional approach rated high by Head Teachers in teacher-directed and child-initiated activities was most consistently associated with children's outcomes, including school readiness at kindergarten entry, reading achievement in third and eighth grades, and avoidance of grade retention. Parent involvement in school activities, as rated by teachers and by parents, was independently associated with child outcomes from school readiness at kindergarten entry to eighth grade reading achievement and grade retention above and beyond the influence of curriculum approach. Findings indicate that instructional approaches that blend a teacher-directed focus with child-initiated activities and parental school involvement are origins of the long-term effects of participation in the Child-Parent Centers.

        "description":"The accreditation systems of higher education institutions and/or programs are becoming a policy measure used to find a balance between their autonomy and public assurance concerning the quality of the qualifications they award. This article analyses, from the point of view of this balance of power, the process of development of the Portuguese accreditation system aimed at providing public assurance that initial teacher education programs are more driven by social demand, namely by the changing school education needs. This was a political and cultural process rather than a merely rational and technical one. Thus the emergence of the need for, and possibility of, external pressure upon higher education institutions is related to the evolution of several social factors. On the other hand, the implementation of the accreditation system means a significant change for these institutions which implies new practices and comes into conflict with some of their values and with power sharing within and among them and with society. For these reasons a strategy of wide participation of significant stakeholders was deemed more suitable for the formulation, adoption and implementation of this new public policy. The way in which government, the accreditation body, and the significant stakeholders exercised their power in this process influenced the characteristics of the system, the rhythm of its implementation, and the abrupt governmental decision to put it on stand-by, until now.

Results indicated that the majority of students felt health education was important and that healthy behaviors were important to adopt. Students who had taken three or more high school health classes and who had a high school health teacher teach their health classes reported increased perceived effectiveness scores of high school health education. In addition, younger university students (freshmen and sophomores) were more likely than older university students (juniors and seniors) to feel that their high school health education was effective in increasing their health knowledge and health behavior. Based on these findings, it appears that increased high school health education and the hiring of certified health educators to teach high school health classes are warranted.

Though several existing scales assess the quality of curricula materials, most do not consider cultural relevance. The Curricula Appropriateness Scale (CAS) was designed to determine the appropriateness of curriculum materials for diverse populations. The final CAS contains six statements with a 4-point, Likert-type scale response option ranging from 1=strongly agree for each item. Item selection was based on a review of the professional literature and existing instruments. A local panel of experts (n-10) examined a draft version of the scale for content validity. Based on the panelists' comments, the scale was revised and piloted with 27 undergraduates enrolled in an elementary school health course. A national panel of experts (n=5) then examined the scale for content validity. Feedback from the national panel was used to revise the CAS for a second pilot test. Students enrolled in a second elementary school health course completed the second CAS during the assessment of the federally developed curriculum, \"Learning to Live Drug Free\". Item consistency reliability was measured using Cronbach's alpha. Psychometric characteristics and recommendations for using the CAS are presented. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

Researchers developed a 126-item checklist to conduct a content analysis of HEDIR messages. Checklist sections included sender information; message format; exchange of ideas' unsolicited provision of information; topical information; and professional development. Two independent pilot studies established content and face validity, and the interrater reliability of the instrument, using pi coefficient, was computed for each item. Analysis was performed on 794 HEDIR messages, from January 1 to June 7, 2001, printed from the HEDIR Web site. Message senders were of either sex, and the majority were university educators (33.8%). Unsolicited provision of information represented the largest category of messages (47.4%), followed by inquiries for information (27.5%) and responses to inquiries for information (26.1%). The most frequently selected item was unsolicited referral to Web site (15.0%) There were fewer inquiries for opinions than for information. The ratio of responses:inquiries for individual items was greater for opinions than information.

Twenty college students completed the four items twice during the same day. During the next 7 days they wore an accelerometer and a pedometer during all waking hours. They also recorded their daily activity in a log. At the end of the week, subjects completed the NCHRBS physical activity items again. The intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.94-0.99 for the four items. The vigorous item was highly correlated with log VPA (r=0.82) and number of days with [greater than or equal to] 29 minutes of VPA from the accelerometer (r=0.60). The flexibility item was moderately correlated (r=0.57) and the muscular strength and/or endurance item was highly correlated (r=0.89) with corresponding log activities. The moderate item was highly correlated with log MPA (r=0.66) and number of days with [greater than or equal to] 30 minutes of MPA from the accelerometer (r=0.61).

Baseline and follow-up questionnaires were completed by 1,412 students. The proportion of students reporting current cigarette use decreased significantly in the CHAMPS group but not in the comparison group. Intervention group students' knowledge about the harmful consequences of tobacco use increased significantly, whereas knowledge essentially stayed the same among comparison group students. Finally, the number of nonsmoking students who reported they would smoke a cigarette if one of their best friends offered it increased significantly in the comparison group but not in the intervention group. These results suggest that a well-planned and implemented peer-helping program represents an important potential resource that should be considered as a welcome adjunct to existing school-based tobacco education and prevention efforts.

This study was designed to determine teens' reproductive health information needs. Selected for analysis were 1,219 submissions to the Ask the Experts section of the Web site. Each submission was independently coded by three of the authors. Findings suggest that the Internet is a useful way to provide teens with access to sexuality information, and that it can reach a wide audience of teens. Of possible concern in this study were the findings that teens asked very few questions about sexually transmitted infections, relatively few males submitted questions to the site, and teens were asking about sex behaviors at significantly younger ages than they were asking about services, pregnancy, or contraception/protection. A combination of education resources, including Web sites, are necessary to provide teens with the vital information they need to be sexually healthy. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

However, recent world events, including the destabilization of governments, have raised concerns that smallpox could fall into the hands of nefarious individuals or groups who might attempt to use the virus as a weapon. In Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publications the threat of smallpox being intentionally released by bio-terrorists is currently considered possible. Because health educators would likely be involved in public health prevention and response efforts to a release, it is our responsibility to be knowledgeable about smallpox.

The purpose of this article is to describe injury risk and prevention strategies across the developmental stages of childhood and adolescence and associated social contexts. Viewing injury prevention from this perspective suggests that developmentally appropriate interventions conducted over several stages may be more likely to motivate and sustain injury prevention behavior change across a lifetime than a single intervention or a single policy change.

        "description":"Academic achievement and high test scores are not the only indicators of a successful school. A good school is also a safe school. Unfortunately, every year in the United States, approximately 3.7 million students suffer an injury at school severe enough to require medical attention or to limit activity. Most of the injuries are preventable. Data can be extremely effective in convincing school decision makers to take action to prevent injuries. Several state and local school systems in the United States have used either ongoing surveillance systems or a one time data collection effort to describe and highlight the school injury problem, leading to the design and evaluation of injury prevention programs. This article provides examples of some of these school-related injury surveillance efforts. It illustrates how health educators can make a difference by getting involved in the creation of surveillance systems and using the generated data to make a convincing argument for school injury prevention. By forming partnerships and developing prevention programs based on local data, a health educator can lead the way to safe schools. (Contains 1 table.)",

Schools have a responsibility to prevent injuries from occurring on school property and at school-sponsored events. In addition, schools can teach students the skills needed to promote safety and prevent unintentional injuries, violence, and suicide while at home, at work, at play, in the community, and throughout their lives. The school health recommendations for preventing unintentional injury, violence, and suicide summarized here were developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with experts from universities and from national, federal, state, local, and voluntary agencies and organizations. They are based on an in-depth review of research, theory, and current practice in unintentional injury, violence, and suicide prevention; health education; and pubic health. The guidelines include recommendations related to the following eight aspects of school health efforts to prevent unintentional injury, violence, and suicide: a social environment that promotes safety; a safe physical environment; health education curricula and instruction; safe physical education, sports and recreational activities; health, counseling, psychological and social services for students; appropriate crisis and emergency response; involvement of families and communities; and staff development.",

Too often, it has negative health consequences, including more than 200,000 workplace injuries to 14 to 17 year olds every year. Training teens about occupational safety is part of an overall strategy to address this problem. When the project described in this article began, there were few curricula for teaching teens basic occupational safety information, and there was little research on the most effective way to deliver this information. Project staff sought to fill these gaps in resources and knowledge. They conducted formative research to determine teen knowledge and attitudes about workplace safety and about child labor laws, teens' comfort with voicing concerns at work, and the type of training they received. Staff also interviewed educators and pilot-tested a draft curriculum to determine format and content appropriate to trainers' time constraints and levels of knowledge. In response to the findings, project staff developed curricula with activities addressing hazards in workplaces, prevention strategies, child labor laws, and how to communicate effectively about workplace concerns. Activities were created to be interactive and fun, and instructor guidance was presented concisely but with sufficient background information for someone with limited knowledge of occupational health and safety.

Schools are the center of many adolescents' lives and they can influence students' personal and social development. Therefore, it is appropriate that the first line of suicide prevention strategies should lie within the educational system. From the perspective of health promotion, schools are in a unique position to identify suicide vulnerable youth. It is important to remember that many high risk youth are not in school, and communities should work to find ways to deliver prevention and treatment services to them.

In partnership with four city public elementary schools, data were collected through focus groups of parents and other caregivers and through a written survey distributed to parents and caregivers. The findings reveal that parents and caregivers are aware of a full range of prevention measures for the child pedestrian injury problem but are especially supportive of speed bumps, safety education for parents, and better traffic enforcement. Parents and caregivers are uncertain about what kind of strategies would work well to get changes made in their communities to protect child pedestrians. They also reveal that they are willing to get involved in trying to get changes made. Parents and other community members can be willing and effective partners in injury prevention, but they can benefit from receiving more information about the value of environmental prevention measures and from skill-building in injury prevention advocacy.

        "description":"Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are the leading cause of injury and death among adolescents 16 to 19 years of age. Three areas of countermeasures for decreasing young driver risk are driver education, licensing policies, and parental management. Driver education is an essential part of teaching adolescents the rules of the road and operating a vehicle; however, it has not proven to prevent MVCs among young drivers. Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) is a policy innovation accepted widely in the U. S. that delays licensure and restricts driving among novices under the most dangerous conditions. GDL programs have effectively reduced motor vehicle crashes where adopted; however, adoption and effectiveness of these policies vary. Parental management of teen driving has not been systematically studied until recently and may be an important part of reducing teen driving risk. Research indicates that parents place modest restrictions on their teens' driving and that restrictions are related to fewer risky driving behaviors, tickets, and MVCs. The Checkpoints Program aims to increase parental management of teen driving and has been shown to do so in short-term follow-ups in several randomized trials. Each countermeasure is important to teen safety and may need improvements; however, the greatest protection against MVCs among young drivers would be to provide better integration among, and wider implementation of, countermeasures.

Valois at the Annual National Meeting of the American Association for Health Education, American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation & Dance in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on April 4, 2003. Valois discusses the changes in the \"American village\" as they relate to children and adolescents, and suggests that health educators need to change professionally to effectively help child and adolescent \"villagers\" of the future. He believes that the best way for health educators and health promoters to predict the future is to create it. Imperative for future generations is the combination of healthy kids and academic success. It could be argued that the school is the most important community cornerstone, and that Coordinated School Health Programs (CSHPs) can help in meeting future goals while strengthening other community cornerstones. It is essential to consistently work toward tipping social and financial capital in the direction of CSHPs at the national, state, and local levels. Promoting child, adolescent, and school health, says Valois, is the right thing to do, and it is important to do it right, because it takes a whole village to raise a healthy and academically successful child.",

Along with this trend, the prevalence of obesity in the United States has reached epidemic proportions. To date, all interventions related to the prevention and treatment of obesity have failed. We must find a new way to prevent this epidemic from spreading. How then can we best encourage people to make lower-fat, more appropriate food choices? What if a tax was applied to unhealthy, fat-laden foods? Among those most affected by such a policy are college-age students. First, this age range (18-29) is at increased risk for obesity, and second, they spend an extraordinary amount of money on convenience food. The purpose of this study was to identify college student's knowledge and attitudes on policies regarding sales tax on snack-related food items. Surveys were administered in a variety of general education courses at two Western universities. Six-hundred sixty surveys were completed. Results indicated that many students (71.5%) were not aware of a snack food tax. About one-half (47.3%) felt they would support such a tax especially if the tax was minimal (e.g., 1 cent).

Understanding variables that are associated with eating disorders could be helpful in preventing them. Participants (N = 525) were students from a large southwestern university. It was hypothesized that a desire for an underweight body mass index (BMI) would be predicted by one's ability to accurately identify one's current BMI while controlling for variables previously shown to be associated with eating behaviors, which included body dissatisfaction; drive for thinness; social physique anxiety; bulimia tendencies; dietary restraint; age; race; Greek membership; and gender were included in the regression model. Women scored higher than men on measures of social physique anxiety, body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, and dietary restraint, although more then twice the proportion of men (49%) as compared with women (22%) were overweight or obese. Women were more accurate in correctly identifying their own BMI category. However, incorrectly identifying one's BMI was the only significant predictor of desiring an underweight BMI among women. No independent variables predicted the desire for an underweight BMI among men. Future research should assess the preventive and predictive power of accurately assessing one's BMI with eating behaviors. (Contains 3 tables.)",

Respondents (N = 3,957) to the 1999 South Carolina Youth Risk Behavior Survey were examined on six questions pertaining to body image influences and behavioral activities to manipulate body weight and/or body image. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used to show associations among the chosen variables. Body mass index scores for participants were generated and compared with concerns about weight. More than 40% of participants were concerned about their weight and participated in deleterious behaviors to manipulate their weight and self-perception of body. Mass media and family were the most influential factors in participant's self-perception of body. Exercise and dieting were the most prevalent ways to manipulate body weight. Significant differences were determined for each race and gender group with regard to types of activities intended to manipulate their body weight. Policy changes to media advertisements and innovative interventions should be developed that can influence adolescents to choose a healthy body size and to be comfortable with the varieties of body shapes.

Although the profession has widely embraced individual certification, program accreditation has not been uniformly accepted nor implemented. The National Task Force on Accreditation in Health Education was charged to develop a detailed plan for a coordinated accreditation system for undergraduate and graduate programs in health education. One of the goals of the task force was to gather professionwide input into any proposed new system. We conducted two Web-based surveys to assess viewpoints on accreditation and program approval from health education professionals (n = 506) and from faculty and administrators at academic programs in health education (n = 105). Results from the surveys show that the majority of professionals in the field and at academic programs surveyed supported and would participate in a national, coordinated, professionwide accreditation system in health education. Furthermore, the majority of respondents suggested that the accreditation system should be comprehensive, flexible, build on the strengths of existing accreditation systems, and be linked to individual certification. Findings from these surveys, along with other input from the field, will help inform the final recommendations of the task force. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)",

The \"BASICS\" Intervention Program is novel in its balance and integration of the optimal aspects of instruction from direct, constructivist and contextually-based instruction designed to meet the specific needs of at-risk students. The specific focus of this program is to address the memory and recall difficulties and inability to approach, structure and solve problem-solving tasks experienced by at-risk students. In addition, the use of continuous diagnostic and formative assessment enable both teachers and students to develop positive relationships and improve student self-concept.

The program for the symposium began with a presentation by Professor Kerry Kennedy about his reflections on national curriculum in Australia over the last 30 years. This was followed by brief presentations by each of the authors of the framing papers. Discussion groups for each of the disciplines considered key questions about the papers with feedback from each group. Finally Rob Randall, the acting Director of the NCB commented on the challenges identified by the discussion groups. In this paper, the author summarises the comments and discussion about curriculum development in general and the &quot;National Mathematics Curriculum Framing Paper&quot; in particular.",

Software companies produced computer tools that looked so good that teachers forgot about writing their own classroom materials and happily purchased software--that offered much more than teachers needed--from companies that had little knowledge of pedagogy. This article encourages teachers to budget time and money for a better balance between teaching how to use powerful computer tools and writing their own materials to meet the needs of their classes.

        "description":"Spatial reasoning is a skill that needs to be developed in students as it is important in geometry for determining total surface areas and volumes of 3-dimensional shapes (Liedtke, 1995). Simply teaching children the formulae, in this case for finding total surface areas, can limit them in understanding mathematics conceptually (Bonotto, 2003). Helping students establish a relationship between the total surface area of a three-dimensional solid and the area of a two-dimensional net should help them in understanding total surface area conceptually. In this article, the author discusses the challenges pre-service secondary school teachers faced in trying to understand how to work out the surface areas of square and rectangular pyramids and a cone. The pitfalls of just giving students a formula to work with without involving them in learning where the formulas come from are presented. (Contains 11 figures and 2 footnotes.)",

        "description":"In early 2008 researchers from the University of Melbourne's &quot;New Technologies for Teaching Mathematics&quot; project created a lesson for the Year 10 students at their Victorian research schools. Two important goals of secondary school mathematics education are to build students' conceptual knowledge and to teach students to think mathematically. Mathematics education research supports the notion that seeing concepts represented in multiple ways both supports students' sense-making and enriches their learning. However the experience of working with multiple representations is not the same for experts and novices. The design of lessons must be carefully considered in order not to create excessive cognitive load for the learner. The study by the University of Melbourne team focused on one &quot;lesson&quot;, designed to provide exemplars for lessons where new powerful, mathematically able integrated documents (Nspire) are used to support students' exploration of various representations of a given mathematical problem. Based on applications of quadratic functions, &quot;Marina's Fish Shop&quot; was designed as a capstone lesson utilising TI-Nspire CAS computer and handheld technology in exploring multiple representations of a mathematical problem set in a real world context. In this article, the authors provide a description of the problem setting and the six carefully guided student activities that formed the final product of that process: (1) observing variation; (2) calculating total area; (3) graphing the area function from data; (4) finding the minimum area from the graph; (5) finding the minimum area exactly; and (6) challenge: producing a general solution.

Many mathematical rules such as area formulas can be derived in ways that are age-appropriate to students, and it is an important part of mathematics education that students engage in these derivations to some extent. A review of several Australian Year 8 textbooks showed that they generally included the reasoning behind the area formulas (Stacey &amp; Vincent, 2008). For the area of the trapezium, there was a surprising variety of methods. In this article, the authors illustrate five methods for finding the area of the trapezium, which many students will enjoy discovering these variations on a theme. The authors stress that, by exposing students to a variety of dissection methods and encouraging them to find their own variations, teachers promote flexible thinking, greater understanding and less reliance on memorised area formulas.

        "description":"Engaging students with real-world activities can be effective in supporting the learning of mathematics, &quot;whenever possible, real-world situations will provide a context for both introducing and applying geometric topics&quot; (NCTM 1989). Tool making is a way to bring real-world mathematics into the classroom and using the tool is a way of taking classroom mathematics into the student's real-world. This article focuses on a student-constructed protractor. The pedagogical discussion is followed by detailed descriptions of the construction steps. These steps together with alternative constructions offer opportunities to explore deeper mathematics. The construction of the protractor requires the use of a range of techniques that provide context for geometry problems involving congruent triangles, properties of equilateral and isosceles triangles and parallel lines. The protractor is a measurement tool used in constructing and measuring angles and is a learning aid for the teaching and learning of trigonometry, similarity and the unit circle. The author describes two activities, Super-size Protractor and Unique Triangles, which provide a shared experience for future class discourse, and outlines the steps involved in the construction of the Super-size Protractor. As each step is presented, the mathematics of the construction and alternative construction procedures is made explicit and justified along with practical considerations. A list of ways in which the protractor maybe used is presented. (Contains 12 figures.)",

In the context of neo-liberal pressures, carried by an international free-market movement in the 1980s, a wave of administrative decentralization initiatives in education rippled across Africa. In the 1990s, a wave of democratization added itself to global decentralization pressures. As these cases demonstrate, the education decentralization process in nonformal education has resulted in varied and often unintended local interpretations, reactions, and ultimately inaction despite nationally and internationally accepted EFA reform directives. The implications of the findings argue for a rethinking of participatory development for nonformal education programs in decentralized systems. (Contains 1 note.)",

        "description":"This article analyzes South Africa's efforts to promote broader participation in educational decision-making through local school governance structures in which parents serve as majority members. We utilize the &quot;theory of action&quot; framework to understand both government policy and school-level actors' meanings of two dimensions of governance: participation and representation. The analysis considers policy statements, government efforts to monitor implementation, and extensive data from parents, principals, teachers and learners in six diverse schools in two provinces. The &quot;theory-in-use&quot; among most of the school-level actors reflects the policy signals and dominates governance discourse. School governance and participation is being defined in very narrow terms that emphasize participation for efficiency reasons, rather than for democratic purposes. Parents' participation is framed by what principals view as appropriate within the boundaries of supporting the efficient running of the school. Truly re-defining roles of school level actors will require addressing power structures and conventions if it is to allow for the authentic participation of communities in the governance of schools.

Building on this foundation, the article delineates a typology of Islamic education and their associated institutions. This enhances understanding of important conceptual differences that hinge upon subtle variations of language as in the distinction between education of Muslims and for Muslims, and between teaching Islam and teaching about Islam. The article then seeks to elucidate a theoretical conception of \"Islamic education,\" that takes into consideration Islamic scripture and Prophetic statements, along with commonly-held approaches to education in Muslim history. The article concludes that key motivations and characteristics of a holistic and purposeful education program are shared between Islamic and Western traditions, a phenomenon partially explained by the shared and cumulative transmission of educational values and methods from classical times until the present.

The paper argues that, at all three levels, the discourse suffers from serious conceptual and empirical weaknesses.

The main goal of the proposed agenda is to use the curriculum for creating a tolerant, moderate, and enlightened citizenry.

ESD thus becomes a term that must be subtle yet clear, holistic yet tangible. One option for ESD, in dealing with this complexity, is to simplify its content and narrow the issues it addresses. Another more viable option for ESD is to retain a broad range of issues and related domains of knowledge while unifying the range of epistemologies it employs. The challenge then is to agree on an epistemology that is inclusive of all domains of knowledge while being practical for education initiatives in the field. This article will examine the utility of an ecosemiotic conception of the epistemological relationship between humans and nature (how we conceive of how we come to knowledge about nature), and a pragmatic method of making value judgments in helping ESD meet the challenges of complexity.",

A concerted effort to teach for--or even about--sustainability in mathematics, science, business and humanities classes is more remote still. The reasons are as various as they are predictable: &quot;poverty, ignorance, disease and violence&quot;--the real &quot;axis of evil&quot;--and high-stakes testing thrown in for good measure. In this article, the author discusses two key issues specific to education that may help teachers deal more effectively with the obstacles keeping ESD from being better known and universally embraced in the schools: 1) curriculum; and 2) school culture. The important points to retain are that ESD requires a fully integrated approach to curriculum development; that small schools are by virtue of their scale better suited to do ESD; and that ideally the physical infrastructure should reflect the values and technologies which make ESD possible.",

Based on fieldwork conducted in four Malawian schools in 2004, this article places the historical context of peace and social justice activism in Malawi in the struggle for independence, and in the theoretical concept of &quot;uMunthu.&quot; Using autobiography as a research methodology, the article discusses the approaches and implications for promoting teacher independence and activism to make teaching relevant to social change and innovation in Malawi.

        "description":"This paper examines social entrepreneurship in a Burmese refugee community as it strives to provide primary education to its children. Despite facing discrimination and fearing Thai authorities, our project leaders exemplified social entrepreneurship, most notably building social capital and agency within the refugee community, and surprisingly resolving intractable problems. Key processes included helping parents claim ownership of the program, depoliticizing the children's access to education, and encouraging high expectations of school performance. Social relationships built an internally sustainable project at virtually no cost and established bridges across antipathetic parties. We argue that the social entrepreneurship model is useful in contexts where poor communities cannot access non-governmental organizations or government agencies. (Contains 1 note.)",

In this article, we re-conceive Dees's characterization of Social Entrepreneurs as potentially achievable by all human beings and as a part of all their activity. This re-conception transforms what is possible in the human.

Five self-regulatory attributes were judged likely to be predictive of academic performance: intrinsic goal orientation, self-efficacy for learning and performance, time and study environment management, help seeking, and Internet self-efficacy. Verbal ability was used as a control measure. Performance was operationalized as final course grades. Data were collected from 94 students in a blended undergraduate marketing course at a west coast American research university (tier one). Regression analysis revealed that verbal ability and self-efficacy related significantly to performance, together explaining 12 percent of the variance in course grades. Self-efficacy for learning and performance alone accounted for 7 percent of the variance. (Contains 2 tables.)",

I argue that the key to successful online discussion forums is the ability of e-tutors to provide learners with feedback well informed in the meaning making and knowledge advancement processes emanating from learner interactions. In this paper, a newly developed concept of providing e-tutors with the information they require is explored, exhibiting the Event Centre (EC) concept, through which tutors are able to obtain periodic &quot;snapshots&quot; of the occurrences throughout discussion forums, which highlight processes of meaning construction and knowledge advancement. The EC concept provides e-tutors with visual images that depict the links and routes through which participants using text messages convey meaning, construct knowledge, and create Socio-Informational networks within discussion forums.

        "author":["Hai-Jew, Shalin"],
        "description":"Started in 1997, Washington Online Virtual Campus (WAOL) consists of a consortium of 34 community colleges around Washington State to provide asynchronous online learning. WAOL bears many of the features of a loosely coupled organization with its geographically dispersed frontline instructors, fragmented external environment, modularity of courses and supervision, and its use of enhanced leadership and technology to communicate a culture. Recent surveys of its administration, instructors, and staff found disparities in various constituencies' perspectives on the organization's culture, decision-making, values, brand or reputation, communications, and WAOL's authorizing environment. Research suggests that WAOL benefits from some aspects of loose coupling: greater adaptive abilities and responsiveness to the State's college system; &quot;fast&quot; course development and launching; and isolated breakdowns. There is, however, a persistent difficulty in conveying a cohesive culture. There is a perception of WAOL's invisibility among its varied constituencies. This organization is at a crossroads, with the threat of colleges disconnecting from this consortium. WAOL should redefine its direction and purpose, such as coupling with local universities to provide not only associates degrees but full Baccalaureate and/or Masters degrees. It may strengthen its position by improving learner supports, publicizing its decisions, creating a stronger sense of virtual community among the instructors (as in its recent creation of an online community for instructors), increased participative decision-making and use of line faculty and staff insights, and greater course varieties.

Faculty members at the University of Bahrain's College of Education are being encouraged to become involved in e-learning activities. To assess faculty opinions on e-learning, a questionnaire was sent to 30 faculty members of the University's College of Education to determine how they perceive e-learning, and how they might choose to integrate it into their everyday teaching activities. Data was collected and analyzed by using descriptive statistics. Results indicate that faculty generally perceive e-learning as a positive force in helping students' achieve their learning objectives. Answers to this questionnaire, however, also indicated areas of weakness: specifically that baseline technological and human resource prerequisites are necessary to support e-learning, and that these baseline prerequisites are not yet available at the University of Bahrain. Other baseline prerequisites are: staff training, well prepared online courses and learning materials, sufficient groundwork for the smooth transition from traditional modes of learning towards e-learning delivery, and the implementation of a more robust technological infrastructure to support all the technical aspects necessary to launch and sustain e-learning.

A comparative analysis of these two different courses revealed important similarities in dropout percentages and the reasons cited by students for dropping out. Our analysis also revealed important differences as well. This paper presents the results of a survey designed to investigate the relationship between dropout with intrinsic (student-related) factors such as sickness, work/ school conflict etc., and extrinsic (institutional-related) factors such as study methods and materials, educational approach, and tutor influence.

        "description":"Accessibility to online education programs is an important factor that requires continued research, improvement, and regulation. Particularly valuable in the enhancement of online accessibility is the Voice-over Internet Protocol (VOIP) medium. VOIP compresses analog voice data and converts it into digital packets for transmission over the Internet, enabling speech, language translation, transmission of voice cues and emotion, as well as hands-free and eyes-free navigation. VOIP applications provide significant opportunities to increase the accessibility of online distance education, by virtue of the additional features they incorporate.",

At the end of the third and sixth years of a distance delivered teacher education programme, students completed a survey to determine the extent to which the nature and characteristics of the online aspects of the programme contributed to learning and afforded affective support. Students perceived considerable value in the online interaction for both learning and support. Small groups and the whole class were seen as the dominant spaces for interaction, but there was considerable differentiation between them in terms of their contribution to affective support. The small group discussions were seen as most important for all aspects of communication but students reported non-participation by some members as a significant problem.

These are the \"copyright controllers.\" The preservation of the commons and expanding access to digital content and applications are very important for distance educators. The educational exemptions for \"fair use\" in the United States and \"fair dealing\" in the Commonwealth countries are integral to any understanding of copyright, which was instituted for the dissemination of knowledge, and not, as is commonly believed, to protect the rights of the copyright owners. Copyright law was expressly introduced to limit their rights. Yet, these controllers are successfully turning a \"copy\" right into a property right. The traditional rights of learning institutions are being taken away. The balance for researchers should be restored.

Unlike spontaneous communities, BLCs develop in direct response to guidance provided by an instructor, supported by a cumulative resource base. This article presents strategies that help learning communities develop within bounded frameworks, particularly online environments. Seven distinguishing features of learning communities are presented. When developing supports for BLCs, teachers should consider their developmental arc, from initial acquaintance and trust-building, through project work and skill development, and concluding with wind-down and dissolution of the community. Teachers contribute to BLCs by establishing a sense of \"teaching presence\", including an atmosphere of trust and reciprocal concern. The article concludes with a discussion of assessment issues and the need for continuing research. (Contains 3 figures and 2 tables.)",

Experts from the field of distance education in India were interviewed at length, with the aim of collecting qualitative data on opinions on process-issues for selecting areas for research, research design, and appropriate methodological approaches in distance education. Data collected from these interviews were subjected to content analysis; triangulation and peer consultation techniques were used for cross-checking and data verification. While the findings and recommendations of this study have limited application in that they can only be used in the specific context outlined in this paper, respondents in this study nonetheless revealed the pressing need for more process-oriented research in examining media and technology, learners and learning, and distance learning evaluation processes. Our research, which yielded interesting empirical findings, also determined that a mixed approach--one that involves both quantitative and qualitative methods--is more appropriate for conducting research in distance education in India. Qualitative evidence from our research also indicates that respondents interviewed felt that emphasis should be placed on interdisciplinary and systemic research, over that of traditional disciplinary research. Research methods such as student self-reporting, extensive and highly targeted interviews, conversation and discourse analysis, were determined to as useful for data collection for this study.",

        "description":"Marriage mentorship is one of the most effective methods through which a couple can enrich their marriage. A good mentorship relationship is based on feelings of warmth and affinity between mentors and mentees. When a relationship of trust is established, the mentees feel more freedom to express their deeper feelings and to explore new paths of mutual understanding. In what ways does the quality of interaction change when mentors and mentees interact via a technological medium such as online audio-conferencing? This paper compares three marriage mentoring experiences that employed online conferencing as the medium of interaction. Audio-conferencing methods provided a particularly warm, trusting interaction between participants, and an effective environment for learning and for practicing communication skills. The paper makes recommendations for efficient online mentoring practice, and builds on a previous discussion of online practice in the community advocacy context (Report #35 in this series).",

The 50% response rate produced 925 student responses comprising 95% as young ([less than or equal to]24 years of age), 53% female, and 79% Caucasian. One-third of the students did not participate in vigorous physical activity ([less than or equal to]3 days/week). Based on the stages of change questionnaire, 41% of the women and 35% of the men reported they were in the precontemplation or contemplation stages, as they were not active or were not exercising on a regular basis ([less than or equal to]3 times per week for 20 min or longer). Exercise-self efficacy scores were significantly different as a function of exercise stage as predicted by the stages of change theory (R[superscript 2]=0.26, P less than 0.0001). These results are consistent with earlier reports on college students and their level of physical activity. Therefore, the low cost, ease of data collection, and the short turnaround for availability of results support the usefulness of a street-based survey of young adults on a college campus to evaluate physical activity.

        "description":"This analysis determined the association between 13 selected health risk and protective factors and reporting two or more lifetime sexual intercourse partners and non-condom use for last coitus among sexually experienced U.S. rural high school students. The sample was 569 sexually experienced adolescent females and 561 sexually experienced adolescent males who participated in the national 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey and who attended rural high schools. For females, coital debut before age 15, forced sexual intercourse, physical abuse, and marijuana use were associated with having two or more lifetime sexual intercourse partners. Coital debut before 15, binge drinking, and marijuana use were associated with having two or more sexual intercourse partners for males. Coital debut before age 15, forced sexual intercourse, and regular cigarette smoking were associated with non-condom use at last coital episode for females. Forced sexual intercourse and cocaine use were associated with non-condom use at last coital episode for males. A greater number of correlates were identified for females as opposed to males. The findings suggest that rural adolescents who initiate sexual activity at an early age are at markedly greater risk of engaging in subsequent sexual risk behaviors, such as having multiple sex partners and non-condom use. Further, substance use and a history of forced sex were also prominent determinants of sexual risk-taking. The findings portend that there is value in delaying the onset of coitus until adolescents are older. Thus, risk reduction programs should encourage the postponement of sexual initiation. Finally, the findings suggest that programs that address the key role of substance use and the psychological sequelae of sexual abuse might be more effective at reducing sexual risk-taking among rural adolescents.

The sample was 1,074 college students enrolled in introductory psychology courses. Alcohol use was measured using self-report behavioral inventories. A total of 382 students participated in the study, 42% of whom attended one or more LateNight programs, and 52.7% of whom had binged within the past 2 weeks. Regression analysis results showed those who felt LateNight was a good example of having fun without using alcohol were 27% less likely to binge than those who did not believe this (p less than 0.05). Likewise, those with high perceptions of peer drinking norms were 30% more likely to party heavily than those with low perceptions (p less than 0.001). LateNight participants were significantly (p less than 0.001) less likely to drink heavily, were 14% less likely to binge (p less than 0.001), and were 20% less likely to party heavily (p less than 0.001) than nonparticipants. Respondents identifying socially with LateNight participants were 14% less likely to binge (p less than 0.05). Those more aware of university-based efforts involving policy enforcement and prevention programming were 19% more likely to binge (p less than 0.01), and 23% more likely to party heavily (p less than 0.01) than those less aware of university efforts.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which the seven responsibilities and corresponding competencies were addressed in continuing education articles found in the professional literature. The method included using the Health Competency Assessment form to code responsibilities and competencies found in all continuing education articles (n=148) published between 1997 and 2000. The census of articles was found in four peer-reviewed journals and on web sites that published such articles for Certified Health Education Specialists. All articles offered for continuing education contact hours were selected and divided equally among the five researchers to read and evaluate (interrater reliability Pi=0.76 - 0.87). Results were tabulated and analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results indicated that the responsibilities are not addressed uniformly in the continuing education articles. Responsibilities I (assessing needs) and IV (evaluating programs) were most frequently addressed. Responsibility VI (acting as a resource person) was addressed in the literature the least often. As a result of this study it can be concluded that competencies are not addressed uniformly in continuing education articles. Based on the study's findings it is suggested that editorial boards of professional journals may want to clarify the role of their respective journals in continued professional development of their readers.

The tool described in this paper involves the class working as a group on a project to design and develop an online database of interesting genes, proteins, and disorders. Students learn the complexity of life by searching for and finding data to populate the homegrown database. The project is highly extensible thereby making it possible for future classes to extend the database developed in preceding classes. (Contains 3 figures.)",

College biology students can benefit a great deal from early exposure to this resource, but insufficient background information, technical jargon, and complex statistical analyses often present considerable obstacles to entry-level students. This paper describes an instructional module on asthma that seeks to overcome some of the barriers to use of the primary scientific literature with introductory college biology classes. Twenty-four papers have been selected from major international biomedical journals reporting on clinical and epidemiological studies of asthma, each of which explores one or a few possible causes of the disorder in everyday life. A different paper is assigned to each student or group of students. Background material on asthma and alternative research designs is presented to prepare students for their assigned reading. At the conclusion of the module, each student or group presents a paper, its methods and findings, along with insights into the study's strengths and weaknesses. (Contains 2 figures.)",

        "description":"The project described in this article is less about the content area, computational cell biology, and more about the educational practice of the students and faculty involved.  Over the course of the past four years, Dr. Raquell Holmes has worked to create curricular resources that support the integration of modeling methods in biology education. For three of those years, students have been involved in the research required to develop chapters for a textbook in progress. This research experience for students is similar to other research experiences which include students identifying primary literature, participating in lab meetings, generating reports, and giving presentations. A unique feature of this research experience was its explicit focus on creating a group-learning environment. Students were hired based on their interests in the project and their willingness to work in groups. We describe the process that lead to the creation of a group-learning environment that supports the development of both students and faculty as researchers and academics. We understand this to have been a cultural, performatory process and introduce both the metaphor and practice of performance, particularly improvisation, in undergraduate education and research.

The most prominent difficulty in this introductory course, is students' poor background-knowledge, such as a lack of understanding of very basic concepts and terms, and the huge differences in students' background knowledge. In order to bring all the students to a common and adequate level of comprehension and familiarity of basic terms, thus giving a fair chance to all attending the introductory cell biology course, the chief instructor decided to build a \"primer unit\". The unit provided an overview of the subject matter of the course, and it was placed on the course website before the beginning of the course. The findings show that students who consulted the primer unit came to the course better prepared. The primer helped to reduce the gap between students who studied advanced biology in high school and those who did not. Even though the differences between students who went over the primer and those who did not was not sustained after formal learning, students reported that due to the primer they started the course less intimidated and with a better idea about what to expect.

The relative benefits of student- and instructor-centered instructional methods, or a mixture of the two methods, varied among supplemental sections. The section with the highest overall score showed the most improvement following mixed instructional methods, the two intermediate sections showed the most improvement in exam performance following student-centered instruction, and the section with the lowest overall score did not show consistent improvement.

When applied to aquatic habitats, malathion can also influence the embryogenesis of non-target organisms such as frogs and fish. We modified the frog embryo teratogen assay in \"Xenopus\" (FETAX), a standard toxicological assay, into an investigative undergraduate laboratory exercise. This exercise provided students with experience in developmental toxicology, experimental design, quantitative morphology, digital imaging, and presentation of research results. Their results demonstrated that \"Xenopus\" embryos exposed to malathion on the first or second day of development were indistinguishable from controls, while embryos exposed to malathion on the third day of development exhibited significantly bent tails and shorter body lengths. Similarly, sublethal malathion exposures also compromised early zebrafish development. To determine if this investigative laboratory exercise met its goal of fostering conceptual understanding of developmental toxicology, we compared student performance on a questionnaire before and after the laboratory exercise, which demonstrated significant improvement in conceptual understanding. Moreover, all (45/45) students successfully completed a modified FETAX and prepared posters of their results, indicating that students learned quantitative morphology and imaging skills while also gaining valuable experience in designing, executing, and communicating an experiment.

To facilitate this effort, science educators have been encouraged to design exercises that span multiple laboratory periods, encourage independent thinking, promote hypothesis-driven experimentation, and data collection and analysis. We have designed an inquiry-based, semester-long laboratory activity amenable to majors or nonmajors and to introductory or advanced biology students. This activity utilizes \"Drosophila melanogaster\", the fruit fly, as a model organism that allows students to investigate how different rearing media additives affect female fecundity measured as numbers of eggs laid. To explore the feasibility of our activity aimed in helping students learn the processes of science, we assigned the activity independently to three different student populations. These included 1) students in an undergraduate biology laboratory; 2) an independent undergraduate research project; 3) a Distance Education Biology Master's graduate student summer research project. The goal of this laboratory activity is to allow students the opportunity to design a controlled experiment, formulate testable hypotheses, identify variables, make quantitative and qualitative observations, and analyze data using a simple computer spreadsheet program.

Anomalous results have been found from secondary data analyses that would appear to stem from the procedures that have been employed during the past 15 years for the estimation of educational achievement. These estimation procedures are briefly explained and their relationships to the observed anomalies are discussed. The article concludes with a challenge to the use of Bayesian estimation procedure, while possibly appropriate for the estimation of population parameters would appear to be inadequate for modelling scores that are used in secondary data analyses. Consequently, an alternative approach should be sought to provide data on the performance of individual students, if a clearer and more coherent understanding of educational processes is to be achieved through cross-national survey research.

        "description":"Results of a previous meta-analysis of gender differences in reading achievement at the secondary school level (Lietz, in press) showed significant differences between major assessment programs. Thus, the gender gap in favour of girls was more pronounced for the assessment programs conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Programs in the United States (NAEP), for the more recent assessment programs in Australia and the Programme for the International Student Assessment (PISA) conducted by the OECD. In contrast, no such effect was found for earlier studies conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), namely the International Reading Comprehension Study 1970-71 and the International Reading Literacy Study 1990-91. Hence, this article seeks to investigate whether or not an effect exists that could be associated with the time period in which a study was conducted. In other words, the article examines whether or not the reasons for the greater gender differences in more recent assessment programs might be related to the scaling of reading scores before and after 1992.

        "description":"A major issue in educational research involves taking into consideration the multilevel nature of the data. Since the late 1980s, attempts have been made to model social science data that conform to a nested structure. Among other models, two-level structural equation modelling or two-level path modelling and hierarchical linear modelling are two of the techniques that are commonly employed in analysing multilevel data. Despite their advantages, the two-level path models do not include the estimation of cross-level interaction effects and hierarchical linear models are not designed to take into consideration the indirect effects. In addition, hierarchical linear models might also suffer from multicollinearity that exists among the predictor variables. This paper seeks to investigate other possible models, namely the use of latent constructs, indirect paths, random slopes and random intercepts in a hierarchical model.

        "description":"Currently, there has been substantial interest, in Australia and internationally, in policy activities related to outcomes-based educational performance indicators and their link with growing demands for accountability of teachers and schools. In order to achieve a fair comparison between schools, it is commonly agreed that a correction should be made for lack of equity. It is argued that student performance is influenced by three general factors: the student background, classroom and school context, and identified school policies and practices. In this article the effects of these three factors on science achievement among students in Canberra, Australia have been addressed. The effects are discussed with reference to Type A, Type B, Type X, and Type Z effects. Type A effects are school effectiveness indicators controlled for student background. Type B school effects are controlled for both student background and context variables. Type X effects are estimated with student effects, context effects and non-malleable policy effects controlled for. Finally, Type Z effects invoke school effectiveness indicators, controlled for student, context, and all identified policy effects. (Contains 3 tables and 14 figures.)",

They were inspired by the Islamic view of nature that is, mankind had a duty to \"study nature in order to discover God and to use nature for the benefit of mankind\". This knowledge was transferred to Western Europe and subsequently played an important role in revitalising a climate of learning and exploration in Europe, leading to the Renaissance in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.",

Although psychological constructs relating to academic engagement and achievement have been identified and researched in a number of cross-cultural settings this body of research has rarely been extended to the developing world. The processes by which students from majority, indigenous and under-developed nations are motivated in school are unclear. The current research sought to identify what motivates students from such demographics by investigating the psychometric properties of two instruments measuring student motivation. Three-hundred and fifty-five students from Papua New Guinea completed the Inventory of School Motivation and the General Achievement and Goal Orientation Scale. These instruments measured students' endorsement of academic (mastery and performance) and social goal orientations. Results supported the a-priori factorial structure and reliability of the instruments and deemed them to be satisfactory and useful measures of motivation in Papua New Guinea. Results are discussed in the light of motivational goal theory. (Contains 5 tables.)",

To what kind of problem does this productive benefit refer? A study of 405 middle school students solving two novel mathematics problems found that individuals utilising a feeling or free-flowing approach to reasoning were more likely to be successful in reaching a solution than those who did not. Indeed, feeling cognitions were found to have both a direct and indirect effect on the generation of a solution depending on whether mainly spatial or verbal processing was required.

The wealth of grammatical information contained within them, however, can help students to improve their English language skills and, ipso facto, their academic writing. In this study, four groups of university ESL students participated in a session to improve their use of the English article system. Two of the groups used English learners' dictionaries and two did not. The results of the study indicate that the students who used the dictionaries achieved a slightly higher number of correct answers in the given article exercises, and expressed a higher level of satisfaction with the session, than those who had not used dictionaries. It is therefore suggested that greater use be made of learners' dictionaries in ESL grammar classes and that more teaching time be allocated to exploring and utilising this valuable resource.

However, achieving additive bilingualism is made difficult by lack of minority cultural content on the curriculum and lack of educational resources. It is argued that the context approach (Bax, 2003) can be used to help overcome these difficulties and as a guide for further research. (Contains 6 footnotes and 1 table.)",

This is particularly so in an era when successful completion of education is becoming increasingly vital as the pressures of a globalised economy mean that many rural and farming businesses are struggling to prosper. The term &quot;place-based education&quot; is used by educators and researchers who have a focus on the well-being and effective learning of students. This paper explores what is meant by &quot;place-based education&quot; and how this concept of education is being implemented in some rural schools in Australia, although usually without using this term. A review of literature about effective literacy learning will demonstrate why teaching that is place-based is important for rural students. What the implementation of place-based education might look like in rural schools is also explored. (Contains 9 footnotes.)",

Space for &quot;making errors&quot; and recovering from them without impairment to becoming an effective teacher, is very limited compared to teachers and other professionals who work in cities and can become largely anonymous once they leave their working contexts. The concept of a mental map is derived from my experience as a teacher in a rural town and Soja's (1996) challenge to think differently about space and spatiality. It focuses on three domain--personal, professional and public--and is presented as a way of supporting teachers to navigate and negotiate rural places which, contrary to some popular views, are complex and challenging.",

        "description":"A structural equation modelling analysis was used to test the mediating effect of achievement goal factors on the relationship between Egyptian adolescents' perception of parental involvement and academic achievement. The perception of Parental Involvement Scale and Achievement Goal Questionnaire was administered to a sample of 255 first-year students (135 males and 120 females) enrolled in a high school in El-Minia city in Egypt during 2005. Achievement scores were obtained from students' school records. Results of the study revealed that students' performance-approach and mastery goals were the most important predictors of students' academic achievement, followed by at-home parental involvement, at-school parental involvement, and finally performance-avoidance goals. At-home parental involvement had an indirect effect on students' academic achievement through mastery goal. At-school parental involvement had an indirect effect on academic achievement through mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals. Implications of these findings for students' academic achievement are discussed. (Contains 1 footnote, 3 tables, and 2 figures.)",

A central purpose of the conference was to introduce participants to the possibilities that qualitative approaches to research offer educational evaluation. However, it provided more than an opportunity to simply explore the application of qualitative techniques to educational evaluation. The conference situated those techniques within a broad, Action Research, planning framework so that by the end of the conference, participants would be able to design, implement, and manage entire evaluation projects.",

        "description":"Adolescence marks the beginning of a significant shift away from the world of parental support to the formation of intimate friendships with peers. Developmentally, this is an important time for adolescents as they seek to develop interpersonal skills, share activities and develop a deeper sense of understanding of themselves and others through shared confidences and self-disclosure. This is particularly the case for adolescent girls, who value the intimacy they find in small close-knit friendship groups. However, these groups, due to their intimate structure, can become a breeding ground for conflict including indirect aggression. This paper examines one girl's experience of the hurt and alienation she suffered within her friendship group. An interventionist approach using Narrative Therapy and the practices associated with externalising the problems within her friendship group allowed this girl to reclaim her sense of self and reconstruct new expectations for the inclusion of new friends in her life.",

In support of the multidimensional perspective of self-concept, results of the random effects model analyses suggest that targeting specific self-concept domains when measuring self-concept outcomes lead to higher effect sizes (p less than 0.001). Interestingly, the treatment setting, intervention administrator type, administrator training, and the use of standardisation procedures were not significant moderators. The implications for self-concept intervention administration in school settings are discussed. (Contains 1 footnote and 5 tables.)",

Do changes in academic self-concept and academic motivation lead to changes in subsequent academic achievement? Various studies have attempted to answer this question by examining the causal relations between academic self-concept and academic achievement as well as academic motivation and academic achievement. Less integral to research however has been the investigation of the relationship between both academic self-concept and academic motivation and their combined effects on academic achievement. For this reason, this paper aims to elucidate further the relationships among self-concept, motivation and academic achievement by proposing a longitudinal design by which self-concept and motivation are measured from a multidimensional perspective. The theoretical and practical implications of this important question will be discussed. (Contains 1 footnote and 1 figure.)",

Student responses were recorded and evaluated in an attempt to understand what misconceptions were held by the students, how they acquired them. The study showed that the level of misconceptions varied between concepts.

In order to confirm this, Grade 10 students' motivation level was measured using two questions. Language gains were also measured and compared with the motivation level. The other strand aims to discover, by observing classes using Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching (COLT) what other factors facilitate learning outcomes. Statistical analyses of the relationship between the two variables, motivational level and language gains indicate that motivation was not a predictor for the Grade 10 students in the study. Nor were many of the language class features included in the COLT. The most powerful predictors of language gains were found in more implicit teachers' beliefs about their students' capacities and their expectations of their students' achievement.

        "description":"The aims of this paper are (a) to investigate how adolescents perceive and represent the body form with respect to being fat or thin, and (b) to describe the process of how they constructed the social representations for these latter two body conditions. The data were collected by means of individual and focus group interviews with adolescent female students in Brazil who were from 11 to 21 years of age. When the adolescents were questioned about their bodies, they talked about \"being fat\" or \"being thin\", even though they were not asked about weight issues. Following their own logic, they did not portray \"feeling fat\" and \"feeling thin\" as related to their \"real\" body condition or weight. Furthermore, in the adolescents' discourse, the concept of \"normal weight\" was virtually non-existent and was characterised as \"nothing\" or \"more or less\". By the end of the interviews, their depictions of these conditions of body weight included links from the body to their social relationships in the form of perceived group exclusion or inclusion. In our discussion we describe the adolescents' collective discourses on being fat or thin as integrated social representations, which incorporate both the physical and interpersonal dimensions of their experiences. We conclude by examining the practical implications of our findings for female adolescent behaviour, especially with respect to obsessive dieting and possible eating disorders. Finally we explore the possibility of educational programs to counter the media and other influences which give rise to the negative aspects of social representations of the body by adolescents.

        "author":["Lee, Moosung"],
        "description":"This article examines the interplay between school factors and teacher job satisfaction that influences educational outcomes by comparing two Non-governmental Organisation (NGO) schools in Cambodia. This small-scale qualitative case study was conducted over a period of eight weeks in 2005 in two NGO schools in a suburb of Phnom Penh. The findings show that teacher job satisfaction is crucially influenced by remunerative incentives such as salary level and welfare conditions. However, job satisfaction is also intertwined with non-remunerative incentives such as school management, principal leadership, professional development, and a meaningful sense of life through teaching. That is, both remunerative and non-remunerative incentives are associated with teacher job satisfaction. However, according to different school conditions, either remunerative or non-remunerative incentive is more prioritised by teachers. Finally, the different job satisfaction between the two faculties seems to result in the educational gap such as student enrolment rates and achievement between the schools.

The purpose of this study is to explore how and why students from different cultural backgrounds are motivated to communicate and interact with each other. It is based on the premise that a given culture prescribes how and why individuals are motivated to interact with others from different cultural backgrounds. In order to provide a holistic view that would account for the multi-faceted and subtle nuances of human behavior in communication, a naturalistic inquiry approach was adopted to explore the communication patterns of groups of students from predominantly individualistic and collectivistic cultures. The findings indicate layers of differences in the way students relate across cultures in class as well as social environments. The implications for inter-cultural communication for educators are discussed using the individualism-collectivism dimension. (Contains 2 tables.)",

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of past performance on students at three faculties, namely, Faculty of Economics and Administration(FEA), Faculty of Business and Accounting(FBA) and Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences(FASS). Students' prior achievements include their entry scores or points in English language proficiency and mathematics at the Malaysian Certificate of Education (MCE) level. Other factors taken into consideration are gender of students and their ethnic origins. Research results show that entry points are an important factor in influencing students' achievement in all three faculties. Apart from this, female students are found to have better results than their male counterparts in FBA and FASS. It was also found that mathematics performance at the MCE level is one of the influential factors for academic achievement in FBA. (Contains 1 table and 4 figures.)",

Large class size, low enrollment rate, girl's education, high illiteracy rate, religious education, textbooks, curriculum and multicultural education are some of the important problems. On the other hand, cultural diversity, economical problems and lack of resources, migration, central management, the rapid growth in school-age population and regional differences make the solution difficult. In principle, privatization could help in the solution of the problems in Turkey. Private schools can increase the quality of education. Private schools can share responsibility with the government by investing money in education. In addition, private schools can also meet the needs for diversity in society promoting specific religious or philosophical views by using their own teaching methods. The paper describes the availability of private schooling in Ankara as a baseline for thinking about the development of private schooling in Turkey. (Contains 3 footnotes, 6 tables, and 1 figure.)",

Eighty-six MSc students in Computing Science participated by using She and Fisher's (2002) Teacher Communication Behavior Questionnaire (TCBQ). In addition to using the questionnaire, data from the electronic class site were used to make assessments about the quality and quantity of communication. Two types of classrooms were evaluated: a) a control condition in which the lecturer did not alter any communication aspect of the module, and b) the experimental condition in which the lecturer posted weekly discussion topics. Significant differences were found by cultural background and gender of the students. The bulletin board postings in the experimental condition were more heavily content-based than the control condition ones. The consistency in discussion topic of the experimental condition postings, both bulletin board and email, were more fluid than in the control condition. Contains 1 table.)",

Data collected from teacher trainees are analyzed and discussed in relation to Swedish governmental policies concerning teacher education and distance education and theories emphasizing the importance of social aspects of education. The findings indicate working conditions that are mainly controlled by the teacher education program, and that teacher trainees to a high degree are fostered into individualism. Exceptions are in group work, which on the other hand seems to be given only minor attention in teacher education. This raises questions related to the intentions of teacher education. First, there are questions concerning issues of flexibility and choice, more precisely about what aspects are flexible or not. Second, there are questions concerning possibilities of teacher education providing an education that enables teacher trainees to develop the competencies needed to be able to teach.

Part one of this article gives both quantitative and qualitative examples of growing economic inequalities, and posits reasons why this is detrimental to human society. Part two provides evidence that an equitable redistribution approach to education may serve as part of an answer to these   problems.

        "description":"Educational researchers in the United States contend that making low-performing students repeat a grade is an ineffective educational practice. This view derives largely from the summary of grade retention research reported by Holmes (1989). A meta-analysis of more recent studies (Jimerson, 2001) also concludes that the practice of grade retention should be abandoned. However, a thorough examination of the published articles within each of these two meta-analyses reveals that many of the individual studies evidence inadequate research designs and faulty conclusions. The overwhelming majority of conclusions from grade retention studies are unwarranted due to the poor quality of research. Overlooked and more recent retention and grade repartition studies suggest that making students repeat a grade may help increase academic achievement. This review contends that research studies do not support the contention that grade retention is always inappropriate. Suggestions for improving future retention studies are offered.

The five identified topics were: lesson organisation, lesson outcomes, teacher communication, teaching strategies, and cultural inclusion. In order to address the needs of students, the five topics have been grouped into two student-focused themes: (a) the learning environment and (b) teacher-student communication.

        "description":"The Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training on May 2005 commissioned the Australian Council for Educational Research to investigate and report on models and implementation arrangements for an Australian Certificate of Education. There are ten different certificates currently available across the six states and two territories of Australia that provide a senior secondary school qualification. The first recommendation made by the Review is for national agreement on what should be taught in each school system. The second recommendation is for students across Australia to be assessed against the same standards. This requires the development of natural so-called &quot;achievement achievement standards&quot; in each subject assessed. A third recommendation is that students are required to demonstrate acceptable levels of achievement of a few key capabilities. A final recommendation is that further work needs to be done to explore how employability skills may be assessed in a consistent way as part of the Australian Certificate of Education. In conclusion, it is emphasised that there is need for a &quot;common currency&quot; or common language for reporting all senior secondary subject results. There is also a need for national debate on what Australia senior secondary school students should be learning during their final years of secondary schooling, regardless of where they live.

        "description":"This paper is a response to the paper prepared by Masters that is titled &quot;The case for an Australian Certificate of Education&quot;. It argues that a national debate is needed urgently on the many issues that have arisen in Australian education. These issues include not only the curriculum provided for students at the final stages of secondary schooling, and the certification of attainment of educational outcomes on completion of 12 years of schooling, but also the curriculum of schools across Australia, particularly at the lower and middle secondary school levels. In addition, there are related issues associated with participation in higher education and the completion of a first degree at an Australian university. All too often, decisions are made at all levels of education on ideological grounds and without consideration of the body of research findings that are available to guide the making of decisions and the monitoring of development and change. This paper draws on readily available research to show the similarities and differences between the state education systems to argue a case for informed debate that draws on the large body of evidence that is available.

        "description":"The South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), introduced in 1992-93, is a credential and formal qualification within the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF). SACE was recently subjected to a review that led to a series of significant recommendations. These recommendations came out of a process that began with the Review Panel scrutinizing existing SACE structures for continuing validity and effectiveness. This paper critically examines claims made by the Review Panel of a resounding confirmation of the need for reform. Since the panel's claims are built upon qualitative data (community submissions), they are critiqued using widely-accepted standards for qualitative research. In particular, this paper examines the panel's evidence regarding &quot;academic creep&quot;, the dominance of the academic pathway, and issues regarding the Tertiary Entrance Rank. The findings suggest that the panel's case for reform may apply more to government schools than to the SACE itself. This paper concludes that the case for reform is poorly developed and largely supported by research lacking transparency and unsuited to making generalizations. (Contains 5 tables.)",

The Review saw the South Australian education system operating in a context that was limited to the geographical and cultural boundaries of the state. This paper discusses both of these issues that appear to require the resolution of conflicting and incompatible problems. In conclusion the paper considers the changing nature of schooling and the role of alternative education in both schools and programs and rejects the continuance of comprehensive schooling at the upper secondary school level within a bureaucratic education system. The paper argues that different types of schools should be gradually established through the self-management and self-governance of schools by the communities served and the choices made by the students who attend the schools and their parents, and who support them while they are engaged in upper secondary education.",

        "description":"This is the second of two papers investigating the adjustment process in a designated group of expatriates, (teachers), who have severed ties with their home country and employer. In the first paper we examined the effect of self-efficacy and flexibility within this adjustment process, revealing the significance of self-efficacy but failing to show a pronounced relationship between flexibility and adjustment (von Kirchenheim and Richardson, 2005). In this particular study, again based on existing literature, the value of self-esteem and pay satisfaction on the adjustment process was explored. Again, it was hypothesised that adjustment would result in reduced turnover intention, increased life satisfaction, and higher job satisfaction. Based on our findings, there would now appear to be some clear implications for individuals and organisations involved in the expatriation process. More specifically, from a personal point of view, there is evidence to suggest a direct relationship between specific personal characteristics, pay satisfaction, job satisfaction, and turnover intention. In essence, those who score high on scales which measure self-efficacy and pay satisfaction would appear to be the ones most likely to find success within the international relocation process. Thus, from an organisational perspective, the accurate measurement of some of these identified intrinsic and extrinsic factors may provide valuable information to the employer regarding those applicants that have the greatest probability of adjustment. Given that both studies looked exclusively at educators in its sampling, the implications for faculties of education, who are seeing increasing numbers of their graduates accept postings in foreign jurisdictions, are profound.

The range of careers they nominated was very narrow, with teaching, nursing and other white collar work in the majority of responses. This stands in somewhat stark contrast to projected labour force needs, and the current serious shortage of skilled workers in key growth industries. Data on factors influencing pupil career choice indicated that over 80 per cent knew someone about the kind of job they were aiming for, and that many of these people were adults in their local environment. This finding emphasises the role schools must play if the skilled human resource potential of Fiji is to be realised. Schools in which a well-supported technical and vocational training program (TVET) was established tended to show much wider career ambitions, not only for TVET students but also for students in the academic strands.

In this research, three modes of webcasting lectures were experimented on three different groups of students, using the pre test-post test-control group experimental design. The modes are live streaming, pre-recorded streaming and video on demand (VOD). The group that attended the face-to-face lecture acts as the control group.

The data were collected by means of open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews from the participation of 55 primary school student teachers. Supplementary data were gathered through semi-structured interviews from five class mentors. The results demonstrate important issues such as the unshared understanding of student teachers' teaching experiences between class mentors and the teacher education institution, and that the mentoring program is inadequate in terms of time management. It is suggested that the class mentors should be helped to open up an important opportunity for how to evaluate their practices in order to evaluate those which the student teachers experience.",

A paradigm that is gaining ground in many educational circles is differentiated instruction. This model proposes a rethinking of the structure, management and content of the classroom, inviting participants within the learning context to become engaged in the process, to the benefit of all. While the model has been accepted and set to work, there remains room for theoretical support to give it momentum. A recent, comprehensive analysis of the literature in this area examines this model, within the context of increasing academic diversity. This paper therefore seeks to synthesise the research supporting a shift to a new exemplar for modern education, and in so doing shed light on the rationale supporting differentiated instruction.",

        "description":"This paper uses Baxter Magolda's (1992) framework on ways of knowing to examine the effects of using multimedia case studies with beginning pre-service teachers (PSTs). Baxter Magolda referred to these ways of thinking as absolute, transitional, independent, and contextual. The written responses to two sets of tasks were analysed for 36 PSTs enrolled in their first education course at a large private university. The first task had the PSTs watch parts of a multimedia case and then discuss what they saw with peers and a facilitator. The second task had the subjects interact and make sense of a different multimedia case individually. Using Baxter Magolda's framework, each PST's responses to the events were coded. Results indicate that working together PSTs operated within contextual ways of knowing more often than they did when working alone. Implications for teacher educators are discussed.

        "author":["Felipe, Abraham I."],
        "description":"The present study tested the assumption of a positive and linear relation between years of schooling and school learning in the Philippine setting. It replicated a 1976 study that had cast doubt on this assumption in the Philippine public educational system. It tested three competing hypotheses for that finding: common sense, the 1976 arrested development hypothesis, and the alternative accelerated development hypothesis. To test these competing hypotheses, two factors were systematically varied: the grade levels of Ss and the levels of the tests used. The competing hypotheses have different predicted outcomes. A total n of 7097 from 96 schools participated in the study. The results showed that on all tests Grade 5 showed more competencies than Grades 4 and 6, although Grade 6 continued to perform better than Grade 4. When sub-test level was held constant in multiple comparisons, Grade 5 was learning more Grade 6 competencies, whereas Grade 6 was losing not only Grade 6 but also Grade 5 competencies. It is noted that whereas Grade 6 enjoyed a slight superiority in achievement scores circa 1976, the present study shows that Grade 5 enjoys an impressive superiority over Grade 6 circa 2003. That in Grade 6 one knows more competencies than in Grade 5 seems to be a myth. The common sense hypothesis has been ruled out. The results are consistent with the accelerated development hypothesis.

This paper presents an action research study that investigates the role of culture in a Chinese language program in a kindergarten classroom. Three topics have been explored: (a) culture as the core in the development of a thematic unit on Chinese festivals, (b) a culturally responsive pedagogy as a model of instruction, and (c) the assessment of student learning. Nine kindergarten children participated in this study. The thematic unit was undertaken for eight consecutive weeks. Five major Chinese festivals were integrated into this unit; the teaching and learning processes were examined to explore the application of a culturally responsive pedagogy. Diagnostic, formative, and summative assessments were administered to explore the children's learning. The assessments were based the participants' oral response to one-to-one interviews, their written responses on the Pictorial Attitudes Scale in a whole-group session, cultural artefacts, and drawing and writing products.

        "description":"In recent years, due to economic restructuring, the problems Hong Kong has been facing are the &quot;knowledge deficit&quot; in the workforce and a shortage of well-educated manpower. The Hong Kong Government has implemented a number of continuing education policies with an ultimate goal to encourage and help the workforce to strengthen themselves with improved knowledge and skills. These policies rely on short-term inducements such as providing monetary subsidies and loans. As the recipients of inducements differ in their capacities, preferences and objectives, there exist problems of variability that depreciate the intended outcomes. Moreover, the long-term needs are undermined. Because of the lack of an overall plan and coordination, there are areas of duplication and inconsistency among the policies, leading to counter-effective administration. In this article, the recent continuing education policies in Hong Kong are reviewed critically with respect to the problems and community needs as well as the policy objectives and possible solutions. The Government's promises and shortcomings are discussed. (Contains 4 tables.)",

        "description":"Dropout statistics for 1986 indicated that only 55% of dropouts under age 20 were employed, only 31% of male dropouts and one in seven female dropouts were working full-time, and although dropouts were fewer than 20% of the adult population, they constituted 66% of the national prison population. Since that time, the economic costs of dropping out have risen markedly as the workplace increasingly demands better-skilled and more technologically savvy workers. Data reported by the states to the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) annually suggest that efforts since the mid 1990s are paying off. OSEP reports that in the 1999-2000 school year, the dropout rate among youth with disabilities was 29.4%, a decline of 4.7 percentage points over 5 years (U.S. Department of Education, 2002). A comparison of findings regarding school completion from National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) and the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2) permits a longer view of the changing pattern of school completion from 1987 through 2003. It also draws on reports of individual youth with disabilities or their parents, rather than relying on aggregate statistics, which can underestimate dropout rates. In this article, the author identifies the rates at which youth with disabilities left high school in a 2-year period. Rates are calculated by dividing the number of youth reported to have left school in a particular way (e.g., by graduating) by the total number of youth who had left school. Rates are reported for youth with different primary disability classifications, and who differ in age, gender, household income, and race/ethnicity, when significant. (Contains 6 endnotes.)",

Projections for the next decade suggest that the strongest job growth will be in occupations requiring postsecondary education. This article examines changes between 1987 and 2003 in the postsecondary education enrollment of youth with disabilities who had been out of secondary school up to 2 years, as measured in the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) and the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2). It focuses on participation in three types of institutions--2-year/community colleges; 4-year colleges; and postsecondary vocational, technical, or business schools. The article begins with a discussion of change over time in youth's experiences with programs designed to help those who dropped out of high school earn a high school diploma. It continues with an examination of changes in enrollment rates at postsecondary institutions for youth with disabilities as a whole and for youth who differed in their disability category, high-school-exit status, age, gender, household income, and race/ethnicity, when significant. The article concludes with findings regarding changes in the extent to which students attended postsecondary school full- or part-time. (Contains 5 endnotes.)",

        "description":"This report has documented changes between 1987 and 2003 in several important outcomes of youth with disabilities who had been out of high school up to 2 years, as measured in NLTS and NLTS2. The stage was set for interpreting these findings in two earlier reports (Wagner Cameto, & Newman, 2003; Wagner, Newman, & Cameto, 2004), which examined change over time in the characteristics and school experiences of youth with disabilities while they still were in secondary school. They offered clues regarding the differences that might be expected between the early postschool outcomes of youth with disabilities in the mid-1980s and their peers more than a decade and a half later. Here, the author addresses the extent to which the changes over time in the early postschool experiences of youth with disabilities were consistent with the patterns of change documented in earlier reports. The reports concluded that there was much \"good news\" in the changes documented for in-school youth, although several causes for concern also were apparent. The same mixed picture is apparent when early postschool experiences are the focus of attention. (Contains 2 endnotes.)",

Focus groups and interviews were conducted with 31 parents from Native American, African American and Hispanic communities, and 10 professionals who had involvement in transition planning. Coding of the transcripts using established ethnographic and content analysis techniques revealed seven main categories or types of barriers which appear to inhibit or prevent parental involvement in school-based transition planning: (a) power imbalance; (b) psychological or attitudinal; (c) logistic; (d) information; (e) communication; (f) SES and contextual factors; and (g) cultural influences. In the qualitative study, parents and professionals also identified a number of potential strategies for increasing or better supporting parental involvement in transition planning. These strategies included: (a) positive communication between parent and professionals; (b) preparing for transition at an earlier age; (c) information on school-based transition planning; (d) use of a parent advocate; (e) emotional support for parents; and (f) flexibility in meeting formats.

        "description":"\"The Toolbox Revisited\" is a data essay that follows a nationally representative cohort of students from high school into postsecondary education, and asks what aspects of their formal schooling contribute to completing a bachelor's degree by their mid-20s. The universe of students is confined to those who attended a four-year college at any time, thus including students who started out in other types of institutions, particularly community colleges. \"The Toolbox Revisited\" uses the most recently completed of the national grade-cohort longitudinal studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. The study, known as the NELS:88/2000, began with a national sample of eighth-graders in 1988. They were scheduled to be in the 12th grade and graduate from high school in 1992. They were followed through December 2000. In addition to regular interviews with these students, the data set on which this essay draws includes the critical components of high school and college transcripts, and the transcript data are the principal sources for the academic history observed. Here, the author offers themes, highlights, and implications of the data for those who comment on secondary and higher education and make decisions about institutional or system policy--editorial writers, legislators, researchers, education administrators.

        "description":"Compared to its predecessor, \"Answers in the Tool Box,\" the preponderance of the \"Toolbox Revisited\" story has been on the postsecondary side of the matriculation line. Implicitly, it calls on colleges, universities, and community colleges to be a great deal more interventionary in the precollegiate world, to be more self-reflective about the paths they offer from high school through their own territories. It also calls on them both to fortify their institutional research capacities and integrate them more intimately with academic advising and course scheduling. Beyond the fundamental banner of institutional fortification, there are three sets of messages impelled by both studies. In this article, the author discusses these three sets of messages and describes the problems of dissonant statistics that are thrown around about student progress and the language used in describing what happens to the education system. The author illustrates a few paired terms that are contrary rhetorics and provides reiterations of themes and conclusions. (Contains 1 figure, 17 tables and 2 endnotes.)",

Results indicate that the transition plans of foster youth with disabilities were poor in quality, both in absolute terms and in comparison to youth who are in special education only. The review of transition plans suggests that foster youth may often go through the transition plan process with no parent advocate or educational surrogate, that professionals have limited expectations for foster youth, and that the transition plan document often does not support accountability or serve as a road map for moving into adulthood. The importance of student-directed, meaningful transition planning, services and supports for youth in foster care with disabilities is emphasized. In addition, the need for collaborative efforts between the child welfare system and special education is discussed. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"What are the characteristics of professional development that improve teaching practice? This report addresses this question, using data from the National Evaluation of the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. The Eisenhower program is part of the federal government's efforts to support education reform based on high standards. The success of standards-based reforms depends on teachers' ability to foster both basic knowledge and advanced thinking and problem solving among their students, and such effective practices require teachers to have a deep understanding of the content they teach. Professional development is considered an essential mechanism for deepening teachers' content knowledge and developing their teaching abilities. This report focuses on the effects of professional development on improving classroom teaching practice. Using a purposefully selected sample of teachers in 30 schools, in 10 districts, in 5 states, it examines the quality of teachers' professional development in Eisenhower and other professional development activities and its effects on changing teaching practice in mathematics and science from 1996-1999. This report draws on the survey data from the Longitudinal Study of Teacher Change (LS TC) and augments the results from the earlier work based on the National Profile and Case Studies. Although the National Eisenhower Evaluation as a whole was designed to focus on several research questions addressing the type and quality of Eisenhower activities, who participates in them, how they fit into other reform efforts, and how they are managed and implemented, this report focuses on one particular research question: Do teachers' experiences in Eisenhower-assisted professional development activities, in the context of other professional development activities, contribute to changes in teaching practice?

        "description":"Over the past decade, a large body of literature has emerged on professional development,  teacher learning, and teacher change. The research literature contains a mix of large- and small-scale studies, including intensive case studies of classroom teaching, evaluations of programs designed to improve teaching and learning, and surveys of teachers about their preservice preparation and inservice professional development experiences. In addition, there is a considerable amount of literature describing \"best practices\" in professional development, drawing on expert experiences. Despite the amount of literature, however, relatively little systematic research has been conducted on the effects of professional development on improving teaching or on improving student outcomes. Given the need for new, systematic research on the effectiveness of alternative strategies for professional development, an evaluation of the Eisenhower Professional Development Program was designed in order to examine the relationship between professional development and change in teaching practice in both a cross-sectional, national probability sample of teachers and a smaller, longitudinal sample of teachers. The results from the national sample of teachers are described in detail in the second-year report, \"Designing Effective Professional Development: Lessons from the Eisenhower Program\" (Garet et al., 1999). This article summarizes these results and explains how they serve as the foundation for the longitudinal study of teachers. (Contains 11 endnotes.)",

In particular, three years of data on teaching practice are used to describe trends and differences across teachers and schools in the three broad aspects of teaching practice: (1) the overall alignment of teaching with national standards, using the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) as the national standard; (2) teachers' emphasis on the six performance goals (i.e., memorize, understand concepts, perform procedures, generate hypotheses, collect, analyze/interpret, and make connections); and (3) teachers' use of the four pedagogical strategies (i.e., teacher-centered instruction, individual seatwork, active instruction, and discussion-oriented instruction). This article first reports patterns in teacher change over the three-year period of the study on alignment, performance goal emphasis, and pedagogical strategies. Then it analyzes differences in teaching practice between subjects and school levels, schools, and teachers and for individual teachers over time. (Contains 6 endnotes.)",

        "description":"The Eisenhower Professional Development Program's primary goal is to support professional development for teachers that will improve classroom practice and, ultimately, student achievement. A multiyear evaluation of the Eisenhower Program sought to provide information to help the Eisenhower Program, and other professional development efforts, achieve this important goal. The evaluation was intended to help policymakers and program managers by (1) describing professional development activities supported by the Eisenhower program and the way they are managed and implemented; and (2) evaluating the effects of the professional development activities on teaching practice. To describe Eisenhower-funded activities and the effects of professional development on teaching practice, the national evaluation included both a nationally representative cross-sectional component and a more focused longitudinal component. This report describes the Longitudinal Study of Teacher Change which examines the effects of Eisenhower-assisted and other professional development on teachers in 30 schools. The study finds that high-quality professional development that focuses on specific teaching strategies does affect teaching practice and that this effect is stronger if the professional development has the six dimensions of quality identified in the analysis of a national sample of teachers. Results show that the most effective professional development is focused on specific higher-order teaching strategies and has features of high quality. The national data, however, show that on average, teachers do not experience high-quality professional development.",

        "description":"Many changes are taking place in our country. Technology continues to impact on the workplace, demographics are changing the face of our neighborhoods, communities, and work environments. Globalization is placing greater demands on the economy and on workers. Educators and employers must face the challenge of how to prepare learners for new roles that they will play in this ever emerging workplace. In this context, consideration must be given to how the U.S. education and training system can evolve to better meet the needs of the 21st-century workforce. Challenges from the private and public sectors will include improving educational outcomes at the primary and secondary levels and developing current and effective opportunities for career development. When paralleling workforce preparation curricula, field trips are valuable learning experiences in the career exploration process and can provide unexpected benefits where examples talked about in the classroom can be related to real-world situations. For individuals with disabilities, field trips can create challenges for students and educators, including medical issues, accessibility issues, behavior management issues, and processing issues. Virtual field trips (VFTs) are one example of a time-worthy career exploration tool that has been enhanced by technology. New technologies in the next 10 years will offer tremendous potential to revolutionize the way education and training are delivered in order to improve efficiency and effectiveness in learning. The locations that a classroom teacher can use with professionally developed VFTs are limited to those presently posted on the Web, and these may or may not correspond to the specific instructional needs of a workforce preparation curriculum or to the special needs of specific learners. Teacher-created VFTs offer a number of advantages to workforce educators and students. The general steps for creating a customized curriculum-based virtual field trip are outlined in this article.

An adaptation of a survey designed by Staab (1996) was used to assess the attitudes of school psychologists (N = 125) and transition coordinators (N = 66) in Pennsylvania and included transition-related tasks within the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) categories of Consultation, Assessment, Direct Services, and Program Planning/Evaluation (NASP, 1992). Results indicate that school psychologists and transition coordinators report similar ratings of involvement and importance. Most significantly, both school psychologists and transition coordinators reported greater ratings for importance than for involvement indicating that both groups believe that school psychologists should be more involved in transition planning than they are currently. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed. (Contains 3 tables.)",

        "description":"This article describes an innovative school-to-work transition program incorporating identified best practices. Iowa's Super Senior program serves students in the &quot;middle range&quot; of the disability severity spectrum during the student's senior and 5th, or &quot;Super Senior&quot; year. The article describes the program elements, presents outcome data, describes the funding mechanism used to sustain the program after the initial federal grant and offers recommendations for transition practice. Iowa's High School Super Senior program has three central elements: (1) Person-Centered Career Planning--where family members, friends and professionals come together to help a student identify their skills, interests, support needs, ideal job match action plan to reach their career goals; (2) Multiple, short-term vocational experiences to help students develop/refine their goals; and (3) Extended Internships and Ongoing Support--during the student's &quot;Super&quot; senior year to develop work skills and employer/co-worker connections that will result satisfying employment that can be maintained into adulthood. 153 students entered Super Seniors 2001 through 2004-05. Of those, 85% participated in the program for at least two years. Of the 153 students served and 125 who completed two program years, 116 exited school with paid employment, with 68 (59%) obtaining full-time jobs and 50% receiving employer benefits. The 116 employed students represented 76% of all participants and 84% of those who completed two or more program years as intended under the model. The employment outcomes for students who completed at least two years in the program were far superior to those who only participated in one year. Specifically, 84% of those who exited after two or more years were employed and only 39% of the students who chose not to complete two years in the program exited school with jobs. In comparison to program entry, students who were employed at program exit increased their hours worked an average of 394% (6.4 hrs. to 31.4 hrs./ week), increased hourly wages by 240% ($2.33 to $7.93/hour) and monthly wages by 612% ($159 to $1,133/month).

        "description":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a motivationally designed instructional text on motivation and learning. The foundation for motivational design was provided by the combination of a model of motivation in self-regulated learning and the ARCS-approach. The model of motivation is based on concepts like expectancies, incentives, and action control. The ARCS-approach included instructional strategies to enhance attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. Within an experimental study, 75 undergraduate students learned with self-instructional texts. One group learned with a text in which ARCS-strategies were implemented, the other group with a text without any motivational features. Results showed that the ARCS-strategies leaded to positive and negative effects on different motivational indicators of self-regulated learning (i.e., situation-outcome-, action-outcome-, outcome-consequence-expectancies, incentives, action control, personal evaluations of the learning process, and short- and long-term knowledge acquisition). Finally, implications for further research and instructional design are discussed. (Contains 1 figure and 2 tables.)",

The module consists of an aggregation of learning objects including video segments, a bibliography and discussion forum activities. The module specifies an instructional sequence through reliance on a problem-solving model. Two rounds of module testing using WebCT[TM] were conducted.

The literature suggests that hypermedia instructional environments are more likely to engage cognitively field independent learners. This active engagement may be the result of the non-structured and explorative nature of hypermedia environments, whereas field dependent learners prefer a more prescriptive and linear style of instruction. Following a review of both these learning style constructs and research studies associated with hypermedia environments, the paper provides a summary of implications together with potential avenues for future research.",

In order to develop such a model, studies from literary text research were analyzed. Literary text research was chosen as a starting point because Multimedia environments often contain texts (or stories) with an emotional quality. Analyzing and optimizing such texts or stories have a long tradition within this kind of research. The resulting model relates Multimedia elements, story elements (e.g., foregrounding), perceptual-cognitive-emotional processes (e.g., presence), and emotional outcomes (e.g., pleasantness) to each other. Theoretical implications concern the expansion of the model in respect to other Multimedia elements and to the integration with existing cognitive and motivational approaches. Methodological implications focus on suggestions for measurement development. Practical implications deal with Multimedia design and dramaturgical e-learning strategies. (Contains 1 figure.)",

In this article I explore how the multimedia instructional strategies and processes can be enhanced by incorporating the principles of cognitive psychology in the design phases. Human cognitive architecture involves both, a limited working memory with visual and auditory channels, and a permanent long-term memory for storing multiple schemas. Understanding and tapping the rich potencies afforded by the human cognitive architecture would result in a more purposeful instructional program embedded in multimedia-mediated learning environments.

In this project we address this issue by developing an innovative instructional design in which collaborative groups of students working at distance create, share and assess learning content (in the form of learning objects) with their peers through online learning portals. The results of this process are assessed via surveys, discussions, reflective essays and peer evaluations. We conclude that instructional models based upon student construction of content and orchestration of learning activities can reduce instructor workload, provide opportunity for students to acquire new skills while increasing their subject content knowledge, and create a lasting legacy of reusable learning objects.

The research question to be answered was: &quot;To what extent are online courses delivered at community colleges in Illinois cost efficient?&quot; The study found that online programs at 83% of the community colleges participating in the study were &quot;not&quot; cost efficient and did &quot;not&quot; provide a positive return on investment. These findings are &quot;not&quot; consistent with the literature. Cost-effectiveness was supported in most other studies, but it was noted that costs varied substantially and were influenced by many factors. (Contains 20 figures.)",

        "description":"The constant flow of alarming economic and business news, rapidly declining endowments and potential disruption to the student-loan industry have all beaten down optimism about higher education's financial and strategic outlook. Universities large and small have announced budget cuts, layoffs, salary freezes, capital spending slowdowns and other initiatives to batten down the hatches for the recession. Concern for the financial position of colleges and universities is well-founded, given the large degree of uncertainty about the future of the U.S. and global economy. Clearly, 2009 will be a year of re-evaluation of underlying assumptions for endowment management, tuition pricing strategies and risk management. Given the critical economic development role of higher education, sound management skills and governance oversight will be particularly critical to ensure that universities are drivers in helping the nation emerge from recession and are themselves well-positioned to survive and thrive. In this article, the author presents some principles and actions that are consistent with good financial management and stewardship of higher education institutions during a severe recession. These principles would also help prepare colleges and universities to be more nimble organizations in the future.",

        "description":"The need to dramatically increase the number of young people who gain the credentials and skills necessary to succeed in 21st century America has never been clearer. One of the most promising ideas for achieving this goal is to establish \"multiple pathways\" for learners that lead to a variety of high-quality postsecondary options. As New England examines recent trends and indicators in postsecondary education, it is an appropriate time to take stock of the prospects for the multiple pathways approach and consider the issues that arise as policymakers, educational institutions and communities look at ways to broaden educational opportunities for learners. The underlying premise of the multiple pathways idea is that by offering a wider variety of high-quality learning options--in settings that include colleges, community organizations and workplaces--there will be an increase in the number of students, especially those from low-income families, who are prepared for careers, citizenship and continued learning. In this article, the authors offer a typology of pathway options. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "author":["Washington, Valora"],
        "description":"There is a definitive gender gap in institutions of higher education, with female students making up significant majorities of undergraduate enrollments nationally--more than 60% at many colleges and universities. In addition, U.S. Department of Education statistics show that male students (no matter their race or socioeconomic group) are less likely than female students to fulfill the requirements to earn their bachelor's degrees. Among those who do, fewer men complete their degrees in four or five years. With fewer men enrolling in and completing college, campuses are out of balance. This leads inevitably to a lack of men in college and university education departments, which impacts the availability of men as role models in elementary and secondary schools. The number of male school teachers is at a 40-year low for reasons ranging from fear of abuse allegations to low pay. In this article, the author, president of the CAYL Institute, explains how her Cambridge, Massachusetts-based outfit aims to close the gender gap in teaching. Recruiting and retaining more men in the field of early care and education is vital to the future success of children. When boys and girls lack the first-hand experience and knowledge of men who are caring and nurturing, the message they receive is that it is not an important trait for men. It is an unfortunate truth that men commit the majority of violence in the country, often toward each other. Until people demonstrate that men can teach, be productive and help children succeed, everyone will lose.",

        "author":["Cronin, Joseph M."],
        "description":"Once upon a time, the relationship of Boston universities to the city's school system was simply to accept worthy candidates into the freshman class and produce a few dozen new teachers each year to fill staff vacancies. For many decades, universities stayed away from Boston schools. Boston trained its elementary teachers at its own normal school, which became Boston State College and eventually was taken over by the University of Massachusetts Boston. In prior centuries, Harvard College produced the largest number of high school &quot;masters&quot; but beginning in the 1930s, Boston College, Tufts and others sent graduates to teach in Boston. What lured area universities into Boston was the new commitment to cities in the 1960s, first by the Ford Foundation and then by Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty and Congressional approval of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, precursor to No Child Left Behind. Universities were asked to help revise the curriculum, design new models, advise on racial integration and improve specialized services to city children. In Massachusetts and elsewhere, universities are often seen as vendors of expertise. The hope, especially in New York City, East Palo Alto and other cities, is that universities can become &quot;turnaround agents&quot; and rescue underperforming public schools. This is a genuine challenge, since universities are stocked with very independent faculty members with a mix of teaching, student advising and research responsibilities. Many faculty, until recent years, lacked school experience dealing with the challenges of urban diversity. Some schools of education and management will be able to respond, but universities are usually better at taking on specific tasks rather than total school reinventions. Universities contributed thousands of hours to trying to help Boston schools improve. With what effect? The author contends that university partnerships must include a clear statement of objectives, mutual respect among university and city partners, a major commitment to stay many years, and a willingness to evaluate and revise ineffective strategies.",

        "description":"In continuing its mission of connecting students to college success, the College Board is developing a multi-indicator system that provides educators with a comprehensive view of their students' college readiness. The information used to measure progress toward college readiness comes from the College Board's nationally administered assessments such as the SAT and Advanced Placement (AP) exams. These indicators are validated by research that links them to college performance and success. This system currently reflects four indicators of college readiness: (1) academic knowledge and skills; (2) success in college-level courses; (3) advanced academic skills; and (4) college and career planning skills. The College Board has prepared more than 40 tables and charts exploring New England trends in academic preparation, success in AP courses, SAT performance and college and career planning, which may be viewed at www.nebhe.org/collegeboardtrends. In this article, the authors present some highlights from the College Board data. All in all, the data suggest that New England high schools and students have made great strides towards college readiness in the past five years. A larger number of New England students are striving to attain the academic knowledge and skills needed to be successful in college as evidenced through increased participation in rigorous coursework. More New England high school students are participating in the SAT and choosing to send their scores to institutions suggesting increased interest in attending college. The increased participation within the AP Program and the subsequent increased success rates (as evidenced by achieving grade 3 or higher on at least one AP examination) among students suggest that more New England students are getting a head start on college-level work.",

        "description":"The academic literature is clear: students with a college degree earn more and lead healthier, more productive lives than their non-degree counterparts. Moreover, the early weeks on campus profoundly affect the likelihood of students persisting through to graduation. With its significant enrollment of first-generation and underrepresented students, Southern Vermont College (SVC) took a new road to meet the challenge of first-semester (and first-year) retention. Many variables impact student retention: (1) academic offerings; (2) residential programming; and (3) the overall culture of the institution. New students need to feel part of the institution and connect to one another, to faculty and to the campus community. To establish connectivity on campus, SVC focused on two strategies: (1) connecting with students &quot;before&quot; they arrive on campus; and (2) intentionally linking pre-orientation initiatives with both orientation and events planned for students during the semester. Rather than one-time events arranged by Academic Affairs or Student Life, SVC aimed to create a quilt of events during a 12-week period. SVC's retention work, the authors believed, had to be &quot;of a piece,&quot; by linking typically disparate activities through shared themes, teamwork and coordination among departments. In this article, the authors describe their new approaches for first-semester retention and report on the results. (Contains 1 table.)",

        "description":"Lyndon State College is a small, four-year public college in the rural Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. In an effort to improve its first-year retention rate, two years ago the authors began to analyze which students return to Lyndon for their second year of college. They found that more than 60% of the students were first-generation college students and more than 30% were both first-generation and low-income (FGLI) based on Pell eligibility. With further analysis, they found the first- to second-year retention rate for FGLI students was 54%, compared with 60% for the rest of the population. With a $100,000 year-long Project Compass planning grant from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation, the authors established a task force to collect data and identify strategies for improving the success of FGLI students. Funded by the foundation and managed by the New England Resource Center for Higher Education, Project Compass aims to help a select group of public New England colleges and universities improve the success rate of their most underserved students. Project Compass is guided by the premise that by developing systemic initiatives to increase the retention rates of the most underserved students, colleges can increase the chance of success for all students.

No doubt a strong developmental education curriculum and effective teaching are critical to success. But states also need a policy infrastructure that systematically identifies students who need developmental education and ensures that they enroll. States also need a data and performance measurement system to monitor progress. To move in that direction, \"Achieving the Dream\" states, in collaboration with Jobs for the Future, have identified a policy framework specifying high-leverage state policies that can promote student success in community colleges. Assessment and placement policies have emerged as high-yield activities to improve services to academically underprepared students. While each participating state has taken a unique approach to the placement policy options in the framework, they are increasingly moving toward standardizing assessment instruments and placement cut scores as a strategy to increase student success. Additional research is needed to better understand the impact of common placement standards on student success, but the \"Achieving the Dream\" experience suggests that such standards enhance states' ability to send clear signals to entering students about what is required for success while enhancing the states' capacity to track outcomes and make adjustments that can increase student success.",

New insights about when and where learning takes place reveal the connection between a child's summer experiences and his or her success in school and beyond. In so doing, the research underscores the tremendous untapped potential of the summer months to improve academic achievement and to level the playing field for all children. Children from families with financial resources receive the additional learning provided by camp, travel, lessons, and other activities during the summer months. Far too many New England children lack the resources to access these opportunities, however, and as a result suffer from what is referred to as &quot;summer learning loss.&quot; If individuals wish future generations to be economically and civically engaged, they need to take different approaches to how they educate, and they need to do so now. Establishing a more flexible idea of learning that includes a focus on summer is logical and crucial. With the strength of New England's higher education community behind the plan, summers of educational enrichment are entirely possible. (Contains 1 figure.)",

These changes can and will be good for society, on balance, if individuals are able to look down the road and around corners and plan ahead accordingly. Those individuals in higher education have an enormous role to play during this transition. Much turns on whether they are able to seize the right opportunities and to mitigate the greatest harms associated with the ways that Digital Natives are interacting with information, institutions, and one another. In this article, the authors explain how institutions can take advantage of the opportunities this new era provides by making scholarship freely accessible online in formats today's students understand, teaching students the skills to sort through the torrents of digital information to which they have access and supporting future innovations.",

Participatory media literacy is necessarily a hands-on enterprise, requiring active use of digital media by students; for this reason the Social Media Virtual Classroom syllabus will involve student use of multiple online media in their exploration of the syllabus texts, and a video blog will provide instruction and real world examples. Although a willingness to learn new media through point-and-click exploration might come naturally to today's student cohort, there is nothing innate about knowing how to apply those acquired skills to the processes of civil society, scientific or scholarly innovation, or economic production. A successfully implemented Social Media Virtual Classroom can bridge that disconnect and prepare students to participate in society as engaged and empowered citizens.",

Operating from campuses in Lynn, Beverly and Danvers, NSCC serves more than 10,000 students each year. One of their strategic directions is to build technology media environments that create a &quot;technological village&quot;--a phrase used by NSCC President Dr. Wayne M. Burton--and to increase communication at all levels of the college. In 2001, NSCC implemented a robust integrated campus portal integrating e-mail, learning management system, course resource areas and administrative services. This Unified Digital Campus (UDC) built upon SunGard Higher Education Banner ERP and the Luminis Platform, provides portal capabilities, collaboration and communication tools, and a common interface. The UDC has resulted in an integrated environment that facilitates seamless interaction for learning, teaching and administration.

Since then, MIT has published materials from approximately 400-500 courses annually. Response has far exceeded expectations. As of April 2008, more than 22 million individuals from around the world have come to the OCW site.

Reducing education funding does not help solve economic woes, however. According to the most recent economic impact report of the New England Association of Schools &amp; Colleges (NEASC), cuts in expenditures for K-12 education have a reverse effect: they slow the growth of education as an economic engine and harm the higher education community as students progress through the pipeline. NEASC's economic impact assessment, the only known study to explore the economic impact of New England K-12 schools and higher education institutions in combination, finds that investment in New England schools and higher education institutions reaps tremendous &quot;short-term&quot; returns to the regional market. Yet these short-term benefits are ordinarily overlooked by the public and even by elected officials. People gain when they invest in their educational institutions; they all lose when they do not invest enough. As New England's economy becomes ever more reliant on the knowledge capital of a college-educated workforce, the need to have robust educational institutions through the K-through-postsecondary pipeline is more imperative than ever before.",

        "description":"A defining feature of U.S. higher education is its commitment to access and opportunity. The growing number of policies and programs targeting college access demonstrates that this commitment remains steadfast. In order to make college affordable for the economically disadvantaged, an increasing number of selective, well-endowed colleges and universities, including Amherst, Brown, Harvard and Wellesley, have developed policies of free or reduced tuition. Other colleges and universities, including Clark University, Curry College and University of Massachusetts Boston, have created pipelines into their institutions through partnerships with high schools or districts, early college and/or dual enrollment, and special bridge programs. College access programs that prepare students to aspire to and apply to college are important but not sufficient. Attention to improving college access, especially for underrepresented populations, is an important priority. But while preparing students to apply and enroll in college is a worthy goal, the author contends that the focus needs to extend beyond college admission to ensure that students succeed academically and persist to graduation. In an era of scarce resources, this will require a new level of collaboration and cooperation between schools, colleges, nonprofits and corporate partners to ensure that students are able to earn a degree and not just accumulate debt.",

Preparing people for success has always been a moving target of sorts. What skills do people need to become civically engaged and economically self-sufficient? In recent years it has become increasingly evident that while basic skills are essential, the &quot;3 R's&quot; are not enough once learners enter secondary school. So-called &quot;21st century&quot; skills--innovation, creativity, the ability to work as part of a team, and to work through complex problems and find solutions--are becoming increasingly important in the new economy and interconnected world. Measurement and assessment issues follow quickly from any discussion of integrating these &quot;new&quot; skills. It is important to recognize that knowledge is obtained in various ways--through different methods in different places--and begin to measure competency similarly. High-quality varied assessment can only succeed where there is a shared understanding of what is required of learners and educators. In this article, the author explains how multiple forms of assessment may bridge the treacherous gap between high school and college.",

QUT not only has devoted much discussion to how a university might stimulate the creative economy (or, as they call it, &quot;creative industry&quot;), but has also put many of the ideas into practice. Kelvin Grove Urban Village is one result. This award-winning redesign in Brisbane is not just bricks and mortar, nor is it simply programs. It is both. Small businesses in the creative industry have been established and linked to university programs. QUT moved its health programs and biotechnology research initiatives to Kelvin Grove. Faltering elder housing has been redesigned. The university's engagement with the city of Brisbane and the state of Queensland has been central to the success of these efforts. Many such initiatives are now emerging across Australia. In New England, engagement partnerships like those at Australia's QUT are becoming more common as universities look to address the global economy. As New England institutions of higher education become involved in engagement--and as they struggle with how to engage without losing academic focus--what might be learned from the far-flung Australian universities?

Eighty-nine of the 260-plus institutions of higher learning in New England (34 percent) have signed the &quot;American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment&quot; to guide their institutions and their programs toward climate neutrality. Public institutions have been significant leaders, with more than half of New England's public colleges and universities (57 percent) participating. Interest in sustainable development comes from many sources, but first and foremost, from the interest of students, faculty, administration and the wider community in moderating or reversing climate change. While interest in sustainable development is strong, justifying expenditures for sustainable development in a difficult economic environment can be challenging.

In no place is that demonstrated more clearly than in New England, with its long commitment to environmental stewardship. A design process that engages the campus and the broader community gives students the opportunity to participate in community dialogue and a collaborative planning and design process. Increasingly, college campuses are seeking ways to ensure that the campus itself and the buildings in which students live and learn reinforce the institution's commitment to sustainable design, operation and education. The authors contend that by taking a strategic approach to student engagement in an institution's sustainable design and operation decisions and practices, campuses can turn their socially responsible policies into competitive advantage. When making college choices today, prospective students weigh an institution's commitment to social, economic and environmental leadership. A campus that presents students with an environmental classroom in the largest sense of the word offers them an academic community in which they can fully learn, live and engage the changing world that awaits them.",

        "author":["Dahlgren, Robert L."],
        "description":"The polarized political mood engendered by the most sharply partisan Presidential election campaigns in recent memory has had an especially deleterious effect on the image of public education. This increased scrutiny has largely fallen on the shoulders of rank and file teachers who now face the most precarious moment in terms of job security since the height of the McCarthyite movement of the 1950s. While this trend has scarcely been reported in the national mainstream media, a close monitoring of local newspapers from across the country uncovers numerous disturbing incidents. For example, Madrid (2004) has detailed how a drama teacher in Paradise Valley, Arizona, was fired after a parent complaint about a skit her students wrote and performed about the Holocaust. In April 2006, Sidney McGee, an art teacher from Frisco, Texas, was fired after parent complaints about the \"nude art\" that her fifth grade class viewed while on a field trip to the Dallas Museum of Art (Pilkington, 2006). More recently, Al Gore's Oscar-winning documentary on global warming, \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" has been the subject of furious debates in school board meetings (Libin, 2007). These stories and others like them lead to a startling conclusion: it is remarkably easy to lose one's job merely for attempting to teach one's subject in a public school in the United States today. In this article, the author examines this dark, telling picture of the teaching profession in the 21st century through the explosive reaction to the use of Michael Moore's provocative documentary film \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" in American classrooms. The author argues that the concerted campaign against the use of the film by teachers reveals the activities of a complex network of parents, advocacy groups, and right-wing media pundits that has been organized specifically to challenge the curricular choices made by classroom practitioners. This network has, in a few cases, lobbied successfully with school administrations for disciplinary action against individual teachers. In the end, the case of \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" in the classroom indicates the ways in which this new network has destabilized the ordinary channels of communication in schools, exerted pressure on school administrations, and created a chilling effect on the teaching practice.

        "author":["Au, Wayne"],
        "description":"High-stakes, standardized tests have become ubiquitous in public education in the United States. Teachers across the country are feeling the intensified pressures from high-stakes testing policies and are responding to these pressures by teaching to the tests in varying ways (Renter et al., 2006). Given the hegemony of high-stakes testing in schools today, this article seeks to explore the question: &quot;W(h)ither the social studies in high-stakes testing?&quot; Drawing on the available body of empirical research, the author argues that social studies teachers are feeling the pressures of high-stakes testing, and that these pressures are causing social studies teachers to alter their classroom practices and curriculum. Further, the author posits that the social studies represent a special case in relation to other subjects because the changes to pedagogy and content are variable, and the amount or significance of these changes depends on specific factors such as test design or whether or not individual sanctions are tied to student performance on the tests. Finally, the author argues that, because of the consistent variability connected to social studies teaching in relation to high-stakes tests, social studies education, in many instances, is positioned to provide an education that challenges the hegemonic norms of high-stakes testing generally as part of a broader need to teach for social justice in today's schools.",

Such state of affairs demands that the social studies intensify its own dialogue about its story and responsibilities. With this in mind, the authors tell the specific stories of a social studies teacher in a small Alabama town and another of a university professor at a large university in Alabama. These stories provide a counter narrative to current socio-political mileu, as well as offer some possible approaches to resisting the technocratic discourse. However, they are also cautionary tales of the risks, complications, and consequences of engaging in such acts of resistance. In other words, the stories speak of an experience with historical heresy, or what Pierre Bourdieu calls heterodoxy--the act of putting forth a history that challenges the status quo, complete with its requisite problematic (Webb, Schirato, &amp; Danaher, 2002). The first story is a brief recounting of the conflict faced by a university professor when teaching about resistance.",

        "author":["Tupper, Jennifer"],
        "description":"There is a propensity, when considering the meaning(s) of citizenship, to think in terms of universality and equality rather than difference and inequity. In a North American context, citizenship often operates as a taken for granted status with the requisite rights and responsibilities associated with membership in a nation. In education, how citizenship is embedded in curricular discourses and how it is taken up by both teachers and students is influenced by a discourse of universality. Most often, citizenship is linked to democracy and informed by an overwhelming acceptance that democracy does indeed exist. Social studies, perhaps more than any other subject, is complicit in advancing this commonsense understanding of citizenship and democracy, and it is one that requires disruption to its very core. But where do people situate this disruption given the proclivity for standardization, accountability, and content coverage that is pervasive in social studies education? And where might people situate this disruption given the preoccupation of many educators with technique rather than interrogation? In this article, the author attempts to do two things. First in questioning what is democratic about the current state of &quot;democracy&quot; in Canada and the United States, the author attempts to dispel the veracity of citizenship as universal (essentialist notions of universal citizenship) that seems to permeate social studies curriculum documents, glossing over or rendering non-existent, historical and contemporary realities of individuals who have not experienced citizenship in equitable and just ways. This is what the author refers to as the &quot;meta-narrative of universal citizenship&quot; contingent upon the &quot;truth&quot; rather than the falsity of democracy, the &quot;truth&quot; rather than the falsity of equality. Second, the author argues that if everyone hopes to move toward a more genuinely democratic reality in North America, it is important to consider the role that teacher education can play, the principles and practices that guide teacher education programs and how teachers might work with their students to interrogate their very understandings of citizenship and democracy, the cornerstones of what many believe education to be serving. &quot;Universal&quot; citizenship must always be used as a category of analysis not only in social studies classrooms, but in teacher education contexts as well.",

Prior to NCLB, discussions over social studies and history standards dominated the political and cultural landscapes. The eventual conclusion from the federal government was that the social studies devalued American history. However, the sharp distinctions between those who advocate citizenship education as patriotism indoctrination and others who see the possibilities a critical approach to teaching history and social studies has for genuine democratic education still exist. This article documents how one elementary preservice teacher (Amy) learned to teach history from a patriotic indoctrination approach and how powerful and appealing this approach was, considering Amy's limited knowledge of American history. Also, this article demonstrates how this approach essentially denied Amy any opportunity to learn about the richness of social studies content and the possibilities it provides for genuine democratic discourse. The outcome is a narrative portrait of one preservice teacher and a cautious analysis of what the outcomes might mean for teacher education researchers concerned with the future of social studies and its commitment to citizenship education. The findings also suggest that there is a need for a deeper understanding of what really goes on in undergraduate social studies methods courses.",

        "description":"Media literacy education is relevant to the social studies for a number of reasons. Media provide compelling fiction and nonfiction narratives about people, places and events. Indeed, many young people's knowledge of world events and cultures comes from media representations. Media also helps shape attitudes and opinions about history, government and politics. As citizens, students rely on media for information about elections, public policy and political processes. Consequently, media literacy education in the social studies can promote student understanding and appreciation of the role media play in shaping and disseminating particular views of the world. This article focuses on social studies teachers' familiarity with media literacy education in the classroom, their understandings of its role and place in the curriculum, and the implications of these views for curriculum development and training. The study presumes that the usefulness of media literacy education resources, as well as their adoption, depend in large measure on whether these materials speak to the overarching goals teachers bring to media literacy education and their understanding of its place in their classrooms. This article reports on the results of a survey of a small group of social studies teachers seeking to integrate media literacy education into their classrooms. This exploratory research aims to help educators, administrators, consultants and theorists begin to understand the particular curriculum development and teacher training needs of social studies teachers engaged in media literacy education. The article concludes by discussing several factors that may place an additional drag on the ability to develop training and curricular resources, and by briefly reviewing some positive developments in the provision of primary and secondary teaching resources.

The article is comprised of excerpts from a seminar paper she wrote in December of 2001, at the conclusion of her first semester of teaching, interspersed with commentary written from her present perspective. In the sections from the present, the author is essentially \"writing back\" to the self of the past, engaging in a conversation that incorporates some of the understanding gained in the intervening years.

The author also discusses the experience of   new teachers who are mentored by older colleagues and teacher educators who have, on some level, opted out of engaging the tensions between the mandate to prepare future educators to deliver standards-based school curricula, and the fundamental commitment to democratizing education.",

        "description":"The authors examine the limitations of critical pedagogy, as commonly conceptualized in U.S. multicultural and social foundations fields. What the authors have concluded is that there is a definite need to re-invent critical pedagogy for its implementation in the more privileged spaces of U.S. teacher education programs. In order for critical pedagogy to bring about wide-scale transformation of social inequalities in the U.S., it must be re-envisioned, at least in part, around inquiries into the identity formations of those in oppressor groups. It must also be more willing to embrace the empowerment found in the development of positive identities for those in oppressor groups. In general, these positive identities should be \"ideologically consistent\" in their commitment to social justice for all oppressed groups. The article outlines a refinement of critical pedagogy that deals more explicitly with students from oppressor groups and, to a lesser extent, those in oppressed groups who have internalized the discourse of the oppressor.",

        "author":["Chant, Richard H."],
        "description":"As a social studies program coordinator at a regional-sized institution, the author typically has between 20-25 preservice candidates enrolled in his annual undergraduate methods course. However, he usually has only one to two in-service candidates each year who require an advance methods course focused on such items as the historical influences, contemporary trends, and research within the social studies field. Recently, the single student in this course was Jonathan Frye, a graduate student and seven-year veteran social studies teacher in central North Carolina. Prior to beginning the semester, Jonathan and the author met to discuss the possibilities regarding the curriculum and structure of the course. Neither one of them was pleased with the notion of meeting in the traditional three-hour per week format established for the course, prompting them to deliberate about alternative models. Since Jonathan had already completed a methods course as part of his undergraduate studies, the author's task would be to bridge Jonathan's prior experiences with his new learning by what Alder (1994) stated as &quot;enabling teachers to bring appropriate knowledge and experiences to bear on their classroom practice&quot;. Given the charge of developing Jonathan's course, the author wanted Jonathan and him to design a process that allowed him to experience how reflecting (grounded in his personal and professional experiences) on his practice (through a critical analysis of the literature) might lessen the negative impact of the teacher-as-conduit model. By this point in their conversations they had identified a number of key provisions that were emerging for this course: reflection, self-direction, personal and professional knowledge, growth, and empowerment. When considering ways to include these provisions, the author suggested they examine how Jonathan could use personal theorizing and action research within his social studies classroom.",

        "author":["Fowler, R. Clarke"],
        "description":"Schools throughout New England face a common problem: a shortage of teachers who are fully qualified to teach science, mathematics, special education, bilingual education, foreign languages and English. Shortages are expected to spread soon to other teaching fields due to a second common problem: New England has the oldest teaching force of any region in the country. To address current and future teacher shortages, many New England states have established alternative, and typically faster, routes into the profession. Maine has developed Regional Teacher Development Centers that provide, among other services, support and guidance to individuals seeking to become licensed via nontraditional means. Massachusetts implemented its &quot;Bonus Teacher&quot; program, which provided $20,000 bonuses to high-achieving individuals who taught after an intensive six-week summer training program. In fall 2009, Rhode Island will launch a similar fast-track initiative, the Rhode Island Teaching Fellows (RITF). Managed by the New Teacher Project, the same organization that managed the Massachusetts Bonus Teacher initiative, the RITF will also put individuals in charge of classrooms following a six-week summer program. There are two problems, however, with relying on fast-track programs to respond to teacher shortages. First, because teachers leave their profession faster than most other professionals, especially early in their careers, teacher shortages are caused more by high rates of attrition than by low rates of supply. The other problem with fast-track teacher preparation programs is that they aggravate the already excessively high rates of teacher attrition. In this article, the author discusses what policymakers should do to address the regional teacher shortage.",

        "description":"Beating the competition with restaurant-style dining, wood-fired pizza ovens, espresso machines and organic vegetables is one of many ways for colleges to attract and hold the best and brightest. It also seems that fond food memories fuel alumni associations, which increase attendance at reunions and boost giving. But is it just an arms race with escalating levels of gourmet ingredients? Or can a dining program make a legitimate contribution to the educational environment? At Bowdoin College, it can, and does. Not just an amenity, the cafeterias serve as an important gathering place where people from different disciplines can exchange ideas in an informal, relaxed environment. At dinner time and during the late-night meal called SuperSnack, Thorne Hall, which is the largest dining hall at Bowdoin, takes on the feeling of a noisy block party. Music plays, and young people chat and move among tables. Because students spend most of their day in intense classes or in front of their laptop computers, they look forward to the opportunity to mix and mingle. Many students say that after graduation they will miss the feeling that every night, they can just walk into a place and know there will be friends to sit with--a sense of community they fear will be largely absent in post-academic life. The dining operation is often used by faculty to illustrate the &quot;real&quot; world for the students. The organic chemistry class may make bread in the bakeshop. Plant physiology students might be on their knees in the dirt in the organic garden. Sociology students will sit down with cooks and dishwashers to measure their happiness quotient. Art students paint a cubist homage in the cafe. Making these connections allows students to broaden their knowledge and pull their heads out of their books, and brings dining employees even closer to students. The author contends that if the goal of a liberal arts education is to prepare students to make thoughtful life choices from a broad base of information, then it seems appropriate to have a dining program with aspirations to expose students to a life of healthy eating habits, a variety of foods from all different cultures, the integrity of a local community and the importance of sharing quality time with friends.",

        "description":"Two educations are available to those who are fortunate enough to continue their athletic careers at the nation's colleges and universities. The first kind, the most obvious and most important, is the education garnered when students are challenged to excel, experiment and stretch intellectually. Many faculty colleagues see this principal education as exclusively important. But for college athletes, it's one component of a full education. The other education is that which is also common in college sports. The references: excel, experiment and stretch are all reciprocally significant in the athletics setting. College athletes do not swap their minds for tennis shoes when they enter the gymnasium. The intellectual vibrancy sought after in the classroom is alive and well in the last place faculty would think to look. The fields and courts are humming with good minds processing complex patterns, reacting to variations, listening for cues, unpacking and reassembling the next moves (of the ball, the teammates, the opponents) before they happen. The better the mind, the better the athlete. Faculty colleagues are envious. They covet the passion plainly exhibited in the eyes of an athlete attentively taking in every word during a 30-second timeout. They begrudge the voluntary extra workouts. They envy the edge-of-the-chair eagerness athletes demonstrate in team meetings. They're also jealous of the intensity of the relationships created and sustained, some for decades beyond the athlete's college career. Coaches choose to work with students who question everything, analyze both strategy and training and bring considerable intellectual \"joie de vivre\" to the field and court. Athletes are perceptive and focused. And they possess the capacity to work hard even when other factors might distract them. Faculty colleagues see this intensity and work ethic in athletes and rightly wish this were expressed in all students in their classrooms. It's up to the athletics community to create the bridges between two educations, to move faculty friends from dismissive to collaborative. After all, to coach is to teach. Successful coaches must master the ability to engage each student regardless of preparation, learning style and capacity. Faculty colleagues and coaches are doing the same work in their discrete disciplines. In this article, the author discusses some adjustments that coaches and athletics administrators (and student-athletes) have to be willing to make to encourage professors to value what happens inside this athletics education.",

        "description":"In 2001, the author wrote legislation that required all public schools in Maine to teach Maine Indian history. On June 14 of that year, Gov. Angus King signed &quot;An Act to Require Maine Native American History and Culture in Maine's Schools&quot; into law--the first of its kind in the U.S. What makes the law unique is its requirement that specific topics be studied, such as: (1) tribal governments and political systems and their relationship with local, state, national and international governments; (2) Maine Native American cultural systems and the experience of Maine tribal people throughout history; (3) Maine Native American territories; and (4) Maine Native American economic systems. The most important piece of this legislation was the creation of a Native American History Commission to help schools gather a wide range of materials and resources to implement the law. This led to creation of the Wabanaki Educational Curriculum, which tells the story of the Wabanaki people of Maine from the Wabanaki perspective. In this article, the author discusses how the law is leading people out of the &quot;dark ages&quot; of education. &quot;Dark ages&quot; because education has been a two-edged sword for Native people. On one hand, it has opened opportunities. On the other, it harmed them physically, psychologically and spiritually. It inflicted spiritual wounds upon Native people lasting for generations.",

        "description":"In 2005, leaders gathered by the National Association of Manufacturers declared yet another &quot;STEM&quot; emergency. In the face of global competition, they argued, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded annually to U.S. students in science, math and engineering must double by 2015. In fact, the need for STEM talent is even more critical today as the nation claws its way back from a deep recession. Furthermore, reports such as &quot;Rising Above the Gathering Storm,&quot; indicate that the U.S. is in danger of losing its historic preeminence in creating and manufacturing advanced products due specifically to problems with &quot;engineering&quot; education--a critical subset within the STEM world. The problems facing engineering education, the report suggests, go beyond a need to simply educate more students or raise performance on exams. Instead, when it comes to engineering, what is even more critical than quantity is &quot;quality.&quot; Too often, U.S. engineering is not cost-effective because the majority of today's engineering graduates do not have the broad background necessary to understand, take charge of and drive large-scale projects to completion in an economic fashion. Within the region, progress is being made through initiatives of the Gordon Foundation, with an established engineering leadership program in place at Tufts University, enhancements to the engineering program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and new engineering leadership programs at both MIT and Northeastern University. In this article, the authors discuss the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program at Northeastern, which aims to ensure that engineering leaders develop the &quot;mindset&quot; required to assume full responsibility for their success and the success of their organizations.",

        "author":["Reich, Brian"],
        "description":"As media digitizes, fragments and moves closer to the audience, the information and experiences become more a reflection of the community than a product delivered to the audience. The very nature of how people get and share information and experience things has changed, so naturally the individuals and organizations who create, consume and share that media need to change as well. Before any content is created, it's important to understand how the audience uses technology to get and share information. How people create, consume and share information is what defines the media experience for the individual. With the monopoly on content broken, there is simply more information available for audiences to consume than hours in which to consume it, so there will be more than enough options from which to choose. New England Journal of Higher Education's (NEJHE) role should be less about covering what is available to all and instead focus on helping prioritize stories and issues that only a handful of people realize are important, but whose impact is greatest or will be felt by most. Audiences want the privilege of deciding for themselves what information is relevant, how they feel or what they care most about. At the same time, because people can quickly become overwhelmed by the number of choices that are available to them, even the most committed individuals need help interpreting the volumes of information they are exposed to. Many in the media believe that distilling information down will allow them to please a larger audience. But in practice, the media too often go to the extreme: Either they focus too narrowly and the content fails to interest the audience at all or they over-generalize and are unable to demonstrate a unique value to their audience. NEJHE should be careful not to make that same mistake. The challenge is to meet the audience's interests. For policy journals like NEJHE, that means exploring issues that other media won't consider or in ways that other media can't devote sufficient time and space to. Embrace the opportunity to tell a unique or important story, resist the urge to please everyone and make sure every piece of content created is must-read. In this article, the author discusses some key considerations that will help create that must-read content on a regular basis.",

        "description":"What happens to print publishing in the age of blogging? College students, faculty and staff swim for hours each day in the Internet, especially via search engines, the blogosphere and social-networking groups--perhaps more than do any other parts of society. Indeed, college campuses live on the Internet, however good or bad this may be for developing interpersonal skills and developed thought. These inventions may be causing massive attention-deficit disorder, but the genie is out of the bottle, and people must deal with it. Certainly, the New England Board of Higher Education must embrace this world. After all, readers in academia are probably the most &quot;Interneted/World Wide Webbed&quot; group of all. So print-on-paper's role will continue to decline. The speed, infinite space, immediate interactivity and cheapness of Internet publishing are huge competitive advantages against print-on-paper publishing. But there are drawbacks to the Internet for academic life. Much of the stuff is put on the web unedited and rife with extreme agendas and thoughtlessness. On the other hand, the very openness and fluidity of the Internet provide for quick correction of factual errors and the presentation of much-needed countervailing arguments in response to absurd positions. The virtually infinite expanse of space on the web also should be seen as a boon, in some ways, to scholars. Besides at-your-fingertips accessibility to global sources of information and analysis, it lets people consult experts directly to quickly try out ideas and then revise them. Using an old-fashioned library with books and periodicals on paper can be a more disciplined and orderly way to research than using the Internet. And reading and putting things on paper tends to encourage more intellectual rigor than using the attention-deficit-disordered computer world. Further, there's the likelihood that people reading information on paper retain it better than they do reading it on a screen. And it has repeatedly been shown that something printed on paper has more authority than that on a screen. Enthusiastic use of the Internet can only expand a journal's influence, but print won't go away. The two media play related but different roles, and &quot;The New England Journal of Higher Education&quot; (&quot;NEJHE&quot;) must use both of them. In any case, while maintaining a printed presence, &quot;NEJHE&quot; should create a family of blogs, written by staffers, members of the editorial advisory board and others, to report on and comment on higher education developments in the region.",

        "description":"For more than a decade, proponents of online communication have held out a vision of how a hard-copy publication can complement itself by creating a website and making proper use of it. &quot;The New England Journal of Higher Education&quot; (&quot;NEJHE&quot;) might be well-equipped to be among the first to actually fulfill this vision. The proponents have based this vision on their analysis of the differences between a hard-copy publication and its web presence. Their analysis has gone as follows: A hard-copy publication and its web presence are fit to perform significantly different tasks. The first is fit for hub-to-spoke communication, with room to print only a bit of spoke-to-hub feedback, such as a few letters to the editor. And a hub-to-spoke model seems to be relatively hierarchical. A website, however can offer an infinite amount of space for relatively little cost. So it can publish both a lot of material that runs from hub-to-spoke and a lot of material that runs from spoke-to-hub. This model can be less hierarchical than print and more collegial. The author notes that a typical reader of a hard-copy publication belongs to a mere audience. A typical reader of a website can belong to a community. The website reader can be not only a consumer of information and analysis and opinion, but a producer of it as well. Given this analysis, the vision is that the website can add a valuable complement to the hard-copy publication. It can be a marketplace of ideas, a forum that puts evidence and arguments to the test of different perspectives.",

        "description":"When President Barack Obama took office, he pledged to revitalize an economy in the midst of the deepest recession in a generation. Working with Congress, he acted quickly to enact an $878 billion package to stimulate the economy in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). More than $100 billion of that will be for education, spanning from early childhood programs to college aid. The ARRA's primary goal is to help the economy emerge from the current recession. But the president is pursuing other policies, both in the short and long term, to ensure economic growth. At the heart of these policies is the goal of making college affordable and accessible to millions of students who otherwise might not be able to go. In this article, the author outlines President Obama's goal to make the America No. 1 in the world in the percentage of adults with college degrees. Increased demand, unprecedented funding and heightened expectations have placed the nation's system of higher education at the forefront of change for a better America. This is a historic opportunity to answer the president's call to action.",

        "description":"Surmounting a national--indeed global--recession in the wake of war is not new to America or its leaders. Born out of one of the nation's darkest moments of the 20th century were bold initiatives to empower those who served their country as well as all who sought to enter the American middle class. The GI Bill of Rights was one such measure, as was the remarkable expansion of publicly financed postsecondary education systems throughout the U.S. The unfolding story of the current recession will again include the need to increase the educational attainment of the nation's citizens as a core theme. The dismantling and restructuring of the domestic automakers is symbolic; the time for America to compete strictly on brawn has faded. America must instead compete on talent nurtured as part of a systematic and public policy-driven mandate to &quot;grow&quot; human capital. As was true after World War II, it is institutions of the knowledge economy--the colleges and universities--that will power a rejuvenated America. In this article, the author calls for bold actions to make the U.S. first in college attainment, including expanding Pell Grants and education tax credits, streamlining the federal student aid process and facilitating college access for undocumented students.",

        "description":"In its first hundred days, the Obama administration demonstrated a strong commitment to expanding access to higher education. The economic stimulus package, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), increased funding for the Pell Grant program and over the next two years, the maximum award will grow to $5,550 in 2010-2011--the largest two-year dollar increase in the program's 35-year history. In addition, the president's FY 2010 budget plan calls for making the Pell Grant an entitlement, revitalizing and expanding the Perkins Loan program, simplifying the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and creating a new $2.5 billion program to improve &quot;graduation and success&quot; in higher education. But the administration's most far-reaching higher education proposal came in the president's Feb. 24 speech to Congress in which he committed the U.S. to be first in the world in the percentage of adults with postsecondary education by the year 2020. This is an extraordinarily ambitious goal. Achieving the president's goal would be extraordinarily beneficial to the nation's long-term economic growth and social progress. But there is no way people will do it without a broad-based national effort. The author contends that at a minimum, reaching the goal will require five things: (1) A need for better-prepared high school graduates; (2) Students and families need better information about postsecondary education opportunities; (3) Adequate financial aid for low- and middle-income families is absolutely critical; (4) State governments need to meet their responsibilities; and (5) Sharply increasing the number of college graduates will require a renewed commitment to student graduation and success by colleges and universities. The president's goal will require a long-term effort by multiple actors, particularly higher education institutions themselves. It remains to be seen if America and its colleges and universities have the energy, wisdom and commitment to achieve it.",

        "author":["Donohue, Nicholas C."],
        "description":"In May, President Obama stated the need for every American to have at least one year of postsecondary education. That sentiment echoes the Nellie Mae Education Foundation's 2008 report, &quot;What It Takes to Succeed in the 21st Century--and How New Englanders Are Faring.&quot; The report cites a growing consensus that reveals the minimum indicator of the skills and knowledge necessary for success as a two-year postsecondary credential of some kind. Working toward this goal becomes even more challenging when one considers the large number of young adults, ages 16 to 24, across the region who are unemployed and not enrolled in school. There are now far too many disconnected young adults across the region and nationally. While more likely to be from underserved populations, disconnected young adults are still a diverse group: (1) teen parents; (2) adolescents in the foster system; (3) youth involved with the juvenile justice system; (4) recent immigrants struggling to learn English; (5) high school students who are one or more years behind their graduating class; and (6) youth who have already dropped out. The longer young adults are disconnected, the less likely they will ever engage with the postsecondary opportunities that could turn their lives around. Today's disconnected young adults are at high risk of spending the rest of their lives as members of the working poor. To reverse this trend, it is important to work harder to engage this population with postsecondary opportunities. In this article, the author describes some of the model programs that are trying to engage New England's disconnected young adults with postsecondary opportunities.",

        "description":"Private student discourses are often ignored or prohibited in the academy; however, these private discourses are very meaningful, and representative of the ways that students order and speak about the world. Specifically, religion is an extremely significant private student discourse; exploring religious discourse might help students not only to understand the ideological and linguistic formations of discourses, including those that undergird and shape religion, but also to refine their own discourses, written and spoken, inside and outside of school. Using \"The Color Purple\" by Alice Walker, a text that problematizes religious discourse, Ira Shor's \"Critical Teaching and Everyday Life\" as a model of illuminating ideological analysis, as well as critical essays about religious discourses, students read, discuss, and write about religion and other private discourses to enhance their writing and critical thinking, and secure a more stable rhetorical position within the academy.",
